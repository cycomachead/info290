4.45,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"another gem from cascade, although i dont really know what i was expecting with peach nut. it certainly doesnt taste anything like peaches, and is in fact rather nutty and sweet, almost like and almond, while the tartness of fresh raspberries add to the tartness of an already very lactic sour beer, and the port wine adds a rich booze kick and thicker texture. to call this complex is a gross understatement, but unlike the sangs, this one doesnt resolve quite as well i dont think. the fruit seems intense, i find myself looking for the peach nut, which i dont even know what that is supposed to taste like, so im assessing it weirdly. i need to learn to relax on analysis and just drink a beer i dont understand. the fruit is great, raspberries are subtle, but bring the best out of the barrel treatment. the alcohol is a little sharp in the finish, but its a nice cut to the fruity sweetness. the grain seems heavier in this one too, fuller bodied and more dense. white port is not something i am real familiar with, but i still taste red grape here, maybe a skinless wine, not sure, but its a neat twist on the palate. as a beer on the whole this is genius, but its not a real good one to dissect, being foreign to the main ingredient. a touch more carbonation would lift it a little, but i like the slow unwrapping of it all. cascade is no doubt one of the best in the world at these inventive wild beers. maybe below my expectations, but those may have been ignorantly founded. beautiful beer, worthy of its high praise and then some.","StonedTrippin","Oct 21, 2014"

4.25,-3.2,,,,,,"An 8 oz. pour at the Cascade Barrel room on 8/19/2014. The second of four beers I had while at the Barrel room (first being Sang Noir). Golden with a tinge of red. Clear. Very similar to Sang Noir, despite the lighter color. More acidic and lighter bodied. Nice play between the fruit sweetness, cherry sourness, and oak acidity. Light body and low carbonation.","LittleDon","Aug 19, 2014"

4.47,1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Shared at the Swamp Head Batch 600 release. Pours a funky reddish brown color with fluffy white head on top that sticks around a bit for a sour brew. Beautiful aroma of apricots and strawberries, some definite vinegar and acidic notes to go with it. Flavor follows the aroma perfectly with juicy raspberries and tart apricots, and some expected sour vinegar flavors to go along. The body is juicy and finishes dry, with medium carbonation. This is easily the best sour I’ve had from Cascade, who has been a mixed bag for me. My two favorite fruits in a sour come together beautifully here.","BMMillsy","Aug 03, 2014"

Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, apricot, fruit, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, apricot, tart, sour, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I honestly did not know what to expect going into this one as I had heard of it, but not really paid it any attention. However, what I found was really quite excellent. The apricot notes in this one were really nice and very refreshing. This made it quite drinkable despite the major tart aspect going on. A really nice surprise that showed up at the tasting that evening that I wouldn’t mind trying again or seeing how it develops with a little time in a proper cellar.","thagr81us","Mar 28, 2013"

The beer drinks with a lot more fruit forward sweetness than expected followed by a tart, dry, yet sweet palate washing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, and semi-sweet.

3.99,-9.1,3,4,4.5,2.5,4,"Appearance is cloudy yellow with almost no head. The nose is somewhat musty with a huge dose of earthiness, with tons of apricot and oak. Taste is very tart up front with a nice amount of sweetness. Oak is a little lighter on the taste than the nose. Cherry, apricot, and oak come through the strongest. Overall, very nice with to a of flavor.","homebrew311","Nov 24, 2012"

4.5,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bought two bottles of this...may need to buy more. Pours a cloudy reddish-pinkish-orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Very nice-looking beer. Scent is wonderful. Good amount of acidic stone fruit and fresh raspberry. Wow, such ripe fruit aromas. Raspberries are more in the nose than any apricot (or other fruit) aromas. Wine-like aromas...chardonnay. Taste is immediately reminiscent of a dry chardonnay...but with a ton of raspberry flavor. The raspberry flavor is not forced or out of place though. Very fresh and complimentary to the flavor. Acidic, but only for the sake of great fruit flavor. This beer sure does have some great fruit flavor. Mainly raspberries, but as it warms up, you get apricots, nectarines, plumots, and a hint of strawberry. Oaky, wine-like finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat dry, and puckering in the finish. Drinkability is very high. Almost 9% ABV is non-existent in the aroma or taste...possibly there in the mouthfeel. Maybe a slight warming sensation. Overall, Cascade is just killing it with the sour genre. Never had a bas sour beer from them. I will continue to support this brewery if they continue to put out delicious gems like this one. I'm hesitant to age my other bottle, considering how tasty the fruit profile is right now.","DovaliHops","Nov 20, 2012"

4.42,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"One of Cascade's more intense beers. Very nice but some funky brett would really blow this one out of the water.","brewandbbq","Nov 19, 2012"

4.29,-2.3,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some berry, apricot, and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a super tart and acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some fantastic flavors that make it a treat to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 11, 2012"

4.77,8.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a golden/orang-ish with a thick, fluffy, white head. Aroma of sour berry fruits, lactic-like yeast, and surprisingly, a very noticeable almond-like note from the apricot nut. Dry palate, very sour and puckering and very astringent. The raspberry lent towards fruit tones, but didn't stand out as raspberry. The Noyeaux made an appearance towards the finish.","boMD","Nov 09, 2010"

3.9,-11.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"D: I enjoyed this one. The market saturation of American Wilds is producing a lot of high-quality beers. This isn't in the top tier, but it's enjoyable enough to be in the next one.","Arbitrator","Mar 30, 2010"
4.37,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D: For an 8.5% brew that smacks of all things tart and funky - well, it's pretty damn drinkable. The subtlest boozy glow, but really the test is how much 'wildness' one's palate can accept. The 10-12 oz. in this glass was plenty good in a short sitting, but I coulda/woulda/shoulda enjoyed another had I had more time to spare. Worth seeking.","msubulldog25","Mar 29, 2010"
4.3,-2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"One finger frothy white head, medium dissipation with some lacing present throughout. Pink grapefruit colored cloudy body, a bit of visible carbonation. The nose is dominated by the raspberries, a bit of raisins from the port barrels, pinto pony horse blanket. Taste is the trademark Cascade Sour, berries up front healthy wallop of funk a bit of mango with a dry roasted finish from the yeast and apricot pits. Mouthfeel is light, very dry, astringent. Drinkability is dangerous at this ABV, perfect for a hot summer afternoon. Very tasty, another winner from Cascade, home of America's best sour beers.","jdense","Mar 28, 2010"
4.42,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The flavor is of slightly tart apricots, raspberries, oranges, and white grapes, with a light acidity and a fairly clean lactic sourness. A slight musty quality is evident. Sweetness is at a moderate level and I notice a faint nuttiness. Carbonation was very low, but the acidity adds some texture. Another unique and enjoyable beer from Cascade.","HopHead84","Feb 23, 2010"
4.27,-2.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"D: Cascade really makes some great sour beers and this is no exception. A fantastic wild ale that I hope to try again at some point.","womencantsail","Feb 22, 2010"
