4.46,0.7,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Outstanding Flem Red with a delicious choice of cherries. Rich, tart with a special robust sour cherry addition. Has a better than average malt backbone and mouth feel as well. This is a special beer for anyone who enjoys Kriek but on the drier more tart side...and definitely for those who like a bigger body Fem Red. Can't recommend enough.","BillRoth","Mar 02, 2015"

The nose has molasses sweetness touched by cherry upfront that's followed by oak, some acetone, and a slightly poopy fart. A similar molasses sweetness washes over the palate in the beer's taste and transitions into subtle tart cherries and modest oak. The beer has a heavy-medium, chewy body with minimal carbonation or alcohol, palate coating and mildly abrasive cherries and oak, and a dry, tannic finish. This beer is big and flavorful, the cherries have faded some, but very drinkable and relatively balanced.","ThePorterSorter","May 29, 2014"

4.31,-2.7,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"this is wonderful beer, it really is, but im not sure how much the cherries really add to it. i mean, the original beer has a lot of tart cherry notes in it already, but remains balanced and rather true to the flemish red tradition. this edition actually has cherries in it, and while they get lost a bit in one of the most sour beers ive ever had, they give it a gritty sort of sweetness before the acid attack on the back end. deep ruby red in color with a ton of bubbles, no problems there. the nose is sour, but doesnt show nearly the intensity of it that is about to follow. the cherries add a nice layer to the smell, tart and familiar, but they come through a bit sweeter in the taste at first. nice sour red base on the first sip, but ive oude tart enough to know that its about to get gnarly. the sourness here is perhaps the most of any beer i have ever had, in fact im pretty sure it is, it almost hurts my jaw just smelling it. the flavors are awesome for the first few sips, and i get a nice earthiness that comes along with all the cherry, but after about half a glass i cant really taste it much anymore, certainly not as well, because my taste buds have been basically scorched off my tongue by all the acid. im not complaining, i like that, but i could never take down a bottle of this without help, it would turn my guts inside out for sure. the carbonation is high, which amplifies the sourness to even a higher degree. i love this beer, but i may like the base beer better than the cherry version. it just doesnt really need them.","StonedTrippin","Apr 10, 2014"

Dark ruby body with a thin tan head. The scent with tart pie cherries, which is very nice. The taste is almost exactly the same. Just enough cherry to give you that tart fruit character, but the base beer still shines. Excellent and an upgrade from the Oude Tart base beer.","PHBoiler","Mar 16, 2014"

It's not the most practical sour I've had, but the fruit characteristic, as well as the intense oak, is notable in its class.

Tons of cherry skin, dark fruit, lactobacillus, and a bit of oak. The flavor is very sour with tons of tart cherry, oak, berry skin, and tannins. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated. Overall, this is a different beast than the base beer.","homebrew311","Dec 06, 2013"

Dark ruddy brown pour with a thin, wispy head; minimal retention and lacing was not surprising. Fairly tart aroma, as would be expected, some earthy funk, notes of phenolic cherry. More of this in the taste, tart, somewhat acetic, earthy, funky, oaky, overripe cherry pulp, leather, cherry cough syrup, with a slightly tea-like herbal quality coming through. Medium body, slightly chewy mouthfeel, with a sour prickle to it. Seemed kind of like an "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" scenario to me, where they took an already decent base beer and went just a little too far. Still good, but I prefer the original.","Rifugium","Nov 15, 2013"

Plenty sour with a blend of moderate red wine vinegar and plenty of sour cherries, bursting, fresh and unabashedly flavorful. Leathery, tannic and with a touch of tobacco, the contrast here is really nice. Tannic red wine, especially on the mid-palate, is present. Sour on the finish with a fleshy, fruity, juicy sour cherry flavor dominating, there's also a touch of meat, a flavor I've found in more than one oud bruin (I'm not making this up, I swear. Medium light in body, moderately carbonated, this beer feels good on the palate. Both the base beer and the fruited version are intense, but this particular batch manages to channel the intensity in ways that make this really work. Recommended.","DefenCorps","Nov 12, 2013"

Tart, dark-red, overly ripe cherries with a good amount of oak and vinegar. Sweet cherries as well with a hint of vanilla and more wood. Some funky notes with a lot of sour aromas. As this beer warms, the cherry comes through fantastically. Taste is initially sweet cherry deliciousness, switches quickly to puckering sour. Light vanilla and heavy oak flavors. A bit of red wine vinegar. Puckering. Mouthfeel is full bodied, lip smacking, and puckering. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is fantastic. I enjoy it a bit more than the regular Oude Tart. The cherries shine through very nicely. Glad I stocked up on this one!","DovaliHops","Aug 15, 2013"

4.39,-0.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a murky dark brown with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour cherries/berries, balsalmic vinegar, and some nice funky aromas. Taste is of sour cherries, vinegar, and earthy and funky flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer and the sour cherries are a great addition to the base beer.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 17, 2012"

4.47,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"d - Overall I thought this was a really great beer; pretty on par with the regular Oude Tart, just more focused around cherries. Would love to have this one again and it was one of the best beers at EBF.","mdfb79","Feb 28, 2011"
4.27,-3.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The flavor wasn't quite as complex are integrated as the nose, and it was a tad bit more acid-forward without as much of the underlying cherry, oak, and fruit flavors. Still, quite good. The feel integrated the two acid components quite well and mixed things up really well with the cherries. Overall, a very nice beer that I was thrilled to see on the menu.","Thorpe429","Feb 26, 2011"

4.2,-5.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Minimal head. The beer is a mahogany color. Tha nose is red fruit. Cherries ( obviously), rasberries, it even smells tart. Taste follows. Super sweet and tart. In fact it is reminiscent of the candy Sweet Tarts. Feel is light with great carbonation. Good Drinkability due to it's refreshing nature. ABV is completely hidden by the mouth puckering sourness of the beer. I like it! Wish it was available in bottles.","Sideswipe","Jan 23, 2011"
4.47,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Carbonation is thankfully there to help lighten up the medium bodied beer, soft and delicate bubbles preventing an overly syrupy mouthfeel. Tart but not alcoholic at all. Very easy to drink for how sour it is on the tongue, but it makes me both thirsty for more, and hungry for some food.","nataku00","Jan 19, 2011"
4.22,-4.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D - I am glad I got a sample of this. It could have used a bit more cherries but it was still pretty good. I hope they end up bottling it at some point. I would love to have a few.","orangesol","Jan 19, 2011"

4.23,-4.5,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"On tap at the Bruery Reserve Initiation party 2011. Pours a murky rust mahagony color with a slight tan head that collars around the glass. Nice tart cherry aroma in the nose along with slight acetone. Light mouthfeel. Well balanced comes to mind as I drink this. It really isn't overly sweet or sour but somewhere in the middle with the sweetness of the cherries being counteracted by the tartness and vice versa. Ends with a lingering tartness. Very drinkable.","kbutler1","Jan 10, 2011"
4.35,-1.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very pungent cherry and vanilla, strong bretty sourness and acidity, refreshing and refined. Bravo.","ptykozoon","Jan 09, 2011"
4.15,-6.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Served from tap into a Bruery sampler imperial pint at the Reserve Society Party. Poured a murky brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and cherries. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, citrus, and very slight cherries. It had a light feel on the palate with med-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The cherries were definitely a nice touch as when compared to the regular version of Oude Tart. If you like sours you will definitely enjoy this one with its well balanced flavors and good aroma to bring you back for more. A definite must try.","thagr81us","Nov 29, 2010"

4.2,-5.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Tastes like sour cherries, unsurprisingly. Cherries are dominant, but there's an acetic and vinous undercurrent that's quite nice. Very enjoyable and balanced, albeit somewhat one-dimensional. There's a touch of sweetness, but this is largely sour. Large quantities could get stomach-churning, but I enjoyed drinking a few small pours.","largadeer","Nov 27, 2010"
4.44,0.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is the best wild ale I've ever had from The Bruery. They really nailed it.","nickd717","Nov 21, 2010"
4.28,-3.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured a dark murky brown with reddish yellow highlights that had a thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was huge on the cherries along with mild vinegar, acidic character, oakiness, and faint citrus notes. The taste was also slammed by the cherries with vinegar, oaky, tart, and acidic accents but did have a touch of citrus that added a little dimension; nice cherry bomb. The brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet , fruity, slight acidic, but oaky sticky tart finish. It drank real good and was glad that this was left over to try after the reseve society party. Nice beer all around, I honestly hope they can find it in them to bottle this tasty goodness.","Gobzilla","Nov 21, 2010"
4.34,-2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"With cherries or without? That is the question. Better yet, drink both versions and you won't have that problem.","DoubleJ","Nov 21, 2010"

4.37,-1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall: Very good, and though I can't say its an improvement upon the original, which was already a great beer, it's certainly very nice in its own way.","HopHead84","Nov 20, 2010"
