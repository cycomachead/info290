Smells like a mouthful. Taste is quite sour.  The sourness overpowers the flavors present. I get cherries and some woody bourbon but the sour acetic/citric acid notes overpower the rest. This takes away from my enjoyment. Mouthfeel is dry and and thin with a sour aftertaste.overall a sour buddy with a nice aroma that is overshadowed with sour.","deebo","Oct 31, 2014"

5,11.9,,,,,,"An 8 oz pour at the Cascade Barrel house on 8/19/2014. As close to perfect as possible. It starts brown with a copious head, producing a good amount of lace. Aroma: sour fruit and oak, very Flemish red. Nicely complex flavor: cherries, prunes, oak, bourbon. Dry with a light to medium light body and low carbonation. Lower acidity and more dried fruit than the usual Flanders red. A must have.","LittleDon","Aug 19, 2014"

4.46,-0.2,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"my brother is a deadset champion for sharing this bottle with me. its one of those beers ive been after for years, but my travels or trades havent gotten me there. what a rare treat it is, wine and bourbon sharing the barrel influence of this burgundy sour beer accentuated with tart cherries. i would put this one on par with any of the russian river dark sours, and i think it needs to be mentioned in that breath. its almost purple in color, darkened to a rich ruby wine shade and showing about an inch of really light lace head. cherry is evident from first sip, tart pie style cherries in there mixing with the bacteria cultures and the wine tannins, its a really mouth watering nose. the whiskey part comes more towards the finish in this beer, more hot oak than vanilla, with just enough char to slow it down to be savored. the body isnt real big, but it doesnt need to be, the flavor complexities ride and appear one by one on the sour waves, which are dominated by lacto, but not entirely. some brett in here too i have to imagine, there is some funk in there with the acid. it warms up to show even more wine properties, pinot for sure. its usually tough for me to identify a grape varietal in a beer, especially from a barrel, but i think its unmistakable here. cherries never get sweet, even exacerbating the already extremely sour feel to this. carbonation is mellow, but more isnt wanted for. the process and the execution of this beer are both something to behold, it never shows its alcohol strength, and at room temperature sips like a fine glass of port or something. cant say enough about this one, a crown jewel in the increasingly crowded fruited sour world.","StonedTrippin","Jun 28, 2014"

Oak, light lactic sour, wisps of general dark fruitiness and berry-like accents. Opens with both sour and sweet cherries, plums, and cranberries. Very light brown sugar and molasses join in. Pleasant oaky accents throughout. Finishes with juicy cherry tart and sour, continued pleasant oak, and just a tiny hint of underlying bourbon notes. Lighter side of medium bodied; smooth with moderate carbonation. It's hard to find a brewery in the U.S. putting out better sours than Cascade and Sang Noir is one of their best.

Very pleasant aroma and for the first half of the bottle could not stop from enjoying it before every taste. Loved the sweetness and sour cherries. Very easy to drink and the 9.8% snuck up on me. I'm so glad I had ordered more than one. Can't wait to try this brew again after some aging on my other bottles. Enjoyed it so much I burnt my dinner.","JayPeso","Mar 02, 2014"

Sang is more restrained sour-wise than the other Cascades I've tried -- and all the better for it. No need to grab for the Tums. The cherry and oak interlace perfectly and the bite of sour cherries is rounded out nicely by the malt. I had a Supplication last night, so it's interesting to compare the two. Supplication is more complex, but Sang is an excellent beer.","jjdc","Jan 25, 2014"

Of course, given how difficult it is to find (and expensive to buy) it may only ever be fantasy for most people. For those of you fortunate enough to come across this dream beer, be sure to enjoy it with someone you really want to impress (i.e, your favourite person in the world).","biegaman","Jul 31, 2013"

The smell of the beer is tart, oak and sour cherry aromas are subtle but definitely in there. The taste of it is also sour, some sharp cherry notes in the fading aftertaste.

I was strangely underwhelmed, but then I realized it's because there is no one stand out feature due to the balance nature. I wouldn't age this too long, as the oak will fade completely.","Philousa","Feb 12, 2013"

Tart cherries, a bit of lactic acid and lemons destroy the sweetness in short order. Woody oak come in next with a bit of funk and vinegar and an ever increasing lactic tartness. The finish leaves a lingering sweet tart candy feel on my taste buds. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a tart chalky puckering mouthfeel.

To me, this is over carbonated and would've been much nicer with a less carbonated, creamier mouthfeel. Still nice, but not what it could be. That being said, this is fantastic.

At once, brown sugar, green apple, balsamic vinegar and milk chocolate can be detected. Swirling the medium-bodied brew about the mouth activates both moderate fizziness and high acidity, with the sharp bacteria gripping the tongue like tiny rock climbers.

Dry toasted oak with subtle lactic funk and a ton of vinous sweet fruit.  Hints of grape, tart cherry and other dark berries provide the perfect amount of sweetness to counter the sourness.  Slight acidity but not harsh or solvent like.  Tart and dry with lingering acetic vinegar presence that leaves me drooling formore.  Decent amount of sourness but very well balanced and easy to drink.","corby112","Aug 07, 2012"
3.8,-15,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Sang Noir goes out pretty dark red almost faded black but more of a badly burnt brown color shifting towards red. An off white head that is short lived with no stick. Smell is pretty promising. A nice amount of oak underlined with some bourbon tomes and wet wood. Some small berry scent with some lactic funk rising up. Taste is tart, leading in with big wood, oak, small bourbon, dark cherry and a lot of lactic sourness in the end, perhaps too much. The beer pretty much stays neutral from cold to room temp. The feel is medium and has some bubbles. The lactic blast is felt when getting this down the gullet though. It causes heartburn, quite unsettling. This is tasty beer, yet a bit too bitey for me. a 3rd of the bottle was plenty.","BARFLYB","Aug 07, 2012"
4.36,-2.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pretty purple ale with some light pink surface bubbles. Up front in the nose for me are the bing cherries and pinot notes. Nice and full bodied with a hint of ink and cassis. Some hints of alcohol and oak alongside leather and sweat. I like the already. The flavor carries more of the grape than I'd anticipated - refined, plummy and juicy. A bit of booze (maybe whiskey..) comes through just in the back end, but as an accent and overture - really nice. Medium bodied with moderate on hi carb. I like this beer - just ordered four bottles.","harrymel","Aug 06, 2012"

Poured a dark ruby red-orange with a half finger light tan that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, tart, sour, wood, fruit, vinegar, and subtle raspberry. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, fruit, sour, tart, tart cherry, and very subtle vinegar. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew.

4.27,-4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"o - Overall a very good wild ale, probably one of the better ones I've had from Cascade. Has an awesome sour nose to it, though I didn't get much bourbon at all. Would love to have it again.","mdfb79","Feb 15, 2012"

4.35,-2.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, a really solid beer. I had waited a long time to be able to grab this one, and it delivered. At the same time, I think it could have been a truly great beer with a bit more whiskey character in the blend, sort of a Cherry Adam from the Wood with red wine and acidity. Still, a very nice beer that I would love to have again.","Thorpe429","Feb 12, 2012"

4.35,-2.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer is ruby to copper colored with a small, quickly vanishing head. The aroma brings sour cherries, bourbon, oak. Smells tart. The flavor carries more oak and is tannic in nature. The bourbon is there, but cherries and a tart sourness are the primary flavors. Acetic finish with some alcohol presence. Similar to Russian River Consecration, a beer of which I am very fond. Very tasty. Overall, I am very glad to have tried this.","Huhzubendah","Feb 11, 2012"
4.32,-3.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a reddish brown with a thin white head. Smell is a great mix of red wine and oak. Flavor follows the nose, great mix of sour and red wine flavors, pretty similar to Consecration. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice beer from Cascade, but not quite worthy of the high praise it has received.","starrdogg","Feb 11, 2012"

4.42,-1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Awesome beer. Killer fruit presence combined with the wine and whiskey barrels. Drinks like a beer half its ABV. Highly recommended.","HopHead84","Dec 17, 2010"
4.57,2.2,3.5,4,5,4,5,"Edit from 12/13/10 visit to the barrel room. Was told that they are now out of the 2009 edition, but had just put on the 2010 version. While fairly comparable to the 2009 version, the fresh 2010 version comes across as a bit more acidic and sour. There's still more than enough going on for me to enjoy this excellent beer, but as I'm not a huge sour fan, I found myself longing for the 2009 version (which I thought showed a bit more fruit and vanilla, and was not quite as sour). Regardless, there's no doubting that this is one fine beer from the folks at Cascade.","John_M","Oct 11, 2010"
4.83,8.1,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"D- I could drink this over and over and would still want more. It would be especially excellent on a hot day...with the sound of a mandolin being gently strummed and the slow, steady creak of a well-used rocking chair on a hot summer day.","Shanonbanana","Oct 04, 2010"
4.8,7.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"- One of the best sours I have had.. better than the others in the Sang series I think... though very close to the Sang Royale.","Docer","Sep 24, 2010"

4.92,10.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"D. I was sad when it was all over. Wish this one was bottled. One of the best wilds I have ever had. And one of the best beers I have ever had for that matter. Fantastic beer from a great brewery!","elliot23","Jul 14, 2010"
4.68,4.7,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice black/dark burgundy with a solid tan head and nice lacing. At first, cherry and grapes dominate the sweet aroma with hints of blackberry. But as it warmed, a great wood began to dominate. This was a nice sweet beer balanced incredibly well with the sourness. This had a little wild carbonation but a nice long sour finish. As this got warmer, the beer became more and more complex as various flavors came out. This was the highlight of Sourfest for me (and I sampled it three times throughout the day to make sure) and one of the best beers I've ever had.","ChrisPro","Jul 11, 2010"
4.7,5.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"1/2 finger tan head, good retention, reddish brown opaque body, trails of carbonation rising up side of glass, Nose is huge frickin' cherry hit up front, more sour than sweet, little if any hops, with oak notes becoming more prominent as the beer warmed. Taste is cherry domination, tart, funky, sweet, some oakiness, all in balance an incredibly complex tasting beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full, not a lot of effervescence, not sticky despite the sweetness. Drinkability is high despite the ABV, just a crazy tasty beer. Thirty months of barrel aging, along with the sublime blending of Ron Gansberg, one of America's best Wile Ale brewers results in this truly amazing beer. An absolute must for aficionados of the style. Very highly recommended.","jdense","Jul 03, 2010"
4.32,-3.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Sang Noir by Cascade Brewing is a barrel aged sour brewed with cherries and 8% abv. It poured a pitch red dark brown with a hint of black. It smelled of cherries, Brett and sweet malts. It tasted sweet and sour with cherry goodness, malt and oak notes. It was my favorite of the bunch, but I am a fan of Cascade and any sours, so I'm partial.","femALEist","Mar 25, 2010"
4.82,7.8,4,4.5,5,5,5,"Poured into a tulip glass at Toronado. It's a very dark ruby red almost opaque with pink head, little lacing. Smells heavy of dark fruits. The Taste is delicious, very tart. It has lots of chery, fig and raisin flavors but is not sweet at all, mixes in well with the wood flavor from the barrels. The mouth feel is very pleasant, with just enough carbonation to make this go down smoothly. It's crazy how smooth this beer is for 10% abv","somabeer","Mar 14, 2010"
4.89,9.4,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability is insanely good. This is their best beer I've had yet. I'm a big fan of sour darks, and this one really kills it. The intense flavor hides the strong ABV, making this one potentially very dangerous.","ccrida","Feb 20, 2010"
