4.09,-2.2,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"this one really took me by surprise. expecting an enormous oak heavy full bodied wild stout, akin to something like tart of darkness, i was totally wrong. its so light in body, not bitter at all from the roast, minimal viscosity, and really pretty clean finishing, borderline refreshing for what it is, and totally different than other wild stouts. might even be a stretch to call it that. dark in color with an average head, i am taken aback by its runny texture, not rich or syrupy at all. the nose shows lemony lacto pretty intensely, but also notes of brett, oak, vanilla and bourbon. the barrel has influenced this quite a bit. lemony citrus all through the taste, and less roasted character than i am used to in a stout, more of a dry cocoa thing, not quite as bitter, but definitely dark. i may have enjoyed black metal more, the bourbon barrel, while adding a ton of flavor, i dont think all the way jives with the sourness. the sweet vanilla seems to be fighting the bacteria cultures, and never really resolves itself. complicated set of flavors on this one, and i like it a lot, very different from anything else out there. more carbonation would be helpful, but maybe then it would even be too light. curious to see how this one evolves in the cellar over time.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Served in Jester King stemware (thanks Michael). The beer is a near black shade with an oily beige head. The aroma is quite interesting. Dark fruits, plum, brett, oak, sour cherry, rye bread. Intense sour with an overly ripe sour cherry flavor. Lactic mouthfeel with a puckering finish. Roast and stout character is overwhelmed by the wild ale component. That said, I don't mind the imbalance that much. Intriguing and interesting. A nice sipper.","Huhzubendah","Apr 14, 2014"

Taste is also dominated by tart and sour notes with light acidic notes and some light dry roasted malt with light vinous notes. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Pretty enjoyable even though soured stout are not something I look for on a regular basis.","Phyl21ca","Feb 14, 2014"

4.2,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Got in a trade with cyde. 750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Batch 1, bottled in Fall 2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, red wine, dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, toast, oak, clove, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, leather, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, oak, and acidic yeast ester flavors; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, red wine, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, oak, clove, hay, straw, vinegar, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, oak, clove, vinegar, straw, hay, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of roasted malt, oak, and acidic yeast ester flavors; with a great balance of malt/acidity and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and lightly acidic/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome sour imperial stout. All around great balance and complexity of roasted malt, oak, and lactic yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 19, 2014"

Poured black with a one finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was compromised of sweet malt, roasted malt, fruit, earth, sour, funk, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, sour, tart, funk, roasted malt, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The tart and sour twist on this one was actually quite nice on the base brew. This made it quite drinkable and enjoyable throughout the glass. Wish this were readily available in my area so I could crush this daily! Definitely worth your time!","thagr81us","May 02, 2013"

I've got mixed feelings about JK, and some of their more experimental offerings (such as the one-off mash-ups they offer on tour days) are just a hot mess. This, however, is spot-on. None of the sometimes observed (what I would consider) "undesirable" wild characteristics (dirty feet, horse sweat, asparagus, etc.) are evident. The slightly sweet and well-rounded stout flavors blend perfectly with the not-quite puckery sourness and produce something both unique and delicious. Bravo. I'd like to see more like this. Absolutely, absolutely worth trying. Highly recommended.","Lawl3ss","Apr 07, 2013"

It is similar in that is a dark sour but is also clearly different at the same time in that funk metal sticks true to its stout by nature. I'm unaware of the blend of base beers of CD4 but I know it wasn't as chocolaty. This defiantly blows tart of darkness out of the water. That's for sure.

Just a thin film of brown bubbles of various sizes, and even that disappeared fairly quickly. I've seen pictures of this beer with a lot more head, so I assume that my bottle is just a bit low on carbonation. I really don't care about appearance nor expect perfect consistency from sours, so it doesn't bother me at all. The aroma has lots of fruit and some underlying stout character. I'm getting a lot of blackberries and red wine. There's a good dose of oak in there. Underneath that fruity sourness, there's chocolate, a little caramel and mild roast. Very pleasant mix of chocolate and fruit. The flavors are well composed and seem much more intentional than probably any other sour stout that I've tried. Taste is similar to aroma. Primary flavors are chocolate, sour, tannic oak, blackberries and red wine. Fairly tart, particularly in the finish. Some cocoa sweetness, but the oak provides a drying tannic bite. Nice lingering red wine and chocolate aftertaste. Carbonation is relatively low, but that might just be my bottle, in part. Very good sour stout. Probably the best I've had. I haven't been a big fan of many sour stouts, but this is an excellent beer. Jester King continues to impress.","popery","Mar 23, 2013"

I certainly agree with BeerAdvocate, this fits more of the American Wild Ale style. Regardless, excellent sour love the Brettanomyces . Tart level is 6/10. Roast level blends in really well. At 16.99 its a tough beer to 'highly' recommend. But the monetary value eliminated - it is certainly very good and very unique.","weonfire","Mar 23, 2013"
