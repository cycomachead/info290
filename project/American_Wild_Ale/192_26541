The scent is full of tropical fruits as well as peach. Very fresh scent. Upon tasting, the initial fruity sweetness gives way to a crisp, tart, and acidic finish. Not a full on sour bomb, but it is there and very enjoyable. Wonderful lingering flavor of a slightly sweet mango. Lively carbonation and light bodied. Very enjoyable beer and a sour ale that is likely to be best fresh.","Jmamay22","Mar 22, 2015"

Aroma is initially innocent enough, some orange and lemon rinds, but blooms into some pretty serious sour funk with a fruity flair, full of sour mangoes, green apples, peaches, white grapes, limes, vinegar, lemon juice. A massive sour gummy candy bouquet with just a hint of barnyard. On the palate the hops seem to accent rather than dominate. Tons of sour fruit: Muscat grapes, lemon-lime, those sour tangerines that are full of seeds, and green mango, super acidic and corrosive, again with little true funk in the old style. Fiercely carbonated as well, like a sparkling wine. Getting more hops on the nose late, quite floral. A subtle sweetness like a pina colada lurks underneath. Body on the light side but not watery or thin per se. I'm still branching out into sour beer territory but this burgeoning fan deems this an "instant classic", at least if one is trying to capture the sour fruit stylings of Rodenbach or tannic white wines.

4.37,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, I have had hardly any dry hopped sours, but to me this is what they should be all about, it's a sour beer first and once the sourness starts to fade just enough hops show up to remind that there is indeed some hops and this beer and I think it adds complexity to a style that can sometimes be to dominated by just sour and not much else.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little acidic, a little crisp, not too dry, not filling at all and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, I might be able to drink the whole bottle, but there's a good chance that the acidic aspect would start to wear on me.  What I liked the most about this beer was how well the hoppy aspects worked with this beer, it's got some nice hop flavors and some really nice hop aromas with out adding bitterness which I think would really clash with the sour.  What I liked the least about this beer was how acidic it was, I know that comes with the territory when it comes to sours, but if it was toned down just a little I think it would help the drinkability.  I would for sure buy this beer again and I wouldn't mind seeing how it ages, but I'm not sure it would get any better since it's dry hopped.  I would recommend this to any sour fans, it's for sure worth a try.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I was little impressed with how well the hops worked with the sour, they used the hops in such a way were it accents the fruity sour flavors and it's far from dominating.  So far this in now one of my favorite beers from New Belgium and in the lips of faith series, it's one of the better sours I've had and it's now the best dry hopped sour I've had.  Great job guys this is one tasty beer and I really enjoyed drinking it, keep up all that hard work.","StoutHunter","Nov 29, 2014"

Aroma has huge fruity smells, both lots of tropical and citrus. I also got some sweet malt notes and some funky yeast. The taste is wonderful, with so many great flavors assaulting your palate. Grapefruit, mango, and peach notes slap you in the face up front with a nice lingering sour yeasty flavor on the back end. Mouthfeel was fairly light and crisp, with the tartness putting a nice prickly feel on your tongue. Overall, this is an outstanding sour, with the dry-hopping adding those great aromas and flavors.

The beer smell is pretty complex and delicious. The beer has both a tarty component and a fruity/tropical part. The tart sour (similar to that of grapefruit and Granny Smiths) is pretty strong and dominates the smell but is delightful when the tropical part comes out. The tropical smell is a little bit like watermelon and melon with a bit of sweet papaya. The beer taste is similar but the tart is stronger and the tropical part is harder to make out. The tropical part still comes out and is pretty good but it's hard to keep the beer in your mouth for that long. The tropical portion is generally stronger after the beer has warmed a little and stronger in the aftertaste. The same melon notes from before are present. The tart comes out with the same notes but is amplified by the bitter citrus hops.","HattedClassic","Nov 06, 2014"

The fruity notes in the hops provide a great layer on top of the fruity sour of the base beer. Will be seeking out more of this.","neurobot01","Oct 26, 2014"

4.75,10.5,,,,,,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy reddish orange body with two fingers of fluffy, long lasting off-white head. The beer looks wonderful and very appealing. Scents of orange flesh, tropical fruit, especially mango, but also with some pineapple, some spicy yeast phenols and a hint of wild yeast and a very faint light pine. Overall impression of aroma is light and fruity, very bright, with a nice undertone of spicy yeast keeping it balanced. Very nice. Flavor begins moderately sour, with a nice wild funk, light pine resin, notes of tropical fruit and lemon zest. This moves into a middle that is still moderately sour, with more pronounced notes pine resin, wild, sour funk, some lemongrass and lemon zest. Finish is dry with high sourness notes of lemongrass, tropical fruit, indeterminate citrus fruit and zest, wild, sour funk and light pine. Aftertaste is wild, sour funk, lemon, hints of peach and tropical fruit and slight lemongrass. Overall impression of flavor is of a sour, funky, complex ale that combines nice wild funk, combined with nice levels of fruitiness and a pine and herbal character from the lemongrass. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a puckering, drying, refreshing feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nicely sour and puckering wild ale that is quite refreshing. Overall this is a wonderful American Wild Ale that is refreshingly tart, fruity, wild, funky and piney in aroma and flavor. Aided by a wonderful mouthfeel it is a nicely refreshing ale. Very well done and quite good.","Auraan","Oct 07, 2014"

Beautiful aroma of grassy hops, hay, a little funk, some nice citrus and tangerines, and some sweet bready maltiness. Flavor follows the smell, but with much more citrus fruit and sourness. A nice sharp lactic tart here with big juicy apricots and tangerines, and a light grassy hay-like hop bite that doesn’t get in the way of thtis juicy sour brew. Dry finish after the juicy fruits, light to medium bodied, with plus carbonation. This beer exceeded my expectations. What an awesome, awesome sour from New Belgium.","BMMillsy","Oct 04, 2014"

4,-7,,,,,,"I am not sure if I like the addition of depth to a sour.  There seems to be a regular beer not-too-well hidden behind a dose of fruity tartness.  I liked the tropical fruit tastes with the sour.  However, adding the more earthy tones that I assume come from larger amounts of more flavorful hops than might otherwise be used in a sour I think detracts from the part I initially enjoyed.  I still rated it decently because it is a fine beer, but I think there was potential to be even better.","cjgiant","Oct 01, 2014"

And yes, I know it’s pasteurized and the heyday of all New Belgium sours is supposed to be prior to the era of pasteurization, but goddamn this is delicious. Absurdly good, like, why-isn’t-this-always-available delicious. The base sour is extremely solid, which I feel confident in saying after having had an old bottle (post-pasteurization) a couple of years ago after the hops had died off, and that was plenty tasty on its own. But this is in a zone of its own right now, while the hops are still kickin’. Definitely pick this beer up.","fmccormi","Sep 13, 2014"

4.37,1.6,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Hazy, rusty orange with a small white head that amounts to a loose collection of frothy bubbles. Tart, fruity aroma with some acetic notes coming through to join a touch of wood, while citrusy hops and grass waft above. Peaches, flowers, bergamot, and lime, getting better as it warms, adding a subtle tea-like smell to the equation. Sour flavor with a definite peachy, fruity hop element. Lots of stone fruit, grapefruit, and lingering sour lemon. Such a smooth melding of hops and sourness. Refreshing and drinkable, but not super acetic, which is pleasant. Very smooth and well rounded. Dry and slightly puckering, leading to some dryness on the gums. I could drink a lot of this if given the opportunity. I had to keep restraining myself from taking huge gulps. Seems less super dry and funky than Felix on its own, thanks to the lovely fruity and floral integration of hoppy goodness. Good stuff!","wedge","Apr 27, 2014"

Bright, floral and juicy pitted fruits/fresh peaches and apricots, and a tropical kind of refreshing tartness that permeates the nostrils. Nice doughy malts underneath. Taste is also very refreshing, sour but rounded out with lightly sweet fruit. Very dry and snappy throughout. Clean, fruity, tart, balanced, and extremely drinkable. The hops work great with their sour base beer here.","tastybeer","Apr 26, 2014"

4.25,-1.2,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,4,"Light brown to dull copper penny in color with moderate clarity. A minuscule layer of thin white head partially covers the top of the beer. Aroma is a complicated mixture of tart Brett and earthy citrus like hops. The taste is initially very tart and yet quickly the citrus like hops follow and help keep the tartness in check. The fade is an interesting tango of the ultra sour Brett notes and more fresh citrus hops. The mouth is dry and earthy. This a very refreshing roller coaster ride for your palate. Not for the meek tongued!","Franziskaner","Mar 25, 2014"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour green apple, cherry, grape, cranberry, grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, floral, grass, clove, pepper, oak, leather, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of hop, yeast, and oak notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart green apple, cherry, grape, cranberry, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, hay, straw, floral, grass, oak, clove, pepper, leather, vinegar, musty funk, white wine, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart green apple, cherry, grape, cranberry, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, floral, grass, hay, oak, clove, leather, light vinegar, musty funk, white wine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of yeast, hop, and oak barrel flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible dry hopped sour! All around fantastic balance and complexity of the hop and wild ale flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. An extremely delicious offering.","superspak","Dec 29, 2013"

I didn’t see the hops but I’m not holding it against the beer because it’s flat out great. I highly recommend this to sour fans.","macher0","Dec 16, 2013"

Off the bat I love the idea of this beer, barrel aged sour then dry hopped for 8 days... Pours very cleanly, but the aroma off this one was more attention grabbing. Fruity and floral with a bit of funk, you're drawn right in. Don't get it twisted, this is a sour beer that begs to be consumed slowly as there is a fully formed wild palette in the brew. The hops do a lot to cut the sharpness leaving this a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer. Perfect gateway beer for IPA drinkers trying to get into sours.","cornejo","Dec 09, 2013"

This one is wonderfully balanced and I might suggest it to someone who was looking to get into sour beers, as the hoppiness provides some flavor profiles that might be more familiar to someone who was new to the characteristics of sour beer. I will definitely continue buying this beer as long as they keep releasing it.","LambicPentameter","Nov 29, 2013"
4.18,-2.8,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"The beer pours a hazy golden amber with a thin off-white head that fades while lacing. The nose is a potent mix of piney/earthy cascade hops carried on by a bit of tart funk. The taste brings a lot more malty sweetness and flavor forward accented by earthy hops and a light, tart fruity (watermelon, kiwi, grapes?) funkiness. Medium bodied, well carbonated, slightly tart and acidic, but drinkable, earthy hops, lingering fruit, masked alcohol...like whoa. This beer is a great seasonal sour from NB, more drinkable and approachable than la folie (which I also thoroughly enjoy) and has a better chance pairing with a meal for that reason. I'd definitely drink this one again and recommend to others.","ThePorterSorter","Nov 29, 2013"

4.3,0,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Have had the pleasure of enjoying this beer many times in many settings, finally time for a review. Pours a somewhat cloudy orange with a blanket of white head that retains nicely and leaves heavy lacing. The nose starts with fresh hops, the simcoe and amarillo bring some pine, grass, and tropical fruit to the table. This is followed by some toasty malt aroma paired with a nice dose of lactobacillus. The taste is way more tart than the nose lets you believe. Notes of tart cherries, lemon, balsamic vinegar, and tropical fruits are all present on the palate. The sourness is refreshing and plenty puckering, the hops kind of tame down the intensity. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and light. Overall, this is a very unique sour that features the best of both the hoppy and the wild ale world.","homebrew311","Nov 23, 2013"

It starts off like a solid IPA and then slowly melds into what a sour ale should be. Tastes of lemon, grapefruit, oranges and lime on the hop notes. The sour starts when it crosses from pine into the citrus flavors that complement this beer perfectly as it transitions into mango and peach.Tons of tropical fruit flavor in this. Mouthfeel is very nice and refreshing.","jbaker67","Oct 26, 2013"

Taste has an immediate tartness, reminds me of a cider a little bit. As the tartness faded there is a hop aftertaste that comes out and lingers. It's not over the top hoppy like some IPA's but just a light pleasant hop presence. Overall different from what I'm used to, but very refreshing in it's own way.","Danimals_Beard","Oct 23, 2013"

Aroma and flavor are complex with peach, mango, pineapple, lemon, cedar shavings, sour cherry, vinegar, horse blanket/barnyard funk, anda bit of allspice, The judicious use of Amarillos for dry hopping was ingenious, as the fruitiness imparted by the hops segues seamlessly into the funkiness contributed by the brett.. This one is not quite as sour as La Folie, but has a more intriguing balance and flavor profile, and it has a better drinkability. Buy at least few, (it’s considerably cheaper than the Folie) if you can find them.","Impfan","Oct 20, 2013"

4.71,9.5,4.25,4.5,5,4.75,4.5,"Pours a hazy dark orange color with a two finger head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick ring of lacing. Decent carbonation. Smells of bretty funk, mustiness, sour cherries, tiny bit of mango, peaches, good amount of lemon, white grape, a tiny bit of sweet breadiness. Taste starts with the dry hop qualities. Get peaches and mango, as well as a tiny bit of grapefruit. Then gets much more tart in the middle, along with notes of lemon, funk and some oak. The finish brings just a tad bit of sweetness, but is just overtaken by the funkiness from the brett, as well as more peach, mango, grapefruit, almost a white grape flavor, cherry, tropical fruit. You can tell the beer has been sitting in oak barrels for a few years, as the oak is very apparent in the finish. Very tart, puckering, acidic finish that lingers on the palate and makes you want to take another sip. Crisp, slightly creamy, and sticky mouthfeel with a medium body. The dry hopping adds a whole new dimension to the beer. Extremely complex sour for a reasonable price. This is hands down the best beer I’ve had by New Belgium so far.","brewskis","Oct 12, 2013"

3.96,-7.9,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"this didn't quite live up to the hype for me. a cool sour, highly prized, and finally scored. it pours a clearish orangey resin color with a good inch or so of just off white foam. the nose on it s quite sweet, and this beer is in fact a sweet and sour package. starts sweet in both taste and nose. mango and peach are obvious, possibly from the hops, possibly from something else. the sour part is the second half, lactic and puckery, but not as intense as it might be. its a good late summer palate, and a much more mild type of sour than I was expecting, and certainly when compared to la folie. bright fruit and sour go well together, but I found this a touch too sweet. it hurt my teeth and left my mouth feeling strange, like eating too many sour patch kids. dry as dry champagne too. the carbonation is nice though, and the body is right on medium. I am glad I had some friends to share this with, a whole bomber would have been too much.","StonedTrippin","Oct 04, 2013"

Aroma of fruity notes of peaches and mango with light tart undertones is quite unique. Taste is quite unique with subtle fruity notes of mango and peaches with very nice fruity ester with some well balanced tart notes. Body is about average with good carbonation.

The smell of the beer is earthy, slightly tart, some cherry notes and oak. The taste of the beer is very tart, far more sour than all the other "sour" ales that New Belgium makes. There is more cherry in the flavor with some vinegar. The mouthfeel is pretty good, drinkable and light bodied nice carbonation. Overall this beer is good, the hops have faded but the sour notes are what seem to me as their peak. Really nice beer.","Knapp85","0"

4.2,-2.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Enjoyed at the 1st Annual Brass Hat Brewing Brewfest in Watertown, CT, this little beauty from the bomber shows a somewhat cloudy straw-yellow brown color with a decent frothy white head and very healthy lacing. The aroma impresses you immediately with lemon-bread, skunky yeast and a little sweet bubblegum. I like it and the sour invitation is compelling. The flavor again echoes the lemon sharpness detected by the nose but there's also some peachy vinegar and some vanilla biscuit. Bitter but perfectly drinkable for the style. It's medium-light bodied with lively carbonation and a light, crisp feel. Once again, this Lips of Faith series is really translating the Belgian ideas into accessible American lingo that I thoroughly enjoy. While it's a little different from the couple of European leaders I have sampled, it stands well with them in my mind. Enjoy this if you find it!","Durge","Sep 18, 2011"

4.22,-1.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Damn French and its crazy pronunciations... Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly murky golden amber topped by a finger or so of kinda fluffy white sea foam. The nose comprises lemon peel, orange rind, lime, pineapple, ruby red grapefruit, sour watermelon, currants, and a touch of peach. It's a tart, fruity wonderland in my nose. I believe there's also a hint of mild mint and pine in there too. The taste is pretty similar, but with the sourness pumped up significantly. It's not necessarily mouth-puckering but it's more than palpable, lemme tell ya. Still dominated by fruit, though a bit of hoppy goodness does make it through the produce stand and onto my 'buds. Unfortunately, it's not as easy to pick out the individual fruits now. Still pretty tasty, though. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, good times all-around here. Thankfully this is one relatively readily-available sour that does not disappoint.","TMoney2591","Jul 13, 2011"

Flavor is acidic unripe fruits, citrus and berries, something subtly herbal, lemonhead candy, slight honey malts in the finish, very dry and tart.

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is fruity and sour, it smells like tart apples, apricots, peaches, lemons, and some vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, but I notice some white grape and a bit of pine/citrus hop flavors, too. The sourness isn't overpowering but you definitely can tell it's a mostly sour brew. I know it's a dry hopped brew, but I pick up more sourness than hops in both the aroma and taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's well carbonated and also dry.

3.98,-7.4,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"D/O: History tells us that New Belgium is much more adept at harnessing sourness than hops, yet this beer's flavor makes something amazing out of both--and it happens simultaneously. The attraction is found early in the flavor of the cellar-temperature beer; it may taste more like real grapefruit juice than any other beer tasted so far. Unfortunately this beer's pleasant but unremarkable smell is not its lowest point--the burn of acidity builds on the palate over time, becoming uncomfortable. Still, the flavors win out; they are impossible to resist, the resultant burn being a cost worth paying.","beagle75","May 16, 2011"

3.82,-11.2,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Pour is a little darker that I expected with little head retention though overall it still looks appealing with a cloudy pine sap color. The dry hoping is notable but not dominant, surprisingly it mixes well with the mild acetone tartness. There is also a little mustiness and a tropical fruit profile in the aroma, any concern about a mediocre NB commercial sour has been put aside now, I can tell this will be enjoyable. The flavor is soft amalgamation of peach, apricot, grain, lemon zest, and grass with none of those flavors coming through more than any other. This beer is more tart than sour but as a sour lover this easily scratches my itch for sour beer. Also the acetone detected in the aroma is not nearly as prevalent in the flavor as it was in the aroma, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is moderate, could stand to be lighter but thats nitpicking abit. As far as drinkability goes this reminds me of a Berliner Weiss in that it is flavorful and refreshing without being overbearing or cloying, very satisfying. I would buy this if it were available to me locally. Recommended.","6DaysBottomOcean","May 11, 2011"

Smells of spicy hops, apricot/peach, mango, and slight funk/must. Taste is of fermented peach/mango, vinegar, funk/must, with the spicy hop flavors coming through on the finish. There is a sour and spicy feel on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. A bit sticky in the mouth. Overall, this is a really awesome wild ale and one of the best Lips Of Faith beers.

The head is white, retention is below average and lacing is also below average. The aroma was almost tropical and slightly sour. The taste of the beer is very tart and is very acidic. The finish is slightly sweet. The fruit profile is very complex, i can barely register it all- I taste grapefruit, tangerine, sour cherry, raspberry and pineapple. It almost seemed with every sip, I would detect something else. I am a relative newcomer to sour beers so with out much to compare this too, I really like this.

Smells citruisy and earthy, the dry hopping is dominated by an aggresive american hop , my guess would be amarillo, brett is present in the background, but the american hops definetly dominate the aroma in this beer. Fresh squeezed lemonade is what comes to mind at first, but the bittery bite of an ipa is present on the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth and light. thiis a refreshing beer i've had this both on draft and in bottles within a couple of weeks of each other. and the draft version has less tartness, and you get more of the belgian funk, brett, horseblanket character.

This tastes fantastic, an almost perfectly balanced sour that leaves your palate with the impression of sweet apple fruit but stays fresh and acidic enough to keep you coming back for more.

Mouthfeel is medium very good effervescence, not sticky. This was my buddy's first 'sour' and he was certainly intrigued. I liked the citrusy hoppiness of this which aided in drinkability and approachability. This was a very pleasant surprise, I wish I'd have grabbed more bottles, though I suspect the hoppiness won't hold up to prolonged cellaring. Another winner in the Lips of Faith series.

Decent hop aroma, sweet, a little tropical fruit and a little sour bite from the yeast. Very juicy, sour bite. Juicy hopped finish which eases the sour flavors in the start. It's not bitter at all. The dry hopping definitely helps this beer and provides something unique. I'd be curious if they chose to make this beer again and give that fruit-juicy hop flavor more presence, it could be a pretty good upgrade. However.

The smell is straight up IPA territory, but the taste, ah, a beautiful tropical laced sour with a comforting acidity. Mouthfeel is smooth, coating, and acidic. No carbonation evident despite the pleasing head. I would never have thought this combination of IPA and sour to be as comforting and pleasurable as it is. A transition beer from an IPA tasting into a sour tasting? I never would have thought of it, yet here is is. Affordable, wonderfully tart, and at the same time, a resiny grapefruit kiss.

Unlike any sour I've ever had. There are lovely fruit flavors (peach, apricot, green apple, grapefruit) with hints of hoppiness and funky cheese. I also get lemongrass and leather. Very tasty. Sour, but not overly sour whatsoever. Mouthfeel is very refreshing and acidic. Drinkability is high. New Belgium has really impressed me with some of the latest Lips of Faith releases.

It was a mix of oranges, grapefruit, lemon, freshly cut apples, grass, and sour APRICOTS. Oh man this beer smells delicious! It didn't have the stomach acid aromas that some wilds get. I'm already really impressed, especially considering all of New Belgium's other wilds have let me down. The flavor is heavy on the sour apricot which I absolutely love. If I tried this "blind" I could mistake it for an Apricot lambic or even a geueze. In fact, it is very, very close to Hanssens geueze. It drinks smoothly and leaves a nice level of fruity tartness on the palate. As wilds go, this is very, very drinkable. Trying it at room temp was a good idea. I came in pessimistic but was really impressed by this beer. I kind of wish I would've snagged another while in Chicago. Hopefully it'll make it to Indiana soon.","aasher","Mar 12, 2011"

I can't quite put my finger on the essence of Le Terroir, but I can tell you right now: it's delicious. Complexity is off the charts, and this beer goes down far too quickly for only 7.5% ABV.

When you take a sip there is lots of sourness on the tongue, taste consists of green apples, orange and white grapes, tart flavors pucker the sides of the mouth.

Light funk, lots of herbal/grassy hops, some bandaid/medicinal action with a touch of light citrus and fruit. Can definitely tell this one has been dry-hopped. This is isn't super sour or tart, but there's plenty there, loads of citrus, lemon, orange, and just a bit of funky/leathery musty goodness on the finish. Firm hoppiness to it, earthy herbal bitterness, flowery, perfumey. Very interesting. Finding it hard to describe the flavors, but overall has some floral, sweet, and citric characters, and all blends together well. Carbonation is good despite the look, medium bodied.

There's a ton of acetic acid, some lactic sourness and a touch of sweetness. The ripe fruit character pairs beautifully with the acetic sourness. The taste opens with a ton of lactic sourness and fruity sweetness. Strawberries, vinegar and a faintly herbal hop flavor come out in the mid-palate, with a bit of grain flavor beneath the sourness.

Some red and green apples, as well as some sour grapes. Low carbonation but quite dry in the finish making it very refreshing and easy to drink. I'd love to have this one more often. One of my favorites at the festival.","seaoflament","Mar 19, 2009"
4.67,8.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall as solid as could be. This was insanely well put together and easily that most sour beer i have come across in months, if not years. Not to be messed with, you need to seek this one out.","mikesgroove","Jan 02, 2009"
4.58,6.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Another outstanding sour ale from New Belgium. Pours a golden brown with a silky tan head. The nose has tart citrus, sweet apricots and peaches along with subtle hops and farmyard funk. The taste is also quite complex. A superble balanced blend of tart and sweet fruits along with rotting wood, damp soil and again subtle hops. Crisp clean body has a dry finish. Delicious stuff. Pairs well with fine cheese.","rye726","Nov 14, 2008"

4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The taste is pretty tart, though much softer than the Love, which allows a touch more fruit character to come through than was in the aroma. The sourness is much more lactic in focus, but still provides an ample sourness; the acidity accentuates flavors of apricot, strawberry, an incredible sour plum note, tart no make that sour melon and an interesting citrus-vinegar component. This beer is somewhat light bodied, but it does have a certain light-viscous heft to it, though it is still very quaffable; the heft is just enough to be well balanced by the sourness (if that makes sense, the sourness cuts through, yet is tempered at the same time by the body of this brew). Some faint oak flavors towards the finish provide a nice, pepper-like spice / bite. There is some acetic character here, it is light (especially compared to the Love), but really helps to add another dimension to the sourness as well as a bit more balance. This is another phenomenal beer, if not for the Love this would have had a much bigger impact upon me.","Gueuzedude","Apr 03, 2008"
4.5,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Orange gold, with quite a big frothy head for these New Belgium sour beers. Aromas of citus, citirc acid, oak, vanilla, fruit, and berry. Taste is funky and cidery, butmore fruity than the Foedre or the love. get lots of cherry, and maybe some grape. A bit of sunflower seedin the back their too, with a nice hint of leather pulling it together. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth medium. Drinkability remains high. Excellent.","francisweizen","Feb 03, 2008"
4.52,5.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Drinkability: Exceptional. I have a high tolerance for acidic beverages and that certainly helps but I feel that Le Terroir is not particularly harsh despite its boldness. For me it makes for a refreshing and exciting imbibing experience.","DaPeculierDane","Dec 29, 2007"
4.8,11.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"d: Very drinkable, excellent tartness. Like La Folie, but lighter malt and with a more pronounced hop profile. An excellent beer, wish they bottled it. I could drink this all night long.","BradLikesBrew","Sep 06, 2007"
4.1,-4.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Orange and amber hues with a slight beige head. Tart and earthy in smell. Not surprising considering that in French it means the land. The first taste hits the back of the jaw and clinches. If you can make it to the second sip you'll find the tartness mellows out into a flavorful yet complex gathering of a beer. An enjoyable beer that should, in my opinion, be consumed slowly, and drinkability is not applicable, because I would think you'd want only one or two at a sitting. A great beer. Unfortunately, only found at the source in FC. NBB.","johnyeast","Apr 25, 2007"

4.92,14.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Sampled on tap at Monk's Cafe for their New Belgium dinner. What treat this was after waiting to try it for so long. The beer poured a very hazy golden color with an off white head. The nose was a bit hot, maybe high abv but I don't believe the beer has a high abv. There was also a tart barny nose to this as well. The taste is hard to describe. A nice sharp, tart taste with some banana esters and citrus. Very very nice. For lack of a better work, I would compare this to RR Beatification which I happen to love. Although I also love La Folie, I would have to say this was my favorite NB beer of the night.","ggaughan","Mar 19, 2007"
4.2,-2.3,4,4,4,4,5,"Draught today @ Choice City Butcher & Deli. A lovely sour ale. It opens up with an intense sourness then leans towards light hints of caramel and sour apples. Honestly, I didnt perceive much hop character at all, but that is okay. A tremendous brew.","Crosling","Mar 05, 2007"
4.47,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This one is pretty thick in the mouth. The carbonation feels natural and complements the beer well. I was tempted to give this one a 5 on the drinkability. The flavor in this beer is amazing considering the low ABV, but I think the sour would wear on your stomach after a couple of pints. This is a must try if you ever see it. It's the dry hopped version of La Folie, and isn't drastically different.","biking4beer","Mar 05, 2007"
4.82,12.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Had during my recent trip to Denver to see my best friend. Great way to start the trip. Went straight from the airport to Falling Rock Taphouse for a few beers before dinner and when we walked in there was a poster announcing a special tapping of Le Terroir. Had to wait about 30 mins for the tapping which was agonizing as I've wanted to try this for years. The bar was kinda dark and the lightning not ideal so kinda hard to nail the color. It appeared to be an apple ciderish color with an orange tint. It was served in a wine glass and had a small head that settled into a thin film with some lacing. The smell was exceptional. It had an amazing sour smell that makes your mouth water. I've tried several Flanders Red Ales in the past year including it's cousin La Folie and this had the best aroma of them all. The mouthfeel was strong with a great sour aftertaste - not too strong, well balanced. The taste was also amazing. I found La Folie to be a bit on the too sour side (not bad but too sour to be a 5). This with the hopping stayed on the not too sour side. It had a great aftertaste and goes down smoooth. Ended up having a couple before we had to head out. Wish they would bottle this. If they did, I'd have one in my fridge constantly. (4.5, HR, T, Y)","TexIndy","Mar 04, 2007"

4.13,-4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Taste is like La Folie, but not as complex, rich or good. A bit thin, sourness overpowers the sweetness and flavors of the fruits. Does not have the lip-smacking goodness of La Folie. However, this beer is pretty good. Overall, I think this beer is just too sour without having any other comparable qualities.","Mebuzzard","Feb 21, 2007"

4.47,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D- It is strangely good. The first two sips I was kind of worried and wasn't sure I would like this at all. The more I drink of it the more welcoming it becomes. I think I just had to let me taste buds adjust to it. It is one of my first Flanders red (besides Monk's Cafe) and I think I could start to get more into this style. It is very strange how such an offensive beer at first can slowly bring you into it where you just don't want to set it down. Can't wait to try my La Folie.","BlindPig","Jan 01, 2006"
4,-7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly cloudy orangy/pinkish color, some carbonation, no head, and no lacing. The nose is of sour apples, citrus/mandarins, slight yeast, and some hops. The taste is pretty sour/bitter/tangy, but very tasty, it draws you into the brew. The finish is dry. Medium body, well rounded, complex brew. Very drinkable, quite a different brew from NB (never had a La Folie yet). I hear it will not be around much longer, so if you can get over to NB, do it.","Wasatch","Nov 17, 2005"
4.68,8.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"But here's the best part: either in spite of or thanks to its challenging flavor profile, this brew is enchantingly addictive and has an awesome drinkability. Had I not had to leave the bar, I could have easily continued satiating my thirst all day on snifter after snifter of this brew. Hopefully I'll get a chance to sample it again...","benito","Beers"
4.62,7.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Enjoyed at The Festival of Barrel Aged Beer in Chicago. Listed as a Flanders Red, it was described as, " Belgian amber ale aged in wine barrels w/ resident bacteria, then dry-hopped with Amarillo hops." If it sounds good, you can imagine how it tasted. The color is a rust - peach color with a haze. Good head retention that settled to a film over the alcohol and barrel aging. Aromas are of sour cherries, cider, a tart merlot, molassas, musky and complex. The flavors reaffirm the aromas. Throw in a touch of cocoa, raspberries, cranberries, nutty, and woody. Aged for richness and boldness keeps the beer from becoming overly sour or tart. Never astringent or off-putting. The texture is shy of creamy. Thinning from alcohol, low carbonation, and tartness. Lighty vineous in the bitter finish. The amerillo hops really help balance the sweet.","BEERchitect","0"
