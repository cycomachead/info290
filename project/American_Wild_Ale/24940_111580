Flavor is very bright and tart. A mixture of various unripe fruits. White wine, lemons, acidity, apricots. Finishes with some oak. The flavor lingers and lingers, leaving tart, bright fruits. A nicely concocted sour brew with a fresh, pale fruity flavor. Memorable.","VelvetExtract","Mar 22, 2015"

The body has some very enjoyable floral notes with a lot of apricots and cherries. There is quite a bit of carbonation and acidity, but it is not overbearing. What I enjoy most about this beer is its earthiness and the fact that everything tastes so fresh particularly the apricots and cherries. I would say that the bottle version can be hazier than on tap and although it probably looks better on tap, it ages very well with more noticeable barrel qualities over time.","blockdude","Feb 16, 2015"

Lots of lacing, residue left behind on the sides of the glass. Very good retention, kinda odd for a sour. Lots of fruit in the aroma. Particularly big on apricot. From what I remember from trying loquats, that's also fairly strong. Cherries are a bit in the background, though definitely noticeable. Mild wine. Some oak. A bit of cheesiness. Could use some cleaning up but it's a step in the right direction for Almanac. Mild lactic note. Taste is medium sour. Lots of underripe apricot. Some oak dryness. Still fairly messy with a moderate amount of bile flavor - I really don't know exactly what the flavor is, but it bothers me in a number of American sours. Some pale malt character lingers in the background. Medium-light feel. Somewhat effervescent. Good sour. Near the top of Almanac's releases for me. If they could just clean up whatever causes that bile-ish taste, I'd be a much bigger fan.","popery","Apr 20, 2014"

Not sweet fruit, but the kinda fruit aroma you get when you walk through a field of trees or plants that grow fruit. Tart aromas with a hint of chardonnay. More chardonnay as the beer warms a bit. Taste is very tart up front. Loquats, lemons, and apricots provide a lovely fruity balance. The cherries are very difficult to find in the flavor. This one is pretty sour. A good amount of wine barrel...I'm assuming chardonnay barrels were uses. The fruit and sourness mesh so well with this one. Has a slight wheat flavor to it. Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Somewhat puckering. Drinkability is extremely high. Overall, this beer is outstanding. To me, it drinks like a berliner. Perfect for a hot, summer day. You could tell me the ABV was 4.0%, and I would believe it. A lovely, dry, sour ale with a lot of stone fruit flavor.","DovaliHops","Mar 07, 2014"

Had it back to back with the sourdough ale and this one prevailed victorious by a long shot in my opinion. Thanks Almanac for this awesome beer. It was similar to Anderson Valley's Rosy Barl to me. Next up, the bourbon sour porter. Should be great!","wakeuptothesun","Feb 01, 2014"
