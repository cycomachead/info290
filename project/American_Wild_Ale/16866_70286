If this is your type of thing then I would suggest getting a bottle because for what it is it does a very good job.  If you don't care for this style don't expect this beer to change your mind.  Overall pretty good, great even just not for me.  Also hab11 just reminded me thus was aged in Oak barrels.  I got no barrel presence whatsoever.  No oak tannins from which this beer could have greatly benefitted.  Not for me but maybe for you.","ThreeLions","Mar 30, 2015"

Simplicity, subtlety and elegance are characteristics this beer brings to the table better than any stout and almost any sour ale I've ever tasted.  Truly a boundary breaker and a testament to demonstrate where craft beer can go.","bnes09","Mar 26, 2015"

Appearance is dark opaque brown with a finger of tan head that settles to a collar and leaves sporadic, spotty lacing. Aroma is sour cherries, roasted malt, oak, and chocolate. Taste is sour cherries and dark fruit, surrounded by roasted malt and chocolate sweetness, and a drying oak and grape finish. Medium body, slightly creamy texture, average-plus carbonation which is good for the style and weight of this beer, and a puckering, tannic, drying finish.","SierraFlight","Mar 02, 2015"

Whatever it is, I think people are overrating this beer a little bit just because it's their way of trying to compensate for the price they paid for this beer. It's a great beer, but the price is just too high for me to seek it out again. Where are the stout characteristics? They're basically nowhere to be found. I was intrigued by the idea of a sour stout, but this doesn't taste like one at all. It's a very good beer I'd probably recommend to others to at least try, but again, the price makes it too high to make it worth returning to -- at least for the next few years. And whenever I do get it again, I'll be aging it a couple years or so to see how it turns out.","Alextricity","Nov 20, 2014"

More fruity sour than vinegar sour, is refreshing, sour-green apple, good amount of large bubbles, making for a light and refreshing beer, I like the paradox.

Not for someone who doesn't like sours or barrel aged beers(20$-35$ 750ml)they offer a beer, Mélange 1, that is a similar beer but with bigger stout character. I prefer this because its so damn tart its like bourbon but sour. Just so full bodied and original, no style to even describe this masterpiece of a beer.","FutureMan91","Oct 18, 2014"

Where Funky Metal does a great job of contrasting the roasted stout flavors of coffee and chocolate against the sourness of that beer, ToD does not have such complexity and just doesn't measure up.  It's a good sour beer but definitely not the best and somewhat pricey for what you get.","ELS","Oct 17, 2014"

Taste is tart; however, there's a dark malt profile, but it is really just in the background. There's also a salty quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body and slightly puckering. Overall, an interesting beer, but it needs an identity - it falls somewhere between a dark sour and sour stout.","Jwale73","Jun 25, 2014"

Smell is very alluring, draws you in with a sour hint and then slaps you once you've put it in your mouth. Makes my mouth water... I've had others from the same brewer and they are all good, but the Stout is by far my favorite.","Ed2","Apr 08, 2014"

The beer is dark brown in appearance with a fizzy head that disappears immediately. Plenty of carbonation bubbles are left sticking to the side of the glass. The smell is vinegary with hints of grape and cherry. After a bit of a sweet fruit taste at the front of the tongue, the taste explodes with potent sourness. It finishes with a bready yeast taste to balance it out. Mouthfeel is medium to watery.","itsscience","Mar 17, 2014"

4.13,-2.1,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,"finally! I have been after this one for a long time, what a rare treat, a sour stout, not too many of these on the market. its got a velvety textured almost black pour, without a ton of visible carbonation, but just under an inch of fairly robust tannish head. the nose is sour, I mean real sour, as sour as anything ive smelled, save maybe their motherfunker. the sour trumps the blackness of the stout, and the chocolate malt, roasted barley, and barrel are all sort of muted behind the acidity and lactic funk of the nose here. the taste is a little more in balance, and it starts off dark and roasty as expected. I get subtle sweetness, spice, and more complex grain, but before I have time to contemplate any of that, it transforms instantly into a sour bomb, not overly acidic like some bruery sours, but softly feeling brutally sour, if you can imagine such a sensation. the huge body of this beer and its really dark malty earthiness keep the sour in check just long enough to form a really intriguing flavor profile. it is truly different, like nothing else ive had. the stout itself reminds me a lot of darkness, with some cherry and other fruit in the finish. the sour here plays on those fruit notes and carries it away. great idea, brilliantly executed. the bruery has a real knack for doing that, which is why I will always come up with the money to try their new stuff, especially the sours and wilds. this is a treasure.","StonedTrippin","Dec 20, 2013"

The head leaves small tendrils of lacing. In body, the beer is almost visible to the eye, but is just dark enough that no light shows through. The body appears free of particles. On the nose, this beer is certainly tart and funky. Nice cherry fruit-leather scents waft over the nose with touches of cocoa, raisins, dates, and plums. Touches of horse blanket and sweet sweat can occasionally be smelled, and as the beer warms the cocoa become a touch richer and adds light vanilla and oak to the mix. In the mouth, the beer is puckering in its acidity with bright malic acid and other acids singing on the tongue. Touches of sweetness appear in the front of the taste alongside the rich and funky fruit flavors, but this is dried out in the finish. Touches of tannic bitters can be sensed, and grow stronger as the beer warms giving a nice, herbal bitterness to the very back of the senses. There is even a touch of funky salinity in this beer. In flavor, the beer begins as sharp green apple and cherry leather with mingling plum and raisin, as the beer warms the mouth is met with a big rush of tannic oak and soft vanilla, alongside sweeter cherries with just a brushing of brown sugar and cocoa. The finish seems quick but actually lasts for quite a while with slightly astringent oak, tart cherries, and soft roast malt. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a puckering and sharp mouthfeel that softens as the beer warms. Carbonation is middling in this beer with a touch of sharpness, as well. The beer finishes feeling smooth and almost velvety. The mouth is left dry and puckering. Overall, it’s a touch too tart, but then again, it’s called the Tart of Darkness. I want a little more in terms of stout qualities, but I have gotten that from other bottles of Tart of Darkness. The funk is rich and awesome in this beer, and the complexity of the beer is deep, bringing new flavors as the beer warms. I love the use of oak in this beer, and like the rich funk and tartness. Personally, I would want to turn the funk up and the tartness down, but that is not what this beer is about. This bottle is totally worth its cost. Try it.","Maxwell","Nov 10, 2013"

4.38,3.8,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a deep black with a very thin ring of tan head. It certainly looks like a stout. Scents of apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar and red wine, with slight roast malt. The nose is certainly sour, not quite a RIS in scent. This carries over into the flavor. It's apple cider vinegar, sour funk, red wine and grapeskin, without many other flavors. It tastes quite sour and vinous, with none of the flavors I expected in a RIS. It's not bad, an excellent sour for sure, but less of a RIS. It was quite nice for what it was, indeed it was excellent. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying mouthfeel. It feels like both a stout and a sour, quite nice. Overall this is a good combination of a sour and a RIS, though the sour overwhelms much of the stout qualities. I'd recommend it if you like sours, but if you want a stout look elsewhere.","Auraan","Nov 08, 2013"
3.93,-6.9,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,"Tried this one at the tasting room. Pours a dark brown to black with some ruby around the edges and a light khaki head. Aroma is sweet and sour chocolates, strangely enough, and some light vinegar that I get from the sour beers. Flavor follows with a lightly chocolates sour flavor, rather easy on the taste buds. It finishes with chocolate on the way down, but leaves a tinge of sour lingering on the to hue. Medium bodied. Very unique and they somehow made this work nicely. Would like to have this one again.","BMMillsy","Nov 08, 2013"

Served in a tulip, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that fizzled away quickly. Not much lacing, either. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like tart cherries, dark fruit, roasted malt, and some vinegar. It tastes like tart cherries, dark fruit, vinegar, lemon peel, vinegar, and some roasted malt and blackberries. It's more of a sour brew than a stout, not that I'm complaining. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with low/moderate carbonation. I think it's a pretty good brew, I might have to pick up another bottle soon. $18.99 a bottle.

Overpriced and under delivered.  I think this beer was done as a sour mash and not with bacteria and wood aged.  I think this would have been a crazy awesome beer had it been done like a traditional sour in wood barrels, but the layers of flavor and complexity are missing for me. ","taylor714914","Sep 11, 2013"

Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, massive tart, acidic, wood, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, massive tart, liquorices, wood, and subtle funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. So they put ‘tart’ in the name, how tart can it really be? HOLY CHRIST! I should have visited my dentist after having this one to have my enamel checked, because I’m pretty sure I had NONE left after the first sip. While being really tart it did still manage to hang on to some other smaller aspects to help try to balance this one out. Unfortunately it just fell a little short. Definitely worth your time trying if you LOVE sours, but don’t unleash this on your unsuspecting friends unless you want a good laugh or are just plain cruel.","thagr81us","Aug 30, 2013"

And man oh man is it sour. Like face squisingly tart. Tart and crisp as pretty much any other sour I've had. Funky fermented smell, lemon, apples and the taste follows almost exactly. The only downside is that it leaves your mouth feeling gritty and weird. Lots of carbonation. Not much of the stout comes through, some mild malts if you really look for it. The sour overpowers pretty much everything else, but not in a bad way. Very good.","Samuel906","Aug 09, 2013"

Incredible aromas with great complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with moderate barrel presence, and a touch of roasted notes; with great strength. Taste of huge sour cherry, cranberry, tart green apple, red grape, pear, clove, oak, light cocoa, light roast, toast, red wine vinegar, leather, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Big fruity acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart dark and light fruits, clove, oak, hay, leather, light cocoa, light roast, toast, red wine vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and fruity, earthy, and acidic yeast flavors with a fair amount of roasted presence; with a very nice puckering acidity and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a highly acidic, lightly slick, and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is excellent. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible sour ale! All around fantastic complexity and balance of flavors with big sourness; and very smooth to sip on, even with the big acidity. This was hardly representing a stout in malt backbone(no idea on age); but damn was this insane as a sour in general.","superspak","Jun 18, 2013"

I feel this sourness completely overpowers the rest of the beer's flavor profile that is seen (largely) upfront on the palate. The sourness does not entirely dominate every other aspect of this beer but it is certainly the leading aspect of it. The sourness still has many flavors underneath it, of some oak, chocolate, and red grapes, but it upstages the malt body. In conclusion, I would have liked to have seen the sourness turned down a tad; with that being said, I have held on to this bottle for about 6 months so I'm not sure if this would be any less sour when its 'fresh'.","TallSaint","Jun 02, 2013"

There wasn't much lacing on this brew either. The smell of packed with sour notes, there is some oak in there as well. The aroma of some dark fruits come out but are quickly overwhelmed by the strength of the sourness. The taste is exactly what the label says, it's tart with a bit of the dark malts in there to balance it out a little. The mouthfeel is dry, tart and a bit thinner than I expected.

The aroma was a of sour fruits, mostly red berries such a cherries, cranberries and perhaps pomegranate. In the initial taste is where this beer earns some serious points. Like a jolt of electricity, one immediately notices the tart cherries. Other fruits can be detected such as pomegranate and tart cranberries. The creamy vanilla backbone that comes from the oak aging rounds the ale out nicely. It prevents the ale from becoming a sour bomb. The sour fruit continues to tickle the throat in the aftertaste. There is also a slight warming sensation which seems unusual for a 5.6%ABV. The stickiness of the mouthfeel and modest level of carbonation allows aftertaste to linger nicely. This may be the best member of The Bruery line that one can find on store shelves.","JohnnyHopps","Beers"

4.46,5.7,4,4.25,4.75,4,4.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was a tossup between the aroma and the taste, with the latter winning by a hair. From the time you crack the bottle you get this insanely complex, deep, dark, and wild aroma filling your nostrils. The “darkness” does get a bit lost here, and if you closed your eyes while whiffing you would be surprised at the beer’s color when you opened them. The taste, however, rectifies this gap. While the funk takes up a large, and continuing, portion of the sip, it leaves enough room for not only the depth and roast of the malts to shine though, but the barrel aging (spent Black Tuesday barrels) as well. The amazing thing is you can actually taste the similarities in the wood, with all that inherent dirt, graphite, and muskiness, without the intense boozy heat all soaked into Black Tuesday. This is a fantastic blend of styles and is extremely well executed. As a warning, the level of tartness and pucker here are quite high, and if you aren’t a big fan of the style, expect to be shocked.","TheBrewo","May 14, 2013"

Craziness, but it works very well, overall. Although the roasted malts poke through a bit more in the finish as the ale warms up, I do wish that they poked through the myriad of sour and barrel complexities a bit more assertively. I'd highly recommend this beer to any sour fan in a heart beat. I couldn't ask for a more interesting beer to drink for my 50th review.","flayedandskinned","May 04, 2013"

Poured it with some Sunday brunch with the wife, and wasn't sure what to expect from my first "sour stout." It came out dark, but not black hole dark, more like used motor oil through the light. The light fizz went away very quickly. I didn't notice anything having to do with it being a stout with either smell or taste until it was about an hour in the glass, when some room temp warmth finally brought out the faint smell of a stout. Otherwise, it was all sour cherries, with a start of tart, with tart in the middle, and then a strong finish of tartness. It's wicked sour, but it cleans up nicely and doesn't leave any sort of lingering aftertaste. Overall, it's damn good, but at a pretty pricey purchase level.","yankeepride","Apr 20, 2013"

Very tart, vinous aroma, cherries, sour apple, touches of oak and wood, with possibly some sweet malt but I didn't pick them up in the smell. Taste is more of the same in terms of strong tart fruits like cherry, sour apple, maybe dark/black druits, as it is a very tart beer, but a great balance from oak and wood lets it be a little fuller-bodied, almost creamy one could say, and while still a dry, crisp finish (and this is a slow sipper, mind you) it isn't overly tart or bitter. Little touchs of roasted malts and/or dark chocolate sweetness seem to creep in as well and make the difference between just a sour beer/ale and a combo of sour and stout.

I knew I'd regret not picking it up. Tart of Darkness pours out a dark brown color with a tiny head. The aroma is absolutely awesome. It's got a strong tart cherry thing going on, along with oak and a vinegar sourness. The taste, again, is fantastic. It's extremely tart straight from the get-go, puckeringly so. There's a bit of roast in the background that quickly gets tossed out the window by a very tart lemon juice thing going on. The finish is lingeringly tart and sour. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the drinkability is fantastic.

4.36,3.3,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"An exceptional sour- very nice tart flavors and aromas with some dark slightly sweet flavors giving the whole thing the same gestalt as a good balsamic. Pours a dark brown, with some decent viscosity and some orange highlights. Not a bad head given the style, but it does fade to nothing after a bit. A little bit of spice complements the tangerine tartness and richer umami flavors. Quite well done and very drinkable. I was tempted to blend some with the Stone Vertical Epic 12 for a Christmas trifle effect. A very good beer.","Georgiabeer","Jan 17, 2013"

4.42,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours deep black/brown with a brown bubbly head that fizzes away quickly leaving just a ring. Nose is sour black cherries, red grapes, tart green apples, plums, a bit of roastiness and just a slight hint of chocolate. There may also be just the slightest notes of oak in the back. The nose is tart but not in your face. The tartness of the flavor, however, is a punch in your tongue's face. Acidic without burning, cherries, plums, some berries (black and maybe raspberries too), pears, apples, some lemon and a hint of lime in the aftertaste. The roasted malts and other stout characteristics are there but hardly. All the tart, wild flavors are balanced ever so slightly by a lingering roastiness, but its not there nearly as much as you'd think for a stout. There's also a so subtle bit of oak but again you kind of have to search for it. I love sours, so I love this but I want to find a sour stout with a bit more "stout" to it. This and Jolly Pumpkin's Madrugada Obscura are very similar in that the sour qualities dominate excessively. Still an excellent brew though.","DonDirkA","Oct 28, 2012"

It pours a deep black-sienna, nearly completely opaque, topped by a fleeting half-finger of tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa powder, vinegar, tart berries, light roasted malts, and a touch of maple syrup way in the back. The taste leads with the vinegar, rolls seamlessly into some tart berries and fruits (lots o' lemon on the back-end), then, just when you think this is just some sour, some roast and cocoa soften things up a bit before a haymaker of slightly metallic tartness finishes things off. Animality! The body is a straight medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.

The oak wood... doesn't register in the smell until after the glass has warmed up somewhat, but when it does, the resulting combination in the aroma is quite wonderful to smell. Flavor is unfortunately about 85/15 between sourness and stout, which is not as close to the nose's proportions as I had hoped. The bright and puckery sour acidic cherry / oak wood blast masks out the great majority of the roasted flavor, and I am left with a soured ale that uses a whisper of roast as a garnish. Don't get me wrong, it works, but a bit more "darkness" on the tongue would have been appreciated.","WastingFreetime","Sep 12, 2012"

It also lacks the sourness that Capt Lawrence Barrel Select Black has which is just crazy sour mixed with lightly roasted malts.

Wow, this is a sour beer, I thought this would be easy, yet the sour is pumped up. I get a lot of lactic feeling with some berry, blackberry, roast malt, cocco, tootie roll etc. While sour, it's not an integrated sour that leads to a satisfying finish. I get battery acid on the tounge with tartness, small relief from the small stout base. Body is a step up from light. Eye opening.

The nose has a little bit of roast to it, and a little bit of earthy funk, but it's very much dominated by a sharp, almost fruity tartness. The flavor profile opens with some contributions from the base stout with some chocolate and lightly roasty notes. The brett and bugs did their work well on this beer, as there is again a light bit of funk and a whole lot of acidity. It's not the most tart beer I've had from The Bruery, but it's damn close. A bit of oak and some smooth bourbon come in for the finish. The body has a little bit more heft than your typical wild ale, but less than you'd expect for a stout, and the in between nature of it does a good job of supporting the malty base beer while allowing plenty of room for the wild characteristics. The carbonation leans a little bit towards the low end of the spectrum. I got six bottles of Tart of Darkness through the Reserve Society this year, and initially planned on offering a couple bottles for trade or to friends. After cracking my first one though, I may just have to keep them all for myself.","axeman9182","Aug 04, 2012"

Aromas of roasted malt and sour cherries combine in a pretty incredible nose. Taste opens witha blast of tart cherry acidity. Wow! This is exquisitly tart! Initial pucker gives way to a complex malt profile that features notes of roasted malt, coffee and vanilla. The finish is tart, dry and acetic. A prickly level of carbonation contributes to a lighter body, making the beer extremely drinkable. I really like this offering from The Bruery. Tart, tasty and refreshing. Hopefully they will add this brew to their regular rotation. Highly recommended.","Sideswipe","Oct 26, 2011"

Smells of tart cherries, raspberries and lemons mostly. Faint hints oak, vanilla, caramel and brown sugar, but this one is all about the tart. Taste is heavy on the lemons up front, a bit of cherry and apricot midway through then a slightly chalky taste near the finish. Bone dry sour patch kids kind of finish. Tart and chalky mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation, medium body. Besides the color I would never have guessed this was a stout as it retains almost none of its attributes. That said this is damn fine sour beer, lots of tart fruit and mouth puckering going on with this one.","johnnnniee","Oct 02, 2011"

Aroma yields no stout characteristics, but plenty of woody sourness. Mouthfeel is quite thin. No roastiness, no coffee, chocolate, or any of the other flavors I associate with stouts. Much more in line with a sour Flanders, similar to a La Folie. All in all, this beer is quite like a Flanders brown or red ale. Comparing this to its closest counterpart, Jolly Pumpkin Madrugada Obscura, this falls short in that it has zero stout characters. All of that being said, it is a glorious light bodied sour, puckering and mouth drying, and quite delicious.","Onibubba","Sep 29, 2011"

While the flavors are metered, impressing in their restraint, the textural qualities carry some wow factor. While it is surprisingly full-bodied for a beer of very ordinary strength, not to mention for a sour, things go awry as the acidity is allowed to build to uncomfortable levels at the back of the throat. Misdemeanors aside, this beer represents an interesting collision of wood and sourness in an approachable package. Advice to Placentia's Bruers-in-residence: put Humulus Lager in six-packs, then do the same to this beer.","beagle75","Sep 28, 2011"

Not nearly as much coffee or chocolate as I was expecting. Much more sour than I was expecting, which is always a good thing. Finishes with some funky cherry/raspberry flavors. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a puckering finish. Drinkability is HIGH!

If you closed your eyes, you would have a hard time telling me that this was a stout that was soured. Pretty strong flavors of tart cherry. Acidic and highly carbonated. Dry and light in body.

Loads of sour fruit, like pomegranate, lemon, bacteria funk. A hint of roast peeks its head out, but if you close your eyes, you would think this is a blonde sour. The flavor is great, lots of acid and a decent body. Again, the only reason to even call this a stout is the color and malts, the flavor lends itself to a very bright sour style. Awesome taste. Mouthfeel is nice up front, but the finish is a little thin and leaves some harsh acid as the beer warms. They are right on the bottle, 56-60 degrees and this beer shines, room temp and it loses a lot of its desireable character. Definitely one worth trying and I hope to score some more for the basement.","Tripphop","Aug 21, 2011"

Huge smell of tartness, perhaps raspberries or just straight yeast, but there is a fruit like character to it, chocolate and caramel, vanilla and hints of wood and with some kinda weird dark fruitiness that seems to accentuate the tart flavor. Flavor was huge, after the assault of chocolate dipped raspberries and cherry, a ton of roasted malts, lots of caramel and lactose were really strong on this.. Very sugary and full.

It looks like a stout and that is about it. If you are a fan of sours you will appreciate this beer.","DarthKostrizer","Jul 26, 2011"
4.33,2.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: This was super interesting, I definitely recommend trying it. There are tastier stouts out there, but this one is very unique and complex. Very glad to have tried this and big applause to the bruery for such a bizarre and fascinating beer. If you love to ponder a beer and defuse it, look forward to some hours spent on this.","Klym","Jul 24, 2011"
4.37,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"O: I wasn't ready for a beer like this, but I also assumed it was possible. This was a very challenging drink in terms of palate exploration. First off, you have very strong associations with specific beer styles that seem to converge in this beer. On one end you have a flanders oude bruin, and on the other you have a stout. In this beer, you get imperial stout flavors in a flanders oude brown sensory experience. Not only is it quite literally that, but new flavors emerge in the simultaneous experience of both styles. Blueberries emerge between tart sweetness and coffee roastiness. Blackberries creep up behind the drying up flavors of the blueberries. This is new and exciting for me. Such discipline in maintaining the integrity of two totally different styles, yet deconstructing them in a way that it becomes possible to combine them. I applaud this effort loudly, and I think The Bruery's craft is second to none in the American Beer movement. They are at the top with a select few other breweries, and this beer is yet another piece of compelling evidence in the assertion of that fact.","Cavery","Beers"
5,18.5,5,5,5,5,5,"My boy Nevins came through with this bottle. We both agreed if you close your eyes you'd think this was a Cantillon. Some sort of blend between a stout and a Geuze. A black Geuze. Simply amazing. Not alot of barnyard funk in the nose as this is pretty young still but tons of sour. How did they do it? I'd say a bit more body than say Cantillon Geuze and a very faint (toffee) sweetness is hiding way in the corners. Wish I had more of this bad boy for the beer cellar.","grotonmarketguy","0"
3.9,-7.6,4,4,4.5,3,3,"Narrative: Walter Chambers wasn’t the best pharmacy technician. He wasn’t the best mortician either. Somehow it was his relentless work ethic that kept him powering through both occupations day in and day out. After a solid 3 hours of sleep, he would saunter in, smelling of formaldehyde, dark circles under his eyes. “Yeah, car…car problems and…so did we get that Abilify shipment come in?” His dark wrinkled suit had strange stringent notes that wafted through the CVS pharmacy. “WALTER!” He snapped out of a brief nap and realized that he could see his breath in the ice cold body preparation room. “Walter, I told you to prep the gauze wrap and you go off for a sno-” Walter slipped back into blackness.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jul 06, 2011"

4.3,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Even though I do detect some slight roast notes, personally I'm categorizing this as a Wild Ale. A very unusual damn tasty one.","IKR","Jun 29, 2011"

4.88,15.6,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Opening my first bottle of Bruery's Tart of Darkness I wasn't sure what I was going to think but I love all things sour and all things Bruery so I had to load up. This is amazing. It pours a dark, deep brown with a finger of head which quickly dissipates. The aroma is of sourness, almost vinegary. This is a truly sessionable stout, not huge like a certain other Bruery stout but if you love sours you would be able to drink this all night long. There is so much sourness going on that I don't get much else. There is some malt that is noticeable but this is largely about the sour. This is an amazing beer. I'm going to have to go back for whatever the Provisions store will let me buy.","aknight","Jun 22, 2011"

4.2,-0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O - Very good beer. Not the best that I have had, but definitely worth a buy. Adding the American Wild Ale funk in with the traditional stout tastes could take some acquiring to, but I personally liked the meld.","ajcobb24","0"
