Age and a batch from a different year may have made all the difference but it has a more pink grapefruit like color. The nose was sweet, sour and tart citrus fruit but there was more of a minerally acidic aroma. The flavor was more earthy, minerally and orangier than Sour in the Rye. It felt about the same. Very good beer but I liked the Sour a bit better.","KYGunner","Jul 26, 2014"

Beautiful aroma of sour vinegar, tropical fruit, and the light spice I get from the regular SitR. Flavor follows with light sourness that is sweetened up by the semisweet and tart kumquats, clean crisp finish with a lingering fruity flavor left on the palate. My wife, not being a fan of most beers, actually even really enjoyed this one. The fruit balances the sour perfectly here and creates a new beer that retains the beautiful sour flare that I love in the regular version. A little more heft than the regular version, creamy yet crisp, sweet and tart, with medium plus carbonation. I would have this one again and again.","BMMillsy","May 16, 2014"

The nose is potent, with distinct kumquat upfront (spicy, super citrusy) a little caramel sweetness, slightly sour and some funk. The taste is definitely similar to SitR, less sweet, more mature and citrusy, but has a lingering citrus that's far more potent than the regular. It's light-medium bodied, citrusy, sour and dry, acidic, slightly undercarbonated, and definitely drinkable. Tried this side by side with the regular, definitely dig the kumquat citrus addition.","ThePorterSorter","Mar 01, 2014"

Aroma of kumquats, apricot, citrus, acetic acid and lacto, with some yeasty funk. Lots of tartness/sourness in the taste, citrus mainly, acetic, more of the yeasty funk that was noted in the aroma, sour toasted grains. I never bothered trying the original version of the beer, so I really have no basis of comparison between the two. Medium body, a bit rough in the mouthfeel with a slightly metallic aftertaste.

How odd the brain works sometimes, amiright? Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy sunset ruby-amber topped by a short finger of cream foam. The nose comprises apple vinegar, cherry-flavored ShockTarts, light balsa, mild toffee, light sour plum, and a wash of sour citrus juices (potentially including the kumquat, but I have no earthly idea what that smells or tastes like, so...). The taste brings in more of the same, plenty of vinegar and straight sourness mixing with the fruit and an undercurrent of toffee-imbued sweetness that serves mostly to buoy and support the sour rather than combat it. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky-ish finish. Overall, a damn fine bit of sour, and, brother, does it ever bring the sour! Still, it's not overwhelming, but rather delicious and complex, not unlike Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge with a sharper acidity and highe3r fruitiness. Good times, indeed.","TMoney2591","Sep 23, 2013"

The kumquats don't really hit the taste until the finish and they leave a sour and slightly bitter citrus flavor, less like kumquat flesh and more like the skin and oily residue of the fruit itself. I don't think The Bruery could have picked a better fruit to add to Sour in the Rye than kumquats. Fantastic stuff.","notchucknorris","Aug 10, 2013"

It is very drinkable, with moderate alcohol level, and the taste of fresh kumquats is just amazing for a bottled beer. One might say it is so fresh fruit dominant, that it doesn't really taste like a beer. I don't consider that a problem. It is not a fruit lambic and should not be compared to one. I'd suggest you drink this one quite fresh to retain the citrus outburst.","Beerenauslese","Jul 11, 2013"
