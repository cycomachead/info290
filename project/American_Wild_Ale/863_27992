Aroma is basement must, citrus, especially lemon, tart sour grapes, vinegar, wood, and leather. Taste is a puckering sourness with citrus and vinegar notes, followed by some mellowing wood bitterness and earthy elements. A touch of citrus sweetness. Light-plus body, surprisingly creamy/thick but not overly so, just enough to coat the tongue, lively carbonation, long sour finish.","SierraFlight","Mar 01, 2015"

What I get after that initial pucker is fresh citrus, earthiness, and a smooth vanilla oak aftertaste. This is one of the most flavorful beers I've ever had. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly. The natural fermentation yields a perfect feel. Overall I'm really impressed with this beer and I'm not a huge fan of sours. This is one of the best I've ever had.","mattsdenney","Jul 14, 2014"

Tastes like the sour candies of your childhood. So complex and tart and the body on it is great. Just enough to hold up the acidity. Right up there with the most sour beers I’ve ever had and definitely one of the best I’ve had.","jbaker67","Jun 19, 2014"

Aroma of Chardonnay, white grapes, lemon zest, funk, tropical fruit and nicely forbodes the level of tartness the taste has in store. The first sip has the salivary glands contracting and it's so tart initially it is almost bad but it's just enough to be perfect. As you get used to it the flavors pop with lemon, white wine, fruits, Chardonnay and Granny Smith sour apples. Oak is light. It's only knock for me is it lacks a little complexity likely because it is so tart the other flavors are lost. Crisp, light body with the sourness drying you out quite a bit. Another great sour from RR. Lives up to the hype and beyond.","kylehay2004","May 08, 2014"

Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Aroma is nice tart lemon, yeast funk, some pleasant citrus-like sweetness, light vinegar (very light on that note), apricots, lots of lacto acidity. Flavor is a nicely balanced sweet and sour lemon, lots of lactic tartness, dry oak, dry dusty Geuze-like qualities yet a nice sweet citrus character to balance. Some wine like qualities with Sauvignon blanc type of acidity. Light bodied with high carbonation and a crisp finish. This is really nice, but I can’t ever see paying $18 for a small bottle myself. Differentiating sour beers is tough I guess. With that said no doubt I would drink this again. Yum.","BMMillsy","Mar 09, 2014"

This is not an easy beer to make, and to produce something that is so complex and yet so brightly textured and balanced when working with wild bacterial strains is nothing short of magic. For those who have had any doubt on the direction that wild beers are taking in America, try this one and be astonished. This is by far the leader of many beautiful things to come. I hope to get a bottle soon and compare some notes, and see how this changes over time.","magictacosinus","Mar 07, 2014"

Beatification has a deep lemon juiciness that is incredible. It is followed by a well-balanced pucker that doesn't have you reaching for the Tums. The finish is nice and astringent, which is the perfect lead in to the the next sip. Up there with Supplication as the best from Russian River.","jjdc","Mar 04, 2014"

In contrast to the 19 month old Beat b5, this one is a lot more complex and slightly less sour. More lemon, citrus, oak, white pepper in the nose as well as on the palate. Acidity is still there, at 7/10 while b5 was more of a 9/10. Just enough to make this incredibly mouthpuckering but without overcoming all the different complexities in the flavour. Highly recommend drinking fresh within a year for the full bouquet of flavours to enjoy.","Stevedore","Feb 15, 2014"

The smell is complex. There is some tartness/acid scent but very funky to my nose. I get more funk than anything. Like preserved lemons maybe. The taste is sour on the front end but bright in the tartness. This tastes like a lemon sour patch kid to me. The sour is balanced so well and doesn't finish acetic. You get a bit of the wood and the sourness really smoothes out as this warms. I really enjoy lemons, so this beer really hits the spot. It's just this side of sour to not be completely thirst quenching, which is good because it's not like anybody has a big enough stash to throw back a few of these. Probably as balanced and as well made as any sour I've had. Slightly ahead of Cantillon Gueuze for me in terms of bright lemony lambic.","PHBoiler","Jan 27, 2014"

Not a lot of funk to this one, just straight-up bracing sourness. I expected more funkiness due to the brett and the almost 2-year old bottle. I think the sourness just obliterates anything else. I actually prefer this sort of sour. It's quite tasty and refreshing but drinkability does suffer due to the extreme sourness.

It finishes leaving you wanting more and more and more. Impossible to drink quickly because after the first sip you know you have come across something special. This is my current favorite beer, if you have a chance to taste any of the Russian River sours try this one first, it will blow your mind.","Lakemonster","Jan 11, 2013"

The smell is strong as hell, lots of powerful sour notes on top of some subtle vinegar. Very acidic aromas. The taste follows the nose. I nearly had tears in my eyes from how sour this was. The flavors of violent oak aging with Brett and vinegar all come together in this beer. The mouthfeel is light bodied, nicely carbonated and leaves me with a salavating pucker after each sip. Overall this is probably one of the most sour things I've ever had. It's brutal and not something I would ever drink a lot of. Still it fits the style and is sure to please anyone who seeks these type of beers.","Knapp85","Jan 09, 2013"

Very wild and expressive. Taste is citrusy tart, but not very dry. It reminds me of a lemon pie with candied zests. Lemon is puckering but sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Slight musty feel. It sure ain't a perfect beer but it taste goddamn good. It feels almost like a pure lambic and is definitly one step ahead from the regular american wild.

Flavor is so full and complex and overwhelmingly sour, somewhat to it's detriment. I think I enjoy a well blended sour like Temptation to unblended. I enjoy the wild fermentation process to get these amazingly complex beers but the sourness somewhat detracts from what it is your drinking. Flavor is like strong lemon mixed with touches of green apple like the nose suggests but extremely sour, not much funk, it's a nice and fresh sour. Mouthfeel is great, low carbonation probably helps with the high acidity in this beer.

4.39,-3.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Beatification pours a crystal clear golden yellow. There's maybe a finger's worth of white foam crowning the beer, and it disappears quickly and quietly. The nose has a good bit of acidity to it. It's very citric, with some bright lemon poking through. There's also a good bit of funk, some earthiness and also pineapple/tropical fruits. The flavor follows suit, displaying the full potential of wild yeast/bacteria. The tartness is perfect, bold and attention grabbing without turning the beer into vinegar. A brief flash of lemon opens the beer nicely, before a tiny bit of oak and some earthy and fruity funk come in and fill the mid palate. The acidity comes back in for a lingering finish. The body is just a little bit full, and the carbonation a little bit lifeless, and combined they're enough to make mouthfeel just feel... off. Despite one or two minor quibbles, Beatification is a fantastic sour beer. It's managed to not only live up to all the community generated hype, but all the anticipation I had for it personally after getting to try only an ounce or two at a tasting a few years ago. I'm glad I have a couple more bottles tucked away in the cellar.","axeman9182","Jul 23, 2012"

It actually resembles a Gueuze in a lot of ways. Smell- sour green apples, citrus, earthy funk! I get some eastern asia tropical fruits (like a star fruit)- very tart aroma. Also, some vinegar aroma. So many things in common with a good gueuze. Taste- oh my god, puckering sour. Its the sour you get from biting right into a green apple (unripened) and gnawing on the skin. There is a sugary tartness on my teeth. Also, I get some sour patch kids sourness too. Definite vinegar present on the end, it works well with the sourness, not a detractor at all.

It comes off somewhere between a wild and a gueuze. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and coats your mouth very nicely. Overall, this is really a fantastic American wild that may come closest to the Belgian style it's modeled after of any American beer I've had.

Notes of lactic acid pair with candied tangerine, tart cherries, waves of oak, and a touch of lemon zest. The taste is quite a journey starting with candied fruits, mainly citrus. A bit of oak and funk comes through next as things quickly head towards the intensely sour side of the spectrum. The finish leaves a lingering tartness on the tongue which leaves you hanging for the next sip. The mouthfeel is effevescent and the body is light. Overall, this is not only a very approachable sour with great balance, but it is damn tastey and well rounded. The hype train surrounds this one for a reason.

Scent is funky with nice lemon aromas. There is also a bit of sweat aroma in the nose as well. Lovely wild yeast scents and citrus with just the right amount of funk. Taste is very oaky at first with intense lemon and sharp, bitter funk from the wild yeast. A bit of cheese as well. Nice blend of lemon, funk, and sour. Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. Puckering. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is the first time I've had this beer, and RR has yet to disappoint.

On the palate, it’s a bit overcarbonated, exploding into bubbles that make the brew hard to taste. Same in the flavor, though: lilac, honey, caramel, pear. Compared to later Beatifications, this is lighter, more delicate, sweeter and more floral, with none of the aggressive tartness of the others. I like how different it is.

Mild tannins and the lactic acid really brings to mind unripened stone fruit (yellow freestone peaches, nectarines). The funk level is tempered by the sourness, but grass, and straw are quite prominent. Mildly cheesy as well. Drying on the finish with lingering lactic acid, some oak tannins (that lend a chewiness), this beer is crisply carbonated. Highly sour, this is pretty excellent 4.5/4.5/4/4.5/4.5","DefenCorps","Nov 18, 2011"

After having so many good beers (read BA Cuir, Zwanze 2011, Lou Pepe Kriek, 007, PvW Eclipse, BA Decedance, and Blåbær) this was the stand out. While 007 was somewhat “similar”, it was more balanced. This was just a in your face mouth puckering sour. I was hoping I would hate this so I didn’t have to try and find more, but alas, that was not the case. One of my favorite beers. I can’t wait to get more of this. Thanks again so much to Alex for sharing this.","SpdKilz","Oct 19, 2011"

4.79,5,3.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Batch 2. The brew pours a hazy yellow hue and is topped with some wispy bubbles; just enough head to demonstrate liveliness. The nose is, whew, musky and hugely atomized. It is getting into my sinuses like Vernors ginger ale does (strange observation, I know...) Anyhow, the aroma is musky and lemon-zesty and just very pert all-around. The taste is just absolutely fantastic; it is the sourest a thing can be without crossing the line into a flagrant level. Notes of lemon, green apple, wet wood, overripe peaches (or maybe underripe?), wet dog, Warhead candy and a small amount of tart white grape reveal tremendous complexity within the sourness. The feel is pert for the most part, but it has an amazingly clean finish. Having had Batch 2 and 3, I must say I prefer 2. It is far more sour, disparately flavored and heavily nuanced; whereas I recollect 3 to be far more harmonious, juicy and less tart. Overall, one of the better American Wilds I've ever had.","ktrillionaire","Sep 03, 2011"
5,9.6,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer pours out a beautiful hazy blonde with hints of amber. The head is almost nonexistent with a thin ring around the edges. The smell puts off a big oaky character, with hints of funky fruit...hinting toward apricot. The main thing I get out of this is a big dry oaky tingle. The citrus acidity on the backside to this beer is incredible, the back of my tongue and cheeks are pulled so tight. This is what I'll expect from a "sour" from now on. The finish on this beer lasts forever, I can't believe how incredible this beer is.

I have been lucky as of late to knock out quite a few of my brews needed for my Russian River -tion Quest and this one is NO exception! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, sour, tart, funk, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was nothing short of excellent in all aspects! This one was a standout from the tasting that night for just about all of the participants. The flavor on this one was otherworldly sour and definitely brought the duck-face HARD! Even from the aroma you would get a partial duck-face going. Definitely well rounded in flavor though as the fruit and woodiness added a nice touch to keep your palate guessing rather than just drop-kicking it with sour and tart notes. Really really well done... Hope to try some older batches in the future for comparison (hint hint traders...)","thagr81us","Jun 28, 2011"

Tasting a Lambic style beer known to be fermented and conditioned with yeast and bacteria native to a region other than the Senne valley that is so complex and delicious is inspiring. The impact of this beer is an illustration that although a true Lambic cannot be produced elsewhere, a complex, balanced, and truly interesting top shelf product can be made in other regions, and shows the true potential of the American Wild movement. I believe that an increased interest in this beer could be a key contributor to the increased legitimacy of beer as a gourmet product.

Slightly metallic, citric, very acidic, funky barnyard, how many ways can I say sour. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Overall, this is a great American Wild.

Wow. The taste is SOUR. The most sour beer I've ever had - the sourness hurts my epiglottis, puckers my posterior pharynx, makes my face warm, and causes me to tear up. The drinkability on this beer is almost zero, but the taste and smell of it is so unique that this beer truly does live up to the hype. This is the best beer I've had tonight thus far.

Don't get my wrong, there's a time and a place for some stinky cheese aroma - it's just nice to find a great complex nose that satisfies without it. I'm mostly getting some musty straw-like components, wet wood and bretty earthiness in the funk department, which is just awesome contrasting with the brighter grapefruit and meyer lemon acidic qualities. The taste is just as delicious as the aroma prefaced, boasting sharp lactic sourness, all of the great lemony and grapefruit brightening up the palate with low-medium bodied with lively, yet subtle carbonation aiding in the long dry, earthy, mineral finish. Not as tongue-numbingly sour as batch 2, but still packs a punch. One of the best American sour beers. Always a pleasure to drink.","Ineedabeerhere","Sep 12, 2010"

4.45,-2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"75cl bottle shared by photomike. Just another animal entirely from the rest of the Russian River family. The sourest beer that I have ever had, but somehow remained smooth and drinkable. I'm not even sure that I understand. Ever since hearing Vinnie describe how they were brewing this beer while we were at the brewery for RBSG this past summer, I've been dying to try it. This truly is a Sonambic. The funk, the acidity, the wood. So intense from start to finish. The pour is a relatively unassuming hazy yellow with a small fine head that leaves patchy lace behind. The aroma is where things get interesting. It's just the funkiest, sourest, most oaky thing to ever hit my nostrils. Straight oaked lemon juice with brett. The flavor is super dry, super sour, with yoghurt and lemons coming through, and quite oaky, though relatively clean tasting as well, without the the sharper cheesy funk flavors found in some Belgian lambics. Light bodied with acid coasting the tongue. I had burned my tongue the day before on some tea, and Beatification started to bring back the hurt with all that acid. Pain for pleasure. Honestly, this borders on too acidic, and I have a very high threshold for sour. Though it is very well blended and smooth overall for how acidic it is. This might not have been the most pleasurable beer of the tasting, but it was the most heavy of an impact. Lacks the depth of Supplication, but the awesome sourness is unrivaled. Killer shit.","bulletrain76","Dec 06, 2009"

The taste is mouth puckering sour and dry with lots of tart fruits especially lemon and sour orange. Hints of horse blanket and tobacco round it out.

Unripe lemons, barnyard and hay, funky bugs and yeast, grassy very dry aroma. Thinking I'm in for quite the ride here. Ok this beer is a little crazy if you ask me. It is just over the top sour. Pungent brutal sourness. Usually your tastebuds get used to the sour after the first initial sips, but this beer just keeps shocking me everytime I take a sip. With out a doubt the most brazenly sour beer I have ever had. Ballsy. I dig it. Lemon rind, green apple, wheat grass, hay, dust. Remember sour candy like warheads or cry babies? This beer is like an adult version of that. Excellent acidity. It reminds me of the most sour thing I've ever had, which were these little weird fruits called calamondins that grew on a tree in my grandma's backyard in Florida. I used to eat them all the time as a little fellow. They are like tart, acrid little oranges and they taste like this beer. Really an amazing feat in brewing to get so much flavor into one beer.

It almost looks like an arnold palmer (half lemonade and half iced tea), by that I mean a yellowish tan, but rather light/clear. A potent sour smell up front, mellows a bit to an earthy undertone. This is the sour I have been waiting to try, it is a super crisp lemony sour, with a sweet ting at the end. I must admit, I am a novice when it comes to Wild Ales, with some having that barn/leathery taste that I do not care for. This is thing is a pure crisp sourness, really none of the earthy smell comes through in the taste. Obviously, very tart in your mouth, and as you drink it will hit the back of tongue hard too.

4.02,-11.8,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"The beer is golden orange colored and a little hazy with a very thin head. You know it's gonna be sour from the first sniff, acidic and "lambicy". The taste is intense lemon juice and funk, so acidic and tasty it's hard to differentiate from the wicked lambics I've had in Brussels and Brugge. Very dry aftertaste, and alum pucker that lasts and is reborn with each lick of the lips. This is the most sour wild ale I could imagine, very similar to my memory of Apfelwein in Frankfurt but with carbonation. Apfelwein is German apple cider and can be very sour (especially the Saurer Most version).","TurdFurgison","Mar 08, 2009"

The head crackles away almost instantly in a champagne-like fashion. The nose is rather acetic with a surprising amount of sour fruit character (strawberries came to mind). Very Rodenbach-like, minus any sweetness. It's similar on the tongue, with much more acetic acid than the other batches, very Flemish, very sour and puckering. Big tropical fruit flavors. Crisp dry mouthfeel, light-bodied, highly carbonated. Nearly a perfect sour in my opinion.

Still, the extreme acidity makes it a very slow sipper and not something I want more then one bottle of in an sitting. Ever since I heard about their plans to make a 'sonambic', I knew I had to get my hands on some. While it's undoubtedly awesome, it's prohibitively expensive, which is really a shame, as it mean I'll have to really hoard my reaming bottles for special occasions, like another Christmas!

Kind of like apple cider or some other cider. I actually do not have much experience with wild ales, but I really dig this. Some that I've smelled are a bit off-putting, but this one really smells good. The taste is really great. You could sort of describe it as sweet-tarts or pixie sticks. Also, there's a bit of a white wine kind of taste, white grapes and barrels. But there's a rush of sourness that is well-balanced with sweetness. There is a bit of a tart finish, but some brett beers are too tart. This one is just perfect. You get a good rush of carbonation along with the taste. I could really sip on this beer for hours and hours. The flavor is great, and the sourness will force you not to drink at a rate that will let the alcohol catch up to you.","taylorhamrick","Dec 25, 2008"

Taste is intense, sweet and sour beginning when it kicks you in the tonge, more of a sweet wine, I get a lot of dry riesling character, fresh floral and honey notes, then the funky acidic character hits, like toasted lemons, vinegar, wood, very nice herbal sour finish, perfectly balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied, silky smooth, low carbonation, goes down insane easy for a sour.

Funk is prominent as well. Feel is medium bodied a somewhat syrupy. Carbonation is good, and a nice dry finish. A sipper but surprisingly easy to drink, really. Alcohol is subdued and doesn't carry much of a punch. Overall drinkability is quite high. I was worried that this would just be a sour bomb, but the flavor was really nice and complex.

4.67,2.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Decided to crack open a bottle of Beatification, batch 002 for my 900th review. Pours straw colored, slightly hazy, and with no head. The smell is quite funky with lots of lemon sourness and great barnyard aromas. The taste is super tart up front, followed by a splendid funkiness with loads of horseblanket character as well as a dose of minerality. Ripe soft cheese and lemon on the finish. Smooth, tart, refreshing in the mouth. Delicious and the real deal. I shared a bottle of this with brickstoredave, and his comment was "Wow, an American brewer made this beer?". My thoughts exactly. What an accomplishment and one more reason Russian River is my favorite American brewery.","Georgiabeer","Jun 18, 2008"

Smells of Brett, green apples, lemon zest, cantaloupe, and vinegar. Taste starts out good and tart with plenty of green apples, lemon, and vinegar. Brett funk makes itself known as does notes of vanilla, but it never gets the sourness of some of the other RR Wild Ales, remaining tart and funky. Light in body with good fizzy champagne-like carbonation and lots of tartness and funk.

4.59,0.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Upon the first sip, I realized that the aroma was misleading. It is very sour. The brett did it's job giving it that distinct sourness it loves to provide us with. Once the sourness subdues, there are definitely those fruity notes, giving it very much a wine-like quality. The green apple really shines along with some melon. The finish is sweeter than I expected it to be and lingers on nicely. As it warms the sourness subsides and the fruitiness comes out more, along with hints of bready malts and oak. it's very nice how this one transforms. The mouthfeel is light and with just a little carbonation. Overall, this is one excellent wild ale. Probably the best I've had.","ASymon13","Jun 08, 2008"

Fruity, sour and tart up front, sort of a berry quality, with a vinegar and salt flavour following close behind. Plenty of earthy funk, but not overpowering, plus a nice dose of oak. Puckering by the finish with lingering fruity tartness. Light bodied with lively carbonation, bordering on sharp. Oaky dryness too. Delicious!

4.84,6.1,4,5,5,4,5,"If only I had the same kind of access to the Russian River beers as I do to the Lost Abbey. If even they were even a little further away. A four hour drive. A five hour drive. Each and every one of the Russian River beers had something to fucking say. The Beatification of all had the most intense things to say, just extremely funky and flowery on the nose. When I popped it open it smelled like diapers or something, heavily stank cheese, I screamed, I passed it around, I got stoked. This was the overall champion of the night for me by a long shot, part of a very small (4 people) Russian River tasting. Beatification is a barrel aged and "spontaneously fermented" beer, brewed with wild yeast and then aged in barrels which have been used for both its original purpose and for making other beers that Russian River offers, meaning that it has a whole lot of life in the wood that contributes an insane amount of complex flavor to the beer. This beer has a list of the known yeast and bacteria strains present in the beer, which beyond being geeky is so insane that you can't just love it if you're interested in the science and alchemy of brewing. Poured beautifully from the mini-Champagne like bottle with a cork and cage and it really is like an intense spoiled semi-brute Champagne that could only come from Belgium, except that it's from California. Infected, golden, attractive. Russian River makes the beers that are closest to those from the motherland, with the perfect amount of American screw-all attitude to boot. This is so much like a Gueuze that it's hard to believe it's not, and it's in the same family as the Leelanau and Jolly Pumpkin beers which are so overtly "out there" that you can't help but listen up. Highest, highest respect for this brew, heavy dog compliments.","brewdogmrb","May 08, 2008"

4.37,-4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a foggy toasted gold with a thin half finger white head that quickly dies down to just about nothing. No lacing at all with this one. Swirling the glass leaves some webs, but they quickly fall back down seconds after. Smell is heavy on the funk, go figure! Sour cherries, white grapes, brett, lemongrass, and oak. After a big whiff, the vinegar becomes present, but doesn't overpower any of the other wonderful complex aromas. Taste begins very tart and sour followed by the smooth oak, sweet tangerine and green apples. Aftertaste is a bit dry with sour grapefruit, some honey, and wood characteristics. So much flavor for such a low abv beer. Light to medium body with a stinging carbonation. Beatification is by far the most sour of the RR brews that I've had, maybe too sour? I'd take Supplication and Sanctification over this, but Beatification is still an amazing beer. Hopefully I can get my hands on another bottle so I can throw it in the cellar.

Than a test batch flowing at some god-forsaken beer festival. And finally in it's bottled form, in both the PH1, and 'regular' 001 editions. This beer pours a slightly hazy light golden colour with a large, tight, and compact head of foam that slowly loosend up, expands, and releases the aromas of this magnificent 'neo lambic' creation. This beer has the classic sharp, acidic, traditional lambic aromas that I adore. Balsamic vinegar, cheese, fresh white winter truffles, morbier dipped in lemon juice, etc. A very vinous and lactic sourness is also detectable, moreso in the darker tinged PH1 batch, than the straight 001, I should add. The taste is pungent and acidic with a wonderful fruity wine-like middle that smooths out the 'in-your-face-nature' of this brew and leaves you with a lovely aftertaste on the front and back of your tongue. The mouthfeel is creamy, super smooth, and reminiscent of the Cantillon St. Lamvinus. The drinkability is perfect and this super sour funky american neo lambic is definately one of the most coercive and notion challening brews to ever have passed this BAS' lips.

Aroma is strongest of tart apples that is balanced by a soft sweetness and at times smells of homeade applesauce. Aroma also shows some bready spices that blends with a grapey sweetness, also some black pepper and grassiness as well. A hint of the sweetness and spiced breadiness flashes at the front of the tongue before a good sized appley tartness enters and a lemony sourness follows. The taste finishes with a nice drying of the palette. Mouthfeel is fairly light in body, the tartness keeps it very refreshing, a nice dance of peppery carbonation on the tongue does so as well. The aroma was definitely complex and where its at for me with this beer.

I'm not real experienced with Wild Ales, but this one just tasted awesome. It also had tastes of vinegar and ends up with a dry, sour finish. Lighter side of medium body with a dry finish; carbonation is rather high. This is definately one of the better beers I've had and has changed my mind on what sour beers can be.

The flavor follows suit, with boisterous carbonation holding things together and keeping it exciting. The fuller body keeps it feeling somewhat mellow. For a sour ale, this is very drinkable. Fuller bodied than I expected, starting off with a juicy sweetness reminiscent of peach of mango juice, the pulpy kind, moving into a modestly sour and lactic finish.

The taste is intensely sour and it immediately begins to dry out through the finish leaving only a touch of bitterness. Light hints of apple, lemon and orange fruit present, with a mild woody taste.

The flavor kicks off with some tart fruit and a light sweetness. Funky yeast and notes of wood add a nice depth of complexity. Lingering tart fruitness lingers at the finish. Well carbonated body and quite refreshing. Really drinkable stuff as well, almost too much so. I wish it was a 750ml bottle or bigger. A very unique and delicious beer that I would love to have available all the time.","meathookjones","Aug 17, 2006"

4.83,5.9,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability- Well, I timed this one about perfect. Sat here on an early evening night in Broadview, Montana...nothing but vast farmland as far as the eyes can see. A few antelope over here, a few partridges over there and a cow or two mooing in the background...not to mention the bats starting to fly into the barn and the two hoot-owls going at it. Ahhh, all this in the middle of a thunderstorm. Review #999 and taking a 8 month or so beer respite as of bedtime this Sunday....only have a Dreadnaught in waiting for my last beer in my self imposed beer break due to my wife's pregnancy. This was about the perfect beer today. Great taste, incredibly refreshing due to the higher humidity today. Russian River scores again. Vinnie...thanks for making one of my last brews for a while a memorable one. Extreme highest of recommendation!!","GClarkage","Aug 11, 2006"

4.85,6.4,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"It would be interesting to taste this along side Redemption which is where this started and also with the PH1 to test the subtle differences in each. Vinnie and Natalie hit this one out of the park as they do with so many of their beers. A real winner, too bad there is not much of this out there.","ggaughan","Aug 06, 2006"

4.62,1.3,4,4.5,5,5,4,"While it is not as challenging or complex, I really like it for its aggressive straight forward tartness. The dominant tartness is joined by a touch of malt character, some austere fruit notes and perhaps a wisp of funk. Another characterful brew from what is fast becoming one of my absolute favorite breweries.","Gueuzedude","Jul 11, 2006"

4.57,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"A great beer nonetheless, but Batch 001 takes it over the slightly more expensive ($1 more per 375cl bottle) Batch 001-PH1 for my money.","TheLongBeachBum","Jul 01, 2006"

4.76,4.4,5,4,5,5,5,"I may be in the minority on this, but I preferred the 001 over the PH1. They are both absolutely amazing beers, and I do enjoy sour beers. I just preferred the fact that sourness dissipated on the tongue quicker on the 001 than the PH1, allowing you to pull the other amazing flavors from the beer. I've had a pretty wide selection of Russian River beers, and besides the Pliny's, this has been by far my favorite to come from them. You'd do well to try and get some of these.","Callenak","Jun 26, 2006"
