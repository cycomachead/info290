I certainly don't select beers based on their looks... but you gotta give credit where credit is due... and this beer looks like Christina Ricci in black snake moan.  Raspberries dominate the aroma.  A slight sour kick up front in the taste but then the tartness from the raspberries takes over.  A little bit oakey, acidic, with a touch of fruity sweetness.  It's def a sipper but I think that's the point of most wild ales.  You could tell it was unfiltered and unpasturized as there was lots of remnants left at the bottom of the bottle.

The aroma of raspberry hits you immediately. The taste is initially sour but the tartness of the raspberry quickly overtakes that. It finishes slightly oaky and lightly acidic. It’s almost like a Berliner Weisse w/ raspberry syrup dropped in already. I'm generally not a sour beer fan at all but this brew is good. The vibrant and fruity flavor offsets the sourness very nicely.","joeyfeets","Sep 11, 2014"

The nose is so deeply jammy. I detect very little tartness on the nose and a hint of oak. It smells like straight jam. The taste didn't quite deliver on the nose. The sour level was perfect for me. It's nicely tart like an unripe raspberry. I just don't get the distinct jamminess that was on the nose. The mouthfeel is a little thin and I could use a tad more carbonation. This beer is so light and flavorful that it is an ease to drink alone with only a slight bit of sour stomach after a whole bottle. The raspberry delivers on the finish as this beer warms.","PHBoiler","May 08, 2014"

Pours a raspberry hue with a frothy pink head that dissipates into a cluster of bubbles around one side of the glass. Nose reveals tart raspberries and a faint medicinal quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose, but flavors are a bit more muted and there is also a salty character. Mouthfeel is light and lively with some astringency. A very good beer, but the fruit is too subdued and the salty quality is a bit too assertive.","Jwale73","Apr 05, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense pink head with poor retention, that reduces to a small ring of lacing. Minimal glass lacing and a fair amount streaming carbonation. Great color and clarity. Aromas of huge tart raspberry, raspberry skin, sour cherry, red grape, green apple, oak, clove, pepper, leather, red wine, vinegar, hay, straw, herbal, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with big raspberry presence and great yeast/oak balance; with great strength. Taste of big tart raspberry, raspberry skin, green apple, sour cherry, pear, red grape, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, red wine, musty funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, green apple, red grape, pear, sour cherry, oak, clove, red wine, hay, straw, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic complexity and balance of raspberry, oak, and yeast ester flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane raspberry sour ale! All around fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of raspberry, oak, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. An extremely delicious and well balanced offering.","superspak","Dec 15, 2013"

4.77,4.1,4.75,4.5,5,4.5,4.75,"what more can you ask of a beer. this is quite possibly the best beer ive ever had, certainly the best in recent memory (since my mid august fou foune). drlovemd87 deserves a shout out for bringing this rarity over. lets start with the color, holy goodness, I have never seen a beer so radiantly ruby red in my life, the color of raspberries mashed in a mortar and pestle right after being picked, hints of pink highlight the reds, looks like fresh jam. bright and gorgeous. show me a prettier fruit beer, ive never seen one. small but sturdy white head, not stained pink in the least, impressive and sexy like whipped topping. now the smell. oh oh oh the smell. tart and mouthwatering like raspberry jam, acidic lacto bacterial fermentation notes too, but not overpowering, and no vinegar at all. its funky, but its summery too, and seemingly perfect for fall. the fruit is so fresh I can taste it, the quality shines through here. the taste is even better than the nose, everything I want and nothing I don't. perfect. I never give perfect scores, and I have to here, no place to improve in taste. the berries are forward but not at al sweet, the sour elements are all lined up, pucker and dry, but not burning or angry, just balanced, still supremely drinkable, not too much alcohol, just right. no gimmicks. carbonated like a champagne, it really pops off in my mouth. cant believe how alive and active this is, and how there is not a lick of residual sugar here, its dry and fruity as it finishes. the robustness of the berries and the balanced yet complex sour flavors are the takeaways for me, and that color of course. its like absolutely nothing else out there, and I would kill to have a steady stream of it. never thought I liked fruited beer, so if you are in that boat, this is a life changer. worth every bit of hype, trade value, and praise it has received and then some. it takes a lot to blow me away these days, and jester king has done just that. it is the standard by which all fruit beer, and maybe even all sour beer will no be measured. as close to perfect as they get. wow, just wow. stop at nothing to acquire this, contact me if you've got extras. my appetite is now insatiable","StonedTrippin","Nov 02, 2013"

The berries come through strong and tasty. Not a lot of funk. Mild oak but it might just be overshadowed by the fruit. Taste is a step back from the aroma. The fruit is still the dominant note, but it's not as jammy as I expected from the aroma. Funk is mild again. More oak shows up. Quite dry. It's tasty but there's not much depth.

The more you know... Anyway, this stuff pours a somewhat hazy magenta topped by a finger or so of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises dank raspberries, mild barnyard funk, sour blue raspberry, and a twinge of green apple. The taste brings in more of the same, with the apple now more apple vinegar-like and the overall level of tartness greatly increased. It's bright, it's fruity, it's tart, it's kinda funky, and it works. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine sour raz drink, one whose greatness was only impugned by the fact that it followed other stellar sours in the same night. Still, it was thoroughly enjoyable.","TMoney2591","Sep 26, 2013"

My only regret is that I only have a couple of bottles of this fantastic brew left to last me a year.","HopAG","Jun 27, 2013"

I had this after Cantillon St. Lamnivus and Cantillon Oude Geuze and this blew those out of the water. The execution on this beer is just flawless, I haven't had a beer that incorporated raspberries this well. Cheers to Jester King and thanks to Jeff for sharing 2 bottles of this!","UT-Alex","0"
