A true connoisseur will know that this is indeed what olde england would have enjoyed. Olde English "800" pairs well with traditional Bangers n' Mash, or even a mouthful of dirt with a side of monty python if real english fare is unavailable. This malt liquor is as dry as British humor, and as inviting as an Oxford boarding school. I will definitely be enjoying the 40 maybe eventually sometime in the future.

Olde English 800 has an ABV of 5.9%. This brew has the look and smell of most malt liquors. The smell is sweet, with grains and malts. Nothing special but nothing bad. This brew has a lot carbonation. The taste is smooth and crisp for being a malt liquor. You get a hint of sweetness, but it is not over powering. This brew goes down nice. Mouth feel is nice too, nothing bad about this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.5 out of 5. I will pick this brew up again.","nicholas2121","Apr 14, 2014"

To be honest it is just as good as any IPA that I have consumed because like all beer it is an aquired taste and to much of anything could make you sick, simply put take a high end beer that is highly hopped and take a malt liqour and give it to someone who has never tried any beer before and they would think that both are disquisting!! This is a bang for the buck and works well wheter your on a tight budget or you have a lot of money and besides it is up to you, the drinker to decide what your taste buds like not some amateurs on a website who have no idea what they are talking about.","kadrewparham","Oct 06, 2013"

Served from 40 oz bottle into a shaker for the first glass then consumed straight from the bottle for the rest. Unfortunately there wasn’t as brown paper bag as the gas station didn’t have any to give us. Poured golden yellow with a one and a half off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, corn, sugar, alcohol, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, corn, grain, wheat, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty bad brew. I always joked with my friends about drinking this one at parties to see the look on people’s faces. Well, apparently my best friend remembered this and made it happen. Just so you know this thing is bad. I really wish it would have been higher in ABV so I would at least be so wasted after that I had forgotten that I had drank it. So after all this I’m wondering around the party with no buzz and looking for something else to drink. Luckily there was another 40 oz laying around, so I went with that obviously. But about the beer, not a lot but grain and corn going on here with a hint of sugar. Great for party gifts and hobos under the overpass, but if you have any class at all you will avoid this at all costs.","thagr81us","Sep 21, 2012"

The smell was what made me start to think twice about it. it smelled almost exactly like a skunks ass. I slowly put the bottle to my lips and tipped it back a little. Not bad, I thought, so I took a big swill and swished it around in my mouth a little. It was the best cheap brew I had ever had.

The only plus side to this is that you will get drunker quicker, but lets face it is that all that fun? Anyway when I was in high school I drank these constantly so recently I went back for a test taste. OE comes in a 40 oz bottle with a red and gold label. Beer is piss type yellow with no head. You do not want this beer in your mouth for long. The quicker it is in your throat the better. The only time to drink this is if you only have 2 bucks and you have a party to go to.","beertaster13","Feb 17, 2004"

I poured it into a glass (and half on the floor for my homies). It poured a straw yellow color With a foamy head that had little lasting power. About a minute or so. It had a stench of gross to it. A little bit of a grainy corn smell and a bit of a skunky smell. It was hard to tell which was stronger. The taste was semi bitter with the grainy thing going on again. The skunk was still there too, though not as strong. Even though it's clear that this isn't my favorite beer, I would drink it again. For my biatches.","CBFanWish","Jan 07, 2004"

For example, while the "Brass Monkey" is the most popular variant (OE and orange juice), a co-worker of mine has mentioned the combination of OE and sloe gin. Anyways, this is a cheap beer that only exists only for those who want to get plastered.

1.81,-10.8,2,1,2,2.5,2,"Pours a transparent yellow, apple-juicy color with a vigorous white head that fades quickly (yes, I am actually pouring this into a glass...). Little to no carbonation. Smell is... whew. Big alcohol sting and little else except vague sensation of acidic chemicals, and maybe notes of adjuncty sweetness that's saccharine and foul, like those awful, artificial sugar substitutes (Nutrasweet, Sweet-N-Low). Less alcohol noticeable in the taste, taking a back seat to more artificial sweetness; slightly tart in the back palate but finishing with a twang of plastic (so help me god, plastic). Mouthfeel isn't that bad for a 40. Since this is easy to drink fast when cold, I originally gave drinkability a 2.5... half an hour later, when my gut felt like it had turned into a ball of rock, I changed my mind. This brew has its moments and out of college-day nostalgia (sittin on the curb and swillin out of a paper bag), I tried cutting it some slack on the scores, but still...

Since I'm also buddies with most of the people their, they sold it to me for a toonie, rather surprised I was buying low quality beer. I told them I hadn't tried it, and they accepted that as a good answer. Since this is malt liquor, I drank straight from the bottle. Can't comment much on appearance except for what I could see through the glass. Little browner than a Colt 45. When swished, some foam would appear that would soon quickly disappear. Smelled alot of corn, cheap malt and something acidic. Tasted very grainy and sweet. Hey, is this candy? It is that cloyingly sweet. Shitty mouthfeel. Too much cheap malt texture with a corn field. Drinkable for drunks and whores. Undrinkable for me.","slitherySOB","Jun 01, 2003"

1.03,-49.3,1.5,1,1,1,1,"All 40 ounces preserved in it's classic presentation, Olde E is a legendary beer. Yeah, right this beer is ghetto swill in all it's glory. Made famous by Run DMC in eighties, this beer pours a golden similar to apple juice hue. Pours with a thick foamy head that cloys around the rim of my mug, with a decent head retention. Aroma is straight up unpleasant, all cereal grains with an astringent slightly cooked vegetable scent. From the smell you would think this stuff could take of some layers of paint from the wall. Taste is highly carbonated watery yet acoholic harsh bitter nasty ass taste. Not a slow sipper chug this and bypass the palate, this beer is for getting folded. I really can't tolerate this one but it's a favorite of my friends. So, in closing there is no question this is one shitty beer. Watch out for the hangovers this beer is known to cause, in my opinion steer clear.","WVbeergeek","Apr 29, 2003"

It has a very pale yellow color to it with a white "head". Goes down easy, but can get rough a little. When I'm lookin; to save some money and drink a little, this is what I usually grab for. Sometimes though, 40oz can be a little too much. Definately a good buy if you are in college.","JISurfer","Dec 11, 2002"
2.16,6.4,3,2,2,3,2,""40 ounces to Freedom"... Pours a crystal clear golden body topped by a frothy bright white head that holds surprisingly well and drops to a creamy surface covering. It also leaves some lace in the glass which is quite unusual considering the high alcohol - although I doubt that's rarely noticed inside the 40 oz bottle! The aroma is also surprisingly bold, but with a distinct cereal-cooker aroma and a firm touch of alcohol. There is some grainy maltiness underneath, but it's overshadowed. Powerful, but not really inviting. The body is thin/medium but the high level of fine carbonation helps it to become creamy immediately, thus giving the impression of a fuller mouthfeel. The residual alcohol that's left after the swallow adds to that impression. The flavor mimics the aroma with a harsh, semi-grainy maltiness rather than the more straightforward sweet malt flavor usually found in malt liquors. The alcohol also lends to an astringent character. Hop bitterness is subdued, as is normally the case with malt liquors, except that it's more noteable here. However, it's quite dull and doesn't add anything to the character. From start to finish this beer lacks finesse. Sure it's bold, but it's also extremely blunt. Maybe that's why people like it... in a way I can see how this could be less cloying as it doesn't offer the bright, super sweet maltiness of many malt liquors - but at the same time it's fairly harsh and the trade-off doesn't seem worth it. Disappointing. This beer deserves to be wrapped in a paper bag. There are much better malt liquors on the market. Take a step up to the Coqui 900!","NeroFiddled","Nov 30, 2002"

First taste reveals a carb bite and a semi-sweet very faint corn taste with nothing else.  This is like a near tasteless/odorless semi-high alcohol in a can.
