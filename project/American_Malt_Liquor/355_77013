Thin bodied, palate scrubbing carbonation and unpleasant flavors have led me to decide that this belongs in the reject pile!

Very slight roundness from body but otherwise booze is not detectable, which is to its credit. But then it's like a strong beer without the flavour/complexity so what's the point? Just dangerous, really. Have a lighter beer if you want something easy drinking.","laituegonflable","Jul 12, 2014"
3.47,26.6,2.75,3.75,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinks easy for the ABV, doesn't really taste like a malt liquor to me, too fruity & smooth. Not bad, I'm sure if I drank enough, a fierce hangover could be had... Better than its rating, but having had this in past, I would say this beer probably goes down hill quickly if exposed to UV light or to much heat. If given limited choices, this might work, other wise caveat emptor on this","russpowell","May 31, 2014"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, sugar, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is fairly drinkable and not as offensive as I was expecting it to be.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 05, 2014"

It tasted like a bland, clean export lager, with none of the vegetal off-flavors that usually come with a malt liquor. I guess that's good. Don't feel the need to the try this.

Overall I like this for what it is - Malt liquor...it is simple and does the trick, not great flavor but better than many I have tried and I would drink this again","Slatetank","Oct 23, 2013"
