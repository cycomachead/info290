For $1 and change, you're  getting the equivalent of about 4 "standard abv" beers. Since I don't like anything to go to waste, I will continue drinking (slowly but surely) the rest. It tastes like a carbonated watered-down cheap whiskey to me. If you are a broke college student wanting to get drunk on a budget, this is seriously a steal. I'd actually prefer Icehouse beer over the Camo as far as taste, and I don't even like Icehouse. You get what you pay for.","trombonehero","Jun 19, 2014"

Even if it is cheap. Rot gut and death in a can. The color is a dark Amber/Yellow color. Smell of alcohol and cheap brew.","nicholas2121","Jan 20, 2014"

3.87,88.8,3.5,4,4,3,4,"I don’t quite understand why everyone has such a problem with Camo Silver Ice. I just cracked open a 40 ounce widemouth and am finding it to be quite enjoyable. There’s an aroma reminiscent of grapes that is quite pleasing. The flavor is mildly hoppy and very smooth. I would compare this to a sort of microbrew in the taste department. At 10.6% ABV, you get your money’s worth, which is something I can’t say about many microbrews or common type beers. For the drinker on a budget, I wholeheartedly recommend Camo Silver Ice. Try it...I guarantee that you won’t be disappointed!","shinerod","Nov 14, 2012"

1.88,-8.3,2,1.5,2,2,2,"You always know youre in for an adventure when the beer is available exclusively in 40 oz bottles. This is the cheapest 40 I have ever had at $1.79, but I will say that it is better than most other malt liquors in a 40 oz bottle. Skunky taste, horrible coloring, excess carbonation, the usual. Malt liquor is usually terrible, this is no different.","ronniebruner","Nov 10, 2009"

Aroma mostly cooking apples for some reason..cooking apples and a bit of soap. Actually not as horrific as I expected. Taste again sour cooking apples with some rubbing alcohol. Palte thin yet sticky in an unpleasing way. Overall really not as bad as i expected. If you like cooking apples ( UK) you will tolerate this one. Way better than the awesomely bad Camo Genuine Ale.","Reidrover","Sep 05, 2009"

1.42,-30.7,3,1,1,3,1.5,"It began with a finger of bone-white head but experienced such low retention that it became wisps even before I finished pouring. Color was a lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was fusel, really bitingly so. Phew! Mouthfeel was medium with a hot alcohol burn on the tongue obscuring any flavor. A second swallow evinced a sweet-tartness, like a candy, but not a good one. Finish left me breathless, but not in a good way. Oof.","woodychandler","Mar 01, 2009"

There is not much retention on the head but the lace is very spread out. The smell is piney and little tropical fruit like. Both the taste and the aroma are adjunct. Very malty and sweet a little corn like there is some pine like tones. There is no real aftertaste maybe a little bit of a liquor.","MTNboy","Nov 18, 2008"
1.71,-16.6,3,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Pours light gold color, with a fizzy 1 finger head that dissipated quickly. smelled sweet and like alcohol. tastes like a big fat mcnasty, it tasted like they mixed a cheap beer with cheap tequila. Alcohol was overwhelming. This one did taste better straight from the can however, which still isnt saying much. AVOID, unless you want a cheap buzz. But still if thats what your looking for your better of drinking liquor anyway.","webbcreative","Nov 08, 2008"
1.78,-13.2,2.5,2,1.5,1.5,2,"This man can pours a semi bright golden color with a medium sized bleach white cap that leaves some small amounts of lace. The nose smells of something a bit rotten,with strong notes of fermentation very apparent. I have had Malt liquor offerings that have been offered to the drain as sacrifice and I must say this one is drinkable,but that is about it. This is really not that enjoyable,it tastes like a watered down Chardonnay. Slightly rotten grapes and saw dust makes up the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is thin and watery...there must be a lot of very undiscerning alcoholics waiting to get paid on Friday to keeping this brewery in business...Drinkable once,but never again!","orangemoustache","Sep 25, 2008"

1.28,-37.6,2,1.5,1,1,1.5,"What the heck, why not try another cheapo. Should have known this one would be that bad. Sure, it was only $2.50, but that doesn't matter. It pours a lifeless medium yelow with a white, fizzy, quickly diminishing head. Smells of musty, straw-like, weak grains and a little harsh alcohol. Tastes the same, except with a more pronounced harsh alcohol burn. It has a light body, oily texture and moderate carbonation. No reason to drink this stuff unless your looking for a cheap buzz, which is what I'm sure this swill was created for.","ski271","Apr 22, 2008"
1.03,-49.8,1.5,1,1,1,1,"I saw this at a house party and gave it a try. My mistake. A pale straw color with a white head that is soon gone. Aromas on bitter yeast and moldy dirt.

1.64,-20,1,2,1.5,2,1.5,"The taste is also basically a cheap, musty, sweet white wine with a faint hint of grain in the finish. The alcohol is quite noticeable in the taste but the palate is rather watery, lacking the smooth fullness of something like Steel Reserve.","Offa","May 05, 2007"
2.08,1.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,"I enjoy drinking 40s; however I did not enjoy this particular 40. The appearance is a medium-colored golden/yellow. The smell was not particularily good and after the first sip I could tell why. My god, I had to power through this 40. Usually the bad ones taste better by the end, but even with a decent buzz this 40 kept me on my toes. Tastes very sweet... think of granulated sugar mixed with a little wheat and some water... Thanks, but no thanks Camo, there are much better 40s out there.","kguyty","Apr 14, 2007"
1.76,-14.1,3,2,1.5,2,1.5,"It looks like Camo Silver Ice has squeaked out a win in Malt Likkapalooza VII on the strength of its superior appearance. Again, most will never see the result of the fine craftsmanship that went into the brewing of this high gravity lager. Unless you have a masochistic streak a mile wide, I'd suggest steering clear of either one of these brews.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 10, 2006"

Aroma: Smells of cooked veggies namingly corn and rice sugary sweetness some actual fruity notes in there as well possibly pear, kinda weird. Taste: Consists of sugary corn/rice adjuncts slightly syrupy with a pretty harsh mix of flavors alcohol evident at 9%, wow this stuff is not something one should drink on the regular. When a pour college student needs to get mildly lubricated on limited money supply, there's really no better time to sample cheap ass malt liquors. Mouthfeel: Somewhat syrupy light to medium bodied artificial carbonation. Drinkability: Not something I will be drinking regularly interesting experience.","WVbeergeek","Dec 17, 2005"
1.08,-47.3,1.5,1,1,1.5,1,"Clear pale in color with a moderate head that quickly disappears. Aromas of vegetables, fish, light grains and DMS. Flavor is fairly clean and it tastes like corn.

1.71,-16.6,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,2,"As it goes for the silver ice, original, and genuine ale the Camo Silver Ice would definately be the least vile. The fact that it is ice brewed and slightly more drinkable make it Camo of choice if it Camo is the only choice. It has a sub average appearance, slightly dark with a frothy head. Smell isn't anything special. The taste is that same old horrible sickly sweet taste only not as strong. The mouthfeel is kinda watery. The reduced taste, high alcohol, and ice brewyness increase drinkabilty. Alcohol hits you hard than the original, which is good because of the shitty taste. It is not like I am gonna come back to this unless I have to (maybe this weekend because I am paying off a speeding ticket) ,but for two bucks I was falling all over the place on the way to bed.","nicksta","Jan 17, 2005"
1.7,-17.1,4,1.5,1,3,2,"pours a deep gold, with a two finger head that remains for about 30 seconds. Strong malt aroma. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth for a high gravity lager. However, the taste puts this beer where it belongs, on the bottom shelf.

The coarse white head was huge and left a lot of sticky lace on the glass. Smell was corny with the added aroma of alcohol. Taste was cloying sweetness, corn, and alcohol burn. The taste had a harshness that the regular Camo lacked. In fact, I only finished half of this before the other half hit the kitchen sink!
