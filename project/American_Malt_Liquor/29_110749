Anyways, still not really a beer, the raspberry component completely obliterating any Bud Light [sic] graininess.

3.25,26,,,,,,"I try to rate beers to style.   This is really a malt beverage or alcopop not beer as such.  It's not bad for what it is and makes a nice change from beer.   It pours a purple color with a minimal white head from a ten ounce can.  The smell is sweet and has some raspberry notes.  The flavor is on the sweet side but definitely tastes like raspberry.  It's decent if this is what you are looking for but it doesn't really resemble beer.","Drew966","Sep 15, 2014"

3.23,25.2,,,,,,"Overall (3.23) : I like this "beer". It's actually a margarita in a can, and I think AB needed to market it under a brand name that would sell, so they slapped "Bud Light" on the can and called it good. It's nothing at all like a Bud Light, and pretty much nothing at all like a beer. For what it is, it tastes great - but if Beer Advocate has these things on here, they might as well start adding Smirnoff and Mike's to the list of reviewed products, as this is NOT a beer. I don't quite know how to rate this. I enjoy it, so I guess I'll rate it how I want.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 21, 2014"

2.91,12.8,2.75,3,3,2.75,2.75,"That damn mango version a few days ago gave me a taste for the other flavors, so raspberry it is tonight. This stuff pours a clear fuchsia topped by a minor wisp of transitory dirty-tan bubble foam. The nose comprises sweet raspberry syrup undercut by a few twists of lime. The taste brings in more of the same, the lime juice really only adding a bit of tartness to the proceedings. The body is a light medium, with a fizzy carbonation and a soda-like feel. Overall, not much to say here: it's tasty enough to me, as I like the sweeter, soda-like flavors. It's nothing special, nor truly praise-worthy in any way, but it gets the job done in an alcohol-delivery sense.","TMoney2591","Jul 04, 2014"

The taste has a very strange fake chemical raspberry flavor, with hints of cheap beer trying to come through. Flat, and while prominent flavors, they are bad.

1.26,-51.2,2,1,1,2,1.5,"Once more, I got a loud Crack!, but given that there was going to be 25 (!) fl. oz. of it, the Glug would not be inverted. This must be a joke, right? If CrAN was magenta, then this was definitely raspberry. It fizzed in the glass like soda pop, making a fizzy two-fingered head of deep purple before taking a bow and fading into obscurity. I was left with a glass filled with fizzing, popping liquid, defying me to CANtinue. Nose smelled of artificial raspberry, like kiddie CANdy, which was entirely disappointing. I miss my paternal Grummy and her raspberry bushes, which smelled as fragrant and enticing in the summer as anything that I CAN remember. This smelled like a travesty. Color was a deep purple (SRM = N/A) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was thin, but fizzy, reinforcing the idea of soda pop. The flavor was that same artificial raspberry taste that I garnered from the nose. Better drinking from the chem lab, I suppose, but I may not have been their target audience. I was not going to stoop to adding ice, as I could not see how that would help, but it needed help and in no small way. Man, this was sickeningly sweet and much too close to soda pop for comfort. Finish was sweet, fruity and just not my bag.","woodychandler","Jun 11, 2014"

Aroma reminds me of the flavor of a Warhead sour candy blue raspberry, with default berry notes and some alcoholic medicinal qualities. Even over ice I don't see how it would help this Raz-ber-Rita...wow. The madness has to stop, but I'm sure somebody out there enjoys this type of abuse, different strokes for different folks. Harsh ass fusel alcohol finish amongst the mild salted berry concentrated sugar notes. Headache inducing almost instantly, puts a smile on my face to know that I will never walk down the path of canned Bud Light Lime concoction's lemmings have gone...which has one ultimate outcome a direct path toward a black out drinking session or worse diabetes induced coma (which also leads to a black out in a roundabout way). Mouthfeel makes your acid reflux come out of hibernation and burn your ears for consuming something this putrid, gag reflex inducing carbonated man made liquids combine to form this shit. Overall, I would never guide anybody toward this path of enlightenment, or eternal black out for that matter.","WVbeergeek","Mar 07, 2014"
