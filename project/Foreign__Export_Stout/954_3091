4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/7/2008. Pours hazy fairly pitch black color with brown edges, with a 1 finger dense tan head with goof retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, plum, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt, light licorice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors, light licorice, and yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Baltic porter! All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, licorice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 08, 2013"

4.18,5.6,4,4.75,4,4,4,"On-tap at Oblivion in Orlando. Pours a dark black color with a tan head. The aroma is dark as smokey with licorice and chocolate. The taste is smooth up front and turns very roasty with a lot of smoke with bitter coffee and cocoa flavors in a bitter finish. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. Definitely recommended!","cjgator3","Jun 16, 2013"
3.86,-2.5,4,3.5,4,3.75,4,"At The Birch Bar in Norfolk, they have it on tap. If you like Imperial Stouts drink this. The Licorice is not a overpowering flavor. It sit in the back to darken the brew and strengthen the Imperial presents. Don't know what it taste like from a bottle just draft is alway far mores balanced an reserve than is over carbonated cousin. Enjoy","Tom2Beer",
