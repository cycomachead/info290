In the middle, the big malt sweetness comes forward with a molasses and caramel flavor against a mild bitterness of citric hops and roast.

This stout pours a near black color with a small tan head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is a very pleasant familiar blend of coffee, chocolate, sweet roasted malts, dried fruit, and vanilla. Mouthfeel is a little flat, could definitely use a little more creaminess. The flavor is exactly as the nose foretold but, unfortunately, there is a long lasting metallic aftertaste that spoils what would be a truly outstanding stout. Hard to believe the abv, it is so well hidden. For its cost and availability this could definitely become a go to stout for me...just lose the metal in the finish.","lochef81","Apr 28, 2014"

Still, I know what I want from a strong stout - and Sinha manages to deliver in spades. Big roasted malt flavours, with good balance and well-integrated alcohol is enough to earn this one a solid grade and some repeat purchases from myself. At $2.50 a bottle, Sinha Stout is very affordable, and something that no self-respecting stout fan should skip.","thehyperduck","Apr 08, 2014"

I'm sure a lot of the low reviews are of infected/"off" batches, judging by how different some of the descriptions are.

4.08,4.3,4.5,3.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Pours an extremely dark brown to black. Big rocky persistent tan head. Smell is roasted barley. Not a particularly strong aroma. Great complex malty flavor throughout. Sweetness. Raisins. Chocolate. A little roasted malt bitterness and hops. Medium bodied, maybe a little light bodied for a stout but it suits this beer nicely. Well carbonated. Perhaps the best thing about this beer is how crisp and refreshing it is despite being a big tasty stout. Astonishingly drinkable. Really great stuff.","burnstar","Sep 27, 2013"

I never found this on tap, which I imagine would have been even better, but it ranks second in my experience to a nicely pulled Guinness pint in a pub in Ireland.","migwell","Sep 10, 2013"

Well carbonated, and striking hop presence challenges the sweetness. Warmth follows throughout.","dreamchaser","Sep 05, 2013"

Aromas of coffee, charcoal, bittersweet chocolate, and a hint of molasses. Very balanced aromas of savory and bitter, with highlights of smoke. Flavors of roast and nut on the forward tongue, with a milk chocolate backbone accented by charcoal and smoke. Very smooth flavors that are layered by subtle bitter and camp smoke characteristics. The beer remains smooth and fairly light in mouth, despite the rich and stereotypically heavy flavors. Roasted and smoky aftertaste, with a smooth, slightly dry finish.

It has a good mouthfeel and has good focus of qualities, but lingers in too specific of a range to be considered a classic. Don't let this review fool you, it's a significant achievement from a region of the world that doesn't have a history in this style of beer. It was a Sri Lankan student of mine who recommended this to me and almost concurrently, I discovered it on on my own. Great beer from the south pacific.

Before a gag reflex set in, I rushed to the sink and poured the glass and what remained in the bottle down the sink. I switched to a Sam Adams Winter Lager but that would not enough to cleanse my palate. There's a reason a large bottle of this is only $3.50. Stay away.","pjohnston007","Nov 28, 2012"

Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, caramel, raisin, molasses, apple, light coffee, herbal, and earthiness.

Good balance of roasted flavors with light herbal hoppiness; slight amount of cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a creamy, chalky, and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present on the finish.

Pour yields a dark brown almost black color, with frothy light brown head -- looks like a thick coffee. Two finger head recedes leaving some lacing and a thin layer of head; a bit more than a black a coffee, with a lighter head. Smell is not too overwhelming, not much there. Coffee and oatmeal aromas present, with a hint of licorice. Taste is nice and clean, coffee and oatmeal is persistent, but nothing too over the top. Hints of burnt flavors on the end. It is roasty. Mouthfeel is very clean and smooth, no bite. Feels like coffee roasts with no lingering harshness or bitterness. Overall this is a decent stout. Not my first choice or "go-to" by any means, but something I enjoy. If you like stouts, Lion Stout is something nice and easy to try.","rodlavers","Sep 02, 2012"

3.75,-4.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black color with a nice 2 finger tan, cappuccino colored head that recedes quickly to leave a film across the top of the beer. The aroma is dark bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans and some molasses and brown sugar notes. On the palate this beer shows the 8.8% with a slight warming sensation that plays nicely with the strong flavor profile of the beer. The flavors i get are burnt sugar, molasses, black stale coffee and a hint of cream. Very roast and malty with a surprisingly refreshing dry finish that leaves traces of hop bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is dry, slightly astringent and has a much thinner body than i expected. Overall, this might be a "summer" stout as it is bordering on imperial in my book with this ABV. I used to pass this up all the time in the states but now that I am in a beer wasteland in Switzerland, this made its way into my fridge. Worth a shot.","Augustiner719","Jul 06, 2012"

The smell of the beer is very roasted with a good amount of coffee on the nose. The taste has some really nice roasted flavors in there mixed with chocolate. The mouthfeel is pretty thick feeling.

As it warmed a little and sat and opened up a little some subtle chocolate malt flavor emerged and that was pretty good, not great but good. There's also an odd something extra, kind of like a cola or rum flavor.

Smell consists of a meaty smokiness, bakers chocolate and a standard, run of the mill roasted malt aroma. Taste is fairly similar to the smell, bit of alcohol comes through at first, followed by a smokey, roasty malt presence, with a bit of sweetness and some chocolate flavor towards the end of the sip.

3.48,-11,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours black as night with a big tan-colored head, although it doesn't seem to retain for very long. Moderate lacing. Roasted, malty, typical stout smell, with some sort of distinct, slightly pungent fruit note I can't quite put my finger on - maybe dates? Mild chocolate notes and kind of an earthy character to the bouquet overall. Taste: Full-bodied, thick-ish feeling front end and a heavy-leaning mouthfeel, which all sort of smoothly vanishes over the palate in the middle, transforming into a slightly odd, pungently sweet finish. I think it's in the finish the high ABV kicks in a touch, turning it into a slightly challenging brew - but still not something you'd readily take for an 8% ABV. A sort of dry, roasty aftertaste lingers, but not bitterly so. Lion Stout used to be one of my stout go-tos before I'd tried very many kinds, and this is my first return to it in a year in which I've been trying a lot of stouts. I'm not sure it is holding up as well as I'd hoped. It's got some character and body and an ABV that packs a little bit of punch; but the flavor combination, to me, is not entirely pleasant; the weird-sweet finish in particular puts me off a little bit.

Popping the top I get a burnt malt and cocoa flavor with a black licorice accent. Pours into a chalice, which is the glass at hand, jet black, with a tan micro-bubble thin head. Taste is roasted malts at the start with a big milk stout flavor kicking in, followed by some black licorice, and then a classical sweet milk stout finish. This is a top fuel dragster brew.

Very fragrant with aromas of black currants, blackberries, cocoa powder and mild roast coffee. Amazing smoothness and medium creamy body with a lush mouthfeel. Quite malty to start, with a sweetness similar to sweetened coffee. The 8 percent ABV is deceiving to begin with, but after several sips, the palate warms right up. From middle to end come waves of roasted malt with undertones of dark bitter chocolate and faint espresso bean. Minimal hop bitterness, a little fruity and yeasty toward the end.

Head dissipates fairly quickly, but some lacing on the glass. Looks quite thick. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, and some dark fruit. Flavour has a lot of sweetness to it. Syupy mouthfeel, which works well for the sweetness of this stout. I can't believe this is under $2 for a bottle.

The aroma is cacao nibs, cocoa, coffee and a sharp fruitiness - apricots, strawberries, grapes - that differentiates it from most imperial stouts. The fruit notes come through in the flavor with a refreshing acidity. The beer starts sweet with cocoa and coffee and finishes with acidity and smoke. It's quite easy to drink.

The malts taste a little more like caramel than expected, and the hops add a nice dimension as well.

Deeply roasty with a bit of dark chocolate sweetness, if that passes for sweet for you. Color was ebony black with the light penetration of a black hole. NONE! Zee-roh!

The head is a light brown and very tall so the carbonation must be somewhat high. Head reduced to a lumpy foam then dissipated completely in a short time. Smell is light, not too rich or outstanding. Taste is somewhat light and sweet and not really anything amazing as far as I'm concerned. Not a bad beer but not really what I would look for in a stout. To each their own I suppose.

Some lacing. There's a very deep fruit aroma, like prunes and berries. Roasted notes give the impression of chocolate. Molasses. Alcohol is present in the nose, giving the scent a boozy character. It tastes of semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, plums, and a hint of black coffee. While there is some roasted bitterness lasting well into the finish, this stout leans toward sweet. Alcohol noticeable, but less prominent than in the nose. Balanced. Medium-full bodied with fairly smooth carbonation. Very easy drinking for such a strong beer.

One dimensional, but pleasant. Taste is good, with coffee, roasted malt, and maybe a bit of hops poking through. Dark chocolate is in there too. A hint of phenol and some alcohol as well. Smooth drinking stout, but not extremely robust. A good session beer for sure, and a tremendous value at $3.29 a bomber.","LordAdmNelson","Oct 26, 2009"

The feel was full bodied with decent carbonation. Drinkability was pretty good for an 8.00 ABV. I have read a lot of hype about Lion stout being the best stout out there, so I have to give it a try.

There is a "fig-like" sweetness in the nose as well. There is definitely a silkiness to the nose as well. Robust flavor and a little bit boozy. Some smoke and some hops. I believe I am picking a flavor that is either a spruce or perhaps a spicy peet. Lots of subtle flavors that are tough to separate. Nice structure and body to this beer. The mouthfeel is nice.

This beer packs a lot of flavor but it is not a good enough flavor to justify drinking at 8%.

Nose is of fruitiness at the beginning - some raisin and date notes, bitter chocolate, a touch of vanilla, and very mild hint of alcohol. Taste is much inline with the nose - starts of with some molasses and caramel malts at first and then moves to a bitter chocolate and coffee flavoring and just a touch of smokey flavoring, the end finishes with some fruitiness most detectable is the mild raisin flavoring. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation with a bone dry finish to it. Mouthfeel is very nice...lively but not abrasive, with a medium body and lightly dry finish.

Out of the bottle it was an opaque brown that was a shade or two away from black. The head was huge, three fingers of mocha colored foam that retained excellently and left good lacing. The aroma was very roasted with some cocoa and herbal hops notes. The flavors were a curios experience. At first I got the sweet and creamy malt with lots of chocolate. Then I began to taste hints of tobacco and the resiny and herbal hops. As it warmed the flavors became more nutty with hints of coffee in there too.

Kind of reminds me of a cross between a baltic porter and a sweet stout. Has all the aroma characteristics plus much sweeter yet balanced with a bitterness, dark fruit, madiera, and even - cream. Mouth is fine carbonation and creamy, but with a lingering bitter sweetness. A little boozy. A session beer that'd get ya snockered. Impressive brew.

Mouthfeel was smooth & medium-bodied, with a fizzy carbonation level that livened up the palate, making it take note of the complexities that enveloped it.

I smell malt and chocolate, a tiny bit of roast coffee, and very faintly, some berry. The taste is a lot sweeter than I was expecting, more of a strong porter than stout. It's all malt taste, though. The berry flavor is stronger in the flavor, but it's still mostly coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy, hardly any carbonation there at all, which would explain the lack of head retention.

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours absolutely pitch black with almost two fingers of fairly long lasting light brown head that leaves sporadic lacing. Good aroma, roasted barley which is quickly joined by a pleasant sweetness are dominant but dark fruits and molasses linger in the background, slightly vinous. Taste is initially sweet but then quickly dries out. The dryness is produced by roasted grains, which are ever so slightly burnt. There is some fruitiness here as well as some light molasses that jumps out just after the dryness appears. The fruitiness lingers into the aftertaste, after the dryness has disappeared. In the late aftertaste the roastyness reappears. Not much bitterness to speak of, seems like its more from the roasted grains rather than any hops. Good mouthfeel, medium-heavy body with medium carbonation and a smooth, slightly creamy feel to it. Drinkability is good, alcohol hides its presence quite well. Overall an enjoyable stout that has a good bit of complexity to it. To experience this beer in its full glory I suggest serving this at the higher end of the recommended temperature range, this will bring out the wonderful fruitiness that makes this beer so enjoyable.","mnj21655","Oct 13, 2007"

Despite being leading beer producers India, for instance, have yet to put a decent beer on the market. As things stand it's Sri Lanka that is the beer champion of the region. The market is dominated by two breweries: McCallum and Lion in a pretty much even race. Both of them do a good stout. My Lion Stout poured pitch black with little foam. Smelling of ashes, cold cuts, coffee and some alcohol. The taste was rather sweet and a little bitter with a strong note of alcohol. There were also notes of chocolate, coffee and ashes.

The beer pours an expected rich dark-brown hue, and an unexpected dense, viscous texture. The foamstand rises to an inch and remains firm through the session. Solid aromas of roasted barley, toast, rich coffee, and cocoa swirl around a mild fermented lactose sweet scent. Flavors closely follow those found in the aroma and remain bold and clean without ever waivering. The beer has no single character that rises above the rest, relying on balance and maturity to produce high quality. Full and rich to the mouth, without becomming thick or chewy. Finishes sweet and with a solid roasted barley flavor (not charcoal). It's difficult to find a more solidly brewed Stout, however it's lack of challenging character leaves me wanting more.","BEERchitect","Jul 23, 2007"

Tastes is of slightly fudgy chocolate with toasted round malt notes, after it warms it becomes rather silky. The bitterness is subtle and comes toward the midsection the finish is a sort of dry and wet at the same time with medium mouthfeel.

The flavor takes awhile to fully develop, but I eventually find nice roasted malts, dark fruits (grapes, figs), almonds?, cocoa, coffee, and a light vinous character. On the palate it is quite similar, with additional notes of charred malts, blackberries?, and a faint smokiness on top of a medium to thick, dry body that contributes a powdery yeast feel. Overall an above average stout that is quite drinkable considering its strength.","mmmbeer","Jan 05, 2007"

Black cherry and dried fig aromas mix with a pronounced boozy scent. Fruit aromas lighten up and reveal fresh fig and roasty chocolate aspects. Interesting and complex. Black roasted malt flavor up front, becoming dark booze-soaked cherries and prunes. Dry, astringent alcohol presence in both taste and mouthfeel; chocolate and dark-roasted coffee at the finish. Vinous berry flavors in the aftertaste. Some definitely noticeable alcohol sharpness on the palate -- jarring at first, but then it cedes to a smoother, almost (but not quite) silky slickness. Actually, the alcohol seems to meld pretty well with the other flavors, tying them together with a dry oakiness, all while remaining distinct and apparent. Hmmm; root beer flavors in the burps!(?) In all, Lion Stout makes me think -- if it is at all representative of the style -- that Foreign/Export Stouts are akin to "junior" Russian Imperial Stouts -- sort of a "warm up" to those larger, more over-the-top relations. In any case, very drinkable. Secure recommendation.","orfeu","Nov 07, 2006"

Drying aftertaste with lots of coffee, mild baker's chocolate, and the fruitiness fades quickly. Acrid roast flavor balances fine without need for much hop charcater, good example of style.

A good bitterness sneaks in first on the palate. A very smooth combination of dark roasted and chocolate malts.A good chocolatey sweetness with a smooth almost silky feel like a milk stout. At 8% I didn't find the alcohol overly present or interfering. A good froth sweetens the brew and brings out a nice bittersweet taste from the roasted barley.

Maybe that was just the alcohol content. After I pour, I notice an immense smell of chocolate. Sort of like some kind of chocolate/mocha flavored cappuccino. The taste is very good. Roasted and chocolately up front, with just a little bit of a hop kick towards the end. Finishes smooth. It has a slight warming effect at 8.0%.

Smells of chocolate, sour black malt, toffee and caramel. Coffee roast only with searching. Tastes smooth silky milk chocolate that persists through and dries a touch in the finale. Soured black malt makes it's presence known in diametric oposition to the chocolate. Coffee modifies the sour and a toffee sweet keeps it from ruining the beer entirely. The aftertaste has a bit of alcohol sting rising up the back of the throat. Hop flavor is missing amid the mix of strong dark flavors...perhaps some cottony fuggles. Any hop bitter is buried beneath the sour and alcohol. Mouthfeel is only medium and carbonation is moderate. The overfoaming head hurts this beer's appearance.

It did not disappoint. I must confess that the sheer fact that this is from Sri Lanka, an area not really known for its brewing prowess, earned this beer a few sentimentality points in my book, but it can definitely stand on its own. Pours jet black with a nice khaki tan head. Smell is a touch on the sour side, with some sour cherries present. Taste is slightly sweet up front, with cherries, prunes, unsweetened bakers chocolate and alcohol in the body. Not quite as complex as I imagined but still one of the more interesting stouts I've had. Definitely a departure from your everyday stout.

Excellent aroma of various types of wood, tar, leather, tobacco. Full and rich flavour where the roastiness and hops are perfectly balanced with the velvety sweetness. Extremely drinkable.

A nice dry, roasty, coffee bitterness peeks through, then yields to some residual sweetness in the aftertaste. Drinkability is very smooth, particularly for such a large alcohol.

Barely detectable alcohol subterfuge going on here, you'll notice the punch more in your forebrain later than on your tongue.

Roasty graininess is upfront, strangely enough- it goes somewhat watery mid-palate and finishes with a slight fruitiness, and more dryness from roasted grain and light hopping. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, letting the drinker know this beer is not a domesticated brew. 8.0% ABV is hidden well under the shroud of roasted malts, other than some warming sensations to the esophagus and stomach.

3.96,1.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Virtually jet black. Mountainous, stiff, dogged, light bister head yields lace. Notions of dark chocolate covered prune and singed molasses candy upfront in aroma. Wafts of burnt barley and dark lovibond caramel are secondary. In flavor, incipient is a soft, milky note of light roast coffee mocha. Sharper notes of raisin and bitter chocolate ensue mid palate along with sweeter tones of treacle and burnt brownie. Roasted grain along with moderate hop bitterness fully dry the profile, especially considering the high attenuation. Dangerously, this is almost thirst quenching. Softens again late, with ashen milk chocolate hints yielding to the pleasantly warm, cleanly burnt finish. A well crafted, nearly spot on export stout. Lacks the "beefy" character of US microbrewed stouts of the same alcohol content, but agreeably so in that regard. Dry and satiating. Excellent drinkability. Thanks to Bighuge for this one.","marc77","Jul 28, 2004"

Nose is heavy with toasted grain, sweet like over ripe fruit, hint of coffee, pleasant to sniff; start is rich in roasted grain, quite sweet with the top middling in feel to the palate. Finish is light in carbonation, the hops mild but noticeable, very dry with a sweet and long lasting aftertaste, quite a nice stout.","Gusler","Jul 24, 2004"

Initial taste is caramel, sweet malt, unsweetened dark chocolate and coffee over prune and molassses. Mouthfeel is gentle carbonation, dry astringent esters. Finish is dry, leaving a metallic taste on the tongue. After all the hoopla I was expecting more complexity. No where near the quality of Stone's Imperial Russian Stout.

Taste is smooth at first, but fills the mouth well. Huge malts, caramelly, thick and nearly chewy, very full bodied. Perfect integration, wonderful balance, sweet and tasty, but never too, with a delicate fruitiness, just underneath. The ABV peeks in just a bit, but doesn't mar the enjoyment of what's nearly a perfect stout! Beats the hell out of Guinness, but gets me yearning for an Expedition.

3.63,-7.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark fudge brown, nearly black, thin and firm light brown cap, a slight skim remains once it settles, lacing in thin sheets. Aroma of slight roast, stale raisin, parched prunes, dry cocoa, and anise. Taste is mild with tame roastability and soft chocolate, slight floating sweetness of dry dark fruits, touches of molasses and toffee roast. Doesn't withstand too much in the flavor dept. or in its length, over far to quickly, but it does incur a certain broad range of capable character. Feel is smooth, a bit sweet and tangy, lightly roasted edge, just shy of a medium body mostly, seems to pick up a bit towards the finish where it drys out with some light cocoa. A fairly decent effort; quick stout flavors and a somewhat healthy body, but could be better. I would consider this over a Guinness on nitro-tap I think?","tavernjef","Jun 23, 2004"

I think to myself that this is going to a dense stout. I am right. The aroma is of heavy with cocoa and espresso. The first sip is sweet and smooth, with cocoa and/or dark chocolate up front, followed by more cocoa notes laced with bitter espresso. There's more bitterness mixed with dark rum flavors towards the finish which is long and warming. Nice lacework is left on the sides of my glass as I continue to sip this beer. The carbonaton is a bit high and detracts a bit from the quality of this beer, but overall an excellent, potent stout that is sweet without being too sweet.","marcobrau","Jun 01, 2004"

Great thick coffee and cream head, very rocky and extremely long lasting. Aroma is sweet, like a mocha espresso. Great taste, fairly complex, leaning definitely toward the sweet side of things, to say the least. Some flavors from the coffe family as well, and some roasted malts flavors are notable as well. I think I'm beginning to understand warm weather stouts: thick, sweet and cool, and nowhere near as heavy as cake or the like. Nice, and well worth picking it up.","jackndan","May 26, 2004"

Tastes of big roasted malts that leads to a nice alochol warming, but finish stops pretty quick with no real lingering alcohol you get in most big stouts. Tastes noted include: bitter chocolates, coffee, and fruits. Nice dry finish that makes this a very drinkable stout. Moderate carbonation with nice warming quality to it.

Sweet caramels, light butteriness, malted milk dominates the flavor profile. Finishes similarly, without a hard roast or hop bittering to the second half. Little sense of the 8.0% ABV stated on the bottle. M.J. says this beer is "tarry" -- not to me, and it could use some for balance.

Only problem is that the flavor is withdrawn and doesn't fully show itself. There's also a sourness in the beer that seems like it shouldn't be there. Is that supposed to be the hops? Is it some astringency from the grains. I don't know, but I do know that it mixes with the chocolate and creates an off flavor. Body is medium to weak in thickness.

The mouthfeel was light, a little bit watery, definetely not as thick as some of the stouts I have most enjoyed.

Maybe it's a jelly donut followed with a coffee chaser. In any event, it's good. The mouthfeel is robust and smooth, having a bit of a creaminess to it.

It really is amazing, hell, even Michael Jackson endorses this one, but then again his opinion is just that another opinion. The Lion Stout pours a very dark opaque tone of deep blackish brown with hints of ruby at the edges when held to the light. The head that complements the body is an incredible milk chocolate hue of brown head, and leaves a sturdy even lace down my imperial pint. The aroma is saturated with dark malts especially the chocolate roasts. Very well done, and the flavor of this brew contains the perfect combination of sweet creamy chocolate, full of coffee roasts, and a smooth dryness that mellows the finish so nicely. With the medium light body and the creamy mouthfeel to each sip, this beer is so drinkable that besides the ABV there is no reason why it shouldn't deserve a five.

4.21,7.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"First off, let me say that this stout delivered much more than I was expecting. It's very unique, enjoyable, and highly drinkable. It pours an opaque black body with no visible highlights, topped by a full, very creamy light tan head that holds quite well and leaves really nice, full lace. The aroma is fruity, cocoaish, and mildly chocolatey. The body is medium with a very fine and gentle carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and creamy in the mouth. The taste starts fruity, becomes sweetly chocolatey, and finishes with a light, almost smoky roastiness and lingering softly sweet notes of chocolate and caramel. Very mocha! The dark malts lend a light acidity which accentuates the fruitiness and helps to balance the malt. It never becomes cloying. The well balanced bitterness is subtle, and it relies on the roastiness and light acidity to help balance the sweet malts. Although it's probably not the best beer for a night out with the lads, it makes a great appertif, dessert beer, or nightcap. Well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Oct 23, 2002"

As the brew progresses there is a slightly earthy/smoky taste that emeges as the brew finishes.  There is a nice creamy quality to this beer that makes it nice and smooth and rather drinkable.  I'm not sure if this one deserves the attention that it gets from Michael Jackson but it is a nice stout that makes a great desert brew with its sweetness.","Murph","Sep 15, 2002"
