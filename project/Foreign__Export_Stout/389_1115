4.05,3.6,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"Smooth and well round mouthfeel within its medium to bold body and very lively carbonation, this brew is so drinkable considering its ABV. Yes, the alcohol is so well hidden.","Everydayoff","Mar 29, 2015"

4.17,6.6,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured from a can into a tulip pint. Dark, almost black; fluffy tan head. Smell is sweet roastiness, maybe some coffee notes. Taste is quite sweet, but the slightly charred flavor at the back keeps it from being cloying. Thick and smooth. A pleasant beer.","gory4d","Mar 01, 2015"

4.05,3.6,4.75,4,4,4,4,"The outstanding flavor profile is intense, complex and well balanced.  It begins with a blend of flavors that separate into chocolate, a hint of coffee and very subtle prune.  In the middle, the big malt sweetness comes forward with a molasses and caramel flavor against a mild bitterness of citric hops and roast.  The finish is a slow sweet fade and leaves you with that nice slight alcohol burn at the back of the throat amid an effervescent burst.","tillmac62",
