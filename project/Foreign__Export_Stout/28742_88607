4.29,7.8,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Overall quite nice, lots of dark malts all over the place, roasty and mild char without being acrid or too tannic, nice fluffy feel, light and airy but still big bodied with just a hint of booze, still drinkable and quite tasty. Another winner for Enlightenment, really liking these guys, just wish the Brut special wasn't so expensive so I could try that.","jlindros","Jan 22, 2014"

4.09,2.8,4.25,4,4,4.25,4.25,"O: Huh, a very interesting FES. Heavy on the char, it would be too much but the soft dark fruitiness really mellows it out and integrates well. Definitely a well attenuated beer, little sweetness with a dry finish. Goes down very easily with a smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel.","Dope","Feb 15, 2013"

4.35,9.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"The net result is that this beer keeps bringing you back for another sip. I realize beeradvocate recently rolled out a new rating system, but I'm going to go oldschool on this one: this beer gets a 5.0 for *drinkability*. Even though the flavor is very good but not amazing, it's really, really enjoyable, and the ABV doesn't get in the way at all.","hreb","Jan 05, 2013"
