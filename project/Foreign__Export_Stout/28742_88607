4.29,7.8,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Overall quite nice, lots of dark malts all over the place, roasty and mild char without being acrid or too tannic, nice fluffy feel, light and airy but still big bodied with just a hint of booze, still drinkable and quite tasty. Another winner for Enlightenment, really liking these guys, just wish the Brut special wasn't so expensive so I could try that.","jlindros",
