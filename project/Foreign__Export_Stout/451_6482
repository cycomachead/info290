3.98,2.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby highlighted, dark brown coloring with a light tan, frothy head. The head retnetion is good, and it clings to everything as you drink. Subtle roasted coffee and smokey nose, with a mocha sweetness in the background. The flavors are rich, with a heavier smoke presence supporting the roasted coffee backbone. There are touches of chocolate throughout the palate, as well. Bitter and smokey aftertaste, with a slightly drying, rich finish. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Oct 08, 2012"
3.98,2.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The taste was bold an unassuming with dark malts and smoke but it had more of a Porter-like character. Low bitterness at the end.","puboflyons","Sep 25, 2012"
4.03,3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall: One of the better Stouts I have tried, as I am not big into Stouts in the first place, but I would drink this one again for sure.","Cavanaghty","Sep 25, 2012"

4.12,5.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O: This is one of my favorite Moat beers, and a really nice stout. The roastiness was perfect after a hike, and I imagine even better in the dead of winter. They really nail an excellent balance of bitterness and roastiness for the style. Very drinkable.","FrankLloydMike","Aug 04, 2012"

Taste was a smooth balanced bitter, dark malts, dark chocolate, espresso beans. Light bodied in the mouthfeel - milky and smooth. Overall pretty good.","KTCamm","Jul 16, 2012"

4.08,4.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Deep dark chocolate color, with a small head. They pour these ice cold, and right to the top of the glass, which is hard to complain about, but I would have rather had it slightly warmer, and with a little more head. Very small tan head, not much lace. I tried to let this one warm up, but ultimately poured it down my gullet fast. Very smooth and creamy, ultimately drinkable. Chocolately and slightly bitter. Very dry, which I enjoy. If I wasn't on a N. Conway shopping excursion, I would've guzzled a couple more. Great stout, nothing over the top.","ggilman","Nov 28, 2011"

4.17,7.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours dark and near black with minimal head. Scent is a moderately strong mix of roasted grain mixed with dark chocolate milk and freshly ground espresso. Taste follows scent, solid roast, chocolate and coffee notes, lightly sweet with light notes of dark fruit thrown in. Fuller side of medium bodied smooth but with a bit of grainy and powdery heft. A good drinkable, full flavored stout in a time where many places strive for big.","rfgetz","Jan 03, 2011"
4.35,11.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is a very good version of an American Stout, lots of flavor and viscosity going on without a huge amount of alcohol. Definitely recommended to those who like this style.","arizcards","Dec 08, 2010"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A nice sipper that you cannot go wrong with ordering. I like how the beer transitions from a chocolate portion to a coffee portion. A very solid beer.","tigg924","Oct 12, 2010"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"First imperial pint pours with a 1/2" dark brown head, over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head dwindles at an average pace, with leggy lasting lace. Aroma is sweet dark roasted grains. Taste starts with coffee, chocolate and anise, sweet in the middle, and closes with a light hoppiness. Coffee flavor lingers after the swallow. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is very nice as well. Good brew all around.","ppoitras","Jun 26, 2010"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A decent drinkability with some sticky mouth coating feel but dries a bit and mostly clean for a dark stout.","jlindros","Dec 01, 2009"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I would definitely give this another try if Moat Mountain was more readily available in my area.","DrewKid4","Jan 25, 2009"
3.58,-8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"The mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout, but it's well carbonated and it's pretty drinkable. I would like to revisit this one, but I am not in a hurry.","rpstevens","Oct 05, 2008"

3.98,2.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I'd love to try this on a nitro pour. I always think of foreign export stouts as defined by guinness. This is definitely not guinness but is quite tasty in it's interpretation of the style.","barleywinebrewer","Jun 28, 2005"
3.88,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Guest tap at the Portsmouth Brewery. Served in a pint glass, this was a dark brown, almost black, beer with a thick, sticky tan head. It had a mild roasted malt and coffee aroma, with perhaps a little bit of chocolate. The taste copied the aroma, but there was a nice lingering of the roasted malt. Pleasant beer, would drink it again","lordofthewiens","Dec 09, 2004"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I found this to be very smooth, though an attenuating smoke hits the roof of the mouth, and leaves a trace of chalky character lying around. On the whole though, it stand up well. I found this pour to be more subtle, in some ways, than the one I had previously.","Truh","Oct 30, 2004"
3.75,-3.6,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"It's not bad, very drinkable for the style and even perhaps a stout suitable for hot days. You do need to be ready for this style, however.","ecoboy","Sep 17, 2004"
3.88,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Had on tap at the Barleypub in Dover. I also enjoyed this with a slice of rich chocolate cake, courtesy of fellow BA's PurpleHops and Purplehats, so that made it even better. I normally don't go for stouts, but was intrigued as I'd never even heard of this brewery. Well, they do a good stout, that I can say. My full pint pour was opaque and dark, with some slight ruby highlights. It came topped with a small filmy latte colored head. Aroma was more subtle than expected, my notes tell me that there was some faint cocoa powder. Medium body, fresh tasting, smooth and roasted characteristics were the predominant flavors. I would be interested in trying more from this brewery.","PatandDavid","Oct 13, 2003"

4.09,5.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This stout poured a deep black color with brown foam that settled quickly and left a shiny, mirror-like black surface. The smell was nice and strong: sweet very dark malt, coffee, and a hint of banana (??). The taste was slightly sweet, dark malt and roasted barley with some fruit (banana), coffee, a hint of dark chocolate, and a low, background hop bitterness throughout. The flavor lingered on the tongue nicely. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-full body and low carbonation feel. This was a good stout, but would have been better with a bit more carbonation or perhaps nitrogenation from a nitro tap.","UncleJimbo","Jul 04, 2003"
3.55,-8.7,4,4,3,3.5,4,"Pours with a deep, deep black body with a thin tan head. The aroma is quite pleasant, with some nice coffee and nutty notes. Taste was quite good and smooth, rolling over the tongue with nice smooth maltiness, but it came off as a bit weak on the finish. But very drinkable, and rather pleasant.","kaszeta","Dec 16, 2002"

4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Excellent stout. Dark, well roasted, carmel taste. Went down smooth with a pleasant bitter taste. I enjoyed this beer very much. Not over filling either, did not leave me with that sometimes "bloated" feeling as experienced with other stouts. A gem.","bewareOFpenguin","Beers"
4.01,3.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Great beverage.  The right dry body with roasted malts and hints of chocolate.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","0"
