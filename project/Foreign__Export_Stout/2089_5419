4.46,23.2,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"(Got a few of these in a couple of trades.) Poured an awesome midnight black with fantastic thick head and great lacing. Very nice thick and deep scent, with sweet malts, roasted grains, and a nice bit of earthy hops in the back. Great flavor, with great roasted grains, a nice hint of coffee and chocolate, and a nice earthy hoppiness at the end to mellow it out. It went down great, with little hint of its higher ABV. Looking forward to having another at Halloween.","JamesS","Nov 06, 2010"
3.65,0.8,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Bittersweet dark chocolate tastes, toasted grains, and bready flavors are among the first things that hit my palate before the bitterness associated with dark roasted malts. This brew is very well balanced between the chocolate/coffee, the sweetness, and the slight hint of alcohol in the flavors. The beer has a texture on the thick side of medium-bodied with a smooth and with a smooth and viscous mouthfeel. Drinkability is good.","MrHassellYaHurd","Oct 22, 2010"
4.83,33.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"WOW! Now this is a great stout! Definitely one of the better stouts I have had in a long time! The beer is BLACK! Deep black, thick, almost chewy thick.. pours like molasses, but all of these adjectives I use lovingly! This beer is smooth and heavy, it definitely has some weight behind it and is definitely a new favorite of mine! The only negative thing I can and will say about this brew is that I should have tried it sooner! If you love stouts like me, do not pass this up! This is top notch stuff!","ronniebruner","Oct 15, 2010"
2.99,-17.4,4.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Honestly, I think this is, and many other imperial stouts are, over the top, rejecting flavor in place of abv and "cred." Bring the ABVs down a touch and I bet I would be able to pick out a lot more of the tasty nuances of this brew. But that may just be my anti-high grav self talking.","AlexanderSelby","Oct 02, 2010"
