4.46,23.2,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"(Got a few of these in a couple of trades.) Poured an awesome midnight black with fantastic thick head and great lacing. Very nice thick and deep scent, with sweet malts, roasted grains, and a nice bit of earthy hops in the back. Great flavor, with great roasted grains, a nice hint of coffee and chocolate, and a nice earthy hoppiness at the end to mellow it out. It went down great, with little hint of its higher ABV. Looking forward to having another at Halloween.","JamesS","Feb 09, 2011"
3.65,0.8,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Bittersweet dark chocolate tastes, toasted grains, and bready flavors are among the first things that hit my palate before the bitterness associated with dark roasted malts. This brew is very well balanced between the chocolate/coffee, the sweetness, and the slight hint of alcohol in the flavors. The beer has a texture on the thick side of medium-bodied with a smooth and with a smooth and viscous mouthfeel. Drinkability is good.","MrHassellYaHurd","Feb 08, 2011"
4.83,33.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"WOW! Now this is a great stout! Definitely one of the better stouts I have had in a long time! The beer is BLACK! Deep black, thick, almost chewy thick.. pours like molasses, but all of these adjectives I use lovingly! This beer is smooth and heavy, it definitely has some weight behind it and is definitely a new favorite of mine! The only negative thing I can and will say about this brew is that I should have tried it sooner! If you love stouts like me, do not pass this up! This is top notch stuff!","ronniebruner","Feb 01, 2011"
2.99,-17.4,4.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Honestly, I think this is, and many other imperial stouts are, over the top, rejecting flavor in place of abv and "cred." Bring the ABVs down a touch and I bet I would be able to pick out a lot more of the tasty nuances of this brew. But that may just be my anti-high grav self talking.","AlexanderSelby","Nov 05, 2010"

3.81,5.2,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"There is not much of an aroma coming from this beer, some pretty minor chocolaty undertones and some hints of coffee, but nothing that really catches your attention. It has a very nice subtle chocolaty flavor, not bitter, but not overly sweet. The chocolate and roasty flavors are the most prevalent, pretty much no hops at all. Theres not too much else going on flavor wise and it has a little more carbonation that I prefer in a stout, but its not enough to ruin the smoothness. Overall this is a good beer, nothing exceptional, but definitely a worthy stout.","bens0n","Oct 14, 2010"

More aromatics, a stronger flavor, and more body. It's not a total disaster and is probably worth a try. Go for the single bomber though.","prototypic","May 30, 2010"

Light fruits like some cantaloupe and strawberries are in there and is not very tasty in this style of stout. An acrid bitterness lingers long on the palate and pretty sure it is not from hops. This beer is not one of the better foreign export stouts I have had. I wont have too much trouble finishing the bomber but this is not one I will be purchasing again.","twiggamortis420","Mar 15, 2010"

3.59,-0.8,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Overall a good example of a foreign/export stout. My main complaint is that the aroma just doesn't show much in terms of the roasted grains. Other than a light dusting of roast, I get mostly licorice and a little fruit. Also, the carbonation bites a little, but this is actually considered appropriate for style. Worth trying, but maybe a cut below top of the line.","briman","Jan 28, 2010"
4.09,13,4,5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Very nice smell and the flavors are quite nice; I do wish the body was a bit thicker; the ABV is pretty do-able for a stout (7.75%) so I could get through a couple glasses in a night, but probably not much more than that.","bamadog","Jan 22, 2010"

3.26,-9.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall this was a pretty fair beer. Get ready for some intensity of the roasted character. Overally I'd like it. I think I would have given it a better score if it wasn't for that soury aroma in the nose character. It thows it off and makes you think of soured milk before you drink it. However, once you can get past it, the flavor is very nice.","phillipzayas","Nov 12, 2009"

4.14,14.4,4.5,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black as the dead of night with little lacing and a very dark head; smells faintly like coffee and coffee notes begin in the taste, but there is also a dry dark fruit aftertaste.

3.16,-12.7,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Dark brown head about one finger thick that slowly recedes to nothing. Black hued beer with just a thin ring of brown highlight. Heavy roasted malts give mixed aromas of coffee and chocolate. This mixes with a tart cherry aroma. Starts out with some roasted, tart,ad vinuous fruits. Through the middle to the finish, the roasted malt comes through with an eventual, tart chocolate finish. The only bitterness in this beer is in atouch of alcohol in the palate. thats about it.

Nose is rich thick and chalked full of browny like chocolatey sweetness, which is a lovely experience all its own. As it enters the mouth you get a beer that is smooth and balanced with tones of bitter chocolate, rich burnt malt and well represented mineral based. A nice even sweetness is there throughout the palate helping to complete this very tasty brew. Mouthfeel is creamy and full with a toasty darkness coating the tongue.

I don't know if the wait had any effect on it, but first pour was very heady: A three-finger pour yeilded a thick, cocoa-colored head to the top of the glass. It settled pretty quickly and yielded an amazing smell or roasted chocolate. The brew itself was midnight-black, but not thick. First sip brought a coffee taste and a strong roasted malt flavor. It was definitely not boozy and is smooth on the tongue; very easy to drink. However, the roastiness forces you to slow down an enjoy. Easily shot up to one of my most favorite stouts.","StoutHearted","Dec 20, 2006"

Aromas of chocolate, alcohol, and sugar. The taste was sweet with a bitter bite, but not nearly as smooth or 'together' as other beers within this style. The various flavors like chocolate and expresso didn't really seem to work in synergy. Overall, this beer seems to be going in several different directions without a clear cut profile or aim.

Rather slight aroma-sort of chocolatey/raiseny thing going on but you really have to get your nose right down in it and whiff to get anything. Great roasted and chocolate flavors. Big hunk of roasted malt goodness. Some very well done coffee and espresso like characteristics. A nice, sublte sweetness in the backround which I really like in a stout. Mouthfeel is good-could use a bump in body for my liking. Very, very enjoyable beer. Thank you sir may I have another?","lackenhauser","0"

This is lighter in body and flavor profile then other double stouts. I can't figure out whether that's a good thing since it doesn't have a mouthfeel like syrup or crude, or a bad thing for the same reason. This beer is all roasted malts- coffee, bittersweet chocolate, baker's chocolate, earthy hops, and caramel. I'm always seeing beers from this brewery, but I had never remembered to look it up and see how they score. I took a shot on this one and it payed off, although I would like to see more daring offerings.","goschool","Mar 25, 2006"

I love the death/skulls/Grim Reaper motif since it takes the Stone gargoyle one step further. It's far from a gimmick, though, since these guys brew quality beer after quality beer, no matter the style. The label asks 'Do You Dare?'

Smells of coffee, chocolate, and milkiness - kinda like an oatmeal stout. Same notes on the palate, along with toasty/burnt malts, anise, creaminess, and hops that suggest pine, citrus, and spiciness. It has a medium body with nice carbonation and the alcohol is hidden well. Tastes good but doesn't have enough IBUs (30) to put it in the imperial/double stout in my book, but the milkiness and the higher ABV suggest a beefed up oatmeal or milk stout. However, because of the lower IBUs and ABV (for a double stout), it is an easy drinker and one I may come back to.","mmmbeer","Aug 31, 2005"

It's a little on the thin side in the mouthfeel department, but the level of drinkabilty makes this a great brew to enjoy on a late summer evening.","germaniac","Aug 09, 2005"

It has a rich malt scent that is high in chocolate and roasted malts. It's sweet and creamy with a dry, earthy black patent malt aroma; some warm alcohol notes. The taste is decent. It has a very dry and earthy flavor that goes down slow and finishes sweet with a chocolate aftertaste. It's creamy on the way down, but they overdid the patent malt content. This is way too "black" tasting. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good brew. I wish they would back down on the patent malt and add some more chocolate and crystal malts. The earthiness is too much for me.","WesWes","Apr 22, 2005"

Aroma is heavy on a meaty baking chocolate bittersweetness, with roasted notes, and peaty coffee. Taste starts with unsweetened, rather bland semi-roasted malt. Light roasted bitterness picks up over the minerally, earthy, home-brewy malt. Finish is tannin bitter with residual, acidic baking chocolate malt. Medium bodied, but feels a bit syrupy at times. Not bad, but it's missing something.","alexgash","Oct 15, 2004"

This beer is a bit oily in character. It has a roast flavor that dominates the flavor profile. This beer is mostly easy drinking, it could be better if it had more of a malty body to it.

Topped by a voluminous tan head that lasts a long time and can be brought back up by swirling the glass. The aroma is strong roasted notes and a decent bit of hops. The initial taste is a nice roasted flavor with a decent amount of sweetness. Strong chocolate flavors as well, with a decent amount of hop bitterness on the finish, but then a slightly tart sharpness slips in. The sweetness is enough to make me think this is a milk stout of some sort, but the tartness is wrong. The mouthfeel is also a bit thin and watery. Drinkability is poor due to the odd finish and the unimpressive mouthfeel. Four of us tried this, two thought it was decent and two of us didn't care for it at all.","aaronh","Jun 18, 2003"

Not undrinkable, but I'm not going back for more.","Brent","May 22, 2003"

Medium bodied and fairly dry, this isn't the easiest Stout to drink. Very bitter roasted coffee flavor with an acidic aspect that does not mellow at all throughout the glass. Overall it is unbalanced on the sharp side. The finish is in line with the rest of the experience, being bitter with a little bit of roasty malt. There are many better Stouts out there.","Dogbrick","Apr 26, 2003"

It pours with a small dark tan head that doesn't hang around for long and the aroma is full of chocolate and coffee - very pleasing. The aroma gave me high hopes, but the flavor did not back it up. The taste is very dry and the chocolate and coffee are not highly detectable and it is almost a little sour.

Aroma is roasty, chocolately, malt dominated with a hint of cherry and alcohol. Flavor is more of the same, much what'd you expect from a high-ish ABV stout, but once again, I note a certain tartness in the background which I seem to find in all Bayhawk beers. This tartness fits in better here (or at least is better obscured) than in their porter, but it is still distracting, and has a lightening effect on the body which doesn't seem appropriate. Not a beer I would recommend.","mzwolinski","Mar 24, 2003"

But, the taste was of coffee like the aroma, but, the roasted malts had a slight burnt flavor to it. The burnt flavor was not overpowering, but still took away what great beer this could have been. Well balanced with the sweet/bitterness, but, that burnt taste in the finish was just a slight turnoff.","BeerManDan","Dec 31, 2002"
3.93,8.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"A full, foamy, dark-tan head is raised during the pour. It rest shortly over an opaque black/brown body before dropping to a thin collar that leaves spotty lace. The nose is rich with deep roasted (slightly burnt) malts and an almost vinous fruitiness. The body is medium/light, and a very fine and moderate carbonation lends to an exceptionally soft and smooth mouthfeel. The flavor displays a mildly complex combination of mildly sweet (caramel, dark chocolate), slightly tart, and deeply roasted malt. It finishes quite dry (due in part to its low pH from the dark malts), but not overly bitter, with some residual bittersweet chocolate and a touch of burnt caramel. Enjoyable, but not outstanding. This beer is a bit of an enigma. It resembles a dry stout, and yet it's alcohol content is way too high. It borders on being an Imperial stout, but doesn't offer the body. Regardless, it's interesting and enjoyable; and probably worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Nov 11, 2002"
