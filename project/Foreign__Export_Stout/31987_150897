4.12,0.7,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours black with a gray/tan, tightly packed head around the perimeter. The nose is mainly milk chocolate sweetness with minimal bitterness or coffee. The taste I'd compare more to a porter than a stout - roasty and malty, slight coffee presence and yeast, minimal booze or bitterness. The beer has a medium body, reasonable carbonation, and a very drinkable malty finish. I'm not picking up much from the special coffee beans used to make this beer, which is disappointing. Though it's not mind-blowing, it's still a solid beer.","ThePorterSorter","Saturday at 04:18 PM"

It also helps when this is served at cellar temperature rather than straight out of the fridge- when it's chilled, all you get is the astringent burnt coffee flavour.","Stevedore","0"

A real sipper, as the bourbon character is surprisingly rich, even though this beer is not barrel-aged. Interesting, to say the least.","Tdizzle","Mar 18, 2015"

You get a fairly cheap coffee flavor with some roast from the malt.  Not sure the barrel aged coffee beans added anything.  Perhaps it muted the coffee.","PHBoiler","Mar 14, 2015"

The aroma is dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and maybe a hint of bourbon. The taste is dark chocolate, roasted malts, black coffee and some wood. Nice hint of bourbon with some warming alcohol. Vanilla and nuttiness near the end. Finishes with dark chocolate, coffee and light bourbon notes. Light mouthfeel. The Bourbon soaked coffee beans creates a nice balance between the chocolate, coffee and Bourbon flavors. Overall, fantastic beer.","PicoPapa","Mar 09, 2015"

The barrel aged beans somehow contribute a high pitched astringency, sharp wafts of black marker and burnt matches, and a palate almost cloying in chocolatey sweetness, more black marker/black licorice/and weird phenols. Black House is a pretty solid coffee stout -- I'm surprised that MT has missed on quite a few of their other stouts.","breadwinner","Mar 07, 2015"

Mouth feel is the same as Black House, light and crisp. This is a very solid brew.","amsguitarist","Beers"

Its the beans that are barrel aged, not the brew. You really pick that up on the nose. Very smooth and mellow beer. Definitely worth a try.","riotontheroad","Feb 03, 2015"

3.08,-24.7,4.25,3,3,3,3,"I had high hopes for this beer but it was disappointing.  Looks nice; dark brown with a finger of khaki colored head.  The aroma is really odd; kind of a charcoal or burnt wood chips and something I can't place.  On the taste I get the barrel and then the burnt flavor I got from the smell.  Some mild bitter chocolate and finishes very nutty.  This beer could benefit from some more sweetness and I don't like over sweet stouts but I feel it's needed here.  Don't really get any bourbon either.  Mouthfeel is pretty standard for the style.  I was really pumped up to drink this and was hoping for more coffee.  You get a small amount of coffee in the form of burnt coffee beans but that's about it.  I am a big fan of MT's hoppy offerings but the Monster's Park was disappointing and this one follows the stout disappointment trend unfortunately.","Popp24","Feb 01, 2015"

3.15,-23,4,2.75,3.25,3.5,3,"Nice looking beer - black with a dark brown head and good retention. The aroma is of vanilla, burnt oak, and burnt coffee with a smoky note. The spirit character is strange - somewhat sharp and harsh with an almost sour flair. The flavor is acrid burnt coffee and astringent oak with some chocolate and vanilla. Again, the spirit character and oak are unpleasant, though the chocolate and vanilla provide some respite from the acrid coffee. I could do without ever having barrel aged coffee in any form again.","HopHead84","Jan 31, 2015"
