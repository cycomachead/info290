4.12,0.7,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours black with a gray/tan, tightly packed head around the perimeter. The nose is mainly milk chocolate sweetness with minimal bitterness or coffee. The taste I'd compare more to a porter than a stout - roasty and malty, slight coffee presence and yeast, minimal booze or bitterness. The beer has a medium body, reasonable carbonation, and a very drinkable malty finish. I'm not picking up much from the special coffee beans used to make this beer, which is disappointing. Though it's not mind-blowing, it's still a solid beer.","ThePorterSorter","Thursday at 08:16 PM"

4.32,5.6,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,"Overall: this is so easy to drink. For a stout that 7.5% ABV, I really enjoyed this. The smell became stronger and fragrant as it warmed up, the flavors were rich with a strong roasted character, and the mouth-feel added another dimension.","Benish","Mar 24, 2015"
