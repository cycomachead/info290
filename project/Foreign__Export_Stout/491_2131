3.77,-1.6,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"an australian classic, something about this one makes it work in a warm or cold weather context, perfect for australian climate, but also neat on this side of the pond, especially as spring tries to fight through winter here in february. huge milky frothy mocha head, lacy and airy on top of the dark brown hersheys colored brew. some bitterness going on in the nose and taste, a hint of grass, this has more hops than others, and that helps. it also seems to have as much of a brown ale malt base as it does a stout one. roast is there, but the cocoa malt thing is too. chocolate gives way to coffee in the finish, intense coffee, but there is no java in this brew from what i a aware of. the feel also is different for a stout, tons of bubbles and english yeast character. i think in some ways its the best of three different worlds, foreign stout, black ale, and english brown, all contributing equally. drinkable as anything, fairly priced, and quite different from others. one of the best coopers beers going.","StonedTrippin","Jan 24, 2015"

3.15,-17.8,3.25,3.25,3,3.25,3.25,"Deep chocolate brown not wanting to let any light through. Decent head dissipating quickly, leaving nice light tan lacing.  Light malty nose with hints of sugared coffee. Taste, to me, has a hint of licorice up front, followed by some bitter malt and roasted(almost burnt) coffee. Not bad, a little unbalanced, but overall, ok !","hophugger","Dec 04, 2014"

4.15,8.4,4.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall: one of my favourite stouts. Well put together, very traditional style with a big, punchy flavour. Add to that a price of AU$58 a case of 24 x 375mL, and this is also one of the best value stouts around, along with CUB's Sheaf Stout.","SmashPants","Nov 19, 2014"
