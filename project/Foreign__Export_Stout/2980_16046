4.09,3.8,4,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,"Black with thick brown foam. Chocolaty and vanilla on the nose but more sweet vanilla bean than anything. Also smells of cool co2 and steel. Starts off mellow. Not as sweet as expected. A very mild chocolate cocoa starts and and a cocoa bittering follows up quickly with some complexity. Very much like milk chocolate followed by dark chocolate. A sweeter vanilla finishes long with a subtle wood and nutmeg note. Superbly balanced which makes it a great beer for the long haul.","constantine_272","Dec 18, 2014"

4.13,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,3,4,"OVERALL: An excellent, high quality export stout. I can certainly see why it boasts all the medals they’ve won on the label. Deserves every one of them. Very nicely done and impressive for a 7% beer. The feel could use a bit of beefing up perhaps, but the rest of the show is a treat. Glad this one showed up locally and if I see it again, I’ll be all over it. Highly recommended.","Jeffo","Sep 08, 2014"
4.25,7.9,,,,,,"This stout was excellent.  I want to say that I had it cask-conditioned at the brewpub, which made it even more excellent.  Great color, balanced flavor, and paired very well with my food.  Thumbs up all around for this one.","dcscientist","Aug 28, 2014"
