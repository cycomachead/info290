I would drink this beer again but seeing as its from Massachusetts I wouldnt go out of my way to procure it, glad to receive it in a trade though.","angelmonster","May 10, 2013"

3.73,-3.9,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"O: Interesting FES. Lots of char and chocolate and SUPER dry. The aftertaste is practically like eating cocoa powder. One of the driest stouts I've ever had. Overall the flavors are decent but the dryness is kinda off-putting.","Dope","Mar 17, 2013"

3.93,1.3,4,4,4,3.75,3.75,"O: This is an interesting though fairly big foreign/export stout which significant amounts of roast and char flavors/aromas. The hoppiness really starts to become more apparent as the beer warms up.","dbrauneis","Feb 04, 2013"
