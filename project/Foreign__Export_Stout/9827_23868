3.9,5.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light tobacco, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light char, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Foreign stout style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on even with the low carbonation. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 12, 2014"

3.06,-17.1,3,2.5,3,3.75,3.5,"If you like a really dark, and strong beer, this ones for you. I personally think its OK, I dont regret trying it. over all I give this a rating of 3. The taste gets better after a few sips. and it isnt a twist tot (which I like) and being imported from jamaica (thats the main purpose why i tried it) makes it worth it, to atleast try if anything.","mando_thegreat","Jul 16, 2013"
3.46,-6.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"A large mocha head rises and sits top this ebony bodied liquid. With the top a darker hue, it looks like one of those beefed up imperial stouts brewed in the US. There's joy here, and the joy is coming through the nose. A very sweet note of chocolate, followed with booze and overripe banana. The taste is agreeable, interesting to say the least. It has a banana accent which gives up a Belgian impression, but isn't. Soft roasted malts taking a swim in chocolate and a kiss of fruitiness. Not much alcohol is noted. Regarding mouthfeel, it's medium-full bodied with a carbonation near soda level, let's cut that down some. As it stands, it's an acceptable foreign stout which is also relatively easy on the wallet.","DoubleJ","May 31, 2013"

3.56,-3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not so refined, but that works in its benefit. A big, sweet Stout that wants to play with our palates. We wish more of these Foreign Stouts would hit our shores to further challenge the palates of US beer drinkers. If the locals in Jamaica have no problem drinking a hearty Stout in 85Â°F sunny weather, then neither should you.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 10, 2012"

3.37,-8.7,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some slight dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly sour bittersweet cocoa flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a slightly above average beer that is drinkable but I am not really enjoying the sour aspect I am getting in the flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 22, 2012"

3.46,-6.2,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"O: the 7.6% ABV is noticeable, not a bad stout from a country that I mostly associate with Red Stripe and red hair but doesn't stand up to the more traditional European or more creative American stouts, perfectly acceptable though if you are in the islands and tired of lager","M_C_Hampton","Jun 18, 2012"
