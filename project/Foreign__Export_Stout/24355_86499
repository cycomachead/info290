4.07,12.7,3.5,4,4.25,4,4,"Pours a dark brown with an off white head. Layers of lace are left. Aroma of smoke and roasted malts. In the flavor, robust roasted malt flavor of dark coffee with hazelnut cream. Roasted, black patent malt flavor is primary. There is a mild resinous hop note and all due bitterness. Full bodied, well carbonated, and delicately smooth. Overall, this is a tasty stout, a bit stronger than your typical. Solid stout here.","Stinkypuss","Jul 02, 2013"

3.81,5.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"32oz growler from Whole Foods. Pours a black color with ruby hues and an inch of light brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is earthy with some chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa powder and hints of caramel and vanilla. Tastes much like the aroma. Earthy at first with some chocolate and roasted malts. Hints of smoke with some sweetness towards the finish. Some sour notes. Mild alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is slick and thin. Overall, pretty solid example of the style I'd grab again.","PicoPapa","0"

3.56,-1.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: This is one hoppy stout, no question about that. You'd think that this would be easy to drink at 7%, but the hops have something to say about that and make it more of a sipper. Some nice flavors going on underneath the hops make up for the astringency and make this a solid FES","BEERMILER12","Nov 23, 2012"

3.13,-13.3,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the char on the nose and in the aftertaste. The nose really warmed up by the end, giving a nice roasty quality to an otherwise strong base of aromatics. The flavoring, however, fell short. While there were notes here and there of what we wanted, the only part where flavor felt stark enough to wake you up was in the end and aftertaste. Otherwise the beer was relatively washed out and watery, and we found ourselves not wanting much more than one serving. We have certainly come to expect more from this prominent local brewery.","TheBrewo","Nov 10, 2012"
