There was some normal settlement on the bottom of the bottle like one would normally expect for a bottle conditioned export stout that was four months old.","pknyc","Mar 27, 2014"

I've been a huge fan of this beer for a few years now and no matter what the price, I always try to get another case of 24 before the one I currently have is spent. It's one of those beers I'll always be faithful to, falling back to it on hard days when I feel I definitely need a treat for myself. I treasure what I have since I can't have it regularly nor cheaply. This is some seriously awesome beer.","FrostBlast","Aug 12, 2013"

4.21,-0.9,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Picked this up at The Kernel Brewery while on vacation in London. Pitch black pour with a nice two finger beige head with great retention and lacing. The nose is earthy and roasty with lots of coffee and dark chocolate along with hints of leather, cocoa, and nuts. The taste rich and flavorful with loads of roasty coffee and bitter chocolate along with hints of tobacco, cocoa, leather, and some subtle dark fruit and hops. The mouthfeel is thick, oily, and slightly chewy with a bit more carbonation than I had expected. The finish is dry, bitter, and mouth-coating. Overall, another stellar offering from The Kernel.","beerdrifter","Jul 09, 2013"

Taste is mildly bitter and heavy on the coffee with a dry, almost piney finish. Feel is fairly heavy and sticky, with a medium carbonation. Overall, this is very enjoyable. Definitely my favorite of their beers so far and one of the best export stouts I've had.","JohnQVD","May 31, 2013"

3.99,-6.1,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Bottle (Hivernale): Poured a deep black color stout with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of nice floral coffee notes with some dark chocolate is very enticing. Taste is dominated by some very nice floral coffee notes with very little bitter chocolate and almost no astringency which is surprising considering the amount of coffee notes that are discernable. Light smokey notes are also perceptible though dark fruits notes are not really detectable as per brewer’s notes. Body is about average with good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. I very much enjoyed this beer and definitely makes me want to try some of their other beers.","Phyl21ca","Oct 16, 2012"

4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Impressive - a fantastic stout. Like running into a wall of roasted malt and coffee flavours. Great if you love dark beers. The only minor complaint I have is that the mouthfeel seemed a little thin to match the flavour; a more unctuous sensation would have gone down well. Trivialities aside, this is excellent and should be consumed if you have the opportunity.","jazzyjeff13","Mar 18, 2012"
