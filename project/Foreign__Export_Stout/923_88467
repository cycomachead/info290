4.21,7.4,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured into a Stone flute. Pours nearly black with a fine one finger dark khaki head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, toasted malt, plums, hint of coffee and oak. Flavor of charred dark malt, dark chocolate, coffee, woody oak, a hint of dark fruit; finishes with more charry malt, light hop bitterness and coffee. Medium bodied with good carbonation and mouth feel. A richly flavored, charred malt stout with light barrel character and a deftly handled fruit component. It tasted like plum juice, but must be from the dark grapes. Deceptively straightforward at first taste, but develops a nice range of complex fruit and toasted malt character. This was very good, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I look forward to trying other beers from this brewery. Nicely done.","LiquidAmber","Feb 14, 2015"
