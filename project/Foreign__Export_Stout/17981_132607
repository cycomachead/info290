I detected barrel aromatics and was impressed to find that this was in a rum barrel. Rum barrels are bei used more and more and they definitely give off some pretty interesting and less coercive flavors and aromas than bourbon barrels in my opinion. It's not necessarily better but it's different. The nose is sweet chocolate, fudge, spicy wood and dark fruits. The flavor is quick sweet and decadent. Sweet chocolate syrup, rum and wood. Flat cola and some dark fruit. Finishes with spicy rum flavor. Full, slick texture. Quite good; would have liked more of this to better diagnose all the flavors.","VelvetExtract","Mar 23, 2015"

4.4,1.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"OVERALL: Really good. Although this is described as an export stout, it’s actually a better Cigar City imperial stout than El Cid. The look is not quite as thick as The Marshal or Huna, but it’s blacker and nastier than the vast majority of the imperial stouts out there, while the aroma and flavor is certainly top notch. A slightly thicker feel would put this over the top. Really enjoyed this and would love to see it again. Cheers 7clutch!","Jeffo","Dec 26, 2014"

4.37,0.7,,,,,,"Bottle from my membership. Have no idea what to expect here. CCB seems big on the rum barrels for Catador. Poured to my El Catador Club Teku (naturally). Pitch black pour with an espresso brown head, looking creamy as can be and the retention is solid. Aroma of chocolate covered licorice, molasses, light booze, hint of vanilla. Not a lot of rum here on the nose but very nice. Very unique and super creamy smell here. The flavor is huge chocolate sauce, lots of anise, dark fruits, definite rum spice here but not a lot of booze, some vanilla notes, and a strong roasted malt presence that makes it seem like there is espresso in this thing. Rich silky mouthfeel, lowish carbonation, but not the intensely thick level that often comes from CCB. In this case that's probably a good thing, as this is so sweet and rich as it is. Easily the best rum infusion I've had in a stout. Really nice, but gonna be tough to get through this on my own due to the dessert in a glass qualities.","BMMillsy","Oct 14, 2014"
