4.02,-7.4,4.25,4,4,4,4,"EBF sample. Pours black or something close. Thick and viscous. Aroma is rich and very sweet. I detected barrel aromatics and was impressed to find that this was in a rum barrel. Rum barrels are bei used more and more and they definitely give off some pretty interesting and less coercive flavors and aromas than bourbon barrels in my opinion. It's not necessarily better but it's different. The nose is sweet chocolate, fudge, spicy wood and dark fruits. The flavor is quick sweet and decadent. Sweet chocolate syrup, rum and wood. Flat cola and some dark fruit. Finishes with spicy rum flavor. Full, slick texture. Quite good; would have liked more of this to better diagnose all the flavors.","VelvetExtract","Mar 23, 2015"
