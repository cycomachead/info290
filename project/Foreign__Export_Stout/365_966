Head is light coffee colored with mini craters and very very nice lacing left behind. Aroma is of roasted malts and coffee beans, very pleasant and not overpowering. Taste is also nice with a great blend of roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate. Balance is nice between roast flavors, coffee, chocolate and hops. Good carbonation makes this stout very drinkable with a good kick of bitter at the end. Decent balance..","hophugger","Nov 17, 2014"
