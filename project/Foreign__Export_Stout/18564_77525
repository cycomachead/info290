4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Conclusion: A very good dark beer. I have always liked this style, but often found American versions to be uninspired. I personally think the Guiness Foreign Extra to be an outstanding beer and the benchmark for the style, and although this is beer isn't quite at that level, it is doing its own thing and doing it well. Worth being proud of for Upslope. I could drink this regularly.","allforbetterbeer","Jan 25, 2015"
