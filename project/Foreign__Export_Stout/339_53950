4.15,6.1,4,4.5,4,4.25,4,"Flavor is roasted malt and dark chocolate.  I think it is a little dry on the finish but no real hints of booze.  Im not sure if the dryness is imparted by the oysters or if they do something else that I am missing.  A nice solid drinkable stout with a fairly high ABV at 7.5%.  I would buy this again even though im not sure what the oysters add to the beer.","sulldaddy","Jan 08, 2015"
