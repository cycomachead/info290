Im not sure if the dryness is imparted by the oysters or if they do something else that I am missing.  A nice solid drinkable stout with a fairly high ABV at 7.5%.

While this was a Foreign/Export Stout, a beer like made me think that Oyster Stouts should be in a class by themselves. This was thin enough to go down smoothly but solid enough in body to savor and once again, Flying Fish has outdone themselves with this latest entry in the Exit series. Find this, open it, and savor it - it's a lot better (and possibly cheaper) than taking the Turnpike all the way down to its southern terminus. Highly recommended.","JerzDevl2000","Feb 05, 2014"

3.85,-1.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The "export-style" quality of this stout seems a little lost to its oily, salty, clam-juice nuances. Nullifies whatever malt-sugary-sweet elements may be present. Superb balance of roastiness, mild dark espresso, and depth of body, however. Clean, lightly saline, and slick-smooth. Lacks the heavier feeling of most of the export stouts I've had. Would've wanted a little more syrupy feel but I can't complain about what it offered. The keg was well over a year old and it suffered not. Begged attentive sipping. It was black.

The taste is of bitter amd milk chocolate, roasted malt, and light charred wood/smoke. The body is light to moderate, seems a tad thin for the style. The carbonation is fairly soft which adds to the creamy texture of this stout. Finishes with a roasted malt bitterness. Definitely a tastey stout, though a bit thin.

There is a subtle saltiness(from the oysters) thT is not overpowering but compliments the chocolate and roasted notes very well.

A half inch, mocha-colored head dissipates into a skim with some spots on the glass. Head was refreshed with a swirl of the glass. Nose is roasty with a hint of lactose and coffee/cocoa. Taste follows nose with the addition of a touch of brininess that comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild and even background carbonation.

The nose had notes of coffee, chocolate, mocha, and even a bit of charcoal. Mouthfeel wavered between medium and full with the coffee and charcoal up front followed by a more mellow mocha sweetness and a dark chocolate finish.

Many people may be turned off by the notion of an Oyster stout, but fear not, this has very little presence, mostly only in name with the exception of a light saltiness.

The stout appears an opaque brown color with a good inch of fluffy dark ecru head. Nose and flavors consist of nicely roasted malt, milk and bittersweet chocolate, caramel, vanilla, a fair amount of light char/smoke, molasses, mocha. It might be subliminal because I know this is brewed with oysters, but I'm picking up a somewhat salty and sour brackish brininess here. The brine plays second fiddle to the roast, smoke and chocolate though. Great body; creamy, very dry and amply carbonated with a lingering bitter, sweet, smoky, mildly sour finish.

The aroma was dominated not surprisingly by cocoa and bittersweet chocolate, and further revealed a feint roasted malt presence. The taste as well was dominated by chocolate, but the roasted malt was more prominent as well, and the finish was surprisingly dry, with the tiniest hint of hop bitterness. For such a chocolate-y beer, I found the body to be spritzier and thinner than expected. Maybe too much CO2 in the tapping?
