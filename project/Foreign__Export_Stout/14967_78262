4.22,12.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours pretty much black, dirty dark brown head. Moderate lacing, and light retention. Nose has a beautiful coffee bouquet, creamy, vanilla and medium roast coffee. Some coffee cake/bread, mild hazelnut, good sweetness over a gentle roast. Almost smells like snickerdoodle cookies a bit. Very nice here. Taste is a bit lighter, but still fantastic coffee flavours. Lightly roasty, nutty, creamy and mild bitterness. Touch of tartness. Medium light feel, and relatively low carbonation. Really nice coffee stout, one of the better ones in recent memory.","liamt07","May 26, 2012"

4.03,7.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"More delicious coffee in the taste, along with roasted barley malt, chocolate. Some sense of dried dark fruits, not cherries. Slight sweetness is cut, and the finish is nice and dry. Good carbonation and a medium body, creamy mouthfeel. Coffee bean bitterness lingers into the long, dry finish. If you like coffee, you'll like this. It's not cherry flavored.","JackieTH","Apr 05, 2012"
3.5,-6.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours near-black with a thin light tan head that quickly subsides into a thin collar without leaving more than a spot or two of lace behind. The nose has a slight cherry presence along with a good dose of coffee and roast. Flavor has a nice combination of cherry and roast, finishing with some dark chocolate. Body is medium to a slightly-dry finish. Pretty good.","Thorpe429","Mar 29, 2012"
