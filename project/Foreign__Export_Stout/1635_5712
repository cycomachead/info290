3.72,-8.1,3.5,4,4,2.5,3.5,"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the aroma. It was rich and bold, boasting of big roasted malts, and huge coffee elements. These elements, however, were blended perfectly with a cooling vanilla, leading to a complex and mouthwatering aroma that fit this style perfectly. Where the beer lost points however, was in the mouthfeel. We were expecting something rich, bold, and full bodied, but instead were met with a rather thin and watery brew.","TheBrewo","Apr 16, 2011"

4.17,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Into the tulip the blackness tumbles further down the rabbit hole. A black hole of despair and neglect. But this glass? I shall neglect not. I raise it to the light..Impenetrable! I smell, the roast, the coffee, a faintness of hop..of hope. Big creamy tan head, the bubbles fine. The flavor is nice, the creaminess of the stout is cut with the bitterness and roasted barley. A little coffee rounds out an excellent stout flavor. Full-bodied, very creamy despite the sharp notes of bitterness from hop and husk. An extremely solid brew from the local cats..","dragonWhale","Dec 16, 2009"
3.75,-7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink for the style because it isn’t very heavy on the palate.","metter98","Nov 26, 2009"
