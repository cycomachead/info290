Smells of roasted malt without too much else, maybe a hint of chocolate. Flavour is fairly sweet, I get some type of salty note too. Thinner mouthfeel than many stouts of this strength.

The taste has the ever present coffee characteristics up front but a heavy dose of chocolate on the swallow followed by roasty malty bitter aftertaste. It all works well together. A lot going on. The mouthfeel is full bodied with light carbonation. I think the drinkability is great! It's a perfect compliment to the rainy night I am currently enduring.

4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a deeply satisfying brew, it is certainly not an Imperial Stout, but is on the rich side for a stout. Still quite drinkable, though it certainly is not thirst quenching; the mouthfeel is a touch too creamy and rich for that. I have had this beer a couple times and each time I have really enjoyed it; it has really nice balance of flavors and heft that just really works and makes for a flavorful, favorable drinking experience.","Gueuzedude","Mar 09, 2007"

Not that RIS sort of "I am a huge ass stout sip me and appreciate me" way, but more of a "I am a huge ass stout and will aggressively tear up your tongue as you try to force me down" sort of way. Still, it's appropriate for a stout to be big, huge, and perhaps menacing, I would just say that this falls a bit too much on the menacing side unnecessarily without much balance. Still, don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic big stout and, if nothing else, unique.","RidiculedDisplay","Jan 29, 2007"

Pleasant aroma offers vanilla, chocolate, dark roasted malt and mild chocolate in a excellent concentration and progression. Body is flat black and holds a creamy, thumb thick, mocha head that diminishes slowly leaving tree ring like lacing. First sip is creamy and holds a vanilla twinged flavor that gives way to coffee and bitter roasted notes. Finish is quite bitter and balances the sweet middle flavors of the beer well. Tasty. Get yourself a bottle!","Jredner","Jul 25, 2006"
4.08,6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours with incredible generous head which is a greyish-brown in colour, darker trim around the edges. Opaque body, black. A fresh and vibrant shot of espresso coffee. Notes of tobacco, ashy dark chocolate. A good base of malt underlying everything. Same continues through the mouthfeel and taste. Quite rich, would pair well with desserts, or as a dessert on its own. No compromise, a smoky coffee roastness. The roast dimension really ties all the flavours together. Excellent, simply excellent.","biegaman","Jun 27, 2006"

3.5,-9.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,"Deep, virtually black hue. A flash of hazy crimson appears when held to light. Thin, but steadfast tan head yields sparse form trails. The aroma is comprised of rounded notes of baker's cocoa, singed chocolate cookie, along with a savory, salty tinge. Obviously sweeter, honey and fudge notes surface as the beer warms. Enticing aromawise. Upfront in flavor is a bittersweet combination of burnt barley and raisiny dark lovibond caramel malt. Midpalate notions of dark chocolate infused mocha appear and linger agreeably. A trace metallic twang comes forth as the beer breathes. Thinnish in body, with a mouthfeel shy in dextrins. Finishes cleanly, with quickly fleeting notes of milk chocolate and trace prune. San Quentin's a well balanced stout, having ample cocoa notes, although the thin body detracts from the malt profile. Good overall.","marc77","Sep 04, 2005"

It also smells like coffee. It had a slightly nutty aroma to it. It tastes coffee like. Also sweet malt flavor is very strong. The hops are present, but quite subtle. This is a pretty good tasting stout. It is full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. It leaves a slightly sweet aftertaste.

Flavor is very burnt and cooked, dark and malty, with a slight hop bite and a lingering milk chocolate sweetness. Very nice. Creamy, luscious texture. A sweet yet very charred stout. Alcohol is barely noticeable aside from a slight warmth in the belly. A nice one indeed. For those that want to sample Guinness Foreign Extra Stout but can't get it here in the States, this one is very similar.","IrishRedRock","Dec 14, 2004"

This one has an interesting finish to it. I rather enjoy the burnt, chewy malty taste. It's the perfect brew to be reviewing tonight on this cold rainy Southern California evening. It also has a certain hop bitterness taste that I don't notice in other stouts. But it's a hearty beer, and I would think stout enthusiasts would rate this fairly high. Marin brews a lot of great beers.","ChappyCubsFan","Oct 24, 2003"

Lacing sticks together like a colloidal suspension it's crazy. Aroma: Deep layers of chocolate from deep German dark chocolate tones to milky smooth cocoa this beer is wide on the range of tones that it produces, hopping is definitely evident floral hops here in one of the darkest stouts I've ever seen. Deep roasted malts blend so nicely in the scent of this fine crafted brew I am loving it. Taste: Slight fruit tones trail and combine with spritzy deep chocolate notes wow what an interesting brew we have here, bittering hops bititng at the palate a complex brew hard to compile all of this description with my senses.

Smell is malty sweet, with a little rummy alcohol (like a muted imperial stout). Taste is chocolatey, roasted malts, with rum-raisin notes. Finish is also malty (smokier, woodier than at first), with a touch of hops, and lingering alcohol. Goes down quite easily though. This stout sits somewhere between an oatmeal stout and an imperial stout in my short book (not as dry or coffee bitter as other export/foreign stouts I've had, like Cooper's). All in all a nice beer.","alexgash","Jun 12, 2003"

A fair warning of what's to come. Thick, chewy, creamy body heavy on the malt flavor. Mostly sweet mid-palate with more chocolate notes and something like maraschino cherries. Decent hop finish; the aftertaste is roasty and pleasantly biting. Alcohol warming throughout. A big, big imperial-like stout. I'd definitely drink it again.","mzwolinski","0"
