Alcohol sneaks in somewhere and goes into a finish that draws out some powdery dryness.","Brenden","May 01, 2013"

3.65,-2.1,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Mixed bag in the nose and tastes: malts first and foremost, mild liquorice front with sweeter molassses taking over, a mini hop, dry finish completes the flavours but there is a lot more going on inbetween. My bottle had a nice, but unexpected and unusual 'semi-sour' feel (for a Stout) to it throughout the tasting. I also thought the alcohol level isn't hidden to any great extent. Complexed and different with a variety of fruit notes and malty levels of roasted/toasted chocolate and coffee.","BlackHaddock","Sep 14, 2012"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass. Massive light brown head with good retention and lots of pillowing lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, dark dried fruit; slightly vinous and sour. Flavor starts with dark toasted malt and develops a nice fruit flavor of plums and raisins, finishing slightly dry with dark fruit, light chocolate and a bright spicy flavor that may be from the oyster shells; slight hops. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. A very nice flavor progression and complexity. I enjoyed this quite a bit. I lean towards imperial stouts, but this was great. I will return to this stout.","LiquidAmber","Aug 24, 2012"

Color is an odd clear pink brown, with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is super mild and what's there is malty, roasty, fruity. Flavor's like nose, but up front is VERY metallic, mineral, and medicine. It's also dry, light soft carbonation and ditto carbonic tang. Finish is bitter and astringent. Also with time the metallic part diminishes. Don't know if I'll finish it.","drpimento","May 10, 2012"

3.73,0,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"So this beer is supposed to be filtered through oyster shells. It's color nearly obsidian (with only some deep brown hues if held to strong light). The head is a fairly dark tan. Nice aroma, with some chocolate overtones. There's a little roast barley in the smell, but the chocolate really stands out. Pretty good balance in the taste. The beer is a little on the dry side, with a good chocolate malt character and a firm bitterness. Honestly, I'm not sure that they oyster shells do anything....just a gimmick I suppose. The mouthfeel is sufficiently creamy and full. This is an fine beer.","Suds","Oct 13, 2008"
3.28,-12.1,4,3.5,3,4,3,"Pours a very dark chocolate brown color with a foamy tan/ yelowish head. The aroma consists of dark roasted chocolate maltiness and salt seafood. Smooth roasted malty flavor with hints of chocolate, toffee, oatmeal, coffee and seafood(oysters). The fish taste is not toooverpowering however. Very unique.","corby112","Mar 31, 2008"
2.98,-20.1,3,2.5,3,4,3,"OVERALL: Nothing special here, though the palate is nice. The alcohol is well-hidden, but the nose and taste is just not interesting enough to say anything. It's drinkable, if only because it's generic enough and doesn't do anything out of the ordinary. I don't see it being an oyster stout either, compared to others I've had at least. Not one I'll re-visit","Jeffo","Mar 25, 2008"
3.68,-1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a clear deep burgundy color ale with a giant size light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with some sweet malt notes and a bread-like yeast is quite interesting. Taste is a complex mix between some liquorice, roasted malt and Belgian semi-sweet malt with notes of dry hops also noticeable and the influence of a Belgian style yeast strain cannot be denied. Very interesting and something I wouldn't mind having regular access to.","Phyl21ca","Feb 11, 2008"
4.01,7.5,4,3,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Described by the brewery as filtered through oyster-shells, which is a little weird (I always appreciate weird). I was mildly surprised to see a stout on draft in the Netherlands, but the bar came highly recommended. It would have been a perfect experience WITH oysters, though there were none on the menu. Nonetheless, a very tasty stout, with nice dry tones and not much residual sugar.","lastauss","Jul 24, 2007"
4.4,18,4,4,4.5,4,5,"This actually has become my home beer. One of a few I always make sure to have in my cellar. The others are for example Girardin Unfiltered, Rochefort 10 and Karmeliet. So you can imagine this must have the same quality and it does. Appearance and aroma are as to be expected. Notes of chocolate in the aroma, good looking. But the flavor is wonderful. Not exceptional, just wonderful. Chocolate, coffee, light roasted, sweet and a bit salty. A beer I can drink all evening.","johnnybravo","Jan 03, 2007"

3.51,-5.9,4,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Suprisingly little smell. Some dry roastyness and chocolate smell, maybe. Taste is unique. Chocolate, caramel, something unique in the aftertaste. Is that oyster? There seems to be a salty, slimy coating in the mouthfeel. Could be oyster, I guess. I wish I could read my notes for the drinkability, but apparantly I was a bit too drunk to write neatly. I did write 3.5, though!","DaveFL1976","Nov 17, 2005"
3.75,0.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Although this was a good beer, it was not a typical Stout, more a cross-over between a Dubbel and a Stout. I liked it!","Absumaster","Aug 28, 2005"
2.88,-22.8,3.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"M&D: it's medium-full bodied, but tastes simply too light for the flavour, with lots of fizz on the palate in every sip; I can't say what style this beer means to be--it's quite mixed and has a bit of -Baltic porter, -Belgian dark ale, -dark bock... but a stout/oyster stout it is not (with due respect). With its slightly cloying profile, I don't even think it goes WITH oysters (as probably meant to be according to its inappropriate name). Not a bad beer in its own right, though, but to "review it within style" plus its overall price performance (cost me 2.7 pounds for such a small bottle), I wouldn't buy it again.","wl0307","Jul 27, 2005"

3.5,-6.2,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Best before end 06. Brewed for Bierkoning Amsterdam. Appearance is good head, brown colored and a black beercollor. Nose is sweet carramellic, litle roasty and freshmalty. Alcohol is noticable has fine good apricot& pineapple yeastarome. Taste is full malty, thick bodied and medium to sweet. Good carramellic and not overdone roast. Very salty that must have come from that sealshellfiltration(?) as it says on the label and is IMO no good for overal taste. Get more thirsty while drinking it and gives a salty haging mouthfeel. No bad brew but IMO to many salts& minerals for a beer.","paterlodie","0"
