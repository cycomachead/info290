3.75,1.1,,,,,,"Overall â€“ This one won a silver star in 2011.... It has such a strong flavour it is very hard to taste the alcohol and the flavour seems to develop with each taste. A good little number and very surprising to me as I was not aware that the Dutch went in for Stout or that they were so accomplished in this style.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Apr 19, 2014"

3.75,1.1,,,,,,"Overall: While it won't knock your socks off with a myriad of complexities, it's amply flavorful and an ease to drink at 5.5% ABV.","ChainGangGuy","Mar 16, 2014"
