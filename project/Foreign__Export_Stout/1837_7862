3.77,0.3,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Overall: Carbonation problems seem to plague this brew but, putting that aside, it is a pretty nice beer","brentk56","Feb 11, 2011"
3.47,-7.7,3.5,4,3.5,2,3.5,"o - Overall a decent stout. I think it may have been on its way to infection, but I didn't sense anything in the nose or taste, just the carbonation. Would like to try it again sometime.","mdfb79","Sep 27, 2010"
4.17,10.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste is roasty, sweet and fruity all at the same time. Interesting mix, but does not quite equal uber-deliciousness. Tasty though, to be sure. I like the rich molasses and fine-ground hop effort - both flavoring and bittering are nice. cocoa powder atop a dripping, roasting marshmallow. Nice brew, this one.","twiggamortis420","Sep 17, 2010"
2.68,-28.7,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"O: Damn this one had some serious promise. I will have to look for another bottle someday.","beerwolf77","Jun 29, 2010"
2.73,-27.4,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"O - No shame in drain-pouring an infected/bad brew. This one isn't awfully offensive but it's certainly not worth drinking. I'd welcome a second chance at it.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 26, 2010"
3.98,5.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall drinkability is good. Strong roasted character, but not overdone or too aggressive. Good balance.","JamnesCameron","Apr 17, 2010"
3.61,-4,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Very nice looking beer-deep black with a healthy looking tan head. Rather average aroma. Grainy and roasted thats about all. Heavy roasted flavors with a leaning towards chocolate malt. Mild espresso. Ok mouthfeel-very drying in the finish. Drinkable enough but could use a bit of an umph to make it really stand out. Good enough beer for the price for sure.","lackenhauser","Mar 14, 2010"
3.63,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability: There is nothing wrong with this beer that a few tweaks couldn't improve. It wasn't meant to be anything huge, it seems. It is a pleasantly drinkable stout but I don't think it fits the FES style particularly closely. (You do have to give it some credit for holding onto it's huge carbonation throughout the bottle.)","meatyard","Jan 28, 2010"
3.62,-3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall? Wildly roasted, toasted brew without a lot else going on. But I like roast. Bring it on! Good beer.","maximum12","Sep 16, 2009"
3.39,-9.8,3,4,3.5,2.5,3,"3.0 D: Not a great beer, but not a bad one either...if the carbonation was fixed.","DavoleBomb","Aug 01, 2009"
3.96,5.3,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This brew drank fine I was left wanting for more it was a good session brew and overall a good stout.","joepais","Jul 08, 2009"
4.18,11.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Besides being plenty tasty, a reasonably low ABV keeps this one very drinkable.","Brenden","Jun 04, 2009"
4.01,6.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D-this is quite a nice stout to sip on. it is lighter and brings some good flavor. definitely a stout to drink on.","cpetrone84","May 25, 2009"
3.93,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"D Interesting but just so thick. Satisfying but big! 3.5","adamette","Mar 30, 2009"
4.03,7.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall - I thought this was very nicely done. I would have no problem at all with going through this one again. It was very solid and I would love to give it another try. I really think they did an excellent job on this one.","mikesgroove","Feb 12, 2009"
3.41,-9.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, not a terrible stout by any means, but not one that I found overly remarkable.","boatshoes","Jan 22, 2009"
4.01,6.6,5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"overall - A great American-made foreign-style stout. Roasty, complex, and oh so smooth. Definitely glad to have had a chance to have this one!","DannyS","Jan 09, 2009"
3.75,-0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability: I expected this Buckeye to be pretty good Stout and let me just say that I wasn't disappointed. It had all the dark roasted flavors I was looking for, but I think the carbonation level was a bit too much for this beer. If you're looking to try a good roasted Buckeye beer, then get yourself a Mammoth Stout. Just remember to pour it slowly into your glass.","AltBock","Jan 07, 2009"
3.83,1.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Aftertaste is of fresh brewed full-flavored coffee. Well made and recommended. Cheers!","rayjay",
