I remember thinking it was much better than the light lagers we had access to down at McMurdo Station. I still think it is a solid beer, though by no means an Import Stout. Really this falls somewhere between a stout and a black ale with the simpler flavor profile and lighter mouthfeel compared to a traditional stout. Still, it hits the spot and is highly drinkable. I would get a few sixes (about $10 each) of this if I get the chance to go back to the ice.","Bockrules","Apr 29, 2013"

2.87,-13.3,3,2.75,3,2.25,3,"Overall: Not too bad, especially from a 'macro' brewery that normally produces standard adjunct lagers, but not nearly as full-bodied and complex as a good stout should be. Definitely more of a sessionable stout.","machalel","Jun 22, 2012"
