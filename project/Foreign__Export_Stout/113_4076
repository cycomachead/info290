3.78,-9.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of dry hop, sweet malt, roasted malt, slight oatmeal, and a hint of chocolate. Fits the style of a Foreign / Export Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and a hint of chocolate. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend.","Tone",
