3.6,-1.9,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Starts out with a couple centimeters of light khaki bubbles on top of deep brown beer that doesn't let much light through but does turn just a bit red at the edges. The smell is mostly sweet with a lot of dark fruit, plums and the like. Very little in the way of malt or typical stout like bitter chocolate in the nose. The taste is very smooth dark malts with only a hint of the bitterness that you would expect. The fruitiness comes through as well but the taste is much more dynamic than the smell with a lot of the more Belgian flavors of earthy, yeasty, vinous flavors in there as well, overall strange for a stout and more like a Belgian dark. Rather full bodied but quite smooth with low levels of carbonation and a finish that is only slightly dry with a touch of bitterness. An unusual take on the style that has enough in the way of interesting characteristics to make it worth trying but doesn't make it a great beer.","fank2788","Nov 02, 2013"

3.77,2.7,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall not bad, a nice export style stout with the dark malts, roasty, black malts, hints of cocoa and caramel, a little burnt notes, candi sweetness that still stays really dry, maybe a bit too much on the burnt like notes but not too bad, a bit too much carbonation too surprising for what it's gone through.","jlindros","Aug 20, 2013"

Drinkability was very good, the beer went down quickly and easily, and I could have a couple in a sitting. Overall, a pretty nice brew, worth trying if you see it.","beertunes","Jul 18, 2013"

3.63,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"This dark mahogany beer has a durable tan head and leaves very good lacing. The near creamy texture overlays an unusual palate that seems both full and light, and has a pleasant, semi-dry finish. Although it is slightly light in color for a stout and has an unusual (yeasty, boozy and hoppy) aroma, in tasting this is indeed a Belgian stout: it has the flavor of a rather spicy and hoppy export stout with the added complexity imparted by Belgian yeast and in-bottle refermentation. The dark roasted malts do come to the fore for a moment now and again in the finish, then linger in the durable aftertaste.","chinchill",
