2.75,-34.4,,,,,,"The taste was powerful. Now I know why in Africa they use the slogan "Guinness gives you power!" It was a very strong tasting stout, with a long bitter aftertaste, that had a bite to it. Overall a good strong stout, tasting of roasted malt with traces of coffee. As you would expect with a Guinness stout the flavours are complex and well balanced, making it one of the worlds richest tasting beers.  Still not as good as a pint of the real black stuff beside the Liffey, Dublin town.","Thisdrinkinglife","Nov 08, 2014"
