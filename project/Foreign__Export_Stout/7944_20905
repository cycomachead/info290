Even if it isn't a gift, the beer is still overall pretty decent and drinkable. I'll definitely be keeping my eye out for this every holiday.","HattedClassic","Jan 17, 2015"

3.17,-8.1,3.25,3,3.25,3,3.25,"A roasty bitterness follows.  Light carbonation - a bit more than I want in a stout, but not over the top.  8% abv for this brew.  A decent option for a cold winter night.","artdob","Dec 27, 2014"
