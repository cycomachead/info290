3.83,-1.5,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"O: Not a bad FES. Age has mellowed and smooth it out but it still has a prominent and sharp char character. Can't imagine how strong it was 3 years ago. Alcohol is completely hidden, drinks like a 6-7% porter not a 10% stout. Nice drinkability as a result. Good beer, lacking a bit in complexity but I enjoyed it.","Dope",
