4.26,1.9,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"On draft at Gainesville House of Beer. Pours jet black with creamy mocha head. Very creamy mouthfeel, wow this is beautiful. Sweet sugary chocolate/lactose on the aroma. This is so creamy it feels and tastes like I'm drinking super rich chocolate milk with just a a bit of coffee bitter to balance. Pretty sweet, but very solid and lots of flavor that bursts on the palate. Really wish I would have had a chance to try Check It and See.","BMMillsy","Oct 22, 2012"
