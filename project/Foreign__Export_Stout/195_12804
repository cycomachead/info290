4.54,17,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Something between foreign stout and dubbel. Smell of dark fruit, bitter aftertaste. Unique. Very recommendable. I liked it better than Magma and Westkust from the same brewery.","hansavijaticar","Nov 29, 2014"

4.06,4.6,5,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 8/6/2015. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, white grape, light pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, white grape, light pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light peppery yeast spice/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, grape, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian style imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 24, 2014"
