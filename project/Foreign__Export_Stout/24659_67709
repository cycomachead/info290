4.06,-2.4,4.5,4,4,4.25,4,"Can from trade. Thanks! Pours pitch black with a pretty creamy looking one finger dark khaki head. Aroma of coffee, roasted malts, some sweet molasses, a hint of hops. Flavor follows with a nutty note, some roasted coffee, roasted malts, sweet molasses and lightly bitter chocolate. Nice balance of the sweet with a slightly bitter finish. Super smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied, with medium carbonation. This is a really nice beer.","BMMillsy","Jan 30, 2015"
