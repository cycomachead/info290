Flavor follows with a nutty note, some roasted coffee, roasted malts, sweet molasses and lightly bitter chocolate. Nice balance of the sweet with a slightly bitter finish. Super smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied, with medium carbonation. This is a really nice beer.","BMMillsy","Feb 11, 2015"

Roasty and toasty with a Denice palate encompassing expansive feel and a touch of out sweetness in there too. The abv is right on as well. Any bigger it would be hot and slow, but as it is it drinks easy despite being huge. It's a great cold weather four pack, and is just filling enough to be warming, but is almost refreshing when cold. These guys might be one of the best unsung breweries in the country, this is good as their hoppy stuff, which is insanely good. Nothing but excellence from these guys in my experience so far. A very distinct and well built stout. Yummy!","StonedTrippin","Oct 16, 2014"

4.57,9.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"This pours a roasty black in color with tight foam lacing atop. It has a great roast aroma full of dark chocolate & cocoa nibs. On my first sniff i picked up layers of roast, toffee, toast and roastiness but after tasting the flavor comes across on my palate, muting the complexity I found in the aroma. Don’t get me wrong, it’s just the nuances I detected while inhaling are now nuances I find on the palate. Lots of roast, lots of toast, and a wonderful dark coffee/dark chocolate flavoring. It finishes dry and goes down smoothly. Not a hoppy stout but there is a pronounced bitterness giving it definition. Thinner bodied than I tend to prefer but utterly tasty nonetheless.","elNopalero","Dec 28, 2011"
