Nose is soft but full with tones of chocolate, sweet malt and dark very ripe fruits.  First sip yields an amazing smoothness to the palate.  Creamy layers of coco and milk chocolate mixed with those same dark fruit notes that I don't normally see play this well in a stout.  This bottle had been in my cellar for over a year.  The bottle is dated 7-31-13.  I'm sure this has something to do with how smooth and well balanced this brew is.  Just simply a wonderful stout overall.","SPLITGRIN","Mar 02, 2015"

4.08,1,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"whoa, i am shocked to learn this beer is 7% abv. it felt a lot lighter to me than that, and certainly drinks more like a dry irish stout at 4% than it does as a foreign style so strong. clean looking brew, medium bodied and soil brown, with a tall head thats surprisingly light for how dark the liquid is. smells sweet like oats, and has less roast bitterness than most. there are some hops in here though, especially in the finish, giving a bit of a fruity flavor to the finish, the way lemon zest goes in espresso. similar complexion, less acidity. clean feeling beer too, only medium bodied and slick going down. the moderate carbonation is plenty, the big flavors do the talking, and its nice to listen awhile. coffee and cocoa in the finish, still think there may be some oats. overall an excellent example of the style fit for year round drinking.","StonedTrippin","Sep 24, 2014"

Very nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, light char, and light herbal hops. Decent amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, light char, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity; and good malt sweetness to bitterness balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent export stout. Great roasted flavor balance and robustness; and quite smooth to drink.

A thin cap remained, offering a touch of lace to adorn the sides. Letting the beer air out a bit, I notice the aromas are remarkably similar to the taste, so I shall combine both descriptions. Deliciously roasty, a hint of ash, blended nicely with chocolate and cream. The black patent malt is definitely in there, which is what gives the ashiness and slight tannic taste. A delicately sweet molasses finish, lasting a good moment, before giving way to trails of bitters. The texture is impeccable. I find no faults, as the carbonation is absolutely spot on, lending a smooth, creamy, and ever so slightly prickling character to the medium/heavy body. Not too thick, so it does not enter the realm of what I could consider an imperial stout. This beer is outstanding. One of the best stouts out there.

Faint aromas of char, coffee, and mild maltiness- reminds me of Kostritzer Schwarzbier. Flavors, however show a bit more intensity with firm maltiness, light caramel sweetness, with most of the emphasis on the moderate roasted grains which gives the beer a coffee, nutty, cocoa flavor.

I thought this was a well made brew, nothing was lacking.","PatandDavid","Oct 25, 2004"

4.67,15.6,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"Pelican serves this on nitro through a spinner at their brewpub. Apparently a spinner, or sparkler is a type of agitator that attaches to the tap and allows greater aeration of the beer as it flows out the spigot. On tap Tsunami is liquid black pearls, though Ive had this from the bottle and the bottled version didnt rock my world nearly so forcefully.","RedDiamond","Apr 16, 2004"
3.88,-4,4.5,4,4,4.5,3,"Similar to Shakespeare Stout but I prefer this. Ink black with brown highlights, a soft and substantial head forms but dwindles to a ring, leaving little wisps of lace down the glass. Chocolatey aroma with a charcoal roastiness. Tsunami Stout is initially quite bitter, with herbal hops leaping across the tongue. They are soon mellowed by the full, thorough roasty quality of the malts. Evocative of both the salt sprayed air of the Oregon coast, and the proliferation, nay, infestation, of espresso bars throughout the Northwest. Slight flecks of chocolate, brown sugar, licorice, and raisin flavors soon fall by the wayside as the hop bitterness returns to pair up with the burnt, huge malts. Aftertaste is creamy, chocolatey, balanced by slight mint and pine hop qualities. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, just the right amount of slippery. Drinkability a bit low for me; as with many serious stouts, patience is rewarded, and haste makes for unneccesary and unwelcome waste.","Thrasher","Apr 08, 2004"
4.36,7.9,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,4,"Wow.. what a nice roasty beer from skyhand. Pours with a nice whipped cream tan head. Pitch black body as should come from a stout. Almost, but not quite overpoweringly roastly flavor. This flavor is right on the edge for me. Its there, but not over the top. A great potential session beer. Overall, a darn good beer.","deejaydan","Mar 28, 2004"
4.51,11.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"22 oz bomber bought on my last trip to Lincoln City, Oregon. Wonderful yet slightly understated roasted dark coffee aroma..slight hint of a milky smell. Jet black in appearance with a nice sized creamy tan head. A very, very tasty stout..very milk chocoalty, cocoa taste to start..then a liquorice tinted bitterness at the end..all the time very smooith and creamy. felles excellent on the tongue. Fantastic stout..anyone fed up with those Murphy/Guiness/Beamish nitro stouts should try this beauty.","Reidrover","Jan 28, 2004"
4.08,1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a deep, dark chocolate -- opaque in the glass - -with a small, creamy mocha brown head. Smells of sweet malt, wet leather, and bittersweet chocolate. Excellent mouthfeel -- rich, chewy and full. Beautiful flavor -- woody, chocolate, toasted nuts -- with a well blended bitterness that is there, but not biting. Very drinkable for a stout of this complexity.","jtfest","Nov 04, 2003"
4.1,1.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The stream from the bottle is a cola brown that turns into black in the glass. The head is a nice size, dense, a good medium tan that lasts as a fuzzy film and laces nicely. The aroma is almost spot on. Great coffee and chocolate nose with the java being dominant. Hops are present in the aroma, but more so in the flavor. The flavor doesn't quite live up to the aromas promise being a little overwhelmed by the hops. Still an excellent stout.","aracauna","Beers"
4.18,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5," though still dark, acidic, and bittersweet. Full of lasting flavor, too. the name, however, had me anticipating a monsoon of flavor, like an Imperial Stout, and that is not the case. An excellent "regular" stout, shall we say, but one still abundant with flavor. Quite nice, actually, and remarkably similar to Guinness Extra Stout.","feloniousmonk","0"

3.98,-1.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,3,"I lugged this one all the way across the country with me from Portland and resisted it sitting in my fridge until tonight. Beautiful, dark dark dark color. Pours fairly thick with minimal head. Malty, coffeeish aroma. Beautiful taste, a WHOLE lot of malt, some coffee, a faint hint of chocolate and chicory. Dry mouthfeel, but not too dry. Semi-sweet aftertaste. This is a wonderful beer from one of my favorite breweries in the world. Darren does a great job out on the coast, I wish I weren't 3000 miles away now.","ElGordo","Sep 08, 2003"
4.16,3,5,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep midnight black color, medium tan foamy head. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. WOW! Bid full bodied Dry stout. Roasted malt flavor. Coffee and chocolate, slightly sweet at the start and then transform into a dry hoppy finish. Bid bold flavor, yet nothing is overpowering. The sweetness is balanced by the hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, more of a chocolate bitterness than a hop bitterness. Well deserving of the GABF Gold Medal. Painted/ Etched Beer bottle.","beerguy101","Apr 04, 2003"

4.5,11.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured very dark, almost black and formed a huge dark tan foam head that left lots of nice circular lace around the glass as it subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee and chocolate with some toasted/roasted elements. A flavor of malt, coffee and chocolate. A very interesting sweetness is present in the finish, yet a touch of bitterness. Almost like bittersweet chocolate. A very good stout.","Wildman","Nov 01, 2002"
4.45,10.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Completely absorbant opaque black hue. Well retained mud brown head leaves Belgian lace. Bittersweet dark chocolate, and sharp, carbonaceous roasted barley dominate the aroma, with secondary support from butterscotch diacetyl and nutty carob. Trace dryish date esters and heaty alcohol surface with a swirl. Quite appetizing in aroma. Prune laced sweetness initially in flavor is superceded by a melange of assertive burnt barley and citrus tinged hop bitterness. Chocolate malt presence melds with mellow, treacle undertones to lend an earthy, semisweet, raw cacao impression mid palate. Moderate in body, with a quasi dry, well attenuated mouthfeel. Finishes with a snap of roasted barley sharpness yielding to lingering deep, yet agreeable molasses sweetness. Tsunami stout has tremendous chocolate and roasted grain character, yet retains an elegant dryness. Delicious, satiating and quaffable.","marc77","Beers"
4.16,3,5,4,4,4,4.5,"The pour as dark as they get, head is voluminous, lace is fine sheets, both chocolate brown and both deliquesce quickly. Nose is malt, light hints of coffee, toasted grains, sweet. Front is malt sweet, the top light to medium in mouth feel. The beer finishes with mild carbonation, the hop pleasantly persistent through the droughty malt aftertaste. Quite a nice stout, drinkable and robust enough to keep my interest. Ranks #178 on my current 1000 beer master list.","Gusler","0"
