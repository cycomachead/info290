Nose is soft but full with tones of chocolate, sweet malt and dark very ripe fruits.  First sip yields an amazing smoothness to the palate.  Creamy layers of coco and milk chocolate mixed with those same dark fruit notes that I don't normally see play this well in a stout.  This bottle had been in my cellar for over a year.  The bottle is dated 7-31-13.  I'm sure this has something to do with how smooth and well balanced this brew is.  Just simply a wonderful stout overall.","SPLITGRIN","Feb 04, 2015"

4.35,7.7,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"great beer; tweener stout.  kinda a bit dry stout, kinda a bit sweet stout, and a nod to American stout.  basically, a little of everything, almost like an imperial stout just scaled down a bit.  (bottle says 7.5% and 45 IBU)  the work of a skilled brewer; well done.","udubdawg","Dec 13, 2014"
