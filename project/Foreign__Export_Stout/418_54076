4.04,-0.7,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"O-This is a very solid foreign export stout. I think this one nails many of the true characteristics of that style, while amping up the ABV just enough to put a new-world craft beer spin on it. It may not be as complex as many BA offerings, but it drinks well and the drying finish is nice change from many stouts out there.","spoony",
