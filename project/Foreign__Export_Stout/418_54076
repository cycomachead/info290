I think this one nails many of the true characteristics of that style, while amping up the ABV just enough to put a new-world craft beer spin on it.

More going on with the taste with the black coffee right up front followed by the roasted malts that leave a bitter dry finish with a good amount of smoke. Didn't last too long but it was there and a bit much for me. Really didn't taste the alcohol but you could tell it was in there. A heavy-bodied brew with perfect carbonation. It came out of the beer cooler at 36 degrees and on the side of the label it says: "Enjoy at 50-55 degrees F".

4.1,0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/9/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, light pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, light pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Good amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Foreign stout style. All around great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 09, 2014"

At the end of each swallow you don't get that satisfying, lingering good taste in your mouth.  If I saw this beer in the store I would pick up a bottle or two to drink occasionally.  It's an excellent stout, just not a "go to" stout.","ELS","Dec 07, 2014"

Something in the finish is lacking for me, perhaps not enough lingering, robust aftertaste that i prefer. This does improve as it warms however. The nose drew me in though. If you see this on the shelf its worth a shot.","Bone53","Dec 02, 2014"

Notes of tar are subtle, as is the dark fruit character, but they open as it warms. Flavor is roasty throughout, with a bitter finish that is slightly charred. Sweet chocolate upfront becomes nutty in the aftertaste. Underlying dark fruit notes of tart cherry add intrigue. It's a bit more charred and bitter than I'd prefer.","barczar","Nov 17, 2014"

Ah, classic Metallica...nothin' quite like it. ...Maybe some classic Megadeth, but this brew ain't named for no Dave Mustaine shit (make no mistake, I love Dave's work). My clear glass fades to an opaque brown-black following the pour, with more than an inch of khaki foam on top. With a sniff off the top, I ride the lightning that is the combination of roasted malts, cocoa powder, and some light smoke. Wherever I may roam, I will still recognize the taste, consisting of dark coffee, smoky cocoa nibs, a vague bit o' bitterness from the back, and a tiny hint of vanilla. The medium body, light carbonation, and smooth, dusty feel recall memories of the day that never comes (yeah, I know it sounds paradoxical, but that day is/was/will be prtetty damn sweet...). This kind of high drinkability ain't my bitch, but I wish it were. A tout le monde, trust me: this brew is mighty tasty.","TMoney2591","May 14, 2010"
3.35,-17.7,4,4,3,2.5,3.5,"Tasted from a twelve ounce bottle. Pours an opaque black with a medium light brown head which dissipates quickly but leaves plenty of lacing. Smells of super dark roasted malt with dark chocolate, coffee, and a hint of molasses and plum fruitiness. The coffee and chocolate come through on the palate with the addition of anise. There is really no sweetness whatsoever in this beer. The alcohol is kept in check until the finish, where the heat lingers for quite a while. The body is surprisingly light considering color and alcohol content, due to the lively carbonation. It seems out of place. The finish is long. Overall, this is a solid beer, but the palate throws me off, and although the flavors are spot on, the out of balance alcohol is a negative.","wedgie9","May 11, 2010"

4.17,2.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. I read in a few other reviews that this was completely black but I didn't have the same results. When initially poured it looks close to black, but when held to the light, it looks like a dark amber/brown color and looks well filtered. At first there is a slightly darker than tan head that goes away pretty quickly, no lacing to it after it goes away. In my opinion the smell is the best part, it has a lot going on, but its still good. Big time roasted chocolate malts, a very "roasty" aroma as well. There is also a very distinguishable smell of coffee as well. In the midst of all that it even finishes with a little hoppy smell. The taste is good, but doesn't balance itself quite as well as the smell does. It burned chocolate malts dominate the taste. The problem is that it's just barely too bitter for it's own good, I think it's between the coffee (likely espresso actually) and the hops. I think with some slight adjustments in the ingredients, the taste would be close to flawless. The mouthfeel is the my least favorite part of the beer. The tastes is much like a stout/ale combination which complicates the mouthfeel. It tastes much like a well hopped stout, but doesn't feel like one, it lacks smoothness. It's not bad, but it just doesn't seem right. However it does add to the drinkability factor, it's very drinkable. All in all it's a very good brew, would be outstanding with maybe some slight changes.","AndyAvalanche","May 08, 2010"

4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4.5,3,3.5,"Aggressive pour gets you two fingers of foam, plenty of larger bubbles break up overall density, medium tan in color, any lacing is super-thin rivulets. True to its name, black as coal, nothing more to say on this score. Burnt coffee, black licorice, bittersweet baking chocolate, fried fresh butter, roasted chestnuts, the nose almost starts to show some hot tar notes, invasive nostril presence, mutter of figs or dates, the hoppy kick pretty much lost until the penultimate moment. Full-bodied, even more bitter and acrid in the mouth yet, somehow, this ends up being a positive. Coffee, coffee, coffee, dark chocolate, chicory, slightly burnt breakfast biscuits, licorice, wish they added some milk and sugar rather than serve it black. The carbonation has some swirl to it but too fine to do much. No fruit nor citrus, spicy ending with pepper and cumin like flavors.

Head receeds fairly fast to just a thin film across the top of the beer and a little bit of spotty lacing clings to the glassware. Very strong aroma of coffee mostly with some burnt grains and hops. Taste is quite bitter from a mixture of hops and is heavily toasted...no, burnt grains. Lingering taste of strong black coffee and a nice dose of warming alcohol to boot. Feel is medium and has a moderate amount of carbination. I really enjoy this beer but it feels a little light and is missing more depth outside of the heavily bitter coffee/espresso character in both the aroma and the taste.","stakem","Feb 09, 2010"

Beautiful color and brown bubble clusters hanging to the side of my glass...granted, not that cool Left Hand glass in the photo, but a nice Cheeky Monk Belgian style glass. Nice swirling head...with a beer tasty enough, just looking at the bubbles can be fascinating. There's a lot in the aroma and taste, from coffee to light tobacco, chocolate, espresso, dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, yada yada... I first had this at a place called Jonesys in Denver...a neighborhood semi-fancy food drink joint with creative offerings. They have a modest but cool selection of brews, and this I hadn't had yet. I wanted a second but I was the DD with a long haul to the DenVUH suburbs....uh...have I run out of room left? How much ranting can I do?!!

There is some toast and roast along with some sweeter, lighter malts that make for quite a wide range of malty flavors. There is a definite hop bite on the back end and a bit of bready yeast somewhere in the middle. Low on the fruitiness, which seems to work well for this style. Mouthfeel is noticeably creamy and oily, but not quite viscous. Alcohol feels about what the ABV is...there, but not overpowering.

There is some bitter roasted coffee notes towards the end. The taste has an almost refreshing quality to it; it doesn't taste heavy at all. Moderate feel, lighter than most stouts. Fizzy carbonation adds to the drinkability of this brew. Quite an easy drinking stout. The roasted coffee flavors in the end make it known that this is a stout. The ABV is no where to be found.

Some delicate strands of lacing to start; however, no retention. Nose is roasty, a little sweet and suggests some lactose. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of coffee and chocolate notes. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation level and a dry finish. I haven't had too many Foreign/Export Stouts, and have found a great deal of variability in the ones I've tried. That being said, this is an incredible offering. If you like stouts and porters, seek this one out. The only disappointing thing about this beer is that it's a one-off.","Jwale73","Jan 28, 2010"

There might be some fruit flavors in there but it is too weak to provide a description. Alcohol is barely noticed. Medium body but a bit overcarbonated. The carbonation would be alright in a pale ale but seems overdone in a dark, rich beer. A nice, enjoyable stout.

Very roasted aroma, like espresso, caramelized blackstrap molasses and dark bitter chocolate. Taste is very roasty and smooth with more espresso and dark chocolate, roasted black malty sweetness, roasted vanilla bean and semi-sweet fudge.

Some alcohol heat in the throat after each swallow. Approaching full bodied and amply carbonated.

The semi thick almost syrupy stout like flavors seem to stick to the mouth and don't go away at all, like a big rich heavy stout. It does seem to finish clean otherwise, and is pretty drinkable surprisingly.

Aroma has a nice mixture of chocolate, roasted barely, smoke and light coffee. Alcohol is also coming through on the aroma. Flavor is balanced chocolate and roasted caramel, but there's nothing that really stands out here. It's well balanced between the roasty malt and hops, but nothing really shines or sings. I usually like to see a little less bitterness in an export stout and more roastiness. Mouthfeel is near full, but doesn't quite reach there and the carbonation is there in a perfect amount.
