3.41,-4.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, slight cocoa, and a weird plastic smell. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and coffee grounds. There is a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the plastic aroma I am getting from this one is odd.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 14, 2011"
