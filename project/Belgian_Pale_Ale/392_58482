A dusky orange fluid that has just a touch of cloudiness. Smell has lots of Pilsner malt and Belgian candi sugar, Hops are spicy and well developed but not overpowering. A touch of alcohol that leads to a spicy, peppery quality. Taste is superb with a big malt body that unfolds the layers of the grains in a delicious bready showcase. Candi sugar adds a refined sweetness and the hops are a wonderful surprise with an American persona. Feel is supple with a velvet carbonation and swallow. Superior drinkability makes me wish I had a bigger growler.","scootny","Jan 25, 2013"

The nose is highlighted by some pleasant esters. Aromas of granny smith apples and white wine grapes waft out of the glass, offset by a dash of clove. The flavor profile starts off with a similar nice fruity notes. Phenols assert themselves a bit more here on the back end than in the smell, and unfortunately they move past clove and have a bit of a medicinal unpleasantness to them. The body is maybe just a little full for the style, but that's a minor issue. A little bit more of a concern is the noticeably dull carbonation, it's not nearly lively enough for a good Belgian ale. Verboten isn't anywhere near being an unpleasant beer, it just misses the mark a bit for the style.","axeman9182","Sep 14, 2012"

Herbal, salty and minty, with mango, musk and lemon zest in the aroma. Smooth yet bitty; creamy but with a bitter pull. Yeasty with a semi-pungent, phenolic herbal tone. Bitterness dials in pretty high. Fruity but dulled by the bitterness, the al- cohol shows a slight warmth. Phenols want to be on top; bitter semidry finish. Intensely complex with an in-your-face bitterness and a new flavor around every corner. Quite enjoyable.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 14, 2011"

Not something I'd go out of my way for though.","Rifugium","Sep 16, 2011"

3.82,1.6,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability/overall- overall this beer would make a nice session beer to enjoy largely due to large amount of hoppiness that stops alot of the sweetness many belgians can have, I think though it creates good drinkability the only downside of this beer to me can be the hops are so dominate it probably takes away some the complexities lurking in there from the belgian yeast, and overall decent ale that would please a hop lover looking for slight belgian twist,","Stunner97","Aug 25, 2011"

Strong banana on the taste, boozy, etc. It was good, but this is me basing it off of only having two belgian pales before.

Richness to it that looked just fantastic as it warms up. Aroma of light fruit touches, hints of a light grassy touches, maybe pine. Apples and grape skin start to come to the front as it warms up and it gets a very complex touch to it. Smooth, even flavor here, really quite wonderful. Light and airy on the palate, the carbonation is spot on. Light touches of apples and bananas, hints of light peach and a delicate touch of grape are all coming out at me. Nice bready and grainy touch to it now as well, really again very well done.","mikesgroove","Jul 23, 2011"

Good aroma of stinging hops that lead to a very faint citrus scent along with musty yeast. The aroma is nice, but you gotta dig for it. Solid bitterness, medium bodied, very dry and it leaves a sticky sweetness behind. Dry wheat, biscuits, honey, mild citrus and some evergreen. Candy sugar and earthy yeast.

The taste falls through with many of the same characteristics and then hit a bit of bitterness toward the end and in the finish. Fairly plain, other than the clove character.

The head settles to a quarter inch, leaves nice lacing, and the body loses carbonation rather quickly. In the nose, light malt and spicy hops yield to fruity/phenolic yeast. Tastes of toasted malts, spicy/medicinal yeast, and a firm bitterness from the green/spicy hops. It has a medium body, with lots of carbonation that quickly ebbs, and a lingering bitterness. They call this a Belgian pale, but it almost tastes more like a saison. Either way, this is an easy to drink brew that is well-balanced and definitely worth a revisit.

The taste is bordering on Belgian IPA territory with the hop presence. More bitter than sweet. Hints of grass, yeast spice, with a slight herbal, medicinal finish.

There is a nice herbal note in the aroma and a similar character shows up in the flavor, the bitterness is excessive and exhibits a harshness that is amplified by the medicinal clove.

4.37,16.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a Delerium Noel goblet. I'm glad I was able to find a bottle of this discontinued beer on the shelves at RSVP. The beer has a golden tan color. It is extremely clear with a lot of carbonation rising. There is a big white foam head that has settled down to a finger thick layer of large bubbles. There is a little bit of lacing and plenty of visible coating left behind when I swirl the beer around. It has a great sweet malt aroma. I can detect figs, banana and toffee; it reminds me of a strong dubbel. I could smell the beer a little bit while pouring, but now that I've really taken in the aroma, I'm eager to take a sip. The beer has a big malt flavor. I can taste graham cracker, banana, alcohol and a slight astringency in the finish. It is a heavy beer with lots of coating properties. I can almost swallow a second time after I use my tongue to collect the film left in my mouth. I don't consider this a bad trait (although some might); I like a beer with a strong mouth presence. There is a good amount of carbonation; looking at the beer made me expect to feel more bubbles, but I think the heavy body tempers this quality somewhat. Considering the heavy body and ABV, I find the beer to be pretty drinkable. I would drink a number in fast succession, but I can certainly see myself working through a four pack in an evening. I'm glad this beer will be back, albeit under a different name.","ToasterChef","May 05, 2010"

With this being said I really hope that they do re-release this brew again and from what I have read it sound like they will. This brew was poured into a chalice, had a nice dull golden color, somewhat cloudy with a nice sized white head that had great retention. The bubbles in the head where reminiscent of champagne and I think this is what lead to the minimal lacing. The aroma is nice, pale malt with a nice clove and slight banana scent ... some additional fruit aromas, green apple? Hops are there and mix very well. The malt flavor comes across first and then the hop presence sets in and seems to mix well with the carbonation as it hits the side and back of the tongue. Hopes have a nice bitterness and are much more pronounced here than in the nose. Flavors of clove and banana from the yeast are there and go very well with everything. Love to find out what hop(s) they have used in this one.

While still sweet, it is more balanced against the bitter hops. There is still some yeasty flavors like banana and clove that remind you that this is a Belgian style brew but some hop presence that tell you that it was American made.

Nose is muted, but what is there is not the hoppy citrus I expect from an IPA, but does have the bread scents of a good pale ale. Mouthfeel fairly full and a little chewy, and the aste pciks up the bread and yeast malts of the nose, with just a hint of hops. Finish smooth and fairly long. Not a bad beer at all.","kimcgolf","Dec 12, 2009"

I enjoyed the earthy/bready character to the citrus bitterness and wish that balance was closer. But I definitely enjoyed this as a diversion from a typical pale ale as well as a "typical" Belgian (if one can say typical and Belgian in the same sentence). I didn't grade it as high as some primarily because of the bitter bite toward the end of each sip. This, coming from someone who is obsessed with IPAs.","BrewerMike","Dec 07, 2009"

I guess this one deserves a bit of a footnote. The hoppy flavor is very American, but adds a great deal to the overall flavor. I love that aspect of it.

Aroma consists of a strong fruit nose sustaining orange peel, coriander, & mild cherry notes. The maltiness of the Belgian style pale ale is definitely noticeable, among some toasted toffee complexities. Flavor contains an initial high carbonated bite of citris orange mixed among coriander and cherry. The fruit aspect of the beer is complex and evident. Finish provides lasting carbonation with the orange and coriander notes, but also accompanies a spicy herbal complex featuring some very mild clove notes. Aftertaste leaves a rustic coriander bite on the palate, as orange citris flavor and notes of hay and horse blanket rise up on the palate. Overall, this beer is extremely impressive, and at 6%, is very drinkable, refreshing, and flavourful. Nothing but outstanding!","jdaelhousen","Aug 27, 2009"

3.19,-15.2,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"On-tap for $5 a pint at Liberty St. Tavern in Allentown. Appeared a hazy amber with a short head. This is an interesting beer, but I get some awful off aromas that really kill it for me. Still there's a relatively big, hoppy flavor with citrus and mild pine, while the aroma hits me with dirt and cleaning solvent - not cool. This beer needs some work, but it's not a good beer yet.","tempest","Jun 10, 2009"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"An aggressive pour resulted in two fingers of rose-shaded head with good retention. Nose had a slightly perfumey accent, kind of reminiscent of Juicyfruit gum, definitely yeast-driven in its origin. The color was a hugely hazy deep-amber. The mouthfeel was full, thick, and bubbly with a very sweet bubble gum (think generic pink or Juicyfruit) flavor on the tongue. The finish lingered with that same bubble gum flavor. At 6% ABV and with its realtive lack of banana esters, I really see this as an alternative to Hefeweizen, which I dislike.","woodychandler","Jun 10, 2009"
4.25,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Bottle Pours a clear goldenrod with a good off white head. The head is frothy and diminishing. Produces good lacing. Aroma is good like juicey fruit gum. Good sweet malts with a touch of hops. The taste is good. Good carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. Has a good balance of sweet and hop. Not to sweet but sweeter than hoppy. Has light to medium body. A resiny texture. The finish is good with a quality aftertaste. I love these guys beers.","Birdiebeagle","Jun 09, 2009"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"About 7 0r 8 years ago I bought the Weyerbacher sampler case and sad to say I found it hard to finish. I swore I would not spend any more money on their products. Lately the beers I have tried, given to me by friends, have seemed much higher quality. I am happy to report that this may be the best beer they have made to date. It is hard to tell that this is not made in Belgium. I guess hard work and changes have paid off for this Brewery. As far as this beer they have nailed every aspect of the style. Congrats to Dan. And I am buying their beer again.","ejimhof","Jun 07, 2009"
4.85,29,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"On draft at TND in Wayne in 13oz wide beer flute. This is not an attempt to create a rendition of a true belgian pale ale, rather it is a "tweener" beer bridging the belgian and american pale ale styles. That said, this is a really enjoyable beer regardless of style. Funkiness of the Merry Monks yeast strain hits first then followed by a nice amount of hops flavor on the finish. The beer is zippy with flavor and carbonation and extremely refreshing. At 6% ABV, this beer is made to session.","JoePetto","Jun 07, 2009"

3.6,-4.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy yellow color with a medium sized white head. Lots of banana in the aroma right from the get go, bready yeast, clovey wheat beer like spice and a mild dosage of hops. Good flavor, definitely Belgian inspired, i like the serious malt structure here, bready again with just enough sweetness to match. IMO this beer needs more hops, i know they are going for a balanced Belgian/American Pale Ale here but a little added bitterness and crispness from another peppering of hops wouldnt hurt this beer any. None the less another solid offering from Weyerbacher and one im glad to have year round. The artwork and package design is great as well, i think this is the visual direction Weyerbacher needs to take in order to put their beer in more peoples hands.","ATPete","Jun 02, 2009"
3.95,5.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Honey orange with yellow flashes. Not much head, though a creamy collar remains. Bright, lively nose with big banana, clove phenol, and breadiness reminiscent of raw pizza dough. Flavors follow in lockstep with the nose except that it is punctuated by a pleasant tart yeast character and balanced by mineral water and New World hoppiness, all in bittering and flavor as well as some bubblegum late into the finish. I made the mistake drinking this out of the fridge too cold. Breadiness came out as it warmed. Overall, very good. It does a great job filling the niche of something interesting and sessionable that's not a lager or basic pale.","yen157","May 26, 2009"

4.01,6.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Finishes really dry and crisp. Somewhat oily as well. I actually enjoyed this one. Seems like it may be an American interpretation as the hops seem to be non tradtional and more citrusy (read: west coast USA). I really liked this, alot.
