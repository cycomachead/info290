It's not a bad beer by any means, but it tastes a lot like a handful of other summer ales I've had. It's not something I'd feel confident being able to pick out of a crowd. That said, it's still crisp like a summer ale should be and it's worth buying again when it's actually summer. I have no earthly idea why it's available in February in Pennsylvania.","bmeehan","Feb 09, 2015"

Not a lot of complexity, but it is a summer offering. At almost 7%, it's not wimpy, and has stood up to a couple of seasons gone by.","qchic","Jan 19, 2015"

The finish is ripe fruit of pears, mild spice fruit notes, Belgian yeast, has a slight dry sweet alcohol ending with mild bitterness.

3.5,-12.3,,,,,,"07/23/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Finding some taps left from a Belgian promotion I tried a taste comparison of this & d’Achouffe Houblon Chouffe, which is a triple. Due to circumstances beyond my control, (sort of), like limited funds & being dramatically close to my self imposed ABV limit, I ended up with the Ommegang. No regrets but I will be looking out for the Chouffe. It's robust flavor, body & alcohol were impressive but not of the moment. Not out of place by any means, just bad timing. It's even usurped what started a glowing review of the Ommegang. I'll be looking forward to both, equally, in the future.","seedyone","Aug 18, 2014"

4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a good example of a Belgian Pale Ale, I thought the extra hops worked pretty well with this beer and I thought it lived up to being called a Summer Ale. This beer had very good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, very crisp, slightly fizzy, not filling, refreshing and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a few of these in a row with no problem, especially on warm day and I think it makes for a good Belgian Style Summer Ale. What I liked the most about this beer was the drinkability, it was very good and I liked how refreshing it was, it's just what I look for in a summer time beer. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't a single thing that I disliked or would change about this beer, but do I wish it was just a little cheaper. I would for sure buy this beer again and I wouldn't mind keeping a few bottles around throughout the summer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes Belgian style beers. All in all I was very happy with this beer, it satisfied my urge for a nice summer time brew and I thought it really hit the spot. This isn't my favorite Belgian Pale Ale or my favorite beer from Brewery Ommegang, but I think it's very solid and as far as a Belgian Style Summer Ale this would have to be my favorite. Great job, you guys really know how to make refreshing and easy drinking Belgian Style beers, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","May 29, 2014"

Beer is smooth and sweet and real light, definitely designed for hot summer days, the floral hops give off a crispness that complements the smoothness of yeast and some other fruit (not quite tropical but more like pear) sweetness for a well balanced and composed beer.","clayrock81","Apr 24, 2014"

Aromas of pineapple, honey, pepper, biscuit, lemon, and subtle resiny bitterness. Flavors are spice forward, with a lemony sweet and tart backbone blended with biscuit notes. Hops bitterness and spice creep in at the tail end of the palate, with a more robust spice bouquet also present. Bitter and tart citrus blend into the aftertaste, with grassy and cedar notes. Light, effervescent body keeps the palate light. The finish is light, frothy, and clean, with only a hint of citrus linger. Very drinkable, and a great warm weather drinker.","GarthDanielson","Aug 19, 2013"

Floral scent, but noticeable maltiness to it as well. Taste is of a lighter floral hop with a respectable substance to it, balanced with just a bit of malt. There is a certain spiceness to it too, both in flavor and mouthfeel which makes this a unique brew. Mouthfeel is like that of a carbonated mineral water - heavier and spicier though. Aftertaste is more yeasty with a hit of floral hops but quickly fades and doesn't continue to develop. Overall recommended.","srv33","Aug 11, 2013"

4.09,2.5,4.25,4,4,4.25,4.25,"on tap at the source, this very light Belgian summer beer is just what the doctor ordered after a long drive through the eastern new your countryside. it pours a pale golden color, more yellow really, with a fair bit of suspended sediment and a huge creamy white head that is continually rising rather than falling. I smell grassy hops, very light wheat malt, and the slightest spice kick. the taste is quite herbal, with the hops giving more flavor than bitterness, and the malt being light enough to allow this awesome Belgian yeast to be prominent. the finish is really clean, and the alcohol is very well hidden. the lightness in feel of this beer impressed me the most, and the floral and herbal profile of the hops is a nice seasonal touch. carbonation on par with the rest of the ommegang lineup. this is an excellent summer drink, also really fantastic with a splash of the fruitesse raspberry beer that's also on tap at the brewery. ommegang can do no wrong.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

The look reminded me a lot of Duvel, but the floral hoppy smell was evocative more of an IPA. Besides the hops, there were spicy, dusty smells imparted by the house yeast strain. The taste was a great combination of typical Belgian Pale Ale flavors, of banana, papaya, melon, and white pepper, and a distinctive hop character. The finish was somewhat tart, and spicy. The body was light and alcohol well hidden. A very easy to drink beer with a refreshing take on the style.","rajendra82","Jun 22, 2013"

Pleasant aroma of biscuit malt and fresh citrus hops, light Belgian yeast. Flavor is semi-sweet biscuit malt, citrus hops, light lemon citrus, light pear; finishes drier with the hops, Belgian spicing and peppery herbs coming to the fore. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A nice melding of American IPA hops and malt with classic Belgian components. Great with dinner. Ommegang continues to be a consistently fine brewer of Belgian inspired ales.","LiquidAmber","Jun 21, 2013"

It has all of the complexity of a tripel without the strength of a tripel. The only aspect I'd like to see enhanced in this beer is the hop character. It would be interesting to see this pale ale with more late addition hops that add similar spicy notes as Bravo (like Saaz). But it's a beer that will quench any palate on a warm summer day. In fact, it might be the perfect beer for that purpose.","parejkoj","Jun 12, 2013"

Pours cloudy golden straw color with a 3 finger dense and fluffy white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, light banana, pepper, clove, bubblegum, wheat, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of hop and yeast ester notes. Taste of tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, pepper, clove, bubblegum, light banana, floral, grass, wheat, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, light banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, floral, grass, wheat, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop and yeast ester flavors; with moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly cream, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent hoppy Belgian pale ale! Great balance and complexity of hop and yeast flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 09, 2013"

At times, fuzzy and rich enough to suggest a tripel, but then it lightens as it dries like a very nice Belgian pale - from a little known "region of Belgium beer-brewing" called Cooperstown, NY.

The nose is rather potent with big notes of lemon rind, a slight bubblegum, fruit cocktail, and a bit of yeast. The taste is way more potent than expected packing in the American IPA citrus hop punch to the jaw (and residual hop breath obviously), with great yeast presence and a spicy finish. The mouthfeel is relatively light bodied and drinkable with a hoppy (but not bitter), yeasty (but not bready nor gum bally), slightly floral, semi-dry, tangy aftertaste that leaves me wanting more. I can't get past how drinkable this beer is. This is all that I want in a session-esque DIPA (minus the body/sweetness) mixed with an approachable Belgian golden ale. Very lovely beer and will likely not disappoint those looking for hops, yeast, or a delicious hybrid.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 07, 2013"

Plenty of lacing is left behind on the side of the glass. The aroma is of pilsner malt and lots of floral hops with some citrus in the nose as well. I also get some peppery notes with clove and maybe a bit of a tropical fruit note. The flavors are quite complex and live up to the bright nose. I get the floral hops, citrus, tropical fruits, pepper, and bready pilsner malt along with the banana and clove flavors from the yeast. It has strong saison like characteristics in the flavor and everything comes together excellently. The body is medium with strong carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry and this is a very refreshing summer beer despite clocking in at near 6.8% ABV. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","May 15, 2013"

Upon first smelling the beer, I thought that it was a combo Belgian and Hefe...it had that sweetness you would expect from the Belgian, but with a banana, pepper and clove and a hint of citrus. The taste followed the nose really well and I really enjoyed the taste. Perhaps combining two of my favorite styles. The beer had a lighter feel than expected, but this did not detract from the beer as it still had a nice smooth, almost creamy feel. It had a clean, dry finish. Overall, another stellar beer from one of the best in the land.","PhillyStyle","May 13, 2013"

Sharp hoppy attack up front, lemon zest and soft bready malt in the middle. Finish is dry, with a pleasant bitter, black pepper flavour. This beer bears more than a passing resemblance to Saison DuPont. Subtle malt, citric hops, faint black pepper and bitter dry finish. Well done Ommegang, I'm a fan.","mjryan","May 07, 2013"

4.17,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Hazy gold, big build of white foam that deflates into random clumps. Sharp but unique hoppiness - prominent lime, spring flowers, clean herbal spice. Malt is simple - clean, crisp pale malt, crackery wheat. Some light spice and fruit from the Belgian yeast but it pretty much stays in the background and lets the hops shine. Bitterness is smooth despite the bright hop flavors. Dry. Really dry and crisp. A really tasty beer for warm weather drinking. Bright, juicy hops combined with the clean and dry finish lend superb drinkability.","bump8628","May 06, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, and Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with floral and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and somewhat medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a really nice balance between the hops and the Belgian aspects in the aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 29, 2013"

It's not overly hoppy as one would think by the description on the label. It's kinda like a mix between a saison and a Belgian pale ale, with added hop notes. A nice blend of malt, tart, hay, funk, and hops. Not overly doing it in any category.","lsummers","Apr 26, 2013"

3.96,-0.8,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Overall: The subtitle “summer ale” says it all. This is a very good BPA from a brewery that consistently produces solid beer. Given that there were no reviews up for it, I took the chance on this one, and I do not regret it in the slightest. The beer is very balanced and very refreshing, and it is perfectly suited to drinking on the porch on a warm day; the problem is that I would like it to be less balanced and more hop forward in order to live up to the name and the hop that is the logo. The 6.8% is a bit high for what is essentially a quaffer, but you do not taste that at all. Give this a shot, if only to have another nice summer beer with a bit of a different flavor profile alongside the typical pale ales and weizens. 15.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","0"
