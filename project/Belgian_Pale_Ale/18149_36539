It has a nice nose. A fairly good amount of hops: mainly grapefruit and pine. A little bit of pepperiness and yeast. The taste is very good. It has a bit of a bite. Citrus and earthiness, some pepper, yeast and breadiness. Nice.","Boto","Feb 21, 2015"

The taste of the beer had a good bitterness to it that left a sharp tingle in the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel was light and drinkable, good crisp carbonation with a dry finish.

Enjoy the clove, banana, and small hint of hops. Also catch a lot of the yeasty flavor. Mouthful works and and is an easy drinker.

The scent seems to be like I'm about to dive into a well-balanced Belgian-style pale. Scent is not too misleading...Although not as well-balanced as I was assuming, the flavors are spot on with the aroma. Lovely citrus notes met with hoppy esters and Belgian yeast. Hints of clove, green apple, and banana cling to the palate along with a bit of bubblegum. Mouthfeel is light bodied and well carbonated. Drinkability is high. Overall, I feel this is a solid example for this style.

No strong or outfront smells to the beer, but some hints of malty notes. The beer has malty and fresh hop flavors, with a finish more similar to lagers. Oddly enough, the beer has a mouthfeel similar to a blonde; round and full in mouth. The lager-esque finish is very crisp, and while typical for a pale, it is very different following the robust mouthfeel.","GarthDanielson","Dec 28, 2010"

Aroma hints of funky yeast notes, citrus herbal tones pale malt derivatives. A nice version of a BPA fruity undertones with funky yeast profile and hops equals perfection when done right. Flavor brings out a bit of band aid/horse blanket funkiness once the yeast is poured in, but more citric, herbal hops with spicy belgian yeast and pale malt sweetness equates to a good time. Mouthfeel is effervescent with carbonation medium bodied finish is a bit plastic/band aid just a touch but not enough to offend it actually works with the other flavors going on. Drinkability overall is effortless the 6% range is working for these bottle conditioned ales I wish more came in this packaging.

There is also the yeast/grassy notes that come through, almost like a saison. This was a great beer to drink on a hot day, a little on the dry side, but the lower ABV, makes it a great session beer, a little on the expensive side ($12) i think i paid for this one, still better than a bottle of white wine, looking forward to trying more from the lost abbey","bonbini26","Apr 28, 2009"

A thin layer of stick holds on to the sides of the glass throughout making this a really nice looking Belgian ale. Smell consists of apples, honey, and yeast. A dash of pepper and some sweet pear in the nose as well. Hops play a very limited role in the aroma, but some earthy notes can be detected. Taste starts off pretty sweet with red apples, apricot, and white grapes. Midway the Belgian yeasts emerge with some spice and dry pepper. Aftertaste is fairly dry with some honey and lemon that linger on the tongue. Light to medium body with a prickly feel and a lively carbonation. Overall the sweetness is a bit much to handle, it's borderline cider. Not bad, but could use some balance. Looking forward to trying the brett version I received from Alex as well.

3.58,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Originally reviewed June 20 2007. 750ml Bottle. Poured a hazed deeply hued gold, with a beautiful sheet of white lace cascading down the glass and floating like sea foam. Aroma was surprisingly subdued, even served at 55 degrees. Kept to some minimal peach and pale Asian fruit minglings. Flavor started as a lovely, soft bready malt flavor, backed with warm yeast notes and cacophony of quieted spices. Gentle and gliding. Crescendo into a furious clamor of syrupy hop flavor, that from the bottle has been heavily subdued. The taste from the tap was more of fresh, sticky hop cones, dripping with resin and a combination that propelled apparent European noble hops into court with the finest that Americas West Coast could show. However, here in bottle condition form the bombastic quality is more subdued into a calming amalgam of hop tea, sliding over the wheaty malt feel. Then, bad things happen. A distinct, harsh Styrofoam note cuts the hop loving short, with a thunderous clap. Infection? Yeast amok? Whatever, its incongruous and creates a biting acerbic quality that is alarming. Somehow, the beer recovers. The smacks sups long and pleasant as almond skins, warm toast and graham cracker caress the palate long after the fact. Further down the bottle, Lost Abbeys mineral yeast signature brighten up and give the beer a little break, with a long breath. Wonderful carbonation and delightful quaffable heft. Were it not for the disconcerting and marked Styrofoam, this would be a more heralded specimen.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 15, 2007"

It just dominates my taste buds and almost becomes one dimensional but I just can't help taking further sips. Good drinkability here? More than good.It kind of reminds me of De Ranke XXX only with more bitterness. It's like I'm drinking hop juice. I kid you not.

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Finished the bomber myself at lunch, I was tempted by the relatively lower ABV. It was a good pale Belgian and unique.","Sammy","Oct 13, 2007"
3.46,-10.4,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Very clear pour, color is pale orange and very clean, no haze at all. Aroma is light and floral with a touch of citrus. Flavor is a very smooth with a really clean aftertaste of green apple/honey/wheat/malt. Low in alcohol and very easy on the tongue.","ChazMania","Oct 11, 2007"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This bottle came straight from the brewery so it was pretty fresh. Nice golden color, hazy with a somewhat funky aroma. The taste was clean, a little funk, some tart fruity flavors also.The mouth-feel was smooth. I was glad my cousin popped this bottle because it wasn't on tap at the brewery.","ArrogantB","Sep 30, 2007"
3.58,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D- This is very drinkable in that it goes down easy but it isnt one i'd have more than once if there were other choices.","Lothore","Sep 20, 2007"
4.13,7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Last swigs: Reminds me a tad of Orval without the funk. Quite impressive for an American Brewery to create such a spot on Belgian. Kudos to Lost ABeey!","blitheringidiot","Sep 19, 2007"
4.13,7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D- Light and smooth belgian ale that is surprisingly hoppy for the style, but not for the SoCal location, like most all of Lost Abbey offerings, this is a very solid and worthy offering, I am a bigger fan of the stronger styles, but this is a nice hoppy Belgian offering that is not too overwhelming in terms of abv","Stoneman78","Sep 13, 2007"
4.42,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Could drink a lot of this, and the one pint was definitely not enough","Floydster","Sep 13, 2007"
4.28,10.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a rich clear golden with slight orange tint, and an airy spider web-like head. At a fairly cold temp, earthy hops in smell, some pale malt breadiness. The taste has a lot of earthy hops, maybe a lot of that earthiness is from the 3 yeast blend. The taste also come across mineraly, though when it warms up substantially that mineral character goes away and you get a lot of sweetness with no bitterness. I liked this a little more from the tap at the brewery as that is probably a bit fresher, but this 3 month old bottle isn't too shabby at all.","MiScusi","Sep 03, 2007"
4.45,15.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Minerally mouthfeel in a very good way. Thought provoking even at this ABV. Highly digestible. Balanced. Beautiful. I can only think of a couple American breweries that consistently impress me with their Belgian inspired brews (Russian River, Ommegang & Allagash) and Lost Abbey is certainly making a name for themselves in my book.","bosco7","Aug 30, 2007"
4.32,11.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Upon the swallow your mouth is left with the memory of the bitter grapefruit peel hops and a warming alcohol presence.","IntriqKen","Aug 26, 2007"

3.5,-9.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability- Think this one should be labeled under the Belgian IPA category. A bit too much hops for me, but otherwise, drinkable and fairly interesting.","GClarkage","Aug 08, 2007"
4.42,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I had a pretty good idea that Devotion would be good beer, I just didn't think it would be quite this good. It's still waaay too early to say for sure (let me drink the handful of Port offerings that are biding their time in my cellar first), but this brewery has a chance to be one of my favorite sources for Belgian-style beer in this country.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 07, 2007"
4.42,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"There was a forceful pop when I pulled the cork, but no foaming. The beer was a hazy light amber colour with a full, off-white head of foam. Good retention and lots of fine bubbles clung to the glass. The aroma was mild overall, but more complex than I initially thought, particularly as it warmed. Hints of malty caramel and pears gave way to a pleasing vanilla aroma, lemony citrus, and earthy apple skins. Yeast character was very subdued, taking a backseat to the fruitiness. The flavour emphasized bready malt, along with a fresh grassy hop bitterness that rounded out the finish. Hints of fruit, lemon zest, and mild spice played in the background. Just the slightest bit of warmth followed the beer, which was just off-dry on the palate. Medium/light bodied, the texture was a mix of creaminess and lively carbonation. An excellent beer overall. Highly drinkable with complexities that were only apparent if you went looking for them. If you have an opportunity, definitely try it.","DrJay","Aug 05, 2007"
3.21,-16.8,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Nice looking beer that poured golden with a huge fluffy white head that stuck around. Some clumpy lacing. The smell was less impressive- somewhat light. There was a light graininess with a touch of floral hops and the barest whiff of banana and orange. The beer is surprisingly tasteless. Somewhat similar to the smell, with floral hops and light graininess up front, followed by some light fruit. The flavors are a little brighter than the smell but lack an edge. Curiously bland. Mouthfeel is a little better, and the beer is smooth and relatively light bodied. It lacks a creaminess that would have been a nice touch. I'm not all that impressed with this beer, but I've liked the other Lost Abbey beers I've had.","Georgiabeer","Aug 03, 2007"
4.09,6,5,3.5,4,3.5,5,"D: A great drinking beer, with a simple hoppy and herbal character, another great one from the Lost Abbey, very rustic, a great thirst quencher.","Halcyondays","Aug 01, 2007"
4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Belgian bomber, caged and corked and w/o frashness or bottling info..Pours light hazy apricot, under an off white head, initially showing puffy retention then softening to a thin tiny bubble film, this one leaves nice tiny bubble webs of lacing. Tropical fruit nose, melons, honey, bananas. Another highly enjoyable Lost Abbey offering. More tropical fruits, white pepper, honey, yeasty spice, some light earthy mustyness and then a dry subtle hoppy finish. One of my seamingly many "favorite styles" and this one nails it. Bring on the salads, cheese, shell fish, crusty bread or just about whatever type of food you want and enjoy it with this high quality brew.","Billolick","Jul 25, 2007"

Great golden color and awesome texture. Crisp and refreshing. Beer has many flavors and the mouth feel is great.Made my day much better.","AdamB84","Jul 04, 2007"
3.92,1.6,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer is fine, but I can't say I was overly impressesd. It's qutie drinkable, and I guess could pass as a Belgium Pale Ale. A decent beer, but just not all that great when compared to some of the other offerings I sampled from Port Brewing.","John_M","Jun 22, 2007"
3.8,-1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Not a lot of hubbub going on in this brew, I was hoping for more hops, alcohol, and funk. The bitterness lingers almost to the point of being a detraction without more hop flavor or funk to back it up.","brewandbbq","Jun 20, 2007"

3.91,1.3,5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Overall: I would like this beer more if it didnt have that off flavor. I have had it before, and I know that it is not just from a bad bottle. It reminds me of some of my homebrews that didnt got possibly slightly contaminated.","OStrungT","Jun 09, 2007"
3.58,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Opening smell is light, spicy, and a bit of yeast in the nose. Good but not spectacular. Something a bit sour or off with it, which shows up in the taste. Malty beer with a winey, oily Belgian feel, a bit heavy, and full of spice from the hop but out of balance for me. The two didn't match very well for me, even a bit grassy or overwhelming in the hop. On the back that "Rumor is that some of the monks love hops" hints at a hoppy version of the Belgian single but this doesn't work for me. Good beer, well made, just missed the mark a bit.","FightingEntropy","Jun 05, 2007"

3.2,-17.1,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Notes: A beer on its own island. This doesn't reflect the norm of belgian pale and it teeters on becoming lagerish in smell and taste. Spices pull it together. Just ok for me.","DogFood11","Jun 03, 2007"
