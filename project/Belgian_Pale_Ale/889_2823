Rather clean nose of light caramel malts and light mild hops.  Flavors are sweet up front with a hair of bittering to the back.  A little light bread flavor comes through the aftertaste.  Good carbonation makes for a lively effervescent mouth feel.  A decent session Belgian pale, but nothing too exciting.","Brutaltruth","Jan 03, 2015"

Aroma of bready and caramel malt, light overripe stone fruit, Belgian yeast, a hint of toffee. Flavor is a lighter version of the aroma with a similar mixture of flavors, but rather attenuated. Light to medium bodied. Hits all the notes for a Belgian pale, but the flavor is light and rather bland with the semi-sweet malt dominating the fruit flavors despite being light itself. I'll hope this is an old bottle, else this is one of the more underwhelming Belgians I've tasted. Satisfactory, with no off-notes, but nothing I'd ever try again.","LiquidAmber","Oct 26, 2014"

3.6,8.8,,,,,,"O: Is it a watered down Belgian or a glorified AA Lager??? I lean towards the later in spite of its classification and that way I am not disappointed.  Not nearly the gusto, flavour and impressiveness of others in this category such as Orval, or Petrus.  From that perspective it leaves much to be desired.  Its not as good as a De Konninik, also in this category.  However, I was expecting Labatts and was pleasantly surprised this went beyond that.  Worth a try but not too many accolades from me.  Would go well with pressed sandwiches that are still hot.","patre_tim","Sep 16, 2014"

3.63,9.7,,,,,,"Sampled a pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A light golden amber with a half-finger or so of white bubbles on top. Aroma largely fruity, apple, pear, and peach notes yielding a gummy bear-like effect that is accompanied by a light orange and lemon rind citric note. I am puzzled by the lack of spicy notes on both nose and palate. This is a Belgian ale, correct? Drinks light and fizzy like a lager or macro-brewed pale ale, bubblegum fruity and slightly floral. Semi-dry and almost no Belgian yeast phenols, although Micheal Jackson writes that the Palm yeast strain yields a dry orange character and I can certainly taste that here. Some of this citrus carries over into the semi-dry finish. Forgettable when compared to many other Belgian brews although enjoyable enough on a hot patio.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 28, 2014"

No, this doesn't stack up well compared to the heavier hitters and Trappist beers that fall into this category but as a starter, this worked out fine for me. Some more spice and strength would have enhanced this nicely but I'll probably give this a go again soon, only because it's warm out and it's nice to have a "light" take on a style that can be quite heavy at times!","JerzDevl2000","Jul 04, 2014"

Mild to sweet smelling, and doesn't have a prescence of high alcohol. No flavoring at the finish. This beer lacks in the taste department.

OCCASION: celebrating the unseasonably warm afternoon of football, Christmas lights and fun with my sons... APPEARANCE: opaque, deep golden amber body with a soft, foamy thin white head that rings uniformly; lacing is cirrus cloud and ocean crest... AROMA: aromatic, fruity--sour apple and tart candy... PALATE: light, fizzy as cider; possesses some staying power in the mouth, but rather dry like champagne...TASTE: mildly tart and pleasantly crisp with little exchange of flavor in the exhale; an underlying hint of lager malts, but inevitably this is a clean basket of fruit with enough hops to hint at an ale...OVERALL: This has to be one of those handful of brews I have passed numerous times, always intending to try and never quite trying; its inclusion in the "Great Beers of Belgium" forced my hand, and I am pleased to find it a serviceable, light, cheaper version of Unibroue's wonderful Ephemere (which announces its apple right up front); a single notch below the Estaminet pilsner in the sample, and two below the Rodenbach--but beer drinking isn't really a competition, right?...","dacrza1","Nov 15, 2013"

2.23,-32.6,3.25,2,2,3.5,2,"Overall I thought this beer was pretty disappointing and I don't think it's a good example of the style, the Belgian Pale Ale aspects that I like about this style were on the light side and there were just too many off flavors for this to be a decent beer. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down smooth and the body was on the lighter side, but the flavor didn't hold my attention and I was over it after the first couple sips, if I had to I could drink a few of these, but there's nothing about this beer that makes me want to grab another, so one is more than enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only aspect of this beer that I thought was fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the flavor and aroma, they both weren't good with too many off flavors and aromas. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's pretty easy to find a much better Belgian Pale Ale, it was pretty inexpensive and now I know why, not recommended to anyone. All in all I was pretty let down with beer, it wasn't what I expected and the added metallic and skunky flavors and aromas really hurt this beer. This was my first experience with Palm and it made for a poor first impression, I'm still down to try more of their brews, but after this one I for sure won't be in a hurry to. So far this is my least favorite Belgian beer, it needs a lot of work.","StoutHunter","Feb 15, 2013"

No odor or nose to speak of either. I kept wanting a hint of flavor- but practically no grain and no hopping evident. Watery mouthfeel too. As the menu had no prices for drinks, I had to ask the waitress what I was paying for this beer- hoping it wasn't a $6 pint- she assured me it was only $3. You get what you pay for and I won't make the mistake of ordering this again. As a fan of Belgian beers from Gulden Draak to Maredsou to Kwak, this beer delivered nothing of the character or malty goodness of those- a bit of research online shows this to be another Inbev disaster which means to find it on-tap at a mainstream bar means this is Budweiser product.

The beer had a light feel to it, but had good carbonation. The beer was very easy to drink and was crisp and refreshing. Overall, a decent beer, and one that I would probably pick before your typical mass brewed American beers.","PhillyStyle","Jul 06, 2012"

The aroma has just a hint of caramel malt with some grassy hop in the background, some earthy tones as well along with bread. The taste is smooth, nice and easy drinking with some more of that caramel malt and a hint of lemony hops, more bread and a slightly metallic finish. The beer is light/ medium bodied with nice carbonation and a slightly dry finish.

3.3,-0.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Served from tap into a tulip. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, earth, earth hop, and caramel hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, cream, and caramel hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. I had heard quite a bit about this one from numerous people, but I have no idea why they were raving over this one. The aroma and flavor on this one were very weak in intensity. There were some good notes in the aroma, but you had to work so hard to find them it was ridiculous. The flavor on the otherhand wasn’t bad, but it was definitely average for the style as nothing stood out at all. Worth trying, but I doubt I will be doing so again.","thagr81us","Jul 02, 2012"

There are so many high quality Belgian pale ales out there to compare it to, and the ones I have tried all compare favourably to this. The relative blandness makes it easy to throw back quickly, but most people who bother will probably find it to be an almost completely forgettable glass of beer.

The aroma was mostly euro pale-lager malts with the typical strong emphasis on grains and a light undertone of adjunct grains. The flavors were, well, exactly like the aroma suggested. Not exactly Belgium’s finest. Still, it was not unpleasant in any way, just right down the middle and what it lacked in complexity it made up for in drinkability.

Flavor wise is very much like any boring amber ale but with a heavy price tag in this case it was like 7.50 for a standard pour in a signature glass. Semi sweet grassy herbal hops a bit of caramel biscuit malt backing it all up let me down a very one dimensional snooze alert flavor profile.

The flavor brings more of the same. It's not awful, but the malt profile is wrong for the style and the overall impact is still a bit dull. The beer's got a little bit of body to it, just enough heft for the style. The carbonation's not ideal for the style, it's a little bit light, but it's still got enough presence to be serviceable.

Nose is nothing special - somewhat macro-esque with a suggestion of pale malts, a light citrus character and a skunky quality.

Couldn't tell if the metallic bitterness was from the hops or possibly crystal malt, either way it was flat. Coincidentally, the beer was not. It was very carbonated.

Very common beer in Belgium, most of any bar you walk into will cary it so it is not the most complex beer out there but certainly worth a try.
