Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of peach, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, banana, tangerine, pear, apple, floral, grass, clove, pepper, light pine, light honey, and floral/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great citrus/tropical hop complexity with a moderate yeast and malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big peach, pineapple, mango, tangerine, banana, lemon zest, orange zest, clove, pepper, pine, floral, grass, bread, light honey, and floral/yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy tartness and spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, pineapple, citrus zest, banana, clove, pepper, pine, floral, grass, light honey, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of hop and yeast flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian pale ale! All around great balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

Noting the bubbles, the ale was aggressively carbonated while leaving lacing on the sides of the glass. In the aroma, it smells quite biscuity with mild Earthy notes. In the initial taste, the beer is citrusy, with notes of yeast, biscuit, and mild pine. The carbonation does not allow the initial taste to linger for a significant duration. In the aftertaste, it evolves into a more dry taste with hints of grape skin and biscuit. At this point, this is mild favorite from revolution being an easy drinker with a complex taste.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 24, 2013"

This brew drinks like an IPA: fresh, hoppy,, and crisp... only difference is that Belgian twinge at the end. This provides a touch of spice that pairs well with residual hop bitterness.

The nose comprises orange zest, grapefruit zest, mild pine sap, light pineapple, light black pepper, and a touch of what seems to be passion fruit. The taste brings in more of the same, though the pine is a bit more assertive, and the Belgian yeast kicks in a bit more, adding some mild notes of black pepper, clove, and cardamom, while also bringing out some of the more lemon-y tones from the hops. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice BPA, with some tastily bright hops, but I do kinda wish the Belgian yeast were more prominent. Oh well, it works well enough now...","TMoney2591","Sep 16, 2012"
