4.01,12.6,3.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"I'm a big fan of Belgian style beers and what I can say about this beer is that it tastes good but its missing the wow factor. It is light or liquid in its mouthfeel which just doesn't make it feel like an iconic Belgian beer but its delicious and so easy to drink. I think this is the PERFECT way to describe this beer... It is the evolution of BMC (Bud, Miller, Coors) beers. If you know someone who likes BMC beers I can't imagine that they could dislike this beer. I'd venture that this would be the best beer they ever drank. That might sound like a weird way to describe the beer but it reminds me of a light beer like (BMC) but with the outstanding flavor of a Belgian beer mixed together. So it is light and effervescent but also flavorful. It stands at a nice 6.8% alcohol too. This would be great in the summer time or warmer weather. I was able to get it for about $2.50 per bottle, which is just too much for what it is. If it was offered for $1.50 per bottle (in a six pack) I could see myself buying this beer at parties for groups of people since I know everyone could drink it. From beer snob to a BMC drinker. The more I drank it the more I liked it. The first sip I wasn't blown away, but by the end of it I felt like a monk gave me his blessing. :-)","Fear4Beer","Feb 01, 2015"

Pours a lovely tangerine-colored hue with a slight haze to the clarity and a frothy, 3/4 inch bright white head that eventually settles into a consistent slick.  Nose is very much akin to a witte - citrus and belgian yeast.  Taste follows nose; however, the fruit comes off a bit more candied in the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light), with a pleasant, lively carbonation.  All and all, simple and somewhat clean, but quite pleasant.","Jwale73","Aug 20, 2014"

2.48,-30.3,3.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,"This was my first beer from Utah and hopefully the rest aren't like this one. It started out kind of nice, with it's very fluffy head and super cloudy body. Then it just went down hill from there. The smell was pretty much average for the style, except it lacked the alcoholy hint in it. The taste was pretty much blah. Nothing really stood out to write about. The mouthfeel was more of a champainge than a beer. It was really bubbly and thin on the palate. Nothing to get excited about, but it's another state in the annols of beer reviews.","JISurfer","Sep 05, 2005"

3.62,1.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale, lightcrystal, and bisquit malts. It also has a fruity yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes bitter and a bit earthy. There is some malt complexity here, but the dry, earthy finish diminishes the overall taste. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a low/medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a different tasting Belgian brew. I like the complexity, but the overall flavor needs some work.","WesWes","Jul 20, 2005"
3.7,3.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability is good easy to drink goes down smooth, would be great summer brew. Overall probably wouldn't chose again if a better pale was available. Picked this up at the Vintage Cellar strange it only has two reviews prior to this one.","mntlover","Apr 23, 2005"
4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"First off, I cannot believe someone else has tried this brew. I guess it's a new brewery. Dated 10/28/05, I like this when a brewery puts a date. Pours a nice golden yellow with a real nice head which lingers alittle while. There's a nice trace of lacing left for the whole duration. Has a wheat/malty scent with a nice light-medium body. Never had a Belgian Pale Ale before, so I cannot comment on that, but it does remind me of a Hefe-Weizen. This is a very social brew.","Wasatch","Beers"
3.33,-6.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Maybe a slight haze, but mostly clear golden copper body with a thick, steady, off-white/cream head. Tangy Belgian malt aroma, with light sugar sweetness, spices (maybe some clove or nutmeg), and a sourdough yeastiness. Taste light crisp wheat malt up front. Faint candyish sweetness barely registers. Kind of grainy and tannin-astringent mid-palate, followed by yeast and carrot cake spiciness. Moderate bitterness with lingering tannin astringency into the finish. Not bad at all. Light-medium bodied with adequate carbonation. A little grainy, and thin, but not a bad Belgian-inspired session ale.","alexgash","0"
