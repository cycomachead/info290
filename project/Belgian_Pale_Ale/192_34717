An interesting beer, something that seems it would be nice on occassion, but not full time, a real winner for a seasonal. Not much belgian about it to me, which is not necessarily a negative, but something of note for the style.","harrymel","Apr 06, 2013"

The nose is initially malty followed by some nice hop spiciness, even some really faint citrus notes, and then piney hop notes....good stuff. The taste is good follows the nose, first malty sweetness, then the hops kicks in followed by a weird kind of bitterness, wormwood. The mouthfeel is unique...dry finish with a strange bitterness. I really like this offering.","aquaderek","Apr 24, 2008"

The taste is pretty spicy, slightly oaky with some pine, hops, lemon zest, oranges, cloves all coming together into a well-ballanced and unique flavor. There is a moderate amount of carbonation, a medium body and a dry finish. This is my kind of session beer - highly refreshing and still with unique flavor. Good beer.","dogger6253","Apr 24, 2008"

This beer is similar, but not quite, to others I've had from New Belgium. The feel in my mouth was one that left my tongue wanting another sip, ever so slightly dry. This is a nice well rounded beer with all of its assets in place and not overstated. It's smooth, flavorful and has "beer" written all over it.

Smells a bit fruity, but not excessively so. That could be the Goji Berries perhaps? Also seems to have a bit of non hoppy sourness. Feels a bit thicker in the mouth than the color would lead you to expect, but that may be due to the oats used in the recipe. All around, this is a very drinkable, not overly sweet or sour, or bitter. A very well balanced brew. I'll have to definetly pick up some more of this. It's quite good!","BigJTrucker","Mar 07, 2007"

Slow moving tails of carbonation rise. Aromas are light and of white fleshed fruits, a bit of lemon and a touch of spicy hops. The taste starts a bit sweet with a soft, smooth body. Some ripe pear flesh fills in the middle and an gentle herbal hop element carries through the finish which has a nice crispness that makes this highly drinkable. A lemon-citric tartness that is also slightly medicinal becomes evident as it warms slightly, further increasing the drinkability. Medium-light body with fine carbonation. The label indicates that Goji berries, wormwood, and schisandra were used, and while I have no idea what they specifically taste like, they worked well. Super sessionable.","hopsaplenty","Mar 07, 2007"

The aroma is a hint of light fruit, followed by the citrus aroma of the hops. The taste is exactly what I imagined the style would taste like. There is more of a sweetness to this style, with less of a bite from the hops. I makes for a smooth fruity citrus finish. Light mouthfeel. This is very enjoyable!

It's got a pale, hazy yellow body with not much of a head. The nose has a strong lemon scent. You'd expect a sharply sour acidic taste from the smell of it, but the flavor, while being heavy on the citrus side is not sharp or bitter at all.

Poured a cloudy light yellow with a large and very foamy white head that diminished fairly quickly and left moderate lacing. Nose is mostly hops, with a little citrus that seems mostly lemon or grapefruit, spices, and flowers. Body is surprisingly rich and flavor is a combination of hops and some odd spices I cannot identify. It is supposed to contain wormwood, and maybe that contributes to the sligthly bitter touch that does not seem like hops that shows in the finish. This is a very unique brew and if you approach it with that expectation it is OK. Basically this is a decent brew with a very unique bouquet and flavor . You have to give New Belgium credit for experimenting.","rkuhnel","Feb 27, 2007"

Pale yellow with a frothy white head. Aroma is more livelly , with some ginger aspects, citric in character, and some fruity tones. Very balanced and unexpectedly "thick" flavours ,given the appearance. I suppose the oats lend to the slickness, and the herbs certainlly leave a strange medicinal/bitter flavour underneath. Weak hopping, though they do show up in the after taste. Rather odd and full on the palte, low carbonation. A rather strange beer, but I liked it. Quite drinkable.

Taste is of sweet bananas and that Belgian funk, this gives way to a berry flavor, perhaps the Goji berries this is brewed with, although I am unfamiliar with this berry, also known as the Wolfberry according to my research, and there is a spice present throughout.
