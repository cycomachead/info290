3.96,19.3,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"Brew pours a golden-honey in color with a small white foamy head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the glass. The aroma is of Belgian yeast along with some light fruit, maybe pears. The taste pretty much follows the nose with some light foral hops in the mix also. Very smooth and goes down easy. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Lighter bodied with medium carbonation. Overall a tasty brew.","BeerWithMike","Feb 25, 2015"

Samuel Adams Belgian Session is a filtered brew you can see right thought it. The smell is rich with grains and some bitterness. So far this brew is doing well. Now for the taste; it is smooth real smooth and light. It is crisp, but you do pick up on some spices in this brew. The mouthfeel is nice an refreshing and clean. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Samuel Adams did a nice job with this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew 4.5 out of 5. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Aug 02, 2014"

3.47,4.5,4,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Single bottle from a mixed pack poured into a tulip glass. A dark golden honey color with around a half-inch of firm white bubbly head. Rather effervescent brew with a nice look. Aroma is unassuming, however ... Faintly malty, with a little brown sugar but nothing overly robust, along with some apple and a pleasant but again subtle hop spice, floral and citrus notes discernible here and there. Flavor is somewhat more robust but still low key, some nice brown spice (cinnamon and nutmeg) notes flitting in and out, breakfast cereal malts, and tangy faintly floral and fruity hops. Very downplayed Belgian yeast character although the latter is certainly present. Does develop more of a honeyed sweetness as it warms. I get the notion here and this is indeed a solid sipper to session out on the deck all afternoon. No real off-flavors. Personally, I am not afraid of more aggressive Belgian flavors and would choose a Belgian pale right from the source before seeking out this again.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 27, 2014"

I'd almost go as far as to characterize this as a really good light beer, but I don't think that's what Boston Beer was going for here. It's a really meager beer but it has no unfavorable flavors or notes so it's hard to call it a bad beer, it just doesn't have enough flavor to make it a good beer. I'd like to try it on draft with a hearty meal after a hard day's work... that's what this beer is made for.","jsausley","Jul 24, 2014"

Meh, maybe it's time to admit that, for me, by far the best part of most Belgian-style ales is indeed their alcohol quotient.","biboergosum","Jun 25, 2014"

3.99,20.2,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Sam Adams Belgian Session - another great beer from the micro brewer that started it all. Across the board the beer is simply outstanding. A great mix on the odor of the beer with that burnt toffee smell to go with the hops and malts. The taste matched the smell (a big plus for me) and was smooth and crisp going down. The only knit was the appearance - although it coloring is appealing, the head has little to no staying power. Otherwise, really a great beer.","jjamadorphd","Jun 07, 2014"

The lack of assertive malt and hop flavors allows the spicy yeast notes to become overpowering. As a result, it was hard for me to determine whether I was supposed to treat this beer as a Belgian pale ale or as a saison. The fact that the carbonation is so over-the-top also prevents this beer from being sessionable. Instead of being like drinking water, it's like consuming a meal in a bottle. All in all, the brewers at Samuel Adams just didn't pull it off with this one; in fact, they never really even came close. I mean, what is the point of brewing a session beer of which many people may find difficult to get through a single serving?","mrfrancis","Jul 22, 2013"

Lots of carbonation action throughout the body. Aromas of bread and butter initially, with floral highlights, some honey sweetness, and a blend of coriander, clove, and all spice. Flavors of caramel in the backbone, with a roasted grain overlay, some light spicings, and a touch of hops at the end. Decent cling along the glass, and the body is light and bubbly.

Bitterness comes in really no where with maybe some citrus but not bitterness from the hops. Its pretty smooth a little watery but it is a session beer I guess. I think it's decent and would be great to give somone with not much beer experience.

Crystal clear with only a few bubbles disturbing its clarity. Aroma is pleasant and reminiscent of an authentic Belgian blonde ale: sweet candi sugar, floral yeast notes. Flavor-wise the first thing I notice is that it's a little bit spicy -- but only a very little bit. The whole thing is very mild. And the carbonation is fine and low, yielding an almost creamy mouthfeel, which works pretty well with the mild flavors. Secondary flavors are earthy and bitter, with a final hint of something fruity. Is Belgian "Session" the lowest ABV Belgian ale in the books? (no, not quite) Is it sessionable? Quite possibly. Doesn't seem interesting enough to bother finding out based on this one. It's ok, but these flavors really are best played at high volume.","hreb","Jul 05, 2013"

Compared to the flavoring this aspect was a bit more robust in the end, giving brighter components and more authentic Belgian blend. Actually, this is one of the most floral beers we’ve ever smelled. We lost points through the taste, however, with things becoming overly watered and washed out by the end of the sip. The spice and fruity yeastiness was there in the start, but faded before our eyes. This is an interesting offering from Sam Adams, and certainly an attempt to keep up with the surge of new styles, but this one just seems a bit rushed and incomplete.","TheBrewo","Jun 07, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and peppery aromas. Taste is much the same with spicy grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

There are lots of visible tiny bubbles rising in this beer. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There's a lot of banana on the nose as well as some lemon. I also pick up a hint of spice. I get some of the malt in the nose as well. Those fruity notes in the nose are present, bringing plenty of banana and lemon the party along with the solid malt backbone. The clove spice is there as well. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the beer is refreshing to drink. This is a good beer.","acevenom","May 08, 2013"

It pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises ripe banana flesh, light clove, light cinnamon, flowers, and some mildly-bready toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, but it's all o'erpowered by a general fruitiness led by oranges and mild lemons. Part of me wishes the flavors echoed the smell, but it still works, so I'm not gonna spend too much time fretting. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish that borders on crispness. Overall, an enjoyable little taste of relatively-low-ABV Belgian-ness. I could easily see drinking a few of these on porches and patios in the coming warm months.","TMoney2591","Apr 19, 2013"

The taste initially is of a hefe like spicy clove/banana note that is blended with white grape, pears and lightly toasted malt balanced ever so delicately with just enough hops to make sure the sweetness is not cloying. The mouthfeel is light in body with a thick, creamy carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer of which I would expect nothing less from the BBC.","gmfessen","Aug 12, 2012"

Finish is a transition of the banana flavor to a zestier sweetness that has a flat bitterness in the background. A tasty brew that is good on a hot summer day.

3.28,-1.2,4,3.5,3,4,3,"Overall I thought that this was an Ok beer and a pretty average example of a Belgian Pale Ale, it seemed like this beer was going in the right direction, but when it got to the taste it ended up falling a little flat. This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth, but the flavor doesn't do a great job at holding my attention, I could drink one or two till I would want something different and more flavorful. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both nice and fairly true to style. What I liked least about this beer was the slightly bland taste, it seems like by making it more sessionable they lost some of the flavors that define this style. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, but I don't dread finding this in the summer pack, it's worth a try, but don't expect an awesome Belgian Pale Ale. In the end I just wish this beer came together better, if the taste matched the aroma it would be a solid beer, but the focus on drinkability takes away from the flavor, I guess I wasn't impressed with this beer, but I didn't hate it, just thought it could be better executed, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jun 10, 2012"

The mouthfeel is crisp, and the drinkaility is actually good. As someone who's not too fond of BPAs, this one is pretty solid.

The taste follows suit with a subtle pepperiness that starts the flavors, the yeast comes through in the middle with a hint of lemon, but the sweet malt notes round out the end of the beer. A nice medium mouthfeel, the flavors could have more depth, and a better mix, but overall the beer is good. This could be a nice intro to belgians for those not used to them because the malt comes through strong at the end to balance out the yeast.

Poured into my Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. Nice head and light color. By sight you can tell this is going to be a delicate tasting beer and when it hits the taste buds that's exactly what it is. Very refreshing with a hint of citrus. Obviously this beer is sessionable (It's in the name!) but it really would get quite boring after more than two of these.

But it's like Orval light only hints of that classic Belgian character makes it into this summer variety pack Sam Adams offering. I can actually deal with that, because I understand what their doing making a "session" version of a beer like that with some of the flavor profile. Appealing pour wtih a pale copper body, bright white head forms thin speckled lacing across the sides of my chalice. Aroma has some spicy yeast components, citric, with herbal mint and a bit of underlying ripened fruit tones. Flavor wise, pretty enjoyable light bodied spicy phenolic character, hints of pepper, ripe fruit with minimal sweetness finishes rather dry. Mouthfeel has a nice light aspect with hints of lingering spiciness, effervescent carbonation for an American BPA. I get what they're doing and I actually enjoy this, not something I'd buy in number but an interesting beer to break down there's a bit more going on than your average new beer addition.","WVbeergeek","Apr 06, 2012"
