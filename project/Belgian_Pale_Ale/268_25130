Pours orange amber with a thick white head with attractive uniform bubbles, completely fills the glass and looks nice. Massive lacing. Light sour fruit aroma. Very mild, almost wheat-like start with very light malt and distinct yeast. Semi dry middle with some spice and a dry abrupt finish. Slight hops. Very subdued.

In fact, it has virtually no flavor when cold. I heated it up on a radiator for about 30 minutes; when warm it gained some cloves and a little fruit.

The smell is an earthy yeast with banana and harvest fruits. Tingling fizzy, the mouth feel is light. The earthy banana flavor is strong and complemented by a fruity pear character.

3.87,5.7,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"This is a good Belgian but not a brilliant one. The beer pours a fairly cloudy yellow with clumps, and I mean clumps of free floating yeast. This isn't yeasty bits but quite significant pieces from its unfiltered bottle fermentation. I'm not sure if that is such a good thing. The smell is typically Belgian in that you get the sweet candied malts, some florals, and some rind. The taste is all of the above with quite a yeast effervescence, some spices such as clove, and a slightly sourish malty taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and it balances well with the carbonation. The beer has quite a frothy white head that lingers throughout. The aftertaste is modest as is its ABV. This isn't a strong beer nor an overly complex one, but it is good drinking.

3.61,-1.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,5,"The bottle came in a big golden can, reminiscent of a fine scotch, so my expectations were rather high. Inside the can, was the bottle, corked and caged, as most self-respecting blondes are wont to do in Europe. It pours a nice vigorous head, dissipating very rapidly, leaving behing a very cloudy-looking (yeasty?) golden brew. The smell is very faint, if anything, a bit of citrus, perhaps. The taste is strikingly similar to the great ciders of the north and northwest of France, with a mixture of well-balanced blonde Belgian beer. I'm not certain how they brewed this, but great brut cider apples are definitely an outcome of the flavor, and if these were not somehow involved I'd be rather amazed. The mouthfeel is nice, generating carbonation on the tongue, and the drinkability is exceptional, as this goes down without any complaints from the tongue or throat, leaving a nice aftertaste of...well, cider. Overall, I'm not sure whether or not I've just had a cider or a beer. I would not call this a great blonde beer of Belgium, since this would have to stand on its own merits alone and pound its chest as a blonde. But not bad at all!","Socrates","Mar 17, 2007"

3.68,0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer tastes lightly, well not it is fairly sweet, but it is deceptive as it is quite light on the palate. The flavor is grassy with notes of hay; these notes seem to be derived from both the malt / grain character as well as the particular hop choice. This beer has a really nice, pale malt character to it; the combination of malt sweetness, biscuit notes and touches of soda crackers really compliments the grassy hop notes. This tastes like a cross between a malt accented, yet still quite hoppy, pils and a Belgian ale, which is I suppose quite what the brewer was attempting. It is very easy drinking and I can definitely see quaffing a few of these on a seasoned Summer day.","Gueuzedude","0"

Predictably Belgian Pale Ale in character; beginning with a lightly hazy, brightly colored yellow hue and spicy, honey-like aromas. Overcompensation with the head retention and carbonation, leaving a loosely knit foamy head. Tastes typically fruity (peaches, pears, pineapples, and apricots), spicy (pepper, corriander, orange-peel), and malty (pilsner, honey-like). Fairly smooth, rich texture with an alcohol that seems more than the labled 6%. Finishes a little on the dry and alcoholic side, but satsfying nonetheless.

Its very drinkable, and I would replace it as my keg beer any day, but unless it costs 1.50 euros or less (which I purchased it for at the marvel known as the supermarkets in the Lowlands) I would skip this one.
