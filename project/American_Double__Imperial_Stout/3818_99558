4.23,6.3,3.75,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Poured in to a Westbrook snifter, the espresso-like liquid settles with virtually no head, trapping most light, and lending an umber tone when well illuminated. There is no lacing, and the relative fluidity of the beer reveals it's lack of viscosity. Immediately, memories of tootsie rolls come to mind as I take a deep dive in to the bouquet. Fall spices and classic pumpkin pie aromas also greet the nose. This is very intriguing. Absent are many of the typical scents of an imperial stout... coffee, roast, smoke, alcohol.... and I think that suits this beer perfectly. It's like a fine confection, brimming with desert-like appeal. The flavor follows suit, delivering chocolate sweetness and an assortment of holiday cheer. The underlying alcohol is fairly well-hidden, and the brew achieves a nice balance with minimal bitterness. The hop profile is obscured, but like any great supporting actor, it puts in a worthy performance. This really has all of the charm of Pumking, with an added dimension that makes the beer imminently drinkable. I really appreciate the balance. Pumking was like a revelation for me, but quickly became too intense to drink much more than a single pour. With Warlock, I have refilled my glass from the Blackwater bomber, and could easily go back for more. The flavors of this seasonal treat remind me a little of Allagash Black, but where that one veered off course, this one stays right on track. The only "complaint" that I might add, is that the mouth-feel is a little underwhelming. Perhaps that's what gives Warlock it's supreme drinkability, but I must admit that the medium-thin body makes me yearn for a little more. Overall, this is a new addition to my must-have holiday rotation.   I am enchanted by Warlock's wizardry.","JohnnyI","Dec 23, 2014"

It tastes like a pumpkin ale but instead of pumpkin it's been replaced by Coal. The strong nice smell of cinnamon and nutmeg Is the best part of the Beer and you can really taste it. However quickly turned lame carbonation, burnt malt, plastic aftertaste and very heavy body is why this beer is getting a low rating. I got this one as a gift because I have yet to have a good beer from these guys. Hope it's the last one I have.","TheHammer","Dec 14, 2014"

Southern Tier's Warlock makes for a pretty tasty dessert beer, but I must admit that I'm a little disappointed - this is very Pumking-esque, but the 'stout' aspect of the beer is a little lacking. Any semblance of chocolate, coffee, roastiness or anything else you'd expect from an imperial stout is too subtle to come to the fore; simply buried underneath a dump truck load's-worth of pumpkin pie spice. This is not a bad beer, but it's not as good as Pumking and there is still plenty of room for improvement. Worth a shot I suppose, but big stout fans will be left wanting.","thehyperduck","Nov 05, 2014"

The taste delivers bringing the pumpkin pie flavor, spices, burnt graham cracker, chocolate and coffee.  A wonderful array of flavors.  A bit thin on mouthfeel being on the lower end of medium.

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a decent and slightly brown creamy head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a very dark brown that borders on black. The smell has strong roasted pumpkin notes and spices as well as more roasted and chocolate notes on the side. The spice is much more pronounced than Pumking. The spices tend to be more of a roasted cinnamon with vanilla. The pumpkin is pretty sweet. The chocolate and roasted malts aren't very pronounced but are detectable when it warms up a bit. The taste is a bit different. Essentially, the pumpkin and vanilla notes are stronger with a side of the spice and those flavors mix well the chocolate and roasted malt notes. The taste is reminiscent of a chocolate carrot cake. The mouthfeel is full bodied but surprisingly smooth compare to most other imperial stouts. The carbonation is medium and adds a little texture to the beer. Overall, this is a surprisingly good beer. Personally, I think this beer is what Pumking should have been and a much better choice. I'll be getting this one again next year for sure.","HattedClassic","0"

The smell is wonderful, very pumpkin pie like with nutmeg and slight cinnamon overtones.  The taste is similar to the smell until the end, at the finish I get a very strong nutmeg/bitter taste that is quite unappealing.  The beer goes down smooth with a slightly thicker mouth feel.  Overall an average pumpkin flavored beer, but nothing I would seek out again.  The bitter over the top spice notes on the finish are too much for me.","TooGood","Oct 31, 2014"

I actually like this better than Pumking, a lot less cloying sweetness, just as much spice. big pumpkin taste, i cant say pumpkin pie enough. but the roasted malt adds a bit of smokiness in the finish, not so much as others i've had where it can taste like burnt pumpkin pie...adds a good balance to the sweetness. and it is still very sweet.","sierratwohearted","Oct 12, 2014"

I got cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla, maybe some nutmeg too. Some pumpkin and squash notes though not alot. I enjoyed drinking this, too me its more of a winter beer, than a fall.

Underneath is a bit of pumpkin and subtle notes of roast and chocolate coupled with an airy light sweetness.  As it warms, chocolate becomes much more noticeable.  Medium bodied with a light smooth texture.  Lower than normal carbonation with no effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is where this one shines - intense, complex and balanced.  It begins with a rush of spice, with ginger and clove the most abundant,  over a light sweetness with pumpkin and roast deep in the background.  In the middle, chocolate notes yield to a hop/roast background with an expertly balanced bitterness.  The finish is a blend of the aforementioned flavors fading away into a nice mild alcohol burn at the back of the throat.

Then when swallowing I get a strong roasted flavor followed by the exact taste of a roasted ferrara torrone I smelt earlier and a complexly layered chocolate malt I smelt earlier. I've been drinking this every day and I remember tasting pumpkin and possibly cinnamon  the first few times I had it.  I don't taste the pumpkin/cinnamon anymore so maybe I suck at reviewing beer. At the moment this is my favorite beer. The only points it loses is in the look. Labeled an imperial stout I expect it to be blacker then black and its a brown/black but not disappointing.

With the glass several inches away the toasted biscuit aromas become apparent, below that there is a great deal of spice as well, mostly those typical in pumpkin beers like nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  This being a stout there is also some roasted malt and chocolate maltiness as well.  Those darker malts make there presence known in the taste as they follow closely behind the spices and end up playing a more assertive role.  There is a little bit of bitterness that is likely due to both the dark roasted malt and hops but hop flavor is very restrained.  The body is medium with a dry finish and lingering spiciness that takes a long time to fade.  Overall I'm going to rate this a bit below average, the spice is just too overpowering and the therefore the balance seems off.

Flavor wise, the pie spices let you know what this beer's intentions are. The flavor is cloves first, followed by a little bit of cinnamon, with a decent malt backbone. This combination starts out pie like and finishes earthy. Leans a bit toward the dry side, but only slightly. While there is some noticeable alcohol in the aroma, it doesn't show up in the taste. As AIS go, this is low ABV and thinner mouthfeel/body then you might expect. Carbonation is medium-light. There is little to no head or lace.","LittleDon","Sep 19, 2014"

Scents of pumpkin, rich, buttery pie crust, notes of nutmeg and other pumpkin pie spices and a hint of roast malt, dark chocolate and black coffee faintly in the background. Overall impression is of a pumpkin beer aimed towards the pumpkin pie side of the style, with a slight bit of a stout aroma in the background adding some depth. Rather nice, though the stout character could be a bit more assertive. Flavor begins medium-sweet with notes of pumpkin, buttery pie crust and pumpkin pie spices. This moves into a middle that is medium-dry with notes of buttery pie crust, pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices continuing, but mingling nicely with moderate notes of roasted malt, black coffee and cocoa. Finish is medium-dry with notes of roast malt, black coffee and cocoa evident, but with a nice flavor of buttery pie crust, pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices providing background flavors. Faint traces of alcohol are present in the middle and finish. Aftertaste is roasted malt and buttery pie crust mingling about equally. Overall impression is of a series of pumpkin pie flavors combined with a nice balance of stout flavors that increase in intensity through the sip. Quite nice and a good change from many other pumpkin beers. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and slick with moderate carbonation. Overall impression is of a good smooth stout that drinks easily. Overall this is the best pumpkin beer I have tried. It combines the basic flavors of Pumking with a very nice stout to create a rich, deep flavor profile that is simply wonderful. This is aided by a wonderfully smooth mouthfeel. The aroma, which is too similar to Pumking, is the only downside of this beer. Otherwise it is an excellent example of what can be done with pumpkin beers.","Auraan","Sep 12, 2014"

The smell is very toasty, but the pumpkin comes through to give almost a fresh baked smell to it. The taste was very good in my opinion with heavy stout flavors like chocolate and coffee from the toasted malt and then some sweetness at the finish from the spices and pumpkin.

But, you'd be hard pressed to get me to drink it again unfortunately. Sorry southern tier, I love stouts, the bigger the flavors the better, but this one, just does not at all do it for me.

It has a sort of coffee, maple finish with some cinnamon which is slightly intriguing.  Not as "full-bodied" as I prefer my stouts but, nonetheless it's still enough.

The nose comprises mild roasted malts and even milder treacle adrift in a sea of the usual pumpkin pie spice blend (nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, vanilla bean, graham cracker, allspice, und so weiter). The taste brings in more of the same with the roast and treacle taking larger roles, particularly the latter, and clashing with the spices a bit. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, an okay stout, but the spices and roast don't meld perfectly together. This clashing doesn't completely derail the situation, but it doesn't help all that much, either.","TMoney2591","Apr 28, 2014"

It's like drinking a pumpkin beer and chasing it down with a stout in the same bottle. The stout quickly overwhelms the pumpkin flavor and makes it hard to enjoy. At the end of the drink I'm left with no pumpkin on the palate, just bitterness. The best elements of this beer are the scent and how artfully the alcohol is hidden. I wouldn't dissuade anyone from drinking this beer, but I wouldn't argue that they should seek it out if it is not readily available.","teromous","Apr 15, 2014"

You get chocolate and vanilla notes as well as some roasted notes from the stout, some silkiness from the pumpkin, and a nice sweet/spicy note from the additions. Definitely hit the spot for me.","Georgiabeer","Jan 11, 2014"

It's good, but not great. Then you make it a little creamy. Kinda like a milk stout, but much more of a cream flavor. Then you pour a crap ton of nutmeg and pumpkin spice in to make it smell like cream nutmeg and pumpkin spice. You realize this was a bad idea. So you put in some pumpkin and some ginger to balance out your abuse of spice. you taste it. You have made it worse. You have now created a creamy, pumpkiny, spicey, stouty, unbalanced mess of a beer. You put a fun picture on the bottle and sell it for halloween. People buy it because of this, and because you usually make good beers. The picture on the bottle really is kinda fun. Best part of the beer.","dheacck11","Jan 02, 2014"

Unfortunately for Todd, he purchased two bottles at the same time giving me the pleasure of revisiting it for this review. In closing, I hate to just shit all over a beer, especially when my reviews are generally higher than the average so, I'll make it clear I like Southern Tier.

The nose is pretty much a roasty version of Pumking, which is my favorite pumpkin beer. Spicy and roasty with hints of cinnamon, licorice, nutmeg, cloves, dark chocolate, vanilla, and brown sugar. The taste mirrors the nose and reminds me of chocolate pumpkin fudge. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg along with bitter dark chocolate, cloves, vanilla, molasses, and some subtle pine on the finish. The mouthfeel is rich, thick and syrupy with medium carbonation and a nice bittersweet finish. Overall, this was pretty much exactly what I expected and had hoped for...a big roasty version of Pumking! Not overly sweet, highly drinkable, and a perfect Thanksgiving or Christmas beer.

Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pumpkin, pumpkin seed, gingerbread, nutmeg, brown sugar, cinnamon, toast, pie crust, caramel, cocoa, roasted malt, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of pumpkin, spice, and malt notes with moderate roast presence; with great strength. Smells almost the same as pumking, but that’s not a bad thing. Taste of big pumpkin, pumpkin seed, cocoa, roasted malt, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, pie crust, toast, caramel, herbal, pine, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, toast, caramel, gingerbread, pie crust, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of pumpkin, spice, and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pumpkin spiced imperial stout. All around great balance of pumpkin, spice, dark/roasted malt and moderate hop bitterness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 14, 2013"

Poured from a growler, I didn't waste a lot of time oogling the appearance (although I will say that the head was ample, full, and clung to the glass for a long time), but instead buried my schnoz into the tulip glass and enjoyed the cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, coffee, vanilla nose and then satiated my curious thirst desperately inspired by an afternoon spent wrapping presents for my mother-in-laws' autre grand-rug-rats. And WOW, was I rewarded ("thank you, God"). Anyone who enjoys good beer made well will appreciate this palate pleaser. Smooth malty taste, with great balance between the alcohol and the creamy texture, and the root-beer-like taste of this charmer.

The pumpkin provides a refreshing variation from the typical chocolate and coffee malt flavors of a stout. The pumpkin flavor is more subdued than in Pumking, but still the star of the show. So far, Pumking is my favorite pumpkin ale because of the strong pumpkin flavor and color. This beer is a nice variation for someone seeking a milder flavor.","antott0523","Dec 13, 2013"

I don't get as much of the dark malt and roasty notes that I expect in an Imperial stout and was a bit disappointed in that. It seemed like a regular pumpkin beer brewed with a little debittered black malt to add color without flavor...like a schwartzbier. The lemon and ginger really made this taste more like a gingerbread cookie than a true pumpkin beer. Worth a try.","Jackofallbrews","Dec 05, 2013"

I was surprised with this condsidering it is a pumpking beer and stout hybrid. I think it gets labeled as a stout based on color, but not taste. I think if you expect a spiced/pumpkin ale you might be pleasantly surprised I was happy with the taste and it is highly drinkable regardless of style.","Slatetank","Nov 30, 2013"

Close to opaque but not quite, the color is a deep chocolate brown, the orange tint evident at the outer reaches, hard to see any bubbles at all, looks like a “tweener” would not guess stout per se. Oodles of ginger snaps, cinnamon, honey, pumpkin and milk chocolate to the nose, minimal roast or toast, all sunny sweetness, mild pie dough to yeast accents, extremely pungent and longlasting, like standing next to an exhaust pipe. Medium-bodied, lighter than might be expected, creamy texture even with average carbonation at best. On the sweet side, the pumpkin and accompanying baking spices are dominant and are smeared in vanilla frosting. Cola accents, sometimes tastes like RC cola. More roast here, teases out mild coffee to dark chocolate. Turns hollow at the finish, loses its initial intensity. At the same time becomes more like a “normal” stout. Needs an extra gear to really impress.","farrago","Nov 28, 2013"

Very intriguing aroma of dark toasty malt, pie crust, baked pumpkin, peanut butter nuttiness and hints of pumpkin pie spices. Never smelled anything like it, but it's tempting. Flavor is sweet pumpkin and pie spices, big vanilla, chocolate. Finish is toasted, nearly charred malt and grassy hop bitterness that is not noticeable until the end. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Flavors very reminiscent of Pumking with an emphasis on stout's toasty malt. It's a nice combination. More pumpkin forward than my normal favorite Elysian's Dark of the Moon. DotM is more a stout with pumpkin flavor, this is closer to Pumking with some stout blended in. I like both combinations and will add this to my Autumn regulars. Anyother winner from Southern Tier.","LiquidAmber","Nov 16, 2013"

4,0.5,,,,,,"22 oz bottle serving. Does pour to a thin, opaque black with a tan head of about 2 fingers. Aroma is very similar to Pumking - traditional pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. I did taste vanilla and maybe a hint of malt. Taste was not overpowering of the same aromas but you do taste the pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon more than others. Fades much better than Pumking if you ask me. Solid stout. More mild and easy to go down than Pumking but seemed to have more a kick after 16 oz of it had passed my lips. I think it is very similar to Pumking but better and more refined. I still prefer Alewerks Pumkin over Pumking if you want a pumpkin beer. However, this one is pretty good. This is more balanced than Pumking. Definitely a little more sweet than Pumking. I'll pass on the Pumking the next go around and purchase a Warlock instead. Finding it on tap will be a miracle though. Very limited quantities.","uvachief","Nov 11, 2013"

It fades into a sweetness filled with cinnamon, nutmeg, raisins, and fig. The aftertaste is roasted barley out dueling hops. This is a bit thicker and with plenty of flavor so it is meant for slow contemplation. This is truly a unique brew and if you like pumpkin beers, but want a twist this is worth trying.

A bready, pumpkin pie with crust type aroma along with cinnamon and nutmeg and some roasted malts as well in the aroma. Smooth and creamy are the first words that come to mind, and as I delve into this beer I'm getting a good balance of pumpkin flavors, sweet malts like caramel and dark chocolate and a good bit of roasted malts as well. Finish is a little heated and spicy and complements the more smoother and sweeter aspects of the beer. Not necessarily stout-like for those who prefer dryer stouts, but a really good sipper that is worth trying by anyone who likes their beers even slightly heavy.","clayrock81","Nov 01, 2013"

I'm also probably not a big ST fan (as their very popular double stouts, Choklat, Crème Brulee, Jahva, and Mokah aren't much to my liking :eek: (I know, I know...); but I really enjoy getting a Pumking every year and really dug their Oak-Aged Unearthly). So I get people saying this beer is "unbalanced" or "too sweet" - and, I guess it is rather like Pumking made with dark malts. I found it drier than most seem to have, and rather porter-like, as opposed to the Imperial stouts mentioned above, and basically enjoyable.

Aromas of fresh baked pumpkin bread, with all of the highlights. Roasty notes, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, and a touch of bready character. Wow, this smells amazing. Flavors are roast forward, with a light, somewhat loose blending of chocolate, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, bread, cream, and vanilla. Very sweet, and once again, just like fresh baked pumpkin bread, although the flavor profiles come across a little bit more subtle than the aromas. Thin, dry bodied, with a roasted, bitter profile blending with a creamy sweetness into the aftertaste. Dry, slightly lingering spice character into a slow settling finish. Easy drinker with true pumpkin flavors. This is a good beer. Might be picking up more to do a "pumpkin keg" for an upcoming Halloween party.","GarthDanielson","Oct 16, 2013"

I don't know what the recipe for Warlock is but it tastes like a post-fermentation mix of pumpkin and a milk stout. That just so happens to be recipe for success in this brew.

Flavor is heavy spice with the nutmeg and cinnamon, but really nicely finished with a creamy sweet whipped cream pumpkin flavor. Creamy medium-heavy mouthfeel with medium highish carbonation. Lingering vanilla cream and nutmeg on the palate. I love the creamy mouthfeel and whipped cream flavor going on, but the nutmeg just cuts through this way too hard.

Aroma is toffee and butter with mild pumpkin pie spice in the background. A sip starts off sweet, fills out to a very caramel sweet flavor with background cinnamon and ginger. Finishes sweet with a decent kick of bitterness and roastiness. Medium full in body with subdued carbonation. Overall a nice dessert beer. A bit on the sweet side for me, as are most of Southern Tier's beers, but the roast in this one makes it more drinkable for me than the rest of their lineup.","spokeydonkey","Oct 10, 2013"

Could this be a the best blend of imperial stout and premium pumpkin beer bottled? The answer is... sort of. As a spoiler for this entire review I will come right out and say, like many others have, that this tastes a lot like standard Pumking. I'd love to do a side-by-side next time. But anyway, on with the review. The color is a dark, oily brown, with an initial bubbly tan head, that subsides somewhat quickly. The aroma is incredible, with warm oatmeal, cookies, pumpkin pie and vanilla icing, and notable spices. The taste is very very similar to the aroma. It's a tad more roasty than the scents let on, but not as much as say, if you floated some pumpkin ale on top of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. The feel is moderate and somewhat warming. The finish actually has more hops wrapped up in it than the original Pumking. It's pleasantly bitter, having traces of dark chocolates and complex hop flavors. This is precisely the part that makes it an exceptional beer in it's own right. Don't hesitate to grab it off the shelf.","Neorebel","Beers"

This may sound harsh but it tasted like they brewed a generic and uninteresting imperial stout and sprayed pumpkin perfume into it. I really don't think a dark and roasty beer pairs well with a sweet, almost pumpkin pie taste. Just a little too many flavors battling against each other in this one. I know a lot of people will enjoy this, but it's just not for me. Personally, I would stick with Pumpking.","Gus34","Sep 28, 2013"

3.97,-0.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Thankfully the flavor is more of a mix of pumkin and stout notes. Dry and roasted with a robust dark malt presence that's countered by sweeter malts and strong pumkin pie flavors on the back end. Slightly smokey with burnt sugar and deeply roasted malt but its not acrid or harsh at all. Hints of gourmet coffee, burnt toast, bittersweet dark chocolate and oatmeal followed by sweeter chocolate flavor, toffee and nut before a strong pumpkin ale flavor in the finish. Spicy and sweet with ginger, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg along with pumpkin purée/pie filling, toasted pumpkin seeds and vanilla. Nicely balanced and whereas the aroma felt like a pumpkin beer with subtle stout character, the flavor is more stout-like with lingering pumpkin pie sweetness. ABV is excellently masked, resulting in another dangerously drinkable entry in the Backwater series.","corby112","0"

3.27,-17.8,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"I dunno. To me this beer is mis-labeled. Instead of Imperial Stout with Pumpkins & Natural Flavor, it should be the other way around; Imperial Pumpkin Beer with Natural Flavor brewed with Strong Stout. The spicy pumpkin totally dominates the stout. Poured this at a good temperature with a smallish light tan, creamy head that quickly settled and a little lace. Color is a very dark, clear garnet brown with a few bubble trails. Aroma is full on spicy pumpkin, with some chocolate chip cookie in the background. Flavor's like nose; the stout is barely discernible, mostly sweet with a hint of bitter and tang. Body reflects the dominate sweetness which slightly clashes with the bitter leaving some high points that aren't entirely pleasant. Finish is like flavor, slight medicine in the aftertaste and longish. My rating for would have been much higher but for the difference in label and experience. It's really a tasty dessert beer. But even in the good chocolate stouts, the stout is the strong backbone.","drpimento","Sep 21, 2013"
