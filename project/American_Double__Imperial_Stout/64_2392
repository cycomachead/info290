I've had this beer at varying times in its lifespan, but I felt like this was very close to the sweet spot. Pours pitch black with a creamy head.    Smell of caramel, chocolate, booze.   Taste follows suit, booze adds a beautiful finish.   I know this gets a bit mellower with time, but I love the booze backing being more prominent.

In my opinion, I would not go past the 5.5 years, assuming it might have peaked around 4.5 years. Just my 2¢.

4.45,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Beautiful dark black, little to no head, what head there is is dark khaki. Nose is sweet, chocolate roasted malts. Very sweet, very chocolate. Taste is dark roasted malts, some coffee, cocoa powder, but not that creamy sort of chocolate, more of a dry one. Some faint cherry. No where near the complexity of Goose Island BCBS, but straightforward and quite delicious. Not any of that roughness present in some porters and stouts, drier, smoother. Little yeast presence, medium to medium-low hops. Hides the alcohol content amazingly well. Mouthfeel is smooth and becomes dry at the finish, with only a light alcohol burn. Overall a damn fine stout, smooth, balanced and quite strong.","GoingPrimal","Dec 16, 2014"

Here is one that beats the hype.  Wonderful mix of dark fruits and roasted malt, there even seemed like a little coffee.  Very creamy feel had me savoring.  Would like to tell you how it changed as it warmed but it did not make it, which says a lot.  At 18% it went down like lemonade.

I didn't percieve any roasted, malt, or Hop notes. I did pick up on a dark fruit and slight roasted aroma my second go around, which was subtle. It tastes similar to its nose, alcohol with a slight roasted flavor. I wasn't expecting anything. Extrodinary, but I was disappointed. The mouthfeel wasn't as thick as I would have expected. Overall, it's more enjoyable than 120, but I would not purchase again.","y2jrock60","Nov 16, 2014"

The aroma is very strong coffee with a hint of alcohol sweetness in the background. The taste is also the coffee/alcohol sweetness. Its also not heavy in its texture, which it easily could be, considering. The 18% ABVis not pronounced and this is easy drinking for such a big stout.

4.5,6.9,,,,,,"Overall, this is a beast of a beer that despite the high ABV (18-20%), is still quite balanced and drinkable. Your nose suggests that it is barrel aged in some way even though it is not. World Wide is world class. Glad I had the chance to try it, and would recommend that everyone does regardless of cost.","WesMantooth","Sep 14, 2014"

4.2,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"2600th review! 12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2010D. Pours dense pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, dark bread, raisin, prune, date, cherry, licorice, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, dark bread, brown sugar, raisin, prune, date, cherry, licorice, light char, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, dark bread, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, prune, date, cherry, licorice, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit flavors; and smooth to sip on slowly. This is one of the most dark fruit forward imperial stouts I have had, but it was still really well balanced. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 12, 2014"

There's some nice imperial stout flavors to this one, though they aren't stronger or more intense than in other examples of the style, so as to justify the much higher ABV. The additional booziness only detracts from the beer's positive qualities at this point. It's not necessarily a bad beer fresh, but if you're going to pick this one up, I would suggest some long term aging before cracking it open.","Jonada","Apr 27, 2014"

4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"2014 bottle. Best part of this beer fresh is the aroma. Lots of dark fruit, a subtle sweetness, slight maltiness, a nice hit of alcohol, reminiscent of bourbon and wine at the same time. Taste is overpowered by the alcohol burn. Also a nice pop of dark fruits; slight hints of chocolate and roasted malt. Has the potential to be a very unique and complex brew but probably needs some time for the alcohol to become less overpowering.","BumpyAZ","Apr 17, 2014"

Jet black in color with no chance of light penetrating it. I get notes of plum,raisin,molasses,black licorice,and roasted barley in the aroma. Mouthfeel is thick,chewy,and oily. The flavor is immediate and intense. There's a barrage of plum,raisin,and molasses on the front of the palate. It's quickly followed by a burning sensation on your tongue and then a massive burst of alcohol in the fade. I'll never forget having this many years ago out of the bottle on an Easter and recall it catching me unawares as I had not noted the ABV prior to finishing it.","Franziskaner","Apr 06, 2014"

3.47,-17.6,3.75,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and nice example of a very strong stout, it had some things that held it back from being as good as it could be, but I still thought it was a little enjoyable and it made for a decent sipping beer. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't smooth at all, it was pretty sweet, boozy and filling, but the taste still did a decent job at holding my attention. One was almost too much for me and next time I would probably split it with someone, there's no way I could drink more than one. What I liked the most about this beer was the roasted malt aspect, it was pretty nice and what I would expect from the style. What I like the least about this beer was the drinkability and that the alcohol wasn't hidden that well, I found this to be much more boozier than 120 minute IPA and that beer was even stronger. I would buy this beer again, but I don't think I will be drinking it fresh. I would recommend this to people who like really strong beers. All in all I thought this beer was pretty solid, it had some nice aspects to it, but when it comes down to it I think the alcohol and the sweetness prevent this beer from being as good as it could be. I would love to see how this beer ages, I feel it's a great candidate to improve over time and I have a 2012 bottle that I will be trying in a couple years. This isn't my favorite Dogfish Head beer or my favorite strong Stout, but it still isn't a bad beer, it's just rough around the edges and I think that age might help that out. Nice work guys, keep on pushing the limits.","StoutHunter","Mar 31, 2014"

A bottle of this cost a ton but it's well worth it when you realize that it's worth more than the 2 or 3 beers that you could normally consume during the downing of the contents of this bottle. If a Stout could be brewed in Belgium and have all of the carbonation and thickness removed from it, this would be the end result. Lucky for us, this was only imported from Delaware for anyone lucky enough to get his or her hands on it. Nothing on the shelf could ever aspire to be this, which only heightens the significance of this beer. There isn't a cure for the dead of winter but this was as close to one as I could ever hope to find, making this a relative bargain since it's nearly made me forget that that groundhog in Pennsylvania saw his shadow. Arguably the strongest beer in Dogfish Head's portfolio and a clear must-have for anyone who loves what beer is capable of. Absolutely beautiful!","JerzDevl2000","Feb 07, 2014"

4.31,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"I had Dogfish's World Wide Stout on tap at Freshcraft in Denver. The World Wide Stout pours a deep brown with lighter butterscotch coloring around the edges and a nice persistent thin light brown head. The smell has notes of roasted malts, charred wood/charcoal, dark fruits, and molasses. The taste has notes of molasses, roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, raisins, anise, honey, caramel, burnt wood, smokiness, and deeply roasted/charred malts. The flavor is really complex with an abundant amount of charred smokiness throughout. There is definitely some alcohol heat on the finish, but certainly less than I would have expected for 18% ABV. Really interesting and complex beer. The mouthfeel was very thick and chewy. I thought the smokiness/burnt wood/charcoal flavors were a bit too intense to put it in my upper echelon of imperial stouts, but this really is a fantastic and interesting beer, especially considering that it clocks in at 18% ABV. I would definitely recommend Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout to anyone that likes big, bold imperial stouts.","lmperialChad","Feb 04, 2014"

The taste follows with a lot of caramel, raisin, and just a touch of the dark malt astringency that really doesn't do much to balance the sweetness.

My negative at this time would only be that I want this stout to age a couple of more years. I am fortunate, I do have one from 2011....

Reminds me a little of a couple ice coffee drinks, but then with the warming finish of a high quality liquor at the end. Very good beer. I am going to cellar a couple for a few years and see how they develop as the alcohol calms down a bit, although i truly do enjoy that part of the beer in this fresher version.","happilyhopped","Jan 19, 2014"

It was at its best on the first, coldest sip, with amazing moments of merlot wine, chocolate, raspberry, and all these other sensual dark flavors coming through. I enjoyed it thoroughly as the alcohol continued to make its presence known. I only wish it got a bit better as it warmed, but that is simply asking for perfection. This was damn near close enough.

I bought this bottle about a year and a half ago already aged from the Dogfish Brewpub, I really should have bought more.

Lots of big chocolate and malts, and with a deceptively high ABV (tastes a whole lot closer to 10 or below), this stout is very well crafted. Drinks smooth and creamy and its sweetness helps itself. Some bitter coffee balances it out as well. Well balanced for such a monster. I do think the age on the bottle has helped this brew. Definitely recommended.","Resuin","Oct 08, 2013"

The booze is present as you'd expect, but it just makes for a slower sip, and it's not over the top, but still enjoyable.... on the right evening, this is a beer worth trying, and keeping in your cellar....

Taste is loaded with roasty barley, some chocolate, earthy, pretty hot and boozy (no surprise), some honey, some dark fruit, nice slight hop presence. Texture is thick, duh. This is a serious sipper, glad my wife likes stout, a good one for sharing. Had to trade for this but I'm glad I did, very solid, not overly complex, delicious","brewtus","Jul 31, 2013"

Thick, rich chocolate fudge cake, very sweet molasses and dark fruits even a nice hop presence for balance. Alcohol is well hidden but you know this is an alcoholic beast.

4.1,-2.6,4,4,4.25,4,4,"The color is rich and beautiful, though the head is less than I expected. Starts with a strong espresso/dark chocolate flavor, that gets richer with each sip and as the beer opens up. Great nose, filled with dark chocolate and bitter espresso. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and becomes more balanced as the beer opens. This beer wins big points on the complexity and balance of its flavor, but loses a bit on the alcohol content, which is certainly noticeable.","smooth_aleing","Apr 03, 2013"

Smell is heavy on the roast, some sweet sugars, I got a bunch of dark fruits initially but it seemed to disappear as it came to room temp, chocolate and vanilla, a bit of booze and coffee. Taste has massive roast, vanilla, chocolate, moderate bitterness, a bit of alcohol but would never assume this was anywhere near 18%, coffee and flavours that resemble oak, moderate sweet sugars but not overly sweet. Lightly carbonated, huge chewy body, full mouthfeel. This was a great slow sipper that I feel was opened at the perfect time, drank the bottle over the course of an hour or so and at the 45 min mark this was sublime.","peensteen","Feb 22, 2013"

The pour is a little disappointing, it's a nice color and depth, but there is no head or lacing...it wasn't a vigorous pour but still, maybe it was just this bottle? The aromas on the other hand are amazing, among the best I've ever experienced in a stout. Big blasts of roasted malt, chocolate, anise and currant, I almost felt like I was smelling a bourbon or a Cali cabernet at first. The flavors are just as bold, the malt and dark fruit comes back around, along with some earthy/oaky undertones almost like it was cask aged. The mouthfeel obviously has a little bite with the abv, but it's not overpowering. This is definitely a big, bold imperial stout, worthy of the "World Wide" label and a must try for stout lovers.","Iceman77","Dec 31, 2012"

It is a bold and ballsy, and even a bit fierce – a true tribute to malted barley goodness. The malt sweetness and the alcohol heat play off each other so that neither one becomes overwhelming or cloying. These two flavors work together in a great duet while the flavors of grain, toasted grain, and dark dried fruits work to compliment the lead and provide an enjoyable complexity to the performance. This is one of the best malt focused beers available – If you can find it, buy it. It is a “must try” for fans of malt focused big beers.","Beer_Runner","Nov 13, 2012"

Sweet and toasty malts, fruit and booze aroma. An intense mixture of sweet and toasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate, caramel. Big alcohol hit. So sweet, it's almost a cross between an English barleywine and a stout. Nice. I'm going to cellar some these every year.","LiquidAmber","Jul 03, 2012"

It's very aromatic, with dark chocolate, vanilla bean, espresso, very roasty malts, and raisins. The gratuitous amount of barley is evident. My palate is filled with bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt just like the nose implies, but also molasses, and bourbon vanilla flavors, with wooden barrel characteristics. The body is quite heavy and syrupy coating the mouth immediately. A great sipper when you're in the mood for something deep and rich. Overall it is not over-the-top as one might expect, but rather it's a complex and admirable brewer's work of art. Drink it with my very highest recommendation.","Neorebel","Apr 24, 2012"

Besides that, though, I get lots of wonderful little nuances - gingerbread, cocoa, cinnamon, licorice, raisin, it’s actually more pleasant than pungent. What a well executed beer this is. Honestly, the booze really does not dominate the tongue. There’s all kinds of fizzy and sweet gingerbread/licorice bits that start things off. The different flavors come in waves only to be snuffed out by the alcohol. It’s not a boozy burn though at all - it’s warming and subdued. Bravo.

That alcohol burn is harsh right now but give it a few years and it'll be perfect. I have a year old one to try side by side to compare. We will see what a year did to the booziness. I feel like the flavors will mature a LOT and will come out from behind the alcohol a little more.

Aromas are super-boozey, with a scotch characteristic, as well as some dark roasted coffee and very bitter dark chocolate. Flavors are strong and boozey, with an initial tingle on the front of the tongue. The mid-tongue gets a good blast of dark roasted barley, syrupy molasses, and booze that has a blend of scotch and rum qualities. The body is light, and has an effervescent feel to it, too. There is a strong, warming sensation that starts at the back of the palate and throat, and follows all the way down into your belly. Delicious. The aftertaste is more of the roast characteristics, with the booze still present, as well as a peppery spicing. The finish is slick, with a slight linger and tang left on the palate. Tasty brew that will keep you completely warm in the winter time. Wow...heavy hitter.","GarthDanielson","Jan 20, 2012"

Not a whole lot I can say that jbertsch didn't say below. Same bottling date and nearly identical experience. Opened this while celebrating the announced expansion/distribution of Funky Buddha and glad I did - I'm dissuaded from buying more. As a huge stout freak, this just doesn't do it for me. I'm all for DFH's continued theme of being off-centered, but this thing is so far off from being a stout it's not even funny.","xpdrinker","Dec 30, 2011"

It's over the top and a bit too sweet for me to like as a beer. If I compare it to other imperial stouts - ones around 12% - then I would give this a poorer grade. But for a beer this high in ABV, the best I can do is grade it for what it is, and whether or not I enjoyed it. It wasn't a drain pour, but when I'm in the mood for a beer and I end up getting something that's more like a port, it already has a hurdle to cross to gain my acceptance. Some nice flavors in there, but it's a bit of a hot mess at the same time.","jbertsch","Dec 27, 2011"

Not a lot of head forms, due to lack of carbonation left in an over 3 year old bottle. Some lacing does cling to the sides of the glass. The smell is intense but wonderful. Lots of notes of brandy, rum, and tropical fruit. The taste was very complex, with layers of coffee, chocolate, fruit and booze. Mouthfeel was still on the hot alcohol side, even for an aged bottle. Might need about 1-2 more year to smooth out a bit more. Could have easily drank a whole 12 oz bottle, but it was nice to share with my bro also. Paired it with a gingerbread cake for dessert. Well worth buying and aging.","morebeergood","Dec 25, 2011"

I also get some dark fruits and it is definitely on the sweet side but is balance nicely by the bitter chocolate. The 2010 is pretty hot and could use some mellowing.

Deep, dark chocolates fill the nose, toffee, traces of raspberry and cherry are found, dark fruity tones coming through, and definitely some huge bitter coffee notes. The 18%abv is hidden very very well (pays to age this 3 years or more). Dark chocolates on the tongue, toasted malts, sweet cherries, big booze on the finish. Bitter dark chocolates and coffee beans dominate this in the mouth, this really tastes good, but that big booze cloud on every finish is holding me back from really loving this beer. Full bodied, Creamy, smooth, rich, bitter and boozy in the mouth. Overall, this is an intensely aggressive beer. From the first sip to the last, its in your face, sweat was pouring out of my body on my 3rd sip. An interesting beer considering the ABV being so high.

4.6,9.3,4,4,5,5,4.5,"Well my first review here it goes. Being a beer newb, I was fortunate enough to be under the guidance of a much more experienced beer geek, and being a very curious and adventurous person I asked him about a huge intense beer that was readily available in our area. He recommended world wide stout, and the journey begins. It pours a jet black with a sexy mocha head, about .5-1 finger length head, dispersed and segregated groups of bubbles, with some light carbonation emerging from the bottom of the glass. Now being inexperienced, I dont know what constitutes a sexy appearance as I have heard so many times in videos and reviews, so I will not judge it in that way. The smell was a bulldozing combination of heat, rum soaked raisins/dark fruit, and nice chocolate coming through the end of the aroma. Little intimidating to say the least. Now I have had this beer three times with two distinct outcomes. the better of the two the beer was slightly colder and stored better I suppose. Although it smells very boozy, the taste revealed a nice balance of chocolate, espresso and dark fruits, with more chocolate/espresso in the taste than nose. The alcohol is there, but it doesnt alter the taste of the beer, it kind of is there in its own right without disturbing the palate . Anyway, beer was great, very complex and strong, and highly recommend.","jsm1289","Oct 09, 2011"

I'm really glad I tried this beer. I'll probably buy one more bottle (for $10) and save it for an occasion. It's always worth buying one of the dogfish head Hazard cap beers...even if its 10 bucks for a bottle.

If any of you have grow distaste for this beer from drinking it with in the first two years please age a bottle you won’t be disappointed!!! It pours black or dark purple like a great port wine with no head. I shared this with a friend and used snifters. The smell is of dark chocolate coffee, dark malts, and alcohol. At first a part of me thought it was gonna be very over powering and very strong. But I was totally wrong it was very sweet and had the heat of a great bourbon finish. This beer was worth the wait!!!","bobbypaulson","Oct 06, 2011"
4.72,12.1,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"O- This is an excellent beer. My first offering i've had from DFH and i'm pretty sold on them already! the is a complex beer with many nuances but it's not busy; every flavor gets its turn on the palate and it works quite nicely.

We need you! I desperately wish that more breweries would release a beer like this (and yes, I’d pay $9 for 12 oz. any day).

Smell is of dark fruits, roasted malt, and some sour wine-like aromas. As the beer warms, I am getting a weird celery smell coming off this one. Taste is of dark roasted malt, dark dried fruits (plums/raisins), turbinado sugar, and some smoky almost campfire flavors. The 18% ABV is definitely in your face with a burning sensation in the throat after each sip. This beer is very thick and creamy in the mouth, with a low level of carbonation. Overall, this is a special occasion beer to me. At 18% ABV, this is something I would only tackle once in a while. Too bad WWS isn't distributed to CA because I would probably buy a few more of these to put in the cellar.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 19, 2011"

Pure black liquid, immaculately clean and shiny, almost shockingly so, thin layer of metallic orange at the glass bottom. More char than roast to the nose, kind of like being in a smokehouse, then licorice, mint, the pine, flowers and grapefruit make this a hophead’s sort of stout, has a full-on mix of plum, cherry, grape, pineapple, peach fruit scents, the full spectrum. Full-bodied, low in carbonation yet smooth enough for good flow. The smoky roast in complete control and the barley sets a sweet foundation for the ensuing licorice, anise, orange marmalade, pine, carob, nuts and molasses. The grassy tingle and herbaceous bite has the power to break through the sweetness, especially at the end.

When I got my glass, it still was dark black, but had a hint of redness on the top of the beer. Smelled of alcohol and cherry. Tasted HUGE! Big malt and alcohol, definitely cherries in there somewhere. Big burn as I swallowed. Perhaps a hint of vanilla and maybe some fig?? Huge flavor, however thin mouthfeel compared to the taste. Sipper despite the thin mouthfeel. Slightly creamy. Overall, this is a must try for stout lovers.

A powerful mouthfull of charred malts, oaky vanilla, and i am streching to find much else, it comes across very hot and oddly mouth puckering. Such an interesting nose yet so out of balance when drinking is disappointing. I love dfh but they are really hit and miss for me - i much preferred tokio to this beer.","Trilogy31","Jul 15, 2011"
3.77,-10.5,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Pours black (brown around the edges) but develops very little head. What does show up is a rich beige color, but does little in the way of lacing or retention. Smells strongly of sugar, dark plum, date, raisin, some faint cherry, and some wood (oak or maple, perhaps). Only a hint of roast or char comes through in the very rear, and the alcohol is hidden almost entirely. Tastes of the aforementioned fruits, some maple syrup, caramelized sugar, a touch of vanilla, some roasted wood (again, difficult to pinpoint), and alcohol. Mouth is relatively thick, but doesn't leave a sticky aftertaste. Instead, a scorching alcohol burn is left that, while not entirely unpleasant, isn't ideal either.

It serves that purpose quite well, and would gladly welcome it again.","eclipse54","Jul 13, 2011"

There was coffee and chocolate to the fullest, there was hops and brandy and so much more on the nose. The taste was unexplainable. It just didn't compare to the original at all anymore.

No one wanted him there but deep inside he knew his dark secret, internally crafting the most majestic jokes ever, but not sharing him.

This comes off far more in line with a Belgian strong ale than a stout. No coffee, chocolate, burnt flavors at all are present here.

4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: Vert intense, but a great intense. The ABV is incredibly sneaky, tastes like it would be an 11%-12%. I like the complexities of the flavors and the intense smells definitely make for a great stout.","Treebs","May 22, 2011"

Heavy mouthfeel, high alcohol, but still smooth and transcendent. Extremely drinkable, but I wouldn't do more than one pour in any given session.

The "ridiculous amount of barley" must have lent a much larger amount of fermentable sugar than normal. I would have preferred more specialty malt, however, to provide body and balance. I'm not a DFH hater, but this beer was honestly a big letdown for me. I personally won't be buying it again.

During my initial tasting my palate was overwhelmed with the complexity of flavors that bombarded the senses. Tatsting was of chocloate and cherries with honts of coffee.

It tasted strong of alcohol and had a sweet-wine characteristic in the beginning then matured to a sweet-bitter flavor with hints of coffee and molasses with a touch of chocolate at the finish.

The brew had minimal head but a good retention and lace due to the outrageous amount of malt used. Smelled of dark and dried fruit. Tasted of late bottled vintage Port wine with concentrated raisin and toffee. For an alcohol content of 18%....RIDICULOUSLY DRINKABLE. No wonder the bar had to put a limit on how much you could have.My girlfriend ordered something else and I had to fight to keep her from drinking my entire beer.

It's an excellent demonstration of the brewmaster's art, with a pleasant malt overtaste supported by just the right amount of hops to carry the malt flavor and alcohol content without overwhelming it. Would I buy this again? Absolutely, for the right occasion.

From the taste, I guessed about 12%. Even though it is really 18%, the majority of it is hidden well. (p.s. don't drink too much of this... it hits you later!) The astringency was overbearing, and I feel with some time this will fade. I cannot wait for these to age in my cellar so I can enjoy it through and through. The low(er) score indicates how it tastes from the store.

The cap only rises to about 2-2.5 fingers in height, and while there's a little bit of both retention and lacing, neither is at all remarkable in anyway. The nose does not give me much to be excited about. The only two aromas I can really pick out are licorice (an acceptable note for a stout, but not one of my favorites) and a solventy alcohol not (not welcome at all). While those flavors still dominate on my palate, at least here I can appreciate a little bit of dark chocolate and dark fruits. Overall though, the beer does taste a little green. The body is nice and full, to be honest I'm impressed that it's not prohibitively heavy given the massive ABV of this brew. Carbonation is just a bit too understated, lost in the sea of maltiness. To be honest, I am a little bit impressed World Wide Stout's not a little bit more boozy than it actually is.

Into a small sampling glass this poured an almost black color under a nice head and carried a dark roasted sweet malt nose. The most outstanding characteristic here was how phenomenally well this masked its abv from its opening to its finish.

The fresh bottle is much more carbonated and produced a pretty thick head. The aged bottle not as much. Still a great looking beer. Smell is heavy solventy alcohol on both aged and fresh. Dark sweet fruits dominate the nose with a dose of chocolate. The coffee bitterness no where to be found. Taste on the aged is much more sweeter with not bitterness. I get mostly chocolate covered raisin with tobacco. Also the Belgian quality with candied plum. Outstanding to say the least. The fresh actually does have a bit of roastiness to it. Not near as harsh as people make it out to be. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. And for a stout man is this beer easy to drink. My absolute favorite! Never thought I would like a beer as big as this.

Smell is a big roasted malt bomb that has picked up big time port and dark fruit, berries, chocolate, soy, faint vanilla. Cant really detect the booze, but it's there under a sea of smell. This has always been interesting beer and it's hit or miss with me. This is a bit to fruity for my liking. Perhaps it's the HUGE port notes and the lack of sweet chocolate, which is pretty muted. Roasted malt is appriciated but the berries are rizzipe. Some fusel alcohol, with warming it came out more. It kinda tastes like bum wine to me which I pick up in a lot of big DFH beers, it's off putting. Feel is big, burly, coating with a little heat on the way down. I don't like the lingering alcohol in the back. Well, I could not get through my glass, it's sacrilege, but I dumped the rest.

Very aggressive pour yields a two finger mocha head that dissolves immediately and leaves no lacing, but a noticeable film on the glass when the fluid moves. Smells dominantly of booze. Also smells like vanilla and caramel/brown sugar. Taste is vanilla, caramel, oak, and booze in that order (and very quickly). Taste lingers with a roasted malt flavor reminiscent of chocolate or brownies (slightly burnt ones, anyway), very sweet and syrupy, overall. Feel is thick and coating with very low carbonation. Chewy and full bodied. Taste, smell, and body couple together very nicely. More like a scotch/stout hybrid than an imperial stout, I would say.

That said, neither of them even compare to the Mikkeller Black, which rules the mega ABV stout world so far.

There's not very much lacing. Mild amounts of many things - mainly sweet malt, dark fruits, and roasted malt, in that order. There's also a slight whiff of alcohol. Very sweet malt up front, similar to their 120 min, followed by dark fruits and a very mild hint of chocolate. The dark fruits make their way out even more as the beer warms - and it had plenty of time to warm, this is the definition of a sipper. There's kind of a dry finish but not really very much bitterness. The alcohol isn't nearly as noticeable as it probably should be, but it's there.

Taste is similar to smell but the alcohol really kicks hard. This one is a sipper for sure. Picking up on carmel also and a slightly off-putting metallic/medicinal syrup-like quality.

The taste was amazing; like dark chocolate-covered raisinettes, with a hint of plum, blackberry, and dare I say wine-iness, and a sweet finish, mixed with coffee and a modest alcohol burn. The latter was quite impressive, given the abv. The feel was also very impressive; slick velvet with no carbonation, yet not overly thick. Definitely a sipping beer. Typically when I approach a much-hyped beer, I am skeptical, but this beer not only lived up to the hype, but it exceeded it.

First sip reveals a much sweeter brew than I expected. Vanilla bean and molasses mix with roasted chocolate and charred oak to give a complex palate.

The aromas are almost too complex to describe. Sherry like tannins upfront, vanilla bourbon and Cabernet sauvion. The taste is even more exciting from the first sip. Cherry bourbon a smooth alcohol bite. The boozieness fades with each taste. The warm feel on my cheeks and in my belly are comforting. Thinking of this stout as an actual ale and not a spirit is becoming cumbersome. I had no idea an ale of this complexity could be brewed on our small blue and green planet.

Upon arrival I could already smell the alcohol content trying to be hidden by citrus aromas...which kind of worked.. in all seriousness on of the first scents to the nose was banana. Pours a jet black with minimal light brown head. The taste of this brew at first is alcohol and coffee with slight unertones of said banana. As you drink on, the alcohol taste seems to get more and more hidden.. and at 18 percent its no wonder why. The mouthfeel of this beer is surprisingly clean.

I tend to like sippers! This beer poured pitch black. It smelled like espresso, dark chocolate, hints of licorice, toasted malt, mixed in with a little vanilla. You can definitely smell the alcohol, although it smelled more like a Brandy or Cognac. The taste is fantastic- Black licorice, almost burnt malts, some raisins, and a twinge of tobacco. This Stout feels more like a Port to me, which I love! It's sweet and a lot of flavor, one of the best stouts that I have ever tried.

Smell to me was very un stout-like. Dark rich fruit aroma with none of the roasty notes one would expect from a stout. Smell is very sweet, which may explain the lack of roastyness and prevalence of the fruit aromas. Taste is very disappointing. Super super sweet. I would have to say it is sickly sweet. Rasiny, sweet syrupy and not all that multi dimensional. It almost tastes more like a black barleywine than an imperial stout. Thick, full and syrupy mouthfeel. Really the only thing I find that I really love about this beer is how well it hides the epic ABV, which is present, but does not dominate. From what I understand this beer changes quite a lot between years and releases, one can only hope that next time I try one it is worth the hype.","zoso1967","Mar 07, 2010"

This is not a thick stout, which usually is what I would prefer, but definitely is good enough to keep me coming back to this one. The taste is intense but easy on the tongue. Alcohol presence is minimal again for the very high ABV and for me only makes itself known as it goes down, not in the mouth. I would say drinkibility is good as it is an excellent beer but even a 12oz should probably be shared with another person. Seemed to be very well paired with fresh cracked mixed nuts (especially brazil nuts, hazelnuts, and almonds). This is one I plan to revisit many times and would now like to have several vintages to see how well this beer ages over time.

It is an insane stout and very well made. The nose is so complex that I don't think that I nailed all that was in the beer.

It's surprisingly drinkable for the alcohol content, with a significant amount of the flavor coming right from the yeast I think. There's a lot of really floral flavors on top of the roasted barley that can only come from the yeast stressed out trying to produce such a high alcohol beer. I don't think this is exactly at an "A" level as the rest of BA seems think. Granted, it definitely took a lot of skill to brew this but if an "A" is perfecting the style of beer, this short of it.

The alcohol presence was present with a lovely warm burn, yet didnt seem nearly as high as it is. There was an extremely malty, raisin/fig sweetness. Very syrupy. Very dark fruit-like.

The soy sauce note in particular suggests that this beer needs at least a couple of years to really come together. This bottle was only a couple of months old, and having had a four year old bottle that seemed to have mellowed too much, especially in the aroma, I am inclined to think that a two year old bottle of this beer would be at its peak.

2.01,-52.3,3.5,2.5,2,2,1,"I am a huge fan of DFH and their uber beers. But I found the wws to be almost undrinkable. The aroma was sour with heavy alcohol. The color was brown black with little to no head. The flavor was sour and very hot alcohol. I had it out of a snifter, but I would have rather have saved the 10 bux. I love the palo santo and the raison d extra is one of the best beers that I have ever had, but this beer was next to undrinkable. I almost gagged while drinking it.","NoahSYGG","Dec 01, 2008"

The head is minimal, and vanished quickly which is understandable giving the nature of this beer. The aroma is of paint thinner dipped in chocolate, but it a good way....a contemplative way. As the beer opens up it smells more like a tawny port with chocolate, and some butter. The taste is again like a tawny port with chocolate. There is some heat in the finish, but not nearly as much as I expected from a beer at 18% ABV. The mouthfeel is very, extremely full bodied, with low, very fine carbonation.

Alcohol is present but actually not overwhelming and finishes with very strong malty taste. Aftertaste is more in line with a giant stout. Strong vanilla, bourbon taste with the roast malt in the finish.

3.88,-7.8,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours an opaque, pitch black color with a slim covering of tan head, not as thick as expected. Perhaps not as dextrinous as other high gravity stouts. Aromas are pretty typical of DFH high grav. stuff: plenty of boozy, fruity alcohol notes over which I'm truly struggling to pick out any sort of roasted aromas. That's it, it's alcohol and nothing else. On the palate, an incredibly rich, sweet, alcohol, dextrinous, thick brew lays over the tongue. I'm first hit with a barleywine like flavor, grapey port, and finally a meager, chocolaty roasted flavor. This beer is truly amazing; what it lacks in aroma (by far) it makes up for quite well in flavor. There's even a drying bitter roastiness in the finish that helps mask the cloying sweetness. Not as good as the Olde School, but a very interesting brew indeed.","dreadnatty08","Apr 20, 2008"

It tasted surprisingly mellow with a sweet, chocolaty mocha flavor. This is probably due to it being aged for a year and a half before drinking. The aftertaste slowly kicked in with slight alcohol warming, but nothing too overpowering (again surprising). The texture was very thick and smooth with only a little carbonation.

Rich espresso, dark chocolate, fig, raisin aroma which is all amplified by the high alcohol content. Very full and smooth mouthfeel. Flavor mimics the aromas well with some faint acidity.

Finish is sweet but not sugary sweet, more like molasses than candy sweet, and big alcohol boom at the end. The carbonation is surprising.

There are definite overtones of dark chocolate and raisins. Hints of almonds and Irish whiskey. Yummy. This is one of the best tasting beers I have ever drank. Mouthfeel is thin, and a bit more carbonated than I thought it was going to be, but it works for the beer really well.

Molasses, dried fruits: figs, dates and the like. Finishes dry as all get out, malt, chocolate, and a little caramel. Super amped up but really, really sweet. Mouthfeel is about as expected, a bit syrupy, but not as much as I thought it might be. Obviously more than one of these is not an option, but it is a good all night sipper, or after dinner drink to share. No balance though, and that's always key for me. too bad.

The thick mouthfeel and slap-in-the-balls taste make it difficult to do anything more than sip a very small amount at a time.

The alcohol is very noticeable though balanced by the bitter/sweet flavor. The smell is that of raisins and maybe a slight hint of orange and sawdust. The taste is semi sweet grapes, dark chocolate, and roasted coffee bean. The beer goes down easy, has a smooth mouth feel with tiny little bubbles tickling the tongue. This beer feels dangerously drinkable (considering it has such a high alcohol content) and I think I could drink another one though I know it would leave me plastered.

The nose is all kinds of dark fruit and chocolate. The aroma really pulls me in to this stout. The head is almost white, and doesn't show amazing lacing... but who cares! On the first taste the intensity and depth is all there. Everything in the nose is now slamming the palate. The light carbonation really lets the dark malts shine through, and while I expected a bitter finish, it never happens. The sweetness is balanced well, but I can't see this pairing too well with food. That's just me, liking something drier with food, but it is an amazing digestif and chill-out brew. Not cheap, but I can't see buying this six at a time.","hops4life","Feb 04, 2008"

Otherwise, it's complex, and pretty much exactly what an extreme beer lover would ask for. After leaving this one in a cellar for a year, or two, or a decade, is probably a good idea if you're looking for something a little smoother, and closer to a traditional Russian Imperial Stout/American Double Stout.

Quite complex. The taste is huge and sweet, but with amazingly balanced flavors considered how big this is and the abv. Surprisingly smooth and even better, surprisingly carbonated as well. How is it that dfh is consistently able to keep carbonation going in their biggest beers when many others are not able to pull this offf. I much prefer this over any still beer. Tastes echo those found in the nose, with long, long, long flavors. Rich and malty, but a late hit of bitter citrusy hops, and a bit of prickliness at base as well. Delicious and powerful. The mouthfeel is rich, sweet, big, and smooth. A very interesting beer and an amazing after dinner sipper out of a snifter, but absolutely huge as well.

Dark as a starless night, with a coffee with cream colored head that doesn't stick around too long, but leaves some pretty lace in its wake. Nose is roasty, with hints of chocolate, coffee (I think thats just the roast), and dark fruit. Also some sweetness like rummy caramelly sugar. Taste reveals the same and more. Full body.

Flavor was much more mild than I expected, both from a Dogfish Head product and from an Imperial Stout, but was decent and extremely smooth. There was no biting astringency that I frequently get from Imperial Stouts, and this beer hides its potent ABV quite well (caveat emptor on that one my friends).

I put it in the fridge about a week ago, and last night just grabbed it for no other reason then I felt I wanted it. Poured a very deep dark black with a minimal say one inch of thick brown head that faded rather quickly leaving behind just a touch of film across the top and a nice amount of side glass lace. Absolutely opaque, no light was coming though on this one. Smell was very full and rich, and very sweet. A ton of chocolate could be picked up at first, but this mellowed and mixed with some oak and caramel aromas. Deep sense of roasted malts comes over you, no taste of the ABV. A full on malt explosion takes hold on the first sip. Deep roasted flavors, mixed in with chocolate and a robust full earthy feel. This was really complex and very smooth. Had the thick consistency of a shake like dessert, but without the carbonation. Lots of wood and oak like flavors came though out. I was shocked by how mellow this was. It really offered me no idea of how strong it was and I was able to sip through the bottle with ease. I dont know if it was the aging or if it really is just that good, but this was excellent. Very rich and smooth and really took me by surprise. I was expecting something a bit harsher, but this was very drinkable and really very nice. I think I have another bottle floating around and if I do I will save it for a very cold night. This was a perfect nighttime sipper, probably one of the best I have had for hat role in a very long time. Definitely have to recommend this one and seek one out again.","mikesgroove","Oct 19, 2007"

2.91,-30.9,2,3.5,3,4.5,1.5,"Pours black with just a touch of deep red around the edges. Almost no head, and the little bit that's there quickly disappears leaving a brownish ring. Also, basically no lacing in a clean glass. Looks pretty much like oil in a glass. The smell is almost completely dominated by dark fruits. Even my girlfriend sitting next to me told me it smelled like I was drinking wine. There are also some hints of coffee (odd combination). Taste: Wine-like dark fruit taste up front; alcohol definitely there, but expected at 18%. This eventually fades a bit allowing some coffee and roasted malt notes to come through a bit, maybe some black licorice as well. Also some chocolate comes out as it warms. VERY sweet. Definitely let this one warm a bit. Very smooth and rich mouthfeel, not too carbonated, but not very drinkable either. Unique, but if I wanted this much of a wine taste (and smell) I would rather just drink wine....ok I would take beer over wine any day but not both at the same time.

3.8,-9.7,4,4,4,4,3,"Pours black with reddish hues and a half inch of brown head that quickly dissipates to a partial coating. Aroma is dominated by alcohol but also present are roasted malts, dark fruits, and some hints of coffee. The dark fruits are slightly more dominant than the roasted malts and at first this reminded me more of port than beer. As it warmed I was able to detect more roasted malts which balanced the aroma nicely. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma, however the alcohol is more of an afterthought while the dark fruits move to the forefront. Raisins and molasses are the 2 main flavors that I can detect here. Brown sugar and malts round out the flavor. Overall this brew is quite sweet and not particularly bitter. The dark fruits lend their flavor first then transition into an overall sweetness that lasts into the finish. The brew is full-bodied but not thick or overwhelming despite a high level of residual sweetness, carbonation is low despite a fizzy head. Overall this brew is certainly unique, enjoyable and definitely an experience. In terms of drinkability I simply can't rate this very high. I'm just not compelled to have another. The alcohol content is hidden amazingly well and results in a pleasant warming effect. So, would I recommend this? Sure, but at $9+ for a single bottle I won't be having this too often.","mnj21655","Oct 10, 2007"

Lingering aftertaste is bittersweet. Mouthfeel is medium/full, creamy, slick and coating. It leaves a nice warm feeling in my stomach! Drinkability is surprisingly good for an 18% beer. It's a sipper, but it's very smooth and easy to drink. I found myself drinking this a bit faster than I should have. Luckily I have another bottle I plan on aging another year or so. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, definitely recommended.","bluejacket74","Aug 03, 2007"
3.71,-11.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,3,"My second review of this, and i'm doing it again because i feel like the first time i was romanticising the beer somewhat. This time ill try to be totally honest. Pours thick, and excessively dark. Looks amazing. Smells of maple syrup, cocoa powder, chocolate malt and alcohol. Taste is extremely bitter for even a big olf imperial. It's almost caustic in its attack. Boozy and burning. Nutty and chocolately with hints of soy sauce. Syrupy and heavy bodied. Definitely and ass-kicker of a beer, and an experience but maybe too extreme to call it a good drinker (although you definitely enjoy it more as you drink more of it).","aforbes10","Aug 03, 2007"

When I first poured the beer, there was a creamy head which took up about the top 1/5 of the glass- just perfect. As black as night. Aromas of sweet malt, chocolate and mocha. The flavor was not dry, but in balance with the high alcohol. It almost remided me of a Belgian in that respect. This is a beer to savor, and the last sip leaves you longing for more.

The beer pours as black as black can be with a good half inch head that recedes slowly. Very strong aromas of roasted malts, dark chocolate and hops waft in my nose. The taste is a mix of espresso coffee, burnt currants, bitter chocolate and alcoholic warmth. Mouthfeel is very rich and full bodied. This is almost like sipping on a fine Madeira. The drinkability is excellent in that the strong alcohol blends in perfectly with the other flavors of the beer. I could probably down two of these in one sitting if I nursed them slowly, but I'd probably regret it in the morning. Excellent beer and highly recommended if you can find some.","rodrot","Jul 22, 2007"

Head is quickly down to a layer of tiny swirly bubbles, with froth around the rim. Aroma is alcohol, alcohol, oh and yes, alcohol. Some dark fruitiness does almost make it presence known, however. Taste starts with sweet dark maltiness, shows a glimpse of some prune/raisin character, and then hits the alcohol. Warns all the way down, and even leaves the lips a little numb. Mouthfeel is odd, starts thick, then seems to almost evaporate. Warming down the throat reminds you that you really did swallow it.

It poured with the solid, crude-oil blackness of a big stout, complete with a big ice-cream-float of a tan head. The slightly licorice-like aroma is much more restrained than Id imagined would come from this monster of a beer. Then on the first swallow, all the alcohol-powered gusto that Id savored tonight come on right away. Thick and viscuous, this sticks to your ribs on the way down to your gullet. Lots of hearty dark fruit, thick chocolate syrup and, well, almost an ashy aspect. So anyway, this is a big beer and I can appreciate the artistry in it. And I understand the rationale behind the $10/12oz price tag (read the book), but Im not real sure its worth it ... there are plenty of outstanding Imperial Stouts or Porters out there that can scratch this itch, and for a lot less dough, so unless I lose my mind, I wont feel the need to fork out 10 bucks for this one again.

Smells sweet, maybe a tinge of honey then backed by lovely chocolate, coffee aroma, and behind that a slight oaked vanilla, earthiness and a little raison and anise. Alcohol is present here (especially as it warms), but not in that impending doom sort of way, this is much more enticing. Taste personally is sinfully delicious, it is very sweet, but I love it. Raw wonderful complex sugar with a rich milky chocolate coffee character, and a medium sweet ( I like to think of it as a roar of a ) dry finish. Hints of sherried raisons and just a tinge of anise. Because of the sugary coffee character it lingers on your the back of your throat much the way sweetened coffee does and make you want that next sip. Bitterness is there, but just enough to hold the last little shred of thread to anchor this slightly a typical beast of a stout from attacking your neighbor.

Rasins, sherry, molasses, lots of fun sweet things here. Everything is there in the taste that you get int he nose, but the alcohol isn't particularly apparent. Where do you hide 18% alcohol? Behind a ridiculous amount of barley I guess. I also get some chocolate and coffee, soy sauce, and even a hint of sour cherry. I wouldn't call this an extremely dirnkable beer, it has to be someone who likes this style. Big stouts, barley wines, scotch ales, port and sherry drinkers.

4.91,16.6,3.5,5,5,5,5,"This is one of my top ten. Not neccesasarily my favorite stout, but neverless, one of the most unique. Probably the most metamorphic nose I've ever experienced. Toasty and crisp. The alcohol hides itself so incredibly well. 18%! I've never had had one to myself and almost don't think I'm ready to. Some beers are great craft work. This beer is a symphony. As soon as you have identified one flavor, it has modulated to another and offspring have breathed hot, smooth, campfire through waterfalls. I smelled in the nose of this beer a smell that i have never smelled in any other beer. Pot liquor from southern style green beans. The primary theme was vanilla, then strong maple and honey, following that, coffee, then the green beans pot liquor, then milk chocolate(not robust enough to be dark) So smooth. I smelled this beer for probably ten minutes before I even tasted it. Once I finally did, it was like tantric sex. This beer! Wow. This is what I always thought a stout from Belgium would taste like. But, then I realized that this is actually quintessentially american micro extreme. This is, in my opinion, the essence of the new American style. This is maybe a bit dramatic, but it is so amazing, and honestly I've had a few other imperial stouts tonight and alot of homebrewed chocolate stout so what can I say. I forgot to write down one of the most striking flavors. Smores! Strong toasted marshmallow, graham cracker and finally chocolate. I didn't smell this, but I tasted it. Also a bit of coconut, but only as a supporting idea, not as a main theme. I will reajourn with this one soon. By the way, i had the 2005 bottle. I think it was 18.8%.","adamdotson","Aug 27, 2006"

Even though there is definately a strong alcohol presence, this beer does a wonderful job of hiding the 18%.

The smell is alcohol laden with roasted malt and burned fruit, there is a presence of hops but it is not heavy. Tastes of heavy flavors, sipping into this is the best way as it has many flavors hiding in all that dark beer. Great mouthfeel I would like to try with a touch more carbonation at times.

The hops was a little too low for so much sweetness, but it does cover the 18% very well. The hops does come through at the very end, but then dissapears fast.

The smell tells me this is just what I need, coffee-like roasted malts with a strong bourbon smell, nice and sweet and boozy. Sugary sweet caramel and vanilla aromas mix with the roasted malts. Initial taste is roasted malts with a nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat. The alcohol is very well balanced for its strength, it goes down quite easy. Medium to heavy bodied and creamy with a little tingle from the alcohol.

Ok the smell hits you with some chocolate aromas along with some woody oak and maybe just the slightest hint of some dark berries. There is also some alcohol aroma that stings the nostrils. The taste hits you immediatley with sweetness. It is almost a chocolate cola flavor. Swimming around in there are also a few hints of some woody and berry flavors. Overall there is a nice thickness to this beer and just enough carbonation. As high in alcohol as this is you would expect it to be rather difficult to drink but i must say the warming effect that it gives you is quite enjoyable as well as the complexity of the flavor and the aroma.

Picked this up at Beers of the World in Rochester a few months ago -- $8.95 out the door, baby! Poured into an oversized wine goblet, World Wide Stout is an intense black, like spent motor oil with a fizzy caramelized sugar-colored foam cap that is rapidly reduced to a thin ring of bubbles around the glass. Nose is predominated by chocolate and alcohol vapors...booze content is pretty high in this one: as the aroma fades from my nostrils I feel a slight "chemical" burning/tickle, kind of like catching a whiff of ammonia or chlorine -- but with a strong roasted cocoa component. Begins vinous, with rum-soaked cherries and chocolate liquer flavors yielding to a roasted malt middle and a sweet cocoa finish. Then a fiery alcoholic warming lights up my entire upper digestive track. Jesus, I won't be finishing this one any time soon... Viscous mouthfeel; expansive, but not in a fluffy Belgian-ale sort of way. High alcohol content creates a lingering buzzing sensation on the tongue and gums (not to mention inside my head!). So, it's as drinkable as it can be, I guess. A great beer, but at $9 a pop and a 12 ouncer that'll get you wasted on its own, World Wide Stout is about a once-a-year thing for me.","orfeu","May 05, 2006"

Maybe I was expecting something drier, but the whole experience was ruined for me by the syrupy, sickly sweetness. Maybe I drank it too fast, who knows. In my opinion, beer doesn't need to be this strong and there's a limit on how slowly one can sip a beer.

The beer was served at about cellar tempterature, and after each sip I allowed it sit on my tongue and allow the aftertaste to linger there. The flavor proved to be surprisingly subdued but complex enough. The beer had the expected chocolate and espresso flavors along with a fair amount of roasted malt taste. The huge alcohol allowed itself to hide until the aftertaste where it slowly lingered on the tongue with a liquor like presence. The flavors melded and tasted right though, and as I delved deeper into the bottle, the more I found myself liking the beer's flavor. A very solid beer with a sheer novelty attraction because of its abv and other factors.

Uniform rings of lace circle the interior of the glass. Aromas of thick malts, dark grapes, rich red wine, dark chocolates. Taste is full and hearty; alcohol sears the mouth and throat, while flavors of dark chocolate, roasted grains and malt, dark plumbs and grapes, and red wine dance on the tongue. A sipper all the way. No gulpin' here. Mouthfeel is heavy and motor oil like; very thick, yet not too chewy or overly dense. Fair drinkablity. This is a great beer, but so powerful that I doubt i'd be back to revisit it often. Pehaps once a year is enough for me. The 18% ABV is where this beer's drinkability takes a dive.

Pours a very dark brown/black, just the slightest bit of lights around the edges, no head at all or any sign of carbonation. Aroma is a gentle roasted malt with a slight chocolate edge, port, prunes, figs, vanilla, oak, rum-soaked cherry, very nice, very delectable, alcohol doesn't dominate the nose as expected. Taste is a strong roasty/burnt malt upfront, flavors of vanilla, cocoa, and oak, with a fruity alcoholic wine-like finish. Alcohol is definitely evident in every sip, but it blends nicely with the other tastes and doesn't make you cringe. Full bodied, thick, slightly syrupy, coating your tongue with lingering goodness.

The taste was similar to the aroma....roasty, malty and almost no hop presence, but more drinkable than you'd expect for such a high ABV....even better than previous years of this same brew.

There is some rum soaked date and fig toward the finish, but mostly malty/choclate and alcohol flavors predominate. I used to think this beer was too expensive, but considering 2-4 oz is what I believe to be the proper serving you get 3-6 servings a bottle.

The aroma is fruity, kind of a soft lemon aroma, with roasted malt adding in a nice counterbalance and complexity. The aroma is very nice. The flavor is probably what I'd expect - its rather sweet, even cloying, and attempts at balance through roasted barley bitterness and some hop bitterness are pretty well done considering that if they were heavier it'd end up tasting like cough syrup. Overall, I like the concept of the beer and I'm glad to try it - it'd be great to share with the homebrew club and friends. However, I'm afraid I regard it more as a novelty - even more than most winter warmers, imperial stouts, barley wines, etc - and given its cloying sweetness I'm probably going to mark down its drinkability.","KroMagnon","Dec 02, 2005"
2.75,-34.7,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,1.5,"Smell and taste are both surprisingly weak. After drinking one, this beer is kind of an enigma to me. The smell is nice with some vanilla and molasses notes, along with some alcohol and a strange mintiness. I don't get anything else though, except some fleeting cocoa that shows up occasionally. There's not nearly as much alcohol in the aroma or taste as I expected, which is good. The taste is equally faint. I get the same vanilla and sugary sweet molasses flavors, but no roasted malt or dark fruit flavors as expected. There is a definite alcohol burn which might be inhibiting my ability to sense these other flavors, but really as with the smell, the alcohol doesn't dominate as much as you would expect, and I'm pretty sure it's just that these flavors are not there in enough abundance for me to detect. I would have to echo a lot of the other reviewers who said that the alcohol is hidden very well, but I definitely disagree that this beer is a model of complexity. There are no hops to speak of here. The mouthfeel is surprisingly milky, though medium bodied. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with this one. The deep imperial stout flavors that I expected are all missing and have been replaced by what is best described as a milk stout on steroids. It never gets too sweet, but only because the flavor isn't that strong to begin with. Drinkability is low.","PatYoda","Dec 01, 2005"

However, I wouldnt say Ive enjoyed this one more than Black Chocolate, it isnt nearly as drinkable only because of the alcohol. I will say though that for a beer with nearly 20% ABV, the alcohol is nicely mellowed by all the other flavors. Still, though delicious, its more like drinking liquor than beer.

At first I get some vanilla, and toasted barley, and then some fruits like a raison or raspberry and it finishes with a coffee after taste. The body is very thick and chewy with light carbonation and a very dry finish. The high alcohol is masked in the taste amazingly well.

Fruity flavour of ripe, sweet cherries as well as other ripe fruits, licorice, roast, coffee. This is a big malty brew with enough bitterness to balance it out. The finish remains sweet and vinous.

Licorice, chocolate, anise, molasses, plum, fuggly hops, figs, toffee. Add a rum-raisin character and it would smell like Rochefort 10. Taste is chocolate, licorice, molasses, and dark fruits. There is just enough caramel pulling through in the later parts to carry the flavor transition from early chocolatey/fruity to the roasty/sweet chocolate aftertaste. Also in the aftertaste is a great toffee that fights the alcohol and persists a long time, sometimes obtaining chocolatey notes. Alcohol is noticable through the swallow, but is behind the flavors I've already described. Roast is present but buried even farther. Some carbonation acrid hangs on my tongue and mixes well with the alcohol that teases the softer parts of my mouth. Thick mouthfeel and mild carbonation.

Smell is mainly chocolate, toffee, and sweet cherries on aroma. I even pull some almonds and roasty malts from it as well. A subtle alcohol tingle hits my sinuses as well with this one. Taste is of smooth cherries along with lots of chocolate and alcohol. I also catch some raisins and coffee tones before the swallow, which was mainly cherries. The aftertaste is of chocolate-covered cherries and is very nice. Pretty complex! Feel is Chewbacca chewy; very tough, heavy, and kicks your ass! Even though the alcohol is pretty apparent thoughout, it is decently smooth as well- balance pretty well for a brew with an 18% abv. I liked having one. I think 2 would be too much for anyone.

I was using an over-sized wine glass (DFH in fact) and this particular glass often subdues the beer keeping a good head from forming. That was the case this time. Judging by the clingy lace, it would form a decent sized one in a shaker glass. The nose is very subtle. Roasted malt, chocolate, hints of black cherry, and just a little licorice. Just a slight citrus finish. The taste is more subtle than I expected too. The chocolate, a little coffee, and with the coffee, the licorice evolves into chicory. There is a mild alcohol warming, and a just as mild hop bite. Very smooth mouth feel, but not as velvety as I had hoped. Still this is a very drinkable (and potent) stout.","carln26","Feb 12, 2005"

4.82,14.5,4,4.5,5,5,5,"I have several years of these in my collection and it took some courage to finally crack one of these beasts. I think having this on tap at the brewpub helped to ease some of the tension. I poured this out into my LaTrappe Quad goblet, surprisingly close in shape to the snifter used at the brew-pub. The body of this beer is the expected, absolutely impenetrable black, the small bit of foam I was able to coax out of this beer though is surprisingly white. That said, even an aggressive pour yielded the tiniest head which quickly receded to nothing but a thin rim about the edge of the glass. The nose is syrupy sweet with malt aromas, the sweetness eclipses the charred malt aromas youd expect (they are present though). They are however complemented by some unexpected, yet lovely notes of vanilla, milk chocolate, sugar cookies and oak (honestly I doubt this beer spends any time in oak but I detect in none-the-less). Most surprisingly the alcohol aromas are faint, what is present is very port-like. Sticky sweet malt is greets my palate initially, a company of flavors rush to join in. Fruit flavors (cherry, berries, plum) The middle is molasses thick with flavor notes of the same. The bitterness levels seem moderate, but Im sure if there wasnt the huge sweetness to balance out theyd be a lot more robust. The finish resonates bitterly and with sharp jabs of sour cherry and spicy alcohol (much less than youd expect). What an amazing beer, if only it wasnt so damn expensive Id have it much more often. Honestly I think the best deal is having it at the brew-pub for $5 instead of paying up to $8 for a bottle. Try this one if you get the chance.","FormatKid","Feb 02, 2005"
4.88,15.9,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Let me be the first to say that this is a completely different brew on draft than in the bottle.. Pours a deep opaque black with no head whatsoever. Aromas are a mix of chocolate and a slight roast mixed with dark fruits and a sake like alcohol tone. The flavor to this brew is just incredible. Up front a nice dosage of chocolate and molasses with a decent amount of sweetness (no where near as sweet as the bottled version). There is a slight vinous characteristic to this brew followed by some raisin and plum like flavors. The finish is absolutely beautiful with a firm roast and chocolate bite with a warming alcohol that fills the gullet. There is also a slight hop bitterness as well. The body to this brew is majestically creamy and full, with a carbonation that subtle yet just right. To top things off there is no easier drinking impy stout than this one which makes it quite dangerous. Overall this brew was the highlight of the night for me (way better than the three year old bottled versions of this brew), and it was soo good that I had 5 4oz samples.

Taste is complex and nice with a hot alcohol burn leading the palate into an array of taste senstations. Bakers chocolate, strong coffee, brandied fruits, and other flavors battle it out on this playground of palate-singing disaster. Mouthfeel is nice, thick and syrupy as expected, but to style as well. Drinkability is good, but ya know, how much of this stuff are you going to have this year. 10ounces is almost enough. Almost.","francisweizen","Jan 05, 2005"

Roasted malt with vanilla, oak, and banana ester as it warmed, this stout had a wine like characteristic in the complexity of the aroma. The flavor is malty, sweet and roasted, with the bitterness and alcohol both mellow and subdued. The texture is excellent, velvety-smooth, and think, warming as it goes down. This is the stuff of which legends are made.","redmosquito","Dec 28, 2004"
4.44,5.5,4,5,4.5,5,3.5,"My first sampling of World Wide Stout, much anticipated. Looks like nothing out of the ordinary for a stout. A hearty dark brown color with not too much dark brown head coating the top. Smell is wonderfully complex. Sweet dried cherries come to mind as well as fine liquers, brandy, cordials, and nice roasted malt and barley, although that seems to take a back seat here to the fruity boquet. A singe of alcohol in the nose, not oppressive in the least. Taste is just as creative and complex as the smell. I definately see the sweetness that others site as a downfall, but I don't particularly think it's dominating this beer. There's plenty else going on here. As mentioned above, the dark fruit tastes are great. I feel like I'm drinking fine alcohol or something, this really is a top notch drink. Tough to think of it as just a beer, really. But it is. Ahhh, the wonders of beer. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and syrupy, a nice touch to this intense brew. As good as this beer is, I can't quite give it a high mark on drinkabilty. This simply isn't the kind of beer you (or I wouldn't anyway) want to drink a sixer of. A great way to end a quiet holiday evening, or treat yourself to something nice. No need to drink a bunch of this stuff anyway as it's quite the asskicker. To give my highest compliments, this is an extremely unique brew with a lot of character. Enjoy.","twelvsies","Dec 26, 2004"

Note; this is also my first Dogfish brew, won't be the last. I thought Id enjoy this as a winter warmer as I poured it after a 10 inch snow falls worth of shoveling and plowing. It poured black with a nice inch plus tan head. Lace was good with rings all glass long. The aroma was of barley malt with a hint of alcohol. The taste was also of malted barley followed by alcohol over any hop. The taste also carried hints of malases, dark fruit like plum and raisin, alcohol, and hints of light chocolate. The mouthfeel was creamy smooth that aided the drinkability. A fine brew for sure. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and just plain delicious. I did notice an oil feel left on the lips.

The aroma is most complex. Dark fruits, strong alcohol, raisins, cherries, roasted malts, chocolate. Wow, what an aroma. The alcohol lends a large part to the nose. The flavor was just as complex as the aroma. Great strong malt character - mostly roasted with a little chocolate. Lots of fruits in the flavor - cherries, figs, and a lot of sweetness. The alcohol is very upfront throughout, but I like it that way. Reminds me to drink it slowly. Very nice beer.

Taste is sweetwith a serious alcohol mouth-numbing and warming sensation. Lots of malt and sugary sweetness.plums, raisins, chocolate, and still more alcohol. Full and almost chewy mouthfeel.

4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"This beer pours a nice black color wtih hints of brown around the edges. The small head falls to ring the beer. The first thing we noticed after pouring the beer was the sweet cherry aroma in the air. Sticking my nose in the glass gives me chocolate covered cherries coated with amaretto. The alcohol is apparent in the nose, but not offensive. The flavor is doing a lot of different things. I get a sweetness that is close to cherry, but also a little fig like. There is a bit of a chocolate character after swallowing, andthe alcohol is there all through this beast. I would expect that to mellow over time. Still this beer is nice. The feel is huge thick. Its a monster. Drinkability sufferes from the apparent alcohol, but I don't think that a beer that rings in at 18%ABV should be too drinkable. Its a nice offering that will definately get better with time.","kmpitz2","Dec 16, 2004"
4.35,3.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Finally decided to open up another one of these to do a review of. With a slightly vigorous pour a decent half-inch tan head rose over the pitch black body, which is more than I would expected from a 2year old brew this strong. As expected after its brief appearance the head slinks away into the black body never to be heard from again. Aroma was quite full with dark fruits like prunes, sweet chocolate malt and a touch of alcohol all rolled into one. Flavor starts off with a dark fruity sweetness before leading into the chocolate malt. Notes of raisins, prunes and alcohol were in the mix. The flavor ends with a sweet alcohol burn that is not too strong. This stuff is thick, maybe not Dark Lord thick but down a level. It definitely fills the mouth with just a small sip, which keeps you from drinking it too quick. It also has a bit of a slick and warm feel to it as well. Drinkability is excellent on this brew with its thickness being the only thing holding you back a bit. Alcohol for the most part is well hidden but otherwise adds to the experience. Excellent example of how a big beer should be done.","meathookjones","Dec 15, 2004"

The nose is fruity, with a strong barley background. The mouth is fairly prickly and pretty heavy bodied, although not cloying by any means. The taste is surprisingly fruity, plums and raisins - much less maltiness than expected (or promised). the hops are subdued by the fruit, with only a touch of raostiness and espresso following the finish.

Nice didn't know what I was expecting but this is smooth rich drinkable stout. Alcohol is noticable and it warms the body but no more so then a normal 10% stout this is an amazing beer and at 21% its unbelievable its so drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich but not overly heavy alcohol must lighten it up some.

The taste lingered until it finished into a clean roasted flavor that was perfectly balanced. I was very pleased by how long the flavor lasted as it was very enjoyable as the extremely high alcohol content warmed my throat all the way to my stomach. The beer feels very viscous on the tongue and carries a smooth mouthfeel with a light tingle from the carbonation. World Wide Stout is very much at home in the world of high alcohol ales as it's body and alcohol remind one of a barleywine but it's rich roasted flavors take the style of Imperial Stout to new extremes.","RenoZymurgist","Jul 20, 2004"

The pour was a thick, oily black as night liquid, with a very thin tan head, which disappeared quickly. Swirling the glass brough back a slight head as time wore on. Not much lace as this one was drank, perhaps the alcohol burned it off. Smells like dark fruit (plums, raisins), were present. Smells pretty strong! Taste is in the beginning a coffee note, followed by plums, dark bread, rum and figs. This is no doubt a full-bodied beer, extra full and chewy to be precise. No carbonation in this thing. Overall, very interesting. This wasn't really my cup of tea, but I do appreciate it. Very complex, there are tastes that you could equate to beer, and others more like a port wine.

The sweet, malty taste gives way to a dark chocolate (70% at least) finish that lasts longer than the warming sensation which spreads slowly throughout the entire body. Drinkablility is hard to define with this beer, because it depends so much upon the context (half the bottle would be a perfect nightcap, or one could pair it with a decadent dessert).

Smell is more complex than anything I have experienced - banana, cider, grapes, sweet candylike barley, backed up with a bit of chocolate malt, and a bunch more that I can't quite put my finger on. Unlike any imperial stout I have come across. Flavor was sweet with alcohol on the tip of the tongue, molding into a rich fruity/malty flavor mid-palate, and finishing with an efervescent, spicy hoppiness and a warming effect on the throat. Very well balanced for having such a high ABV, definitely one of the best sipping beers I have ever had. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, very smooth and creamy - simply delicious. I feel I probably have understated the impressiveness, complexity, and character of this stout, as I am truly taken aback - but I am sure some of the other, more poetic reviewers have done what I can't. I was apprehensive of whether an $8 bottle of beer can really be worth it (I actually felt that the 120 Minute, while good, was not worth the bucks). Well, this was worth ever penny.

Mouthfeel is interesting - quite thin actually, with very small bubbles of carbonation. This beer is not that drinkable because of it's strength, and I wish that it came in a smaller bottle.

Unlike some other sweet, high ABV DFH offerings, this brew brings a more round and well-developed multi-dimensional flavor in which the elements don't blur each other, showing more maturity and character. I'd truly fear going overboard with this, as I would candy, because the aforementioned high ABV is a real red flag of caution.

You'd have to be blindfolded in an unlit cave in the deepest reaches of the earth to find something more black. Smell was complex. The high alcohol was obvious, as was the overall complexity of the brew. First taste was overwhelming - this is a complicated brew. Notes and hints of a liquor in the interweaving of massive hops and malts, but still definately a brew. This is a beer to be enjoyed slowly. It goes to eleven.

Some hoppy bitterness is present but could be stronger I think. Oh!!! But wait... Now that it is warm, it definately port-like. Yes! It is a port! And a good one at that. I smell brandy! Wow. Mouthfeel is thick and velvet as you would suspect. Drinkability is pretty good considering but too sweet for a beer...like the 120 minute. But if you consider this as a port, it is quite drinkable. I would recommend serving like a port, perhaps a quarter or half pint a person. This is genious...how did they get an ale to taste like a fully-fleshed port??? A great contribution from Dogfish head. This should not be called a stout... it should fall into a new style category called "port ales". Try it and be perplexed!","HiroProtagonist","Dec 27, 2003"

We also notice the alcohol in there, but would of course never say 23%, making us believe this could be around 12% is an art by itself. The taste is also relatively complex, but way too sweet, almost harsh candy. The mouthfeel is full and a definition of syrupy: toffee, cinammon, vanilla, chocolate and coffee and an alcoholic malt finish.

The body is big and rich, with a complex blend of chocolate, malt, coffee and plum in the flavor. The finish is where the light alcohol burn reminds you it hasn't gone anywhere since the initial whiff. There is some bitter coffee in the finish as well.

The finish was light for the style and sweet with a slightly burnt aspect. Supposedly, they have redone the most recent batch according to the website so that it is closer to the 18 % version.

The mouthfeel confirmed the ridiculous amounts of barley in the brew, but the flavors of coffee and tannins left rather too quickly and left me with the taste of elevated ABVs.

The head explodes initially and then leaves little islands of bubbles as it starts to fade. Eventually, the entire head disappears leaving only interminable darkness. The smell is noticeably sweet, with notes of raisin and molasses and just a bit of chocolate. It doesn't have much of that wonderful roasted malt smell or taste. The taste, in fact, is a bit sweeter than expected but an overwhelming alcohol taste is not a problem. The 21% abv is well-hidden.

I'm not sure how to rate it's drinkability; while it is one of the tastiest brews I've had, the alcohol content deters you quite a bit. I just couldn't get into that "wine drinking" state of mind.

I thought that the Samuel Adam's Triple Bock tasted like marsala wine, but dogfish head changed my thinking. It had little head that dissipated quickly (not too much of a concern since it would take me forever to drink it anyway.) Very robust aroma. The taste is sweet like prunes and alcohol is obviously apparent. I was amazed at my first sip. It gave me a very warm feeling as if I was drinking a fine scotch. One of my friends made a comment about how slow I was drinking it. Ok, so I'm not man enough for this beer, but I did finish it eventually. It might be a good idea to share this with friends (even though it costs $9 a bottle.) That's the only reason it lost drinkability points, but if the occasion is right the $9 just might be worth it.","dmarch","Apr 08, 2003"

Decent taste!!! What a concept!! This beer tasted like coffee ice cream when first poured semi-cold. A very nice sweetness at first, with ice cream really coming to mind, masking the alcohol as well as one could expect at 23%. At first it seemed there was no way this was 23%, but when I let it warm a bit the alcohol was STRONG and the beer seemed more like a brandy. Split a 12oz and that's about all I could drink of this stuff, but compared to the Sam Adams (about the only brew i've had that is similar to this) this brew was much more drinkable and enjoyable to drink. A novelty nonetheless, but a solid effort. Drink this one cold.","avylover","Mar 30, 2003"

4.6,9.3,5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"2001 version. Utterly opaque with the deepest possible black onyx hue. Thin, but tight and impressively persistent creamy brown head considering the high alcohol content. Sparse, oblong foam aggregates decorate the glass. Intense waft of heaty alcohol drenched prunes and oak lend a fruit laced bourbon impression upfront in aroma. Alcohol heat diminishes, allowing deeply rich bittersweet chocolate, carob and carbonaceous, smokey roasted barley to surface. Fruit of a figgy nature emerges towards the end of the aroma, along with judicious, mellow butterscotch. Delectable, and akin to a tawny port / imperial stout hybrid aromawise. As the beer warms, a slightly salty, molasses and soy sauce combination becomes perceptible. In flavor, a surge of milk chocolate and residual unfermented sugar bathes the palate initially, then is ensued by a combination of coffeeish roasted barley bitterness and pseudosweet ethanol. Mellow dark fruit emerges mid palate, and is comprised of expected dried prunes, but a note of tart, mildly acidic black currants adds contrast. Molasses tinged sweetness persists as a constant undertone and is only partially offset by overshadowed hop bitterness. Full bodied, viscous, with a tongue coating oily mouthfeel that borderlines on being syrupy. Finishes long, with notes of treacle and anise diminishing slowly, only to be superceded by enveloping alcohol warmth. A complex, intense, yet unexpectedly balanced beer. World Wide Stout is like an imperial stout in overall character, but with a more pronounced ethanol, port like character. If you're ever indecisive about choosing a vintage port or imperial stout, drink this and have your cake and eat it too. I do feel, however, that similar complexity could've been acheived with much lower alcohol content. Superb drinkability, with a creeping ethanol presence. Almost wonderful.","marc77","Mar 09, 2003"

It is essentially like a sweet ruby port with a shot of bourbon in it. Since I like each almost as much as I like beer, this is a dream beer to me. The sweet wine notes linger around seemingly forever in the aftertatse, like a good chocolate truffle. I'll have to consider buying a couple more bottles to age. The mouthfeel is thick and luxurious as it coats the tongue. The drinakbility is good considering the ABV of the beer. One bottle will last an afternoon, but on certain occasions I can see me yearning for another one of these babies. Like today, amidst the beginning of one of the larger snowfalls of recent years.

And then I could savor the aroma bringing vanilla, roastiness, raisins, and dark fruits to mind....and of course alcohol. My first taste required a deep deep breath afterwards. The strength in flavor and alcohol kick is very very high. But surprisingly the alcohol isn't overpowering at all. It's very warm with a slight burn down the throat and that's it. The warmth stays and the burn goes. During that process, rich flavors of molasses, chocolate, and coffee present themselves smoothly. This beer definitely needs to be sipped. I started out with fast sips and my stomach is feeling pretty heavy. But as your stomach warms and the beer warms, it is very smooth to drink. Of course the last few sips will be tough to taste as well since the 23.04% ABV will have kicked in already. This is why I rated drinkability lower, because you simply don't need a second bottle.

The smell recedes a little (not much!) to make room for licorice, molassess and some spicy notes. Pours black, with no head whatsoever. How do you rate a black hole on appearance? The taste is, well, big. Tons and tons of roasted barley, chcolatey malt, with a decent level of hop bitterness, though not enough to keep the finish from being fairly sweet. Dark fruit (raisin, fig) and lots of peppery spices abound as well. Someone else mentioned Turkish coffee as an analogue, and they're dead-on.

Again rum & coke comes to mind, but also port wine, grape, caramelized dark fruits, roasted chocolate malts, and alcohol.

The taste started off with the alcohol on the tongue, then the berries and the fruit seemed to arise as well as the caramel/sugary, slightly sweet was left at the end. It was a thick brew. This seemed to get better as I left it sit in the glass and get warmer. The flavors seemed to jump more as the temperature rose. I loved this, for so many reasons.

It is slightly syrupy, but with that much grain and alcohol (23%+ for the 2002 batch) it's to be expected. This is a true sipping beer. The complexity of this ale will keep you sipping until you can't stand up. Each sip is a different order of flavors and sensations. The after taste is alcohol and fruit.
