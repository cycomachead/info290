4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/19/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Light herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with an awesome roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible imperial stout. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 09, 2015"

The taste is sweet with some hops still lingering around although I'm sure they have faded considerably over the last couple years. This one drinks deceivingly well considering the high ABV. Overall, I haven't had a fresh bottle to enjoy of this beer but it is damn tasty after a couple years. Moral of the story: drink one fresh and save at least one to enjoy years down the road.

Aromas of booze, dark cherry and fig sweetness, molasses, and a touch of earth and wood. Roasted notes on the nose, too. Flavors are rich and darkly sweet, with molasses first and foremost, hints of earth and old world fruit, and a touch of roast at the end. Earthy tones help take the cloying off the sweet body, and there is a touch of bitterness that brings balance to the brew. A deep, slow building warmth starts from the booze. The beer is bold and smooth in mouth, with a smooth, clean finish. Aftertaste is heavy and lingering, with subtle molasses and fruit sweet. Heavy hitter, but very good.","GarthDanielson","Apr 13, 2013"

I am a kid at heard (but luckily legally able to drink), so I enjoyed watching the falling out of the hard pour into a shaker. What was even more fun, especially for my wife, was how the foam, just perfectly cresting the glass by a tiny amount, looks like a sugar cookie sitting on top of the glass. With a whiff, there was a pretty noticeable hop presence, but of course not like an IPA. There was also a very strong sweetness that just billowed out of the glass. Taking a big gulp, you get a really, really malty kick, with only a touch of roasted-ness to it. It really had a delicious flavor, and the hop smell that was so strong was only partly present on the tongue. It's hard to believe that this much flavor isn't from barrel-aging, especially with how long the malts linger in your mouth. With a high ABV, it should be a long-sipping beer, but the flavor and silky-smooth texture had me pounding this thing. Awesome.","yankeepride","Apr 12, 2013"

Pours a dark black hue with a one finger khaki head. The first thing that comes across on the nose is dark fruit and light bourbon, along with chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, and some hop character. The taste is pretty incredible at this stage: Developed dark fruits and caramel mixed with a bold dark chocolate flavor. This has a nice charcoal/wood complexity to it as well. It's followed by a light bitter flavor and a lasting malt finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, sticky, heavy bodied, with light carbonation. Night Stalker is a very satisfying stout, and it's not too over the top or boozy. Good stuff Brett Porter! ; )","mnphish","Mar 15, 2013"

I contacted goose island with my bottle date and time stamp just so they could try and limit the people that wasted over 10 dollars on this and instead of letting me know that they were looking into this, they sent me a generic letter saying how they used different hops and it brought on a different taste from years past. They did not go on to explain why people who have tried multiple bottles from this years batch have tasted two really different beers.

But I should be judging it against other Imperial Stouts, and this is where it just doesn't measure up, in fact it would be a 2 because I'm not getting a lot of the roasted malt character that Imperial Stouts usually bring. I'm glad to have tried this because the flavour profile is interesting- certainly not infected- and is actually drinkable. But it's not what I expect from beers such as Old Rasputin or FIS.

3.73,-8.4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"O - Interesting beer. I've had some hoppy stouts before but this one seems a bit odd. The flavors and aromas don't add up to me as it warms. It is unplesant in a pruny sort of way at times, not sure if this is a not a great bottle or perhaps it was mishandled or something. But as far as this bottle goes it was nice to try but not something I'd probably seek out again.","Teleweizen2","Dec 20, 2012"
4.36,7.1,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is an interesting and different stout. I'm not sure if I'm a huge fan of hopping a stout a lot, but it does provide a different drinking experience. This one reminds me of a black IPA more than a hopped up stout because of the more prominent burnt malts over the chocolate. Not sure if I'd go hunting for this one again, but as it is a GI imperial stout for under $10 a bomber, it is a solid value. Definitely a stout to experience at least once.","boilermakerbrew","Dec 20, 2012"

There is also a good hop aroma in there as well which is impressive for a beer that is over a year old. The taste is very nice, big amounts of malt and hops, it's got chocolate and boozy vanilla in there too. There is bitterness of some coffee in there too. The mouthfeel is thick, it's oily and smooth with a moderate carbonation to it. Overall this beer was very good, it was well worth the price in my opinion.

This beer is actually quite high up there on my list of favorite Imperial Stouts, so that's something. The aroma is so nice, it's nearly intoxicating (pun intended). The taste, though not quite as good as the aroma, is really quite nice. And the mouthfeel? Damn near superb. If you like stouts, give this one a try. I really need to get one fresh to really see how these hops are while it's young. That said, this is one great candidate for aging!

It starts off nicely, with rich chocolate and roasted malt aromas melding together well, with some bright hops providing support. But then some strange off-flavor rears its head--burnt rubber, maybe? The taste is pretty bad. I have little desire to dissect what I'm tasting, but here goes: mouthwatering hops, burnt coffee, bitter non-delicious high cacao chocolate. Full bodied and medium carbonation, a little high for the style. Overall, not particularly good. I don't know what happened here.

Slight boozy smell, but at 11.7% that is to be expected. I'm not super experienced with stouts so the nuances of the style are still lost on me but I liked it. A bit heavy in the mouth. This is a sipper, not the session IPAs I've been drinking of late (surly rules). Malty, a little chocolaty, and boozy is what I can come up with.

The flavor also showcases the hops and dark fruit detected in the aroma. There is also a creaminess to this beer from the smokiness of the malts and a milk chocolate-like flavor that is really quite nice.

4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this while talking to GI brewers about beers. Pours relatively dark with a small brown head. Aroma is interesting, hints of hops and roasted chocolate. Taste is good, lots of hops for a IS then the maltiness of the stout hits on the back. Very Ying Yang effect on the taste buds. The back end is not very complex as it hasn't been aged but also isn't too bitter for a young stout. It feels smooth but has a very hot character from the 11% ABV. Very solid, I will put a bottle away for a bit to see how it develops! The GI brewers did mention that this stout is intended to be consumed fresh to capture the hop characteristics before they fade.","fo1ksguitar","Aug 07, 2011"

Quite hoppy smell, with rich earthy imp stout aroma, bitter chocolate and coffee. Bitter from the outset with strong espresso coffee, and a potent hoppy bitterness. It finishes with a lingering bitter aftertaste but with a fruity grapefruit hoppiness pushing through. Alcohol is quite prominent. Thick and creamy feel. Full bodied. Just enough light fine carbonation. It's all about the bitterness. One of the bitterest Imp Stouts I have tasted. Goose Island claim it is heavily hopped and it damn well is.","PartyBear","Jul 31, 2011"

This really was as close to mousse like character in a stout that I've ever had. Fluffy, yet with bold and deep nutty flavors. Like I said in the flavor, there's an unusual volume on the flavors of the nuts in this brew. A really eclectic nutty meal makes this into an exotic treat. I'd love to contrast this aged brew with a fresh one. I'm really curious how some hoppiness might fair in a younger flavor profile.","Cavery","Jul 20, 2011"

Smells of dark roasted malts, spices, lots of citrus zest, and slight chocolate. To me this smells very much like Anchor's Our Special Ale. Taste is extremely hoppy up front with loads of citrus zest and pine. The malt, spices, and chocolate come through on the finish. There is a nice hop/roast bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation and is very thick and creamy in the mouth. There is a noticeable alcohol burn in the throat with each sip.

But I wasnt exactly converted. The alcohal was not hidden at all. In fact it was very up front. Maybe it would be better with some time, but would loose a lot of the hop, which is one part of the beer I liked. Over all average, not horrible. Despite how easy it is for me to get, there are a dozen stouts I would turn to before giving this one a second thought.","Kayn169","Jun 24, 2011"

I've read that the hops are VERY present when this beer is fresher, and while I definitely enjoy hoppy beers, I like my stouts thick, rich, smokey and malty and this one definitely fits that bill. Excellent nose, excellent flavors, I would say the only thing that would slow me down is the weight and ABV, but I'm willing to take my chances.","bamadog","Jun 17, 2011"
4.52,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"O: Boy, this is a really nice beer. There are some this will find this beer a little too boozy for them, but I like it..a lot.

3.75,-7.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a near black, glossy sheen, small cap of bubbly khaki head, good ring or retention with spotty lacing. Scent unexpectedly dominated by citrusy hops (orange and grapefruit) with roasty and toasty malts and touches of bitter chocolate - getting flashbacks to cheap chocolate "oranges". Taste is a huge burst of pungent hops - grapefruity, orangey and touches of pine resin. Noticeable notes of alcohol before heavy malts present themselves. Full bodied, sticky and dry, high carbonation for style with bubbles forming a new head when swirled moderately. Didn't expect a hop bomb from a Imperial Stout. If I knew, I would have aged for a year. Too hoppy and hot. Bottled 2/11.","rfgetz","Jun 17, 2011"

4.47,9.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle dated 2/6/11, some four months old. It pours a full bodied midnight black in color with a light dark khaki head which laces the glass. It definitely doesn't appear as thick as the BCBS variants. It smells of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and then finishes with a sweet orange hop aroma. You don't get that from most imperial stouts. The aromas work very well together. The flavors are of coffee, bitter and sweet chocolates, oranges, and it leaves you thinking you just ate some orange Andes mints after a swig of coffee. It is very flavorful really interesting, compared to most of the style. I really enjoy it. It drinks very oily and is pretty chewy. It's a sipper for the most part. The alcohol is also nowhere to be found. Overall, this is a superb beer. I'm glad it's available almost year round.","aasher","Jun 04, 2011"

I tried Big John a few weeks ago and thought that the cacao nibs added to the brew pushed the sweetness and chocolate factor over the top, diminishing the quality of the drink. Here we have a more balanced, though certainly very sweet, RIS from Goose Island that gets the job done in a much more satisfactory way. As far as the RIS style goes, this isn't an envelope pusher, but it's certainly worth a try or two, especially if your sweet tooth is acting up. 4","mwill7287","May 28, 2011"

3.08,-24.3,4,3.5,2.5,4,3,"O: Man…the more I have Goose Island’s “best” beers, the more I’m turned off. I heard BCBS is basically this beer with an even bigger oaky booze flavor. In that case, I don’t think I’ll continue my hunt for the famed barrel-aged creation. It must be a specific brewery trait, because all I taste is a sad grouping of artificial flavors. Sorry Goose Island, but I don’t think your absorption into Anheuser-Busch will change a whole lot about the taste of your beers.

First sip was a kick in the mouth, in a good way. Strong hops with rich dark malts. Coffee, chocolate and others all come into play.

The nose has undertones of coffee, malt and touch of hops. On first taste it has a rich viscosity heavy in the mouth. Very smooth and only slightly boozy and you can tell with a little age under it's belt it's going to turn into something special.

4.22,3.7,4.5,5,4,3.5,4,"O- I like it, and will definitely drink it again. The most impressive quality of the beer for me is the aroma. Even after three months since bottling the dry hopping is seriously noticeable. The beer is fairly complex, but far from unapproachable. High alcohol makes for a bit of a burn, but the flavor is not compromised. Biggest complaint here is the carbonation. Let it age and this will subdue, but you'll lose some hops. I say drink it now and later so get two!","CMB2012","May 02, 2011"
4.22,3.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"All around a pretty righteous imperial stout. While fresh, it's spot-on for a hopped-up take on the style and it smooths over well with some age. The only downside is the sheer alcohol heat which is strong even for 11.7% abv.","Ryan011235","May 01, 2011"

The taste is overwhelming with alcohol and extremely bitter hops. Also, I would catch notes of chocolate, but the alcohol was so overpowering that I had trouble finding anything good from this beer. The beer was very thick and creamy and had perfect carbonation. The beer has potential and would probably be a lot better if it was dated 2/6/09 not 2/6/11. The overpowering alcohol really turned me off from this beer. I may pick one up for the cellar and try it in a couple of years and hopefully that will change my opinion of this beer for the better.","brian44556","Apr 19, 2011"

Fairly sweet smelling. Taste is spot on with huge bitter dark chocolate notes and a nice crisp hop finish. I have read about the hop presence in this and even after a year it is still very noticeable. A great tasting stout. Mouthfeel is quite viscous.

Roasted malt, bitter chocolate, coffee, and slight alcohol also present. I take a few sips and am amazed at how good this beer is. Deep roasted malts, coffee notes, bitter chocolate, a touch of booze warmth, burnt sugar, and hops late. Full body, low/medium carbonation, and a slightly dry finish round out this ale. I will always love Goose Island beer even with the recent changes in ownership. This beer rocks and I will lay some down for as long as I can last- loved it!","gnemesis","Apr 10, 2011"

4.25,4.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a dark, slightly sluggish concoction with a almond colored head that leaves behind patches of lacing. The aroma is dominated by alcohol, toast and caramel. The taste follows suit with intense sweet malt and alcohol melding together to form a rich, heavy brew. In my mouth the beer feels sticky and heavy. The aftertaste lingers for some time and is both dry and sweet. Overall, this was an interesting beer that I enjoyed. Aging allowed this beer to meld and soften while also perhaps increasing the ABV a touch.

4.2,3.2,4,4,4,5,4.5,"This pours black with maybe just a touch of light penetration on the sides, but probably not, a nice mocha head that dies away pretty quickly and little lace. On the nose I've got a couple of things: first, piney hops, a huge amount for a stout in my experience, but also dark chocolate and alcohol. A strange combination which could be really good, I think. In the mouth, there is chocolate all around, a hint of booze, and lots of bitterness at the back, mostly hoppy but also some roast bitterness. The finish is huge and takes forever, the huge body coating the whole mouth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, I quite like this beer, one of the more unique big stouts I've had, and a welcome change from the tyranny of your basic coffee/chocolate flavors that tend to dominate these beers.","EricCioe","Mar 18, 2011"
4.21,3.4,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Midnight black body with just a millimeter of dark ruby color illuminated at the edge of the glass. A thick cap of mud-colored head tops it. Magnificent appearance. Smell has at first a bold dark chocolate aroma, accented with honey sweetness, followed by a bit of dandelion. Taste is at first marked with chocolate kinds of roasted malt, a blend of sweetness, a surprising jolt of citrus and piney hops that lingers well after each sip is done. The combination of dark stout flavors with and IPA-like hop profile is not often executed well, but here it blends well. Mouthfeel is creamy, not too heavy. Still, its a huge beer. Delicious, but hard to drink more than one.","KBomb","Mar 17, 2011"

Thin ring remains around the glass as the lacing dissipates into translucent islands. Smell is complex; hop pine, licorice, anise, sweet roast malt, slight bourbon, soy. Taste is roast malt, chocolate, soy, slight bourbon and oak, coffee, molases, prunes, really complex, deeeelicious. Sweetness and medium thickness in mouthfeel make this damn near perfect. Alcohol doesn't dominate, carbonation is a bit on the low side, but again, almost perfect for this brew. Sweetness begins to gang up on you and coat the mouth after several sips; slight pine makes its way through the malt as well. Not too drinkable, in the way that one will definitely kick your a**, but up there with the RIS style that I so much love.","youradhere","Nov 22, 2010"

Not much to look at really, just a big black beer. The aroma is pretty typical for the style, but a grassy hop is present in the aroma along with bitter chocolate , slightly burnt wheat toast and dried fruit. Not bad, the grassy aroma kind of detracts from anything else though, it's tough to focus on anything else. Interesting taste, somehow I really get wheat bread out of the flavor with a rustic espresso finish and touch of bitter chocolate, sweet canned fruit, molasses and grass. Grass and wheat bread seem to be a couple odd ball flavor profiles for this one for me. The mouthfeel is full and chewy and the and the carbonation is nice for a heavy beer like this but the overall drinkability isn't to high on this one for me.

The chocolate and earth were there and then an intense bite of hops and a slightly sour finish. The flavors evolved throughout the drinking with new ones taking over with each sip. This thing almost overwhelms you with the wall of flavor. The mouthfeel is very smooth and just coats with every sip. Drinkability? You better have a friend with you to drink this 22oz bomber. I sat down and drank the thing alone over a 2.5 hour period and it knocked me on my butt (I'm a lightwieght but this thing is not to be trifled with).

Pours a dark brown color which is black in the tulip glass, small tan head, no lacing. Aroma is super hoppy! Reminds me of Darkness, but without the cat-piss Simcoe hops. Roasty chocolate, alcohol, and herbal, piney hops in the nose. Taste is pretty on par with the aroma. I really like the roasty chocolate tastiness, but the hops are overbearing. I like my imperial stouts to be semi-sweet and malty, which this is, but I can't get over the hoppiness that overtakes what I look for in a stout. Full bodied, sticky, lightly bitter.

Not very good with salty foods or especially with salty snacks-- it becomes simply bitter-tart and sweet without flavor remaining.

4.37,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Black with a thin mocha cap of fine bubbles. It looked almost dead during the pour. The little bit of foam that was present stuck around for a while and left a bit of spotty lace on the glass. Lots of grapefruit in the aroma initially, citrusy and fruity, which gave way to roast and toffee, caramel and chocolate, over time. Alcohol was present, but not overpowering. Nice flavour. Bitterness seemed to come from hops and dark grains, giving it a bittersweet chocolate flavour. Lots of citrus up front, toffee and caramel, bready, roast through the mid. Significant alcohol in the finish, but well short of being hot. Lingering maltiness, sweet toffee, grapefruit and alcohol. Full bodied and sort of heavy, very creamy carbonation, luxurious smooth palate coating texture. Lots of alcohol warmth. This is a tasty beer. I'm not always a fan of big stouts with considerable hop character, but it worked for me in this beer since it seemed more of an accent rather than the main focus.

4.7,15.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Dense, thick, totally black pour. 3 inch head formed but settled into a thick, creamy 1.5 inches. The initial nose suggests dark roast, smoke, vanilla, and hops. Thick, sweet, medium dense body. The front speaks to vanilla and hints of anise. The middle is rich and shows the alcohol, which, fortunately, is balanced against the chocolate and roasted notes. The nose over time blossoms into extensive hop and burnt sugar notes. Nice Belgian lace forms. The finish is rich, warm, lingering and makes me think of molten chocolate and brandy desserts. This is an excellent beer. It is moreish, but given the high ABV should be consumed with care. This is a cerebral ale! Excellent after-dinner or dessert beverage. Would also do well with grilled, smoked and BBQ-ed food.","carlborch","Jul 08, 2010"

I was a bit disappointed in it; the hevay dry-hopping that I was told was a major part of Nightstalker just wasn't apparent on that draught pour. Hilarious right? Increasingly I feel as if I was served a different beer, like the base beer w/o hopping or something. This bottled version has been nothing short of a revelation. It is drinking Heavenly right now and I need to procure more bottles. Quickly.","Reaper16","Jun 29, 2010"

3.81,-6.4,4,3,4,4.5,4,"I was expecting a bit more of a foreboding label based on the name. Oh well, the mysteriousness works too, I suppose. The beer pours an opaque black-brown topped by about a finger of tan foam. The nose comrpises a surprising amount of hoppy florals and greenery, with some roasted malts hanging around in the background. This is more of a pale ale's smell than a stout's. The taste holds notes of chocolate syrup, molasses, roasted malts, brown sugar, and, near the end, a strong but still understated bit of hoppy bitterness. Though the bitterness threatens to steer the situation away from impy stout territory, it is restrained enough to allow the stoutness to maintain its dominance. The body is a nice heavy, with light carbonation and a smooth, chewy feel. Overall, a good bit o' brew, but not one I'll necessarily refer to as "great". A good one-timer.","TMoney2591","Jun 27, 2010"

A mammoth of a beer, and one that I can say is decidedly better than its bourbon barrel aged counterpart. Some alcohol is present in the swallow currently, but I think it's actually at a good level now and contributes to the overall profile. Went down smooth and easy as it warmed. What a lovely beer.","Bubba83","Jun 25, 2010"
3.7,-9.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Perhaps I expected too much, but I was a bit letdown with this one. A big beer with a substantial, but not overpowering, abv. Up front was nicely creamy with deeply roasted malt flavor. The middle was dominated by a molasses/sorghum sweetness that seemed too sweet and too raw, as if the beer needed a good deal more time to mature. Not unpleasant, but the overall effect was of a beer that was still unfinished. According to the bottle the beer can mature for several years, so I think I will put one back and revist some cold winter evening.","Brent","Jun 23, 2010"

So many of the imperial stout characteristics you expect, yet so much more you don't normally find in the style. It's a big beer in a big bottle and probably best to share, but I'm not having too much trouble going it alone.

Aroma of bitter hoppy notes with roasted malt notes - definitely more hoppy then I was expecting. Taste is also dominated by loads of hops with bitter and citrus notes not common for the style with a side of light roasted malt notes. Body is quite full with a creamy texture and good carbonation with no signs of alcohol. Very good which is not surprising considering the brewer but also more hoppy then most imperial stout I have tried before.","Phyl21ca","Jun 13, 2010"

Nose features very darkly roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, hops, and some nuttiness. The flavors are unique for a stout. On the front of the palate, the flavor is sweet with citrus hops. After, the chocolate, coffee, and nuttiness start to come through. The finish is bitter from both hops and chocolate. The body is full with average carbonation and a long finish. This beer is super smooth and well integrated. It is a little hot, showing the high alcohol. If it weren't for this heat, I would be giving it almost a perfect score.","wedgie9","May 12, 2010"

The smell is an awesome combination of rich, dark chocolate and a faint background of hops. Taste is more of the same... I've had hoppy stouts before and not been crazy about them, but Night Stalker pulls it off damn well. I think the key is the balance struck between citrus and earthy hops. Nobody does an imperial stout like Goose Island when it comes to mouthfeel, this beer just melts in my mouth like some sort of rich adult milkshake. I was a bit worried when I heard Night Stalker described as a hoppy stout, as my previous experiences with such beers have been underwhelming (I'm looking at you Storm King), but Night Stalker was phenomenal.

The flavor has big dark fruit notes upfront, reminiscent of pomegranate and plums, along with some piney and citrusy hops, chocolate, burnt bread, coffee, a little bourbon, and some alcohol.

Mildly fruity, I get a little raisin flavor. Beautiful roast character is present as well. Hop character is present with a light-moderate citrus flavor, the blend of chocolate and orange is very appealing.

It tastes like bittersweet chocolate, roasted and burnt/charred malt, coffee, caramel, citrusy hops and vanilla. Great mix betweeen the bitter and sweet flavors, this is a very tasty brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's silky and creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's very smooth and easy to drink. It should be a sipping beer, but I like it so much it's a bit hard to just sip it. Also, for an 11.7% ABV brew the alcohol isn't very noticable.

Great to have a stout with a little hop aroma on the nose. There is also a lot of roasty aromas coming from the array of malts used. Flavor is amazing, chocolaty, caramel and roasted malts hit you right away. There is a distinct vanilla quality to this beer. Its great to drink a stout that hops play such a great role in, wow.

3.88,-4.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is really nice and soft, just a bit on the light side. Drinkable, yes, but something about it doesn't shout that it's an amazing beer. The closest thing I can compare it to is Surly Darkness with the hoppiness. I did enjoy that a lot but it was also more of a stout. I'd say where Darkness is kind of like 70-30 Stout-IPA Night Stalker is more in the range of 50-50 Stout-IPA.","roadhouse","Apr 05, 2010"

It decants nicely and does well with some sitting out to let the alcohol fumes mellow and burn off some of the initial hoppiness.

Knowing Goose Island's QC issues, I can imagine process issues are perhaps not terribly uncommon (for the record, my Night Stalker was filled at a roughly appropriate level), and I imagine perhaps they can be worked out in the future without a need to alter the underlying recipe here, 'cause it truly is a good one.

It tasted like chocolate covered oranges, with grapefruit and some coffee and cream and caramel. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was one of the hoppiest imperial stouts I've ever had (along with Speedway). It had a truly great taste, almost like a black IPA. It had good body too, and hid the alcohol pretty well, so it was easy to drink. But this is a beer I prefer to sip.

Aroma is dry, burnt hoppy and roasted malt with dark fruits, bacon and boozy notes. Very distinct for a impy stout and appealing. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, moderate carbonation and a lingering finish of mild roast malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Flavor has a nice malt, chocolately base that is quickly balanced and overwhelmed by dark fruits, hoppy bitterness and again like the nose a mild bacon-y taste. Hops are citrus and very green and fresh. Alcohol is very strong throughout and limits the drinkability of this fresh and suggests (along with the hops) interesting potentials for aging.

The grassy hops over licorice and chocolate aromas are unique and IMAGINATIVE. Adequately carbonated with a light tingle from the alcohol; spikes up with an oily creamy smooth coating texture TOTALLY complements its drinkability. Full flavored, the choco-licorice, plum grassy hop BLITZ is consuming. The licorice and grassy hop flavors linger well into the after experience. The 11.7% ABV is buried...and at $10 a bumper, this one is a COSMIC drinker!! End of story...just feed me Night Stalker for the rest of my f*& life and I'll die a happy BA.

Drinkability - I only give it a 4.5 because after I had this, the bourbon county stout, the imperial brown goose, and a coffee bender I stumbled a bit on my way down the steps.

With a name like "Night Stalker" and this bad boy coming in @ almost 12% ABV, you would think this beer would be a little intimidating? Not at all! This goes down surprisingly very smooth and as I let it warm up, all the flavors came rushing out making this one a very special and complex brew. Highly recommended!

Aroma is big and rich, some strong vinous notes, dark fruit, bit of chocolate and a hint of some ashy roastiness. Taste follows with a nice dose of sweet chocolate and caramel followed by some more of the fruit flavors, ripe grapes, almost a cherry and apple like flavor mid taste, molasses in the finish and aftertaste along with a hint of smoke, some hoppy bitterness and a brush of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very nice, it is definitely big thick and chewy, and yet also smooth and creamy. The malts are heavy and you can feel the weight and strength of the beer, but it stays on the verge and does not get overly cloying or thick. Soft creamy carbonation, a bot of alcohol and hop bite in the finish along with some alcohol warmth. Overall a delicious stout imo, definitely a sipper, a very big beer, but also a very well crafted beer, a great dessert or night cap.","hoppymeal","Sep 03, 2009"

The smell was mainly a hint of coffee, some chocolate and roasted malts. It wasn't strong or anything but was pretty apparent. Taste was similar. Coffee was strong in the taste but not overpowering and not all you could taste. Chocolate was there as well. Pretty "boozey". This is one of the few beers were I can say that, though it wasn't so boozey I couldn't handle it. When it warms up a bit is when is shines. Moutfeel is good, nothing spectacular but still good. Drinkability, well I could do a few for sure but one is good enough if I'm going to be drinking all night or drinking other things. Pretty high ABV that is somewhat well hidden but pretty apparent at times. I would definitely drink this again!

4.82,18.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at east village tavern. Black, nice head. Smell is absolutely bursting with stouty aromas of espresso, chocolate, roastiness. Taste has all that, some oakiness (not sure if it's oaked so I could be just imagining it), molasses, mmm. VERY balanced. As far as stouts go, I think it's more on the bitter side (relative to the style), but if you consider it on it's own, I don't think there could be a more balanced beer. Big beautiful mouthfeel. When you finish 12 oz of a beer this size in 20 minutes and are ready for another one, you can call it drinkable. I asked the bartender if she preferred this to the BCS, which was also on tap. She said the BCS was too sweet for her, and since I hadn't tried it before, she was nice enough to give me a little taste. And I 100% agreed with her. I probably didn't have enough to understand the true nature of BCS, but from what I did try, I clearly preferred the night stalker.

4.34,6.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours black, pitch black, with a very thin brown head, almost a ring from the start, which leaves little bits of lacing. This one looks kind of normal for an imperial stout. The smell is very intense. There is a whiff of cracked roasted grains, very raw almost like unboiled wort. There's a bit of booze in here though. And a whiff of dark sweet chocolate is present - though not too powerful. But I can detect quite a lot of sweetness, with a hint of fruitiness - like a rich red wine or something. The taste starts with the overripe fruits, dark plums and grapes, a bit of raisins, followed by some dry, bitter chocolate, very, very rich with these flavors. Then the sweetness comes in, caramelly at times, but sometimes just like chocolate cake or something, washed over with coffee. And in the finish, I can taste some earth hops, and a bit of a resinous feel pulls the beer down as I swallow. This beer is just incredibly rich, almost too rich, with a strong note of booze. This one is very full, but actually not quite syrupy like I expected it to be. Sometimes, I feel like little chunks of grain are going down with the beer. This one is a sipper, most certainly. But a very good one. The pour was into an 8 or 10 oz snifter, which was just the right size to get all of this one that I'd like. I would love to have more of this, though I drank it at like 1 in the afternoon, with a big day ahead, so I stopped at one.

The aroma was hoppier than I expected, very nice in such a strong looking stout, with loads of undercurrents of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is complex to say the least, a little overwhelming. Lots of chocolate and malty sweetness, not so much flavor from the hops although maybe a hint of citrus, noticeable ethanol and a cough syrup component that I'd have preferred was avoided. The body matches the intensity of the taste, on the thicker side. The drinkability is not too high, as this is truly a sipper and at 11.7% ABV I'd limit my ingestion of this beer to 1 per night.","TurdFurgison","Jun 22, 2009"

The taste is an insanely delicious balance of dark chocolate, caramel, with roasted nut flavors, with a thick maltiness. Think of every dark, savory, deep flavor, and there's a hint of it in this beer. It feels thick and sweet in the mouth, like melted chocolate. I loved it. It was rich and fantastic.

4.68,15,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Nice hiss as I opened the cap letting me know that the cabonation held up on this one in transit. It poured an opaque onyx color with a small coat of brown head that falls to a broken film after settling. The aroma brings notes of anise backed by a mild but detectable alcohol. There is a bit of fig fruityness and some chocolate notes in there as well, but both are married well with the anise. It is a little lighter on the nose than I anticipated. The flavor on the other hand is huge. The first to hit me is a spicy anise that moves to a chocolate-covered fig on swallowing the beer. The aftertaste brings espresso and almost a hint of cherry fruityness with a detectable bitterness on the sides and back of my tongue. This one is sweet, but not cloying. The alcohol is certainly apparent in the flavor, but it does not take away from the experience; instead it enhances the flavors in the brew. As I drink more of it, I'm finding some tropical fruit flavors (pineapple and coconut) right as I swallow the beer and lingering into the aftertaste. It is a very unique combination of flavors. The mouthfeel is thick, leaving a good residual coat in my mouth after swallowing the brew. The carbonation is minimal but present and suiting this beer very well. Overall, I am thrilled to have had a chance to try this brew. It is incredibly complex and I think I like this more than after resting in barrels. Drinkability is as expected for the style.

First thing I notice on the nose is a cordial cherry feel. With a light swirl you get some coffee and tobacco tones that all blend together well. A hint of Chocolate is there also. With first sip you realize there is a ton of flavors going on in this one. Chocolate syrup, Cough medicine(in a good way), tobacco and black cherries come through at first. The oak is very woodsy in this one with no bourbon at all. There is a nice hop feel that really develops well as the beer warms and you drink. It is rustic and really beautiful the way it balances the beer and adds character. Make sure you let this beer warm up considerably as it drinks much better and shows it true colors more towards room temperature. I started with this as a 4.5 in flavor but it was so dynamic and amazing after about 10 or 15 minutes of warming up that I had to give it a 5.

4.82,18.4,4,4.5,5,5,5,"Overall all, floored, this beer needs to get out more as this almost blows the category up. Seriously one of the richest tasting and fullest beers I have ever run across, top notch.","mikesgroove","Apr 26, 2009"

4.97,22.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"The pour was nothing short of exceptional, maybe the best beer I have had in the Goose Island selection. Highly recommend it to anyone that can find it.","arcgator","Apr 13, 2009"
4.5,10.6,4,4,5,5,4,"Wow, a crazy smooth Imperial Stout stout that hides its alcohol content very well. No trace of booziness in this 11 percenter; just incredibly smooth, lush chocolate flavors with hops on display up front. The hops are more floral than piney or citrusy. The bitterness in the finish is assertive enough, but not overblown. Complex in the true sense of the word (in terms of beer), with a few different flavors mingling together that are hard to describe. I'm glad I had just a five-ounce sample of this silky smooth monster stout. Definitely something to seek out.","marcobrau","Apr 12, 2009"
4.21,3.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"D: very tasty, but the alcohol sticks out as i mentioned which makes this a little difficult to drink more than one of.","dukedevil0","Apr 11, 2009"
4.73,16.2,4.5,4,5,5,5,"D: This beer is worth murder.","klewis","Apr 05, 2009"
4.53,11.3,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Drinkability - drink it where you can find it. Although I think I prefer the BCS, this is a treat that won't disappoint.","brewdlyhooked13","Apr 03, 2009"
4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I don't like this quite as much as BCS (which I identify as the quintessential dessert beer), but it's still really terrific. Not sure about those Darkness comparisons - I just had that down the street at Risque and Darkness was much more impressive in smell and taste. Still, it's nice to see GI shaking things up and not resting on their laurels.","MasterSki","Apr 03, 2009"
4.38,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste is very nice. Some dark roasted malts, some very dark and ripe fruits, just a bit of tobacco. The hops are just behind the scenes holding everything together. This is an amazing beer. Very big and viscous in the mouthfeel. The beer coats the side of the glass after each and every sip. The alcohol is a bit more noticeable in the taste after it warms up a bit. Still an incredible sipper.","FtownThrowDown","Apr 03, 2009"
4.77,17.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"(While I loved this beer on tap, drinking a bottle supplied by BlueOkie would lead me to mark down the total score into the 4.2 range; still good, but not as enthusiastic about the bottled product.)","brentk56","Apr 02, 2009"
4.58,12.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours black with a dense and sticky brown head. This is Darkness light. Hell, I'd put this up against Darkness any day. This is a hoppy as hell imperial stout. Dank piny hops with plenty of roasty and chocolaty goodness in the nose. I'm going to punch this bitch if she blows her smoke my way again. Bam! Hops up side yo head!! Really robust roasted malt goodness. Full body with some prickly carbonation. Long dry finish. Wow. Fantastic beer.","tjthresh","Apr 01, 2009"
4.56,12,5,4,5,5,4,"Huge, complex & satisfying. Well worth the price of admission.","ironarrow42","Mar 31, 2009"
4.75,16.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Have had this on tap a few times and fresh from the bottle (bottled 2.19.2010, consumed 3.3.2010) and it has been near perfect each time. An incredible offering from Goose Island, I much prefer this to Bourbon County Stout and I'm really glad I picked up a case!","hawks10","Mar 29, 2009"
4.4,8.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I spent a good 45 minutes with this one and am very impressed with the unique hop flavors and the complexity over time.","Yetiman420","Mar 28, 2009"
4.65,14.3,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: Simply awesome and a hearty thank you to Jory Hanson for bringing this barrel up to Milwaukee.","murrayswine","Mar 18, 2009"
4.53,11.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Smooth. Dark. Pretty thick. Hopped up. Think about mixing black albert and darkness...pretty much the easiest way to explain if you have had those two.","gorby10826","Mar 10, 2009"
4.55,11.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"D: This is a wonderful beer. I often wondered what Bourbon County Stout would taste like without the barrel ageing. Well, I guess the folks at GI were reading my mind. This needs to be more available than a limited draft only release!","GbVDave","Mar 07, 2009"
