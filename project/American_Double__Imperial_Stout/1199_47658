4.76,1.7,4.5,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,"On tap, the beer is jet black and thick, with a thin, tan head. Aromas of rich cocoa nibs, coffee, vanilla, hints of maple, woody highlights, and a bourbon undertone. Flavors are rich and sweet forward, with bittersweet chocolate blending perfectly with vanilla and maple. Wow! Backbone of subtle coffee, hints of bourbon, and a building warmth. The body is smooth, creamy, and velvety smooth. There is a candy sweet aftertaste of chocolate, maple, and vanilla. It's like an awesome piece of candy. The finish is amazingly smooth, with a subtle roasted coffee and maple linger. This is an amazing beer!","GarthDanielson","Tuesday at 05:55 PM"

The nose was a bit soft but playful with light coffee, oak wood, chocolate and bourbon. The front end displayed a delicious and decadent chocolate that opened to a roasted coffee. The bourbon is subtle with some added caramel and toffee. The funny thing is that the maple is ever present, never pervasive and blends seamlessly throughout. This is so smooth and velvety that it really lives up to the hype.","KYGunner","Apr 04, 2015"

Flavor is very roasty and dense with a bunch of java, chocolate syrup, maple syrup, burnt sugar, and bourbon. Espresso and dark chocolate. The feel is very syrupy and thick. Sticky with noticeable heat and lingering barrel character. Finally got to notch this one on the bedpost. A pretty terrific beer.","VelvetExtract","Mar 22, 2015"

Altogether, this is a very different beer than Good Morning or Mornin' Delight but I honestly think these are very different beers (coffee, chocolate and aged in maple bourbon barrels vs coffee and added maple syrup) and I haven't had anything quite like this before. Worthwhile and would definitely go out of my way to drink this again.","Stevedore","Mar 01, 2015"

Aroma is only slightly hot…bourbon, maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, fairly mild sweetened coffee, nuts, and light molasses.  More vinous than the flavor and increasingly chocolaty.  Flavor is a wonderful blend of semi-sweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee and cream, and maple syrup – surpringly not too cloying.  Smooth and not too boozy at all, the syrup increasing as it warms leading into coffee beans, berries, oak, cocoa, and pipe tobacco.  Full and creamy smooth, though not insanely thick (which isn’t such a bad thing).  I took the better part of an hour to drink my glass, but it was never a struggle – just something I felt the need to savor.","wedge","Feb 13, 2015"

5,6.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Had the unbelievable luck of trying this at black rock in chicago on vacation. Pours pitch black with a small brown head. Smells of bourbon, vanilla, syrup, and chocolate. The smell is so balanced it was almost impossible to wait any longer before trying it. Spoiler: it tastes just like it smells. So smooth and balanced and this beer definitely lives up to the hype. A light alcohol burn (whisky flavored) with medium carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. Overall this beer is fantastic and greatly deserving of its legendary status. So glad I had the chance to finally chase this whale down!","Bolivian22","Jan 11, 2015"

Chocolate fudge brownie, coffee and light bourbon flavors follow. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is an ideal dessert beer. It is sweet and decadent. Alcohol, what alcohol? Despite some bourbon flavor there is nearly no heat. Overall it's a little too sweet but I'm very happy to have tried this.","brianmandell","Dec 17, 2014"

Not quite as flavorful, nor as complex, nor as smooth as Panther Cub or Founders' best product ever, Curmudgeon's Better Half, which had more of the maple present.

Yes that's right, FIS would be first. CBS is a fantastic IS, but honestly after this bottle I would not seek it out again - I truly feel that FIS is a better beer, and thank heavens, as I can get my hands on this at will. The maple here is very flavorful and interesting, and the balance and complexity here is incredible. I can't knock this beer by any means, but I won't lose any sleep knowing that it is retired.

Very warm and inviting scent that is well rounded. This beer is very smooth. The slight maple flavor combines well with the vanilla, oak, and light bourbon flavors. The body is well made and slightly thinner than a bourbon county. It is very much a full and richly flavored beer. Some said that the beer has not gained anything with age. I have no base to compare it to. I would say this beer is currently drinking very well but the maple is not acutely strong. You may want to set up a bottle share and get on this one.","PHBoiler","Sep 26, 2013"

We all agreed this ale was delicious from start to finish. Popping the cap, you take in the coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, and bourbon aromas. While pouring, you notice the deep, dark color with a head to match. I wish I would've opened this one a little earlier; however, Founders still came through. Some of the flavors weren't as strong, yet still very bold. As many have said, this is a great beer and I'd definitely recommend this one!","vgarneth","Aug 04, 2013"

Many people talk about the maple flavor really falling off after a couple of months, and I think that was the case here. It was so much funkier than I imagined— I got a lot of the oak of the barrel, as well as sort of anise and licorice flavors. As it warmed up, it got much more interesting— too cold out of the tap, it was hops, booze, and tobacco in one big slam. I keep thinking about how distinctive it was, but I am not sure that means I loved it. Basically like reading the Iliad.","tipfortap","May 23, 2013"

Pours from the 750 ml thick, black and viscous. A one finger brown creamy head forms at the top and lingers for a good while. Big bourbon vanilla aroma that mellows into bittersweet chocolate and then earthy spicy coffee. Taste is big up front chocolate syrup and slight bourbon followed by maple (did not fade in this bottle as others have said), and ending with spicy coffee beans. Earthy mocha lingering on the palate with the maple sweetness. These flavors blend together so seamlessly. Mouthfeel is thick thick thick with lowish carbonation. The bourbon is there but doesn't take over and the coffee ite keeps this from being too sweet. I was worried about being disappointed with this but I am not.

Like the '12 KBS the coffee seemed to have faded a little bit and there was a little bit more bitterness to the chocolate then I was expecting which was similar to how the '12 KBS compared to the '13 KBS. Overall like the '13 KBS I think I might have enjoyed this a little bit more when it first came out. That being said it was still delicious and well worth seeking out.","jaasen64","Apr 26, 2013"

CBS pours black with a finger of head that quickly drops down. The aroma is very sweet, with big bourbon notes shining through a dark fruit and roasted malt base. On the tongue, a smooth maltiness, vanilla, and dark fruit comes through first, then a bit of anise, chocolate, and the faintest hint of coffee on the middle that transitions gloriously to the thing that I can tell gives CBS it's reputation. That awesome, fantastic lingering maple and bourbon aftertaste. The mouthfeel is actually a little lighter than I would have expected. Overall - CBS wasn't my absolute favorite big stout - but I can forgive it, it's a little bit old at this point. It's still very delicious and worthy of the hype.","shand","Apr 12, 2013"

If it's even sweeter with more syrup character, I might like it even more. The bourbon dominates here, but that extra maple dimension adds to the complexity nicely. Well done.","PsilohsaiBiN","Jan 26, 2013"

Huge complex woody nose. Tons of roasty coffee and maple up front along with plenty of dark chocolate and hints of bourbon, vanilla, and caramel. The taste is just as big and is also dominated by the sweet maple syrup, roasty coffee, and bourbon. Also getting hints of licorice, bitter chocolate, vanilla, molasses, caramel, and toffee. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a subtle creaminess and a touch of booziness on the finish. Overall, this is just a tad bit too sweet for my taste. And it fell a little short of all the hype.

I'm intrigued...the taste is a punch of distinct maple with a bit of licorice, chocolate, and roasty malts. I don't get the coffee as much as in a bottle of FBS. The mouthfeel is rich and flavorful, fudgy and slightly bitter, with a lingering roastiness. This is one of the most distinctly flavorful stouts I've had, but it doesn't pop with flavors as I'd expected. It's definitely a unique experience, but I'm not sure it's worth the tremendous hype trying to get a bottle unless it's re-released and consumed fresh.","ThePorterSorter","Jan 07, 2013"

I would rather tuned up chocolate. Lots of true coffee, even the taste of creme (though I understand no real creme used). Very filling, the maple syrup seems added in. Above average mouthfeel,, though not as thick as one could imagine. Thanks to Mike at Champane's for putting this one aside for me.","Sammy","Dec 29, 2012"

Unfortunatly only a 5oz. sample, Pours jet black with a fluffy brown head. Smell is largely like the Breakfast Stout or KBS, with dark malts, brown sugar, and coffee, with just a hint of maple. The maple really comes on more on the finish, balancing out the roasted malt and coffee for a memorable Beer.

The flavor was also heavy on the coffee, just like the regular Breakfast Stout. Complimenting this was a smooth vanilla-maple sweetness, oat creaminess, and oak woodyness. The bourbon, coffee, and chocolate are so bold, that the maple really adds some nice depth and contrast. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and had light carbonation.

One of the main reasons is that it is just so seamlessly integrated- no one flavor dominates, each element of the taste is smell seamlessly flows into the next and plays well together. The pour is black, with a thin head and lacing. Nothing special there, but nice enough. The aroma, however is lovely. Nuanced notes of vanilla, Bourbon, chocolate, and a finish of Maple syrup. Each aroma is noticeable, but it makes a whole greater than a sum of its parts. Sweet, yes, but also complex. The taste is equally enchanting. What strikes me most again, is that each flavor is layered with the others to make a delicious whole. This time, it starts off with a bourbon and maple hit, with the bourbon flavor growing and sharpening into the long finish. The last note you experience is a nice chocolate note that picks up where the bourbon leaves off. Silky smooth, this beer just disappears, only the complex flavors make you linger to contemplate. An exemplary beer.","Georgiabeer","Jul 15, 2012"

There is some residual lacing throughout the entire time I was drinking this beer. I drank it in a blind taste with KBS and I was surprised by the amount of head compared to the bottle of KBS. Very nice aromas and the sweetness from the maple syrup shines through. I can’t taste the maple syrup but it is definitely sweeter than KBS. I was pleased with the amount of carbonation of this beer and overall it was very good.","bvdubn","Jun 21, 2012"

What I didn't expect was how smooth the taste was. I have had Founders KBS before and the bourbon taste/smell was very overwhelming...in a good way though. This tasted more like chocolate than anything else. I would highly recommend this stout to chocolate beer lovers and those who love their high quality stouts.

The pour is an opaque jet black with a small light brown head that cuts to a ringlet but sticks and laces a bit. The aroma is bold coffee followed by a touch of bourbon/alcohol, wood from the barrel, and a distinct sweetness... but I can’t say I’m getting tons of maple syrup. The difference between this and KBS for aroma seems to be that the bold woody vanilla aspect is replaced by sweetness. The flavor again packs a bold coffee punch at first, followed by loads of milk chocolate, a bit of ash, char, woodiness, and bourbon. The secondary flavors develop into chocolate milk, sweet maple syrup on pancakes, and lingering coffee and bourbon. Compared to KBS on flavor, there’s less of a bourbon punch as well as less of a roasted, bitter coffee punch. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel as always. All in all - pretty good shit!

Nice big roasty coffee presence, chocolate, malts, oatmeal, and a very nice bourbon presence all wonderfully balanced by the sweet maple syrup flavor coming from the additional aging.

Bottom line: it’s not world-class, at least at this point. Has the maple dropped off that much? I still think it’s a very solid brew, but lacking the special qualities that inspired people to give up so much for it.","Phelps","Mar 11, 2012"

I pick up little to no barrel aromas. Taste is sweet with tons of coffee chocolate and caramel malts with again faint maple and some earthy spicy hops trying to cut through the sweetness. Thick body with a sweet creamy silky smooth mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This is a great beer, but the maple seems very subtle.

The smell is BIG on coffee and oak, hints of bourbon and chocolate, don't get too much maple that I expected. Tastes just like it smells, but with a bit more of the oak and bourbon characters. This is a big beer for sure. Very similar to KBS in my opinion. There is a slight hint of the maple sweetness at the end of the taste, the alcohol is very well hidden (drank this bottle to myself.) Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, just as expected. Perfect carbonation for the beer. Overall, I wish I had this on tap first, so I could have done a comparison of the two. Either way, this is a HUGE beer and if you're able to land a bottle, crack it open and enjoy.

Vanilla and oak with just a bit of bourbon. A little anise as well. A fantastic nose on this beer! Taste is somewhat of a letdown however. Don't get me wrong, it's a very tasty beer, just had my hopes set higher. Initially sweet chocolate and coffee. Then I get bitter chocolate with some maple syrup and light vanilla. The maple syrup is more noticeable as the beer warms. Finishes slightly bitter with some black licorice. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a syrupy finish. This is a big beer with ABV well-hidden. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, I'm so glad I got to try this. I was just a little let down, as it was not as good as KBS IMO.","DovaliHops","Jan 09, 2012"

Pours a very dark brown close to black with a small darkish tan head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The is big coffee, some dark chocolate, some vanilla and a bit of bourbon, oak, and some light alcohol. Quite awesome. The initial taste is sweet with dark chocolate, then comes a lot of coffee. A decent amount of oak as well as a bit of vanilla and some bourbon. The maple is there as well, but not overpowering. The finish has a decent coffee bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Great beer. A substantial improvement over KBS. The coffee is quite strong, and the maple sweetness is not overpowering, which I was slightly worried about.","jethrodium","Dec 13, 2011"

4.12,-12,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall: The final verdict? I was incredibly excited (and fortunate) to get to try two highly-sought after stouts this year: Darklord 2011 (thanks Alewatcher!) and CBS. After hawking three stores in town, I got 3 bottles: one for my wife and I, and one each for my father and father-in-law for Christmas. The grand total? About $50. And a whole lot of time. So, the question is, was it worth it? While I was horribly disappointed by Dark Lord (hey, that just means I don't have to drive to IN this spring or...well...ever) this is honestly quite good. Nice sweetness, fairly restrained booze, wonderful aromas, and interesting profile overall. Was it enjoyable? Abso-floggin-lutely. Is it an A+ beer in my mind? No. The flavors, while awesome, don't show the incredible depth/definition of the very best. Would we buy it again for $16.00? Well, that depends. If it was a fairly readily-available yearly release, we'd probably pick up a bottle every year or so. Would I go to the ends of the earth for one or trade my cellar away for it? Probably not. None of this ought to take away from this beer. Founders did a great job, but when a beer is hyped as much as this one is, it's almost impossible to live up to the hype.","BedetheVenerable","Dec 12, 2011"

I smell a good coffee flavor, boozy smell that I would contribute to the bourbon barrel, and very disappointingly a very faint maple. The coffee flavor is good not great, and the bourbon flavor is good but the maple flavor is very muted almost like the coffee over powers the maple flavor. The mouth feel is good its slick and slightly oily. I had this beer a year ago at the brewery and it was the most fantastic beer I ever had, this isnt that beer. I don't know if they changed the recipe or something but I was very let down by this in a bottle.

4.65,-0.6,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Canadian Breakfast Stout pours pitch black. The foam, which is past caramel and halfway to milk chocolate in color, billows up to about four fingers in height. The lacing left around the glass is gorgeous, sheetlike for the most part. Head retention is very good, but just a bit short of perfection. Coffee is the first thing that that jumps out about the nose (which is heavenly), although rich milk chocolate and maple aromas are also present. Everything is so well integrated that it takes a while to pull apart all the different components. The flavor, and I wasn't sure it was possible, is even better. Creamy milk chocolate and a splash of maple syrup swirl together at the front end of each sip. A mild bourbon note that gives a slight warming sensation fills the mid palate, before a strong coffee flavor comes in to close things out. The carbonation is spot on, nice and low. Meanwhile, the body, while being both silky and creamy, could stand to be a bit more full/sturdy. Any qualms I have with Canadian Breakfast Stout are minor, as this is truly one of the top few stouts being brewed in this country. I got up at an obscenely early hour to hunt down bottles of this, and I'd do it all again without hesitation.","axeman9182","Dec 06, 2011"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee grounds, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and maple syrup. Taste is of dark roasted malt, maple syrup, coffee beans, dark chocolate syrup, and a bit of alcohol. There is a nice roasty/cocoa bitterness on the finish that lingers on the tongue and a slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional beer that completely lives up to its hype.

Head is very creamy, aromas of maple and coffee creep up out of the glass nestled in cocoa and a bourbon heat. Flavor is spot on, although this beer doesnt really shine until it has warmed up completely to room temp, I would't even refridgerate this badboy. The maple is slightly subdued and the coffee roast and chocolate take the forefront. Finishes with a slight bourbon bite, but it is mellowed with the slight sweetness of the maple that just barely pokes it's head out. Overall, this is a sexy beer. I think that a lot of this b.s. about maple fading will be proven wrong with this beer. I predict the coffee mellowing first and allowing the maple and chocolate sweetness to shine. Only time will tell.","Tripphop","Nov 15, 2011"

4.4,-6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"O: Well, this beer is really really good. The maple tones are subdued with initial tastes, and then initiate their subtle bellicose intents to compel my idle hands to guzzle. Good shit, I expected it to be sweeter, and was pleasantly surprised. I am grateful to have been able to try this one. I would love to have again, and wouldn't pass up an opportunity. A perfect dessert for this accompaniment would be a hot fudge sundae with peanut brittle bits mixed into a rich, high quality vanilla bean ice cream...After which I would probably be sick to my stomach from such a degree of extravagance.","harrymel","Nov 12, 2011"

Aroma is immediately of maple and chocolate. Taste is of sweet maple, brownie batter and some oaky-vanilla.As it warms the coffee flavor shines through. What I like is it doesn't taste like the burnt coffee flavor I got from the FBS. For as thick and syrupy these flavors sound this beer has such a nice light drinkability... even though its flavors coat the mouth and linger quite long. This beer is amazing but the availability of it drives me crazy. I wish I could get it a little easier... but that might take away from the experience. Overall this is a perfect stout and I would change nothing about it. (except its availability).","stabzmcgee","Nov 12, 2011"

The beer poured out as a very dark black color, nice and thick oily looking body with a brown colored head on top. The head lasts for a little bit and fades in time. The smell of the beer is sweet and lightly roasted with some maple, chocolate and coffee aromas. The first sip is sensational, I couldn't believe how great this tasted. The blend of maple and coffee was fantastic. Such an interesting flavor it's hard to explain. The mouthfeel of this brew is creamy, thick and rich. Overall this beer is great. There isn't many other ways to explain how good this is. Makes me wish I could have gotten more. So glad that I got to try this beer finally.","Knapp85","Nov 06, 2011"
4.58,-2.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, I wasn't sure what to expect with the maple-bourbon barrel aging. This is a very heavy and thick beer with alot of sweetness. The combination of the maple and bourbon flavors seems to turn into a sort of caramel flavor. All the flavors you expect from Breakfast stout come through with the addition of the bourbon and maple syrup flavors. This is an exceptional beer, not only very interesting but very well done for the style. Incredibly smooth with lots of different flavors. I was very fortunate to get my hands on this one.","adman08","Nov 06, 2011"

4.3,-8.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall – What to think…I felt this was just too sweet. It is a solid imperial stout, no question. However, it just didn’t really do much for me to be perfectly honest. Obviously this is quite subjective and everyone’s experience will vary, though I just couldn’t get past the sweetness. I like a bit more char/roasted character throughout. To be honest, I would take KBS or FBS over this if I were enjoying a stout. However, if I were to share this as an after dinner beer I would choose this over the aforementioned beers. I suppose it boils down to my not liking overly sweet stouts. Would still love to try it again and as stated, for what it is, it is fantastic.

It lives up to all the hype it gets and it is truly a special thing. Hands down my favorite stout and easily top 5 beers of all time. It might be a long while till I have this beer again, exclusively because of the price and availability of it. I was lucky enough to enjoy it on tap at a bar 2 blocks from where I live, many people search and search for this beer. The price is to say the least very high I’m unsure about how much people are paying for a pint of it (I think its quite high), but at Crunchy’s it was $8 for 6oz, and only one per customer. Anyways I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys trying good beer (this is just not a beer I would start someone unfamiliar with good beer out on, I feel they would feel disappointed about paying so much). I wish I had the money and resources to find and have this beer multiple time every winter, I keep picturing myself sipping a sniffer of this while seating in a leather recliner chair beside a toasty fire watching the wintering weather outside.","minterro","Nov 03, 2011"

I don't think it would fare that well at a blind tasting. Unique as well with the maple/bourbon barrel. It could also benefit from a better aroma. Would I seek this one out again? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I go to a special release for it? Most likely. Would I follow distribution trucks/vans around Indiana to buy it from every store?

Smells like coffee and burnt sugar, syrup, light bourbon. Taste is great, much better than I remember it being on draft. Sweet, balanced coffee bitterness, thick sugary syrup flavor, a hint of bourbon and oak, bitter chocolate, finishes sweet. Body is a bit lighter then I would like but still thick, light carbonation.

Huge dark coffee tamed by a nice underlying maple sweetness. Those flavors mend amazingly with the mild bourbon. An occasional boozy flavor pops up, but then is quickly quashed by the maple coffee flavor. This is undoubtedly one of the best tasting beers I have ever had. Intense, but reasonable. The mouthfeel is big and velvety with a nice light carbonation. Overall, this is easily one of the best 10 beers I have ever had. Impressively drinkable and flavorful.

5,6.8,5,5,5,5,5,"On tap at Mike’s Bar and Grill during Cleveland Beer Week. Huge thanks to Founders for bringing some kegs of this this week. Just awesome. I have been searching for the perfect beer for years. I found it last night. The guy next to me said he had this last week in a bottle and tonight was his first time on tap. He said it was clearly better on tap. I have only had this once. On tap. Last night. So this review is based on what I enjoyed last evening. Pours pitch black with a slight tan ring around the edges. Looks like what I would expect. I put the glass up to my nose and whiff. Whoa. Layers of aromas. First I noticed a stickly sweet maple, then a touch of coffee, roast, and wood made a noticeable note here as well. I smelled this a few times because I was surprised by the complexity just in the aroma. I took a sip. My first thought was "Holy Fuck". An explosion of flavor hit me. Upfront their was a strong sense of coffee, followed very closely by a touch of maple sweetness, then a touch of dark roast from the grain bill and a slight note of vanilla with some booze notes that was not at all hot. The booze flavors were hid well by the way this was barrel aged and melded perfectly in the finished product. There really was no booze as there was just a note of it and it made for a perfectly rounded beer. The finish combined all of the above ever so slightly. There was no cloying sweetness. Nothing over the top. Everything in this beer was perfectly represented from start to finish. I honestly never thought I would give a perfect score to any beer. Until now. This one for me goes beyond the hype and was worth every sip.","fiver29","Oct 21, 2011"

4.46,-4.7,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"A truly excellent beer, but I have to say that I prefer KBS a bit more. KBS is less sweet, less bitter, with more bourbon, and it's more balanced with just as much flavor as CBS.","aficionado","Oct 11, 2011"

5,6.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Criticism: My only criticism is that this one may be trying to do too much at the same time, and it may be too sweet for some barrel-aged elitists. Some will definitely find the KBS and the BS to be better than CBS because it (one) does not try to do as much "flavor packing" as CBS does and (two) the maple syrup adds sugar in a way that may perhaps prevent it from being a palate destroyer like KBS or a bit too overly rich juxtaposed to the BS. The maple syrup may perhaps be overkill for many. But CBS is an extreme beer. CBS in an extreme beer for those who enjoy extreme tastes. Is CBS the best beer in the world or even in the US? It might be. But, to absolutely make it the "king of beers" is to take the mystique out of craft beer and buy into the BMC marketing bull**** that a brewery like Founders refuses to buy into.","paxchristi","Oct 11, 2011"

Subtlety (as far as barrel-aged stouts are concerned) is what sets this one apart for me. Bourbon and coffee are definitely much more mild in this beer than KBS. The maple is a nice touch but not as strong as other reviewers seem to indicate.

I could drink 124 of them, though I would probably die, but it would be well worth it because it is better than anything.

4.97,6.2,4.5,5,5,5,5,"750 ml bottle. Served in a DFH snifter, the brew pours dark brown/black with about an inch light brown head. The head stays around a little while, and there's a good amount of lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is wonderful, it smells like chocolate, coffee, maple, roasted and charred/burnt malt, vanilla and bourbon. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the chocolate, coffee, maple and roasted/burnt malt flavors starting out the strongest, and the bourbon/vanilla flavors getting stronger as the beer warms up more. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, creamy and coating, with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's very easy and enjoyable to drink.

The adjectives that immediately come to mind are ones of high praise, from decadent, to gourmet, to incredibly rich. While FBS and KBS tend to be somewhat bitter, this beer is actually quite sweet, so that's probably the major difference between this one and its predecessors (besides the maple), which is worth noting.

It pours with a glistening thickness that immediately sticks to the side of the glass, smelling of fresh coffee that's been bludgeoned with mocha and maple. Absolutely delicious. The taste brings all that's right about KBS with a sweet blanket of additional smoothness brought on by the maple. The flavor is simultaneously restrained and bold, mild and audacious. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of excellent stouts like Bourbon County Rare, slick and oily with only a bit of a carbonation and alcohol tingle (but I don't mean that in the creepy undercarbonated way - this beer tastes fresh and well [correctly] carbonated).

Pours a deep black with virtually no head save for a few bubbles of creamy brown. A slight stickiness allowed CBS to gently coat the sides of the glass with a mild yellowish film. The aroma wafts up easily and little effort is required to discern the moderate bourbon notes. Inhaling a bit more brings forth a hint of something sweeter lingering in wait; possibly the maple syrup or wood. Initial taste jumps forward with dark roasty malts covered in a bourbon shell with a mildly sweet maple syrup finish. The aroma while drinking brings the coffee into subtle play. Subsequent tastes confirm that the alcohol is noticeable, but not overtly present. There are thicker stouts, but the extra weight here would feel out of place. Instead an exceptional balance of the flavors, alcohol warmth, and trailing finish ensure that this beer can be sipped slowly for a long while.","darienm","Oct 02, 2011"

The maple really cuts the bourbon and the beer benefits from it; though, I did not think the maple came through as strongly as some had told me it would. There was a definite sweetness and it had a maple character to it but the flavors were perfectly balanced. The beer's ingredients live in harmony. No fighting for first position. Very similar to KBS but a notch above. Booze is hidden. Had two and a half glasses. Could have easily drunk more but was driving an hour. Well done Founders.","Bowman2001","Oct 02, 2011"

4.97,6.2,4.5,5,5,5,5,"From notes 8/5/11. RB Review #1000! Huge thanks to beddachedda. Brewery-filled 12 oz bottle. This beer is so damn good and one of the best stouts that I’ve tried. The maple flavor is absolutely wonderful and blends into the chocolatey stout perfectly. I tried the Founders imperial stout lineup together, and CBS was head and shoulders better than the rest, though I’ve never been a KBS fan, to be honest. The pour is black and thick. It has an awesome dark brown head, not quite Hunahpu dark but close. The aroma is a perfectly meshed combination of barrel and stout flavors. Chocolate and maple are the strongest notes, but coffee, roast, vanilla, bourbon and oak all play significant roles. The taste is pretty much perfectly sweet to complement the stout’s flavors. I had to stop myself from drinking my entire glass in one go. It’s a great beer to sip with its big, round mouthfeel and wonderfully complex interplay of flavors, but it was so delicious that I had to force myself to slow down. The syrup flavor fits with the beer even better than I could have hoped (and to be honest, my hopes weren’t set all that high). It has all of the best flavors of rich, dark maple syrup.

The wood aroma was noticeable too. The taste was malty and delicious, with noticeable sweet coffee. There was some bitterness in the middle with a tiny amount of smokiness. The aftertaste was very smooth with the main flavours being sweetness and the whiskey.

This big coffee aroma, bourbon, and dark roasted malts from the underlying beer is still dominant, but the reason it's world class is the maple syrup sweetness. The Breakfast Stout is still easy to pick out with the heavily toasted dark malts and freshly ground coffee. But the maple syrup and bourbon takes over midway through the taste and leaves a lingering sweetness after each sip. The mouthfeel is as smooth as any beer I've ever tasted in this particular FBS category with soft but noticeable carbonation. It's not full bodied, but close.

Aroma is dark chocolate, burnt malt, and toasty oak with a substantial maple component and a very subtle coffee note. The taste is much smoother than the regular FBS, which is the base beer for CBS. Like the aroma, the taste is led by dark chocolate and deeply toasted malt with considerable toasty oak barrel and moderately sweet maple syrup flavors. The flavors are very well integrated and smooth with a lingering bourbon heat and a much diminished coffee component from FBS. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate-to-low carbonation and a mild lingering alcohol warming. The drinkability is fairly high for the abv. The moderate sweetness balances out the toasty and bitter malt and coffee notes very well, and the complexity is great. Overall, this is a great beer that definitely lives up to the hype.

Taste is ultra-complex, coffee, some bittersweet chocolate, toffee more than molasses or caramel, with some vanilla from the barrel but I didn't pick up any maple aromas, noble hops. Taste mirrors the nose, with a dry finish due to the oatmeal. The barrel aging certainly tamed the ABV which wasn't very noticeable, decent but not overwhelming effervescence, slight bit of stickiness. Despite relatively high ABV quite drinkable.

Very sweet nose, with caramel and maple syrup coming to mind, but also many of the essences similar to KBS...chocolate, oak, hazelnut, and cherry-vanilla. The taste was just a tremendously balanced mix of the aforementioned, tilted toward the sweet end of the spectrum, with a maple/caramel/chocolate sweet finish.

It had a heavy creamy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this beer blew me away. This might be one of the better Imperial Stouts I've had to date. I loved how the mouthfeel on this one was both heavy and creamy at the same time making is scarely drinkable. This brew had an awesomely well balanced flavor and nice aroma to boot.

Not at all cloying considering the dominant flavors being bourbon and maple syrup.

What's more interesting is that I could distinctly make out each of these components. Clearly. My 'strils haven't been this happily busy in a long time. And my tongue was not left out of the action. For fear of being overly redundant, everything I listed above came back, in some form or another, in the taste. In addition to a bit more bourbon, some burnt biscuits and heavy dark chocolate notes join in on the fun, while the maple syrup doesn't appear quite as strong as before.

The syrupy sweetness never becomes cloying, however, making this beer surprisingly quaffable despite its big, complex body. The mouthfeel helps the drinkability, too, as Canadian is light on the tongue (heavy in the stomach) and almost fluffy with carbonation.

Very rich taste, too: maple syrup, slight twinge of alcohol, sweet but oaky, with a slight bitterness in the finish. The maple syrup sweetness grows as the beer warmed up a bit, and to my taste it became a little unbalanced. It's smooth as all get-out. This is a super drinkable and amazingly delicious beer.

A chocolaty fragrance with a touch of whiskey a wood and coffee scents follow. A rich chocolaty flavor, with coffee overtones, then the sweet woodsy flavor of whiskey that comes through at the halfway point across the palate; a maple syrup sweetness blends itself into the flavor that gradually grows to at the soft flavor of a grassy bitterness. A thick oily texture, that begins with a heavy water feel that grows in weight. A mild burn of alcohol on the throat, but it does not last long. This is an easy to drink stout you have no idea that this beer is ten percent.

You can really smell the sweetness upfront, the maple syrup really enhances that, and it blends and mellows well with the bourbon smell, the charred, roasty, toasty, oak and dark malt combinations, also bringing out a bit of vanilla, and the coffee is in there too, almost getting lost in the incredible mix of smells. A really great smelling beer. The taste, to but it briefly is incredible. This is one of those beers that you hear so much about, you just can't believe that it's true, I actually wanted to like this less than I did. It starts out creamy and chocolatey, the sweetness, combined with the roasty flavors, make it like drinking a coffee and chocolate milkshake, but it's not cloyingly sweet - which may be in part thanks to the oaky-bourbony taste. The syrup isn't necessarily easily picked out, but this is definitely reminiscent of syrup, even so much to make me crave pancakes as a start to dig into it. The vanilla of the barrel really comes out in the taste as well, and I still can't say enough about the rich creaminess, jsut balanced perfectly with the dark roastiness. I mean, it's possibly one of the smoothest (I know that word is a bit lame, thanks the AB) beers I've ever tasted. Just perfect mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, to let you know it's there, but not slow you down any. The drinkability is great, though it's a heavy hitter. I mean, I could barely stop drinking to take notes, but the ABV caught up with me by the end, making the last few sips a little slow, but I really, really loved this beer.","taylorhamrick","Mar 12, 2010"

There are so many wonderful sweet and desert-like flavors swimming around in this stout, the alcohol might be consumed among them.

Taste is shockingly good. Especially when tasted alongside KBS and FBS. The other bottles actually cowered and ran off in the Canadian's presence. We've got maple syrup, serious sweetness including vanilla and chocolate perfectly balanced w/roast and some slight bourbon/oaky character.

Milk chocolate, mocha, bitter coffee, maple, oak, lots going on here. Mouthfeel is thick, lush, creamy, warming and comforting. All I can say about the drinkability is that I watched my buddy put away his 12 oz pour like it was a pale ale. Its really high. I could drink this all night but there are too many other beers on the tap list I want to try. Absolutely amazing beer, my only gripe is I wonder how different it really is from KBS.

I was told by the owner at EBF that the barrels it aged in were former bourbon barrels soaked in maple syrup. The taste is incredible. It has multiple layers of complexity. The rich chocolate and oatmeal flavors along with a stiff, bitter coffee character, followed up with bourbon and maple syrup flavors. Damn, this is an incredible beer; because of the different tastes involved it's open for folks who don't normally care for dark beers. The mouthfeel is near perfect.

Mouthfeel is very nice, thick, chewy, low carbonation, not overly boozy, very silky smooth. Flavors are similar to KBS but a little sweeter from the maple and a little more mellowed out. All the same notes from the aroma and the finish lingers forever.

Body is a dirty rusty blackish brown that really looks like used motor oil thickness. Nose is still very coffee dominant with only hints of vanilla and bourbon. Maple is only in the background like fresh pancakes with a bit of syrup on top. Oh so sweet and smooth as you take first sip. Bourbon isn't as evident as KBS as a vanilla character comes into play and almost a creme brulee coffee sweetness is developed. Wonderful desert like sweetness is soft yet rich and bold while it paints a very thick coating feel on the tongue. Wonderfully drinkable brew that is nectar with it's tasty sweetness.","SPLITGRIN","Aug 03, 2009"

5,6.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured out of a growler courtesy of Jcb890. I wish there was a procedure to replace my blood with this beer. It is epic. Pours as any stout should. Jet black color with a dark tan head. Head retention is good as a thin layer of foam remains throughout the glass. Vanilla, coffee, caramel and a sweet maple aroma dominate the nose. The taste is incredible. Very complex beer that gets better as you get deeper into the glass. Starts off with vanilla/caramel sweetness. The coffee notes come through in the middle, followed by a bit of booziness. The maple comes through at the finish, although it's mixed with a nice roasted character. This is one of the smoothest beers I've had the pleasure of drinking. Almost a creamy quality to it. After taking a sip it seems like it coats the tongue. Despite being a stronger ABV it is surprisingly drinkable. All said and done, this is probably the best beer I've had to date. If you ever have a chance to try this, please do it, even if you have to drive to Africa.","reginaldo","Jul 26, 2009"

Stout black appearance with a small and tight dark brown head. Malty nose of coffee beans, chocolate, with a hint of whiskey. This beer is so well rounded. I'm pleasantly surprised that it's not too sweet - just a nice melding of strong flavors. A bit of vanilla and oak accent a deep rich and roasty malt base with a nice subtle presence of maple and a hearty smack of whiskey flavor. Deep leather flavors and almost smoky. Soft velvet on the palate - just uber smooth and soft. So delicious. Hard not to take giant gulps of this, as it's highy quaffable despite the booze. I might like this better than the Kentucky. A real treat for sure.","twelvsies","Jul 22, 2009"

The bartender was pretty awesome and knowledgeable and told me this one was tasty and she even compared it to the Kentucky Breaksfast Stout for me since this was my first time having it :) The appearance was pitch black with a nice big tan head. The head pretty quickly went down to almost nothing within a few minutes. Despite this happening it still left some, not much, but some lacing down the sides of the glass. Looks very good. I didn't get to much out of the aroma but from what was there it was some coffee and some chocolate as well as some roasted malts. Could have been just me but all the smell was pretty faint and not there but for what was there it was good, like I said was probably just me. The taste, oh my god! Pretty much incredible. Lot's of chocolate in the taste which I wasn't expecting but it was quite the pleasant surprise. There was also some coffee present and some roasted malt. I could also pick up on the bourbon/whiskey flavors and the oak, very nice. The taste was incredible. I've only had the regular Breakfast Stout which was extremely great but this one was amazing! Pretty thick mouthfeel which was just perfect. Drinkability was high especially considering the high ABV and the alcohol was hidden so well. I went in knowing they had this on tap only to have one and ended up drinking three it was so delicious. By far one of the best beers I've ever had.

Aromas were weak, but pleasurable - coffee, vanilla, and bourbon mainly. Mouth-feel was incredible! Thick and syrupy with balanced carbonation providing excellent coverage of the palate. tastes were complex and delicious as well - sweet like fresh honey with notes of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, molasses. The maple was slightly present, but not as bold as I anticipated, which actually aided this beer to be more subtle and smooth in comparison to KBS.

Rich chocolate & bitter coffee elements from the stout, soft maple traces, and buttery vanilla from the barrel. ABV was well hidden, and I had no problem finishing the 10+/- ounces that were combined in one cup.

4.77,1.9,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"D: Absolutely sublime. Much better than the standard Breakfast Stout, and I dare say also significantly better than KBS. Hands down, this is the best-tasting beer I've had to date.","Thorpe429","Mar 22, 2009"
4.25,-9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"D: Zero drinkability, but definitely an experience. The maple sweetness backs up on the pallet where you have to drink a water in between. Full flavor.","DrewOSU","Mar 15, 2009"
5,6.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Drinkability is crazy, it gets more drinkable to more you have. They wouldn't let me get a growler of it, but that didn't stop me from drinking a growler's worth of it.","paco1029384756","Mar 15, 2009"
4.59,-1.9,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had this on tap on KBS Day. Appears like their other Breakfast stouts, pitch black, although not much head and very little lacing. Smell was awesome, lots of rich coffee, whiskey, chocolate, and a bit of sweetness in the background from the maple syrup. Taste was also great, lots of coffee and a nice touch of alcohol to it. The maple syrup gives it a sweeter side compared to regular Breakfast Stout. Mouthfeel was thick and smooth, almost chewy. Drinkability was good, I had to fight to not take a huge swig of it, although the high alcohol content makes it a little too much to have a lot.","kbeals","Mar 15, 2009"

4.55,-2.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Malt flavor and coffe punch on the finish. Major aroma down to the very last ounce.","Yetiman420","Mar 14, 2009"
4.65,-0.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,4,"This is tasty as hell. The maple adds a whole other layer of complexity. Adds a bit of resudual sugars that go nearly perfectly with the coffee and chocolate of the original. Thick in body and creamy as well. Possibly the most complex beer I've had to date. Absolutely delicious. Some dried dark fruits coming through as well. The finish is forever.","mcallister","Mar 14, 2009"
4.89,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,5,"This stout was creamy in the mouth, bitter in the finish and sweet maple syurup in the beginning. The beer had lots of dry coffeee flavor and some maple chocolate sweetness. The color was coffee black.The head was spare, I tried it mixed 3/4 canadian to 1/4 cherise cherry ale, and it was like a chocolate covered cherry. The guys at founders take alot of pride in their product and the beertenders are well versed in their profession.","smibroncos","Mar 06, 2009"
4.37,-6.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This is a fantastic beer, I think it may be slightly better than the original since the maple balances out the acrid character of original breakfast stout.","alovesupreme","Mar 04, 2009"
4.1,-12.4,5,5,4.5,4,2,"I don't think I've had a more delicious coffee beer in my life. This beer pours unholy black with a thicky tan creamy head. Aroma is basically of the most delicious coffee you could possibly imagine. Completely irresistable. Tastes follows the aroma up with pure coffee and roasted/chocolate malt. The flavor is so good but almost so intense that it turns you off. As good and as pure as this beer is, it's almost like tasting the most delicious coffee grounds in the world. You know it's the best coffee in the world, but it's still so strong that it makes you choke a bit. A mixed blessing.","wiseguy142","Feb 28, 2009"
4.6,-1.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"On tap at Founders. A nice dark black color pour with a light brown foamy head.Aroma is nice sweet maple,brown sugar,coffee and a hint of alcohol,smoke,and grain. Flavor is huge roasted coffee molasses,vanilla and maple syrup,with a hint of smoke, a nice alcohol flavor/bite at the end,and the maple sweetness stays on your lips after the sip. Thick body,soft carbonation, a little sweet and thick to be called sessionable but wow what a good beer,you swear that you are going to taste or smell bacon next but never quite do. Very Very good.","WakeandBake","Feb 07, 2009"
4.55,-2.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This version is really enjoyable and maintains the majority of the characteristics of the regular BS. However, the maple syrup cuts down on some of the more bitter elements and replaces with a smooth sweetness from the maple influences. Mouthfeel is a little bit smoother and mellower than the regular version. Overall, just as enjoyable and really enjoyable version of the regular great beer.","CRJMellor","Feb 01, 2009"
