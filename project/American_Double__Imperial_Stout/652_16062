As stated above it’s very similar to Goose Island BCBS, but like it’s younger brother that may not have the bad ass reputation but is better looking; this brew is not as strong as BCBS and has more oaky and earthy/peat moss notes, but it’s an outstanding imperial stout in its own right and one I will seek out as well as highly recommend.","CHickman","Feb 19, 2015"

The aroma is Bourbon with some coffee, vanilla, caramel, cocoa, and espresso. The taste is bourbon, cocoa, coffee and earth. Lots of woody bourbon flavor. Earthy notes. Finished with some more Bourbon and alcohol warmth. I'm surprised that the ABV isn't higher. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style. Pretty drinkable. Overall, really good Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout I'd grab again.","PicoPapa","Jan 13, 2015"

I think they need to bump up the ABV, maybe that will help balance the beer with the bourbon, but not bad at all, would definitely purchase, seems a little raw compared to other BA imperial stouts, but really good, definitely worth a try and I would put this in top 10 of my own personal BA stouts.","Catracho5","Jan 07, 2015"

Smell is awesome - bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, a little fruitiness.  Taste is great as well - bourbon is not overwhelming and the vanilla really shines with some nice malty and chocolate undertones.  Very little hop flavor or bitterness.  A little on the thin side vs other similar stouts, carbonation is good.  Overall,a very balanced bourbon barrel stout that seems to be ready now - will be great to see how it ages.","BobJude","Dec 05, 2014"

The bourbon is done well, but the 1 year in the cellar really is helping to calm this bad boy down and soften the heat.  If you spot this it is a must have - drink a couple if you can't resist but you have to put some down for at least a year.  I have had a bottle with 4 or 5 years on it a couple of months back and for me at least, some of the oxidized notes were too much - my guess is somewhere in the 1-3 year mark is perfect.","pagriley","Oct 30, 2014"

On the nose is a strong smell of fresh oak, bourbon, and caramel. Very sweet taste. Almost like eating a caramel from a nice candy shop. I like the taste, but like the smell more. Also tastes of vanilla, some bourbon, but not really that much alcohol. I love CW’s barrel aged beers. No one does it better, and this one does not disappoint.","kkleu357","Sep 03, 2014"

Chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon flavor mid-palate-once again thinner mouthfeel; it was kinda like chocolate soda with a shot of bourbon thrown in. Ok, let' wait 15 minutes and let it warm.

4.6,8.2,4,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Pour leaves a thick tan head with an immediate aroma of chocolate coming through. After settling down the aroma of chocolate remains, and the bourbon comes through underneath. Taste is on par with some of the heavy hitters in this category including BCBS and Brunch weasel. Not as sweet as BCBS, and not as much coffee as brunch weasel, in all honesty more well balanced than both. Chocolate and bourbon are prominent with tobacco, molasses, vanilla, plum, cherry, and a touch of coffee. Feels slick and syrupy, and allows the taste to linger on the tongue for a delightful amount of time. One of the best of this style I've had.","Phigg1102","0"

4.15,-2.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Bottle from Homer321 in trade as an extra! Big thanks. 2013 bottle poured to a FW Barrelworks Teku. Pours dark brown to black with a half finger of creamy khaki head. Aroma of graham cracker, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coconut maybe, caramel cream. Flavor is sweet caramel, chocolate, sweet anise, bourbon booze, vanilla finish. Mmm. Body is medium, maybe on the thin for the style but doesn't take away much from the nice flavors, with medium carbonation.","BMMillsy","May 21, 2014"

The bourbon barrels used readily impart their woodsy, vanilla, and caramel-esque flavors to the nose and tongue, but the dark roasted malt base beneath maintains an integrity of form that is quite impressive. Neither shooting to be "big" in the mouth nor trying to appear too sophisticated/elite, this beer nonetheless manages to do both at the same time.

This beer was dark, but not dark enough. The light passed through it too easily, something I would expect from a standard stout, not an imperial. The smell was just ok. Faint bourbon, no vanilla, no malt or indentifying nuances that stood out. I'm a fan of bourbon stouts, this beer lacked substancially in comparison. The base beer stands out in no way to me. It's awfully thin and watery. The bourbon barely helps. I like my beers to be big and heavy on the bourbon. This one just didn't do it for me. I appreciate the trader who got this to me.

I came back with various BCBS as well, and I will fully admit that those are better, but Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Stout is a very close competitor, while being a totally different beer. Sometimes you want a massive, booze-laden behemoth, and sometimes you want something that isn't so big, but still packs the full flavor. This is that beer. With something like BCBS I feel like I have to set aside an evening to drink one. With this, I can just break one out any time.","krustster","0"

3.88,-8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I received this in a trade, I've never heard of the brewery before. Overall I think it's a really good beer. Last week I did a taste test of KBS vs. BNS vs. BCBS vs. Great Lakes Barrel Aged Blackout Stout. This one falls around where the Great Lakes was in that test (BNS was the winner IMHO). It's a really good beer. Is it in the same league as the others, not quite. all the components are there but it seems a little disjointed. At the time I'm writing this I've let the beer warm up quite a bit. At this point the ETOH has come out much more in the flavor and aroma but so have the Stout flavors of Chocolate and Coffee. When it's cold the Vanilla dominates the aroma and flavor but has blended nicely at around 55 degrees. Bourbon flavors and aromas are still the most prevalent but the Stout underneath is starting to come through. It's a very good beer, worth trying if you've never had it.","ausch30","Sep 05, 2013"

I'm looking forward to seeing how my other bottles continue to develop as it's still drinking hot after nearly a year. Overall, a great BA Stout that seems to fly under the radar.","Treyliff","Aug 27, 2013"

There is a pleasant "milk duds" aroma, but I found the alcohol burn harsh on the palate even with 8 months of age. The subdued nuance of a good kentucky bourbon is lacking.

A bit boozier and heavier on the bourbon flavors th an the nose suggests, but the barrel character remains complex and is nicely integrated into the base beer. Some dry, charred oak followed by a strong sweet and spicy bourbon presence that's followed by a smooth vanilla bean flavor before the roasted and sweet malt notes come in. Not as sweet or dessert like as the nose hinted at but there's still some subtle silky chocolate flavor countering the intense roast. The rost compliments the dry oak and spicy spirit with hints of dark chocolate, burnt toast, oatmeal and espresso bean. Slightly hot with some warmth in the finish but after the palate adjusts, the high ABV is relatively well masked. Definitely a sipper but the complexity and intense flavors make it a very enjoyable drink.","corby112","Mar 10, 2013"

Scent is is bourbon up front with some nice chocolatey notes. Pretty heavy caramel malt aroma with some very subtle oak. As the beer warms up.. a little bit of chocolate cocoa comes through with just a hint of coffee. Taste is sweet bourbon at first. Lovely notes of vanilla and toffee. Somewhat of an interesting soda-like flavor...can't tell if I like this aspect or not. Nice chocolate flavors with just a hint of black licorice. Mouthfeel could use a little more body. Drinkability is pretty high, as the ABV is WELL-hidden. Overall, I wouldn't consider this among the top bourbon barrel stouts out there (Parabola, BCBS, KBS, etc), but it's pretty damn tasty. Needs more body though.","DovaliHops","Feb 16, 2013"

The result is a richer bourbon presence and more flavors imparted from the barrel. I always felt previous years tasted too strongly of cheap barrels. What still remains an issue is that the base beer isn't a very sturdy stout to begin with, so the result of barrel aging seems to take an already thin base and thin it out even further. It's not a mess, or Kate Moss thin - damn did I date myself there - but it's just doesn't quite stand up to the better beers in the field.

The same strong dark chocolate base beer note is here, and vanilla is again what comes through most from the barrel aging. Layers of toasted brown sugar and wood follow, before transitioning into a beautiful marshmallow finish. The body is sturdy, but not overbearing, and the carbonation is just a touch too lively. The end result is a mouthfeel that's just off from greatness. Between the Bourbon Barrel Barleywine and this beer, I've got to say that Central Waters is putting out some of the best barrel aged beers in the country.","axeman9182","Nov 21, 2012"

The tight bubbles leave elegant lacing down the inside of my glass and there is no observable sediment. The nose hits you hard with intense notes of boozy bourbon, coconut, vanilla, and milk chocolate sweetness. The taste is grainy, sweet, and boozy with a lingering bourbon caramel. Its body is a rich and sweet airing on the side of heavy medium, but lacks the smoothness that would take this beer to the next level. The alcohol is relatively well hidden within the beer's intense sweetness, but manages to cut through after each sip. Overall, this was a great extra and an exceptional bourbon stout, but there are better options available.","ThePorterSorter","Aug 15, 2012"

There was a decent amount of bourbon presence, but not as much as in the BA Blackout stout. I thought this was very similar to the BA Blackout stout. The appearance wasn't as nice, but the bourbon presence was a little bit toned down which made the beer a little bit easier to drink, both mouthfeels were very similar- the Central Waters was a little bit less carbonated. Overall I'd recommend trying the Central Waters BB Stout if you are into BB beers, worth seeking out to try however I'm not sure if I'd drink this all the time.","jaasen64","Jul 29, 2012"

Mild bourbon comes in and lingers with some caramel and chocolate long after each sip. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel.

The base beer picked up some nice bourbon tones, not to heavy but enough to taste the spirit. I don't really pick up any alcohol.

Some residual spots of lacing are revealed after each tilt of the glass. Nose expresses dark malts, bourbon notes, artificial sweetener and lactose. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of dark chocolate and a slight char at the finish. There are also some whiskey notes that come out at the back as the brew warms.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, caramel, and toffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, sweet alcohol, toffee, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. The toffee aspect in this one really made the beer for me. It coupled really nicely with the hints of the barrel that were present and actually made them stand out more.

This beer is extremely well rounded. The mouthfeel has a perfect amount of carbonation for the style, and drinks extremely smooth with a slight amount of dry bitterness on the backend.

It's thin, and the carbonation spritzes a bit much at times, yet, it still feels somewhat "heavy." I think that's just the booziness though. The bourbon is still a little hot on this one. Sweet vanilla, wood, cinnamon. There is some creamy milk chocolate on the back end, but I have to wade through the strong bourbon to get to it. I definitely could have sat on this one a bit longer, as I'm sure the bourbon would have faded some allowing this to become more of a balanced stout. But, I'm glad I tried it.

This is slightly unfortunate, really, because after tasting how well Central Waters does with their big-ABV'd Bourbon Barrel Barley Wine, I had high hopes for this stout. It does improve as it warms, however, and the supporting cast of roasted malts and chocolate is tasty.

A second whiff adds a slight chocolate sweetness that causes salivation. From the get-go, you can tell that you are in for a heavy beer. This is where the BBS throws you for a loop. A solid bourbon taste along with a chocolate backbone show you that this beer is not heavy, but kicks out some big beer flavors. A sweet and warm chest feel.

Strange that the barrels o'erwhelm all else. The taste delivers the expected roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate...then another strong tsunami of bourbon-soaked wood. Still pretty good, though. The body is a strong medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly chewy feel. Overall, another disappointment, but nowhere near as deep as the BBBW.

The raisins, dark fruit and milk chocolate really came out in the smell. It also had notes of clove and spicy tobacco. I'm used to the stronger punch-you-in-the-face bourbon barrel beers. This had a nice combination of coffee and bourbon with port in the background. Pleasant amount of ABV not just a wallop.

There is a light roast and chocolate. Vanilla and light nutty sweetness. Taste is much of the same. Not a huge roast character to this brew, especially up front. Some good malt balance along with the bourbon. Caramel and chocolate, small dose of coffee becoming more pronounced toward the finish. Big vanilla while bourbon flavor isn't overwhelming. Some dark fruits. Light sour dryness in the mouth along with an otherwise more full feel. Seems like something you'd find in a wine or wild ale. Of course it's on lesser volume but it's still present. Overall, quite drinkable. A unique brew that I'm happy to have tried.

Head has nice retention and leaves a solid crown as it fades. Nose is absolutely delicious with strong tones of vanilla bourbon, coconut, leather and carmalized malts. Sweet bourbon and vanilla notes greet the tongue first quickly followed by a sour and tart bite that twings on the back of the tongue. This turns to a lenghty bitter feel that lasts long on the taste buds. Warms the belly well and has a bit of a bourbon bite twords the end of the palate.

Big chocolate, toffee, vanilla, oaky aroma, some hazelnut and bourbon, reminds me of a chocolate bar. A bit of roasted grain is in the background. Lots of caramel sweetness in the flavour, bitterness was present but not strong, plenty of oak and bourbon character. Vanilla and chocolate filled out the middle, along with nuts and a light fruitiness. Finished with lingering alcohol warmth and a flash of drying roasted barley. Faint tartness as it warmed.

Bourbon taste is strong, but smooth; noticeable, but in no way overpowering. Perfectly blend of flavors. Carbonation is a little higher than medium but does a good job holding this one together. Mouthfeel is medium, with a dry, roasty, bourbon-y, and vanilla finish.

And although the bourbon element is pretty nice, the overall beer isn't as rich as you'd expect from a double stout. There's a mellower, chocolatey, maybe Russian imperial stout taste, while the aroma is of wood and whiskey. Also reminds me a bit of Magic Hat's Chaotic Chemistry in that the whiskey dominates.","tempest","Apr 15, 2007"
4.23,-0.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This is an older bottle (as pictured above) from a trade with nflmvp last summer (many thanks, Steve). Poured into a 17-ounce snifter, it sits a glossy dark chocolate brown, bordering on black, with a sticky, fluffy desert-khaki head. Bourbon aromas are prevalent, along with milk chocolate, roasted filberts, vanilla extract, and dried cherries. But that bourbon scent is powerful and more prominent than any other aspect of the bouquet. Good chocolate sweetness up front that yields immediately to a strong bourbon flavor. This is followed by a pleasant woody pucker, a coffee-ish char note, and a final vanilla sweetness. Quite a ride, and the complexity is endearing for sure. It's a bit boozy at first, but this aspect melds well, becoming more integrated with each sip. Body is medium, with a smooth, but no-frills mouthfeel. No coating thickness or syrupy consistency. Not exactly silky, but smooth enough. Drying with the barrel-induced tannins so prominent. A fine bourbon stout, and a must-try for fans of the style. I just received another bottle today from flyingbison, and I'm glad to have another sample for the future.","orfeu","Apr 13, 2007"

This is more like a barrel aged dubbel. If it was a dubbel it wouldnt be half bad. Other than being water thin, it has an overbearing sour grape flavor going on. Didnt get much bourbon out of it. Plenty of oakiness coming through. I hope this was a bad bottle, because this is nothing that I would seek again. I was expecting a lot more out of this. Instead this will go down as one of the worse beers Ive ever had.","FtownThrowDown","Apr 06, 2007"

Some sweet and sour sauce, with a light bourbon cascade, over gentle roasted coffee and oak. Coffee is more pleasent and carries the roasted flavors, but this is pretty weak.

Rich, deep chocolate and coffee along with deep roasted malts and a lingering finish of dryness of damp wood, expresso and bourbon. Well hidden alcohol. Quite the treat. Thanks Ernest.","Crosling","Aug 16, 2004"

4.5,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4" of medium brown head over the opaque dark, dark brown brew. Head retention is good, laces well. Aroma is of coffee and chocolate malts, with an undercurrent of bourbon, as advertised. Taste is pretty evenly split between coffee and chocolate, making for a nicely balance flavor, dark malt-wise. Some alcohol notes ala the bourbon sneak in at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability is are high, would want to drink this all day for the flavor and feel, even if my head would rue the day in the morning...","ppoitras","Jul 21, 2004"

4.42,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Shared with Feloniousmonk received from cokes - Solid deep, dark brown body, black in most light. Small fluffy light brown head sits briefly which resides slowly to a hazy skim and thickly placed strings of lacing. Aroma is beastly large! Oh, how I love these bourbon barrel lovely aged brews. Damn nice whisky aromamtic nose to be found in this glass. Great oaky twinge. Ahhh and behind each wiff sits some terrific notes of soft and dry bakers chocolate. Taste is full of chocolate laced bourbon, nice little burn and edge of bourbon oak barrel singe of heat and sweetness. Feel is well heated and bourbony, good round body thats just beyond medium. Good warmth within and has a bit of spice to finish off the residuals.One fine drinkin' little Bourbon Barrel Stout, a brew to be taken in slowly, but hard to do when its so smooth. Good stuff!","tavernjef","May 28, 2004"
4.1,-3.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Further observations: I've had a good deal of this recently, and I've concluded that some bottles are "bourbonated" much stronger than others. It's a predominant factor regardless, and the stronger spirited ones leave a definite impression, though the weaker ones seem to unfold with more roast, dark chocolate, buttered nuts, and espresso, with the whiskey laging behind until the finish. In some ways, that's a plus....and in other ways it is not. The above review is from one of the most heavily bourboned one's I've sampled. Numbers pretty much stay the same regardless.","cokes","Beers"
4.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Silky smooth in the mouth, carbonation is dead on. Floats around, spreading extra goodness all over. It's one hell of a stout, flavor is everywhere and I'd like to be able to enjoy this more often.","Skidz","0"
