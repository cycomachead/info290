3.61,-12.6,4,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Overall: As i seek out highly rated beers, and stouts especially since its one of my favorite style, this offering falls short for me. I find this a bit far from an A beer. Its heavy on the odd dark fruit/sweet, wine-like tannin notes and light on roasted malts/coffee/chocolate. Furthermore, the mouthfeel lacks that thick, chewy body that makes you savor every sip. I wouldnt recommend this stout as there are countless better ones on the market, nor am i going to seek this out again. I find this beer overrated to say the least","Bone53","Mar 23, 2015"

3.41,-17.4,4,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Pours nice enough. Black with a small head that sticks. I agree with other reviews I've seen on this one, the alcohol comes through strong in this one, as if it were barrel aged. Not a bad thing per se, but not something I was expecting from a regular imperial stout. I get lots of deep roast and caramel but any other complexities are blanketed by the alcohol. Does go down smooth and lingers on the tongue. I'm not sure what to think of this one, not my favorite in the style but not terrible by any means. Eh.","anon","Mar 07, 2015"

Not sure the "Great Bear" applies, and of course "Good Bear" is way less impressive. I'd do it again, but....","seedyone","Nov 07, 2014"

My nose is not so discerning, but I detect malt, hops, and a bit of fruit in the aroma. The flavor starts out very bold--hops, coffee, figs, some malt, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to thick. Overall this is an iutstanding stout. I think this one has even more character and complexity than Sierra Nevada Stout, which I really like.","Dsimenson","Oct 05, 2013"

Deep roasted coffee-like flavor full of roasted malt, burnt caramel and some hops. All in all incredibly balanced in terms of flavor. All the flavors really blend together very nicely in this imperial stout and make it quite drinkable. The 8.1 abv is hidden quite well. Goes down smooth, thick mouthfeel with just a bit of some alcohol and hop bitterness. Fairly light carbonation. Overall: an absolutely delicious big beer.","CA_brewster","Aug 14, 2013"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, toffee, molasses, dark bread, floral, light pine, raisin, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, dark bread, floral, light pine, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, light raisin, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt flavors with light fruitiness; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. All around nice balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the gravity.

For better or for worse, this drinks like a 5% single stout...except that it's really 8.1%. Since Bear Republic doesn't call it an imperial stout, I'm grading it as a single. Ergo, I'm willing to overlook some of its flaws and appreciate it as a decently priced (for a bomber) everyday drinker.","ThisWangsChung","May 05, 2013"

Factor in the very reasonable pricing and year round availability however and the Big Bear Black Stout is pretty hard to beat.","Nugganooch","Apr 23, 2013"

A hint of chocolate and coffee in the aftertaste, but mostly sticks to its burnt ashy characteristics. A big beer that isn't zealously brewed to acheive astronomic abv levels, yet packs the complexity and feel of some of the biggest double stouts. Had this pretty warm, probably mid to high 50's.

4.45,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours black into a pint glass with a small head. Looks good. Smell is mainly coffee, caramel, roasted malt. Taste is quite good, you can taste the alcohol creep in as you drink it, and it gives it a bit of a smokey bourbon type taste as it warms. This helps bitter out the sweet taste that starts each sip. Well balanced taste. Mouthfeel wise, it's smooth, a bit acidic, but smooth and creamy. This has a good bit underlying it. Overall I rank this quite high, but I could see it having a tab bit less alcohol to give it a little less bite. I feel like it becomes more noticeable as you drink it. Very, very good overall though.","ely2000k","Nov 16, 2011"

The sourness has a sweetnes to it that goes well in balancing other flavors of dark roasted malts that sit in as the backbone while those other flavors go to work in making this a very unique stout. The caramel malts through and through become the main character of this beer. They offer a sweetness that outshines other, traditionally simpler stout flavors. Those dark roasted malts give this beer a perfect background on which to other tastes can play around on your palate. Such a unique beer is nothing less than I'd expect from a good brewery. The three others I've had from Bear Republic (Hop Rod Rye being my favorite) have all been stellar. This is no exception, so buy if you see it. Decent price for the bomber as well.","chodinheaven","Oct 10, 2011"

Aromas of roasted malts, booze, vanilla, some dark chocolate and sweet coffee. There's a lot going on here. Taste is more of the roasted malts, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. Has a surprising amount of alcohol taste for a beer that is 8.1%. A hint of vanilla towards the end. Pretty heavy beer with a small amount of carbonation.

This works really nicely with the dark chocolate and cocoa that are present. Mildly bitter with a grainy, mildly dusty cocoa character, the balance of flavors here is rather stellar. A mild coffee liqueur character rounds out the palate. The finish, however, is mildly dull, here. This is where the dulling effect of age and oxidation is most noticeable, with a touch of a papery feel. Mild bitterness, mild cocoa and moderate fruit are also present.

4.68,13.3,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"I poured a dense finger of deep-tan head with good retention on this humid late afternoon in early June. They got the species right in that this Bear was Black! I have written in ink that was less black than this beer. It disallowed light penetration in the same way that a black hole sucks up light. If I ever found myself inside this beer, I would be utterly lost. The nose smelled of this morning's coffee, commingled with piney hops. Now, if you think that I am kidding about the roasty coffee aroma, please note that I am a retired US Navy sailor and I take my coffee like I once took my women - hot and black! You have to spoon my coffee out of the pot because it is so thick that it won't pour. I once spilled some over the side and the Coast Guard thought it was another Exxon Valdez. You get the idea. Mouthfeel was medium, but not as full as might have expected from this bear. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate on the tongue initially, but slowly, out of the darkness came the piney hops and just a tad bit of caramel sweetness as advertised. Shit, the f**kin' thing's mauling me, just as they warned me about! More of that confounded truth in advertising. Now, it's sinking its teeth into me! OMFG, I just wanted to drink a bear, I mean, beer, not die. Finish was smoky, chocolaty, roasty and I was finished. Warming, the finish took on a fudge-like aspect, both in terms of taste and mouthfeel. Dang, this was real good and I think they still have some over at my local. Definitely worth revisiting, especially if I bring a rifle and re-read Faulkner's "The Bear" ahead of time.

On the nose the big note is bitter chocolate, but there is also dry espresso and dry roasted malt. In the mouth the bittersweet chocolate is foremost, but there is also a good deal of toasted malt and oats. The toasted flavors are a bit too much for my liking, but others might like it. The feel is medium full and fuzzy, leaving the roast and the bitter chocolate on the tongue for a long finish. I like this beer well enough but to me the taste would be much better if it were balanced like the nose: bittersweet chocolate being further ahead of the toasted malt, which got to be too much for me.","EricCioe","Apr 07, 2011"

3.36,-18.6,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Big Bear Black Stout pours stout black. The light tan colored head tops out at three fingers in height, while subsequently displaying average retention and solid lacing. The nose is a bit muted. It's heavy on roasted grain, rather than a coffee or chocolate aroma. The flavor is a little bit more vibrant, but suffers from the same issue of bluntness. It's more general roast than any specific dark malty flavor. There's just a bit of anise in the background as well. The body is solid, if just a bit light for the style (which I suppose should be expected, given the relatively low ABV for an imperial sout). The carbonation though is a bit overdone, and mutes what should be a malt forward beer. Big Bear Black Stout is a decent beer, but there are many top tier imperial stouts out there that would command my money before this one.","axeman9182","Feb 23, 2011"

Taste brings the heavy roast flavors of coffee, cocoa and grain, hints of char and smoke, but the taste is completely smooth. nice smooth carmel and dark dried fruit on the back end. Fuller side of medium bodied, smooth, not sticky and no linger flavors, slightly dry. A very nice RIS that doesnt go overboard like many extreme beers in the style.","rfgetz","Jul 12, 2010"
4.22,2.2,4,4.5,4,5,4,"Poured from the bottle into my snifter. Great black appearance with a slight tan head that dissipated quickly to a nice crown. Wonderful aroma of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. Bitterness is slightly present in taste with chocolate and coffee primary flavors. Great feel with ample carbonation that tickles. Really a good stout and very enjoyable taste and a great feel.","jacobseyb","Jul 09, 2010"

4.35,5.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,3,4.5,"This is a wonderful stout. Black as night, fluffy tan head, lots of lacing. Smells of slight hops, roasted malts, hints of bitter chocolate and coffee. Taste is similar with a bit of hops with a deep roasted malt backbone, coffee, and chocolate. The only real complaint I have with this beer is that it is just too thin... I don't buy that this is an RIS...if this was just an American Stout, the thinner body would be suitable, but it's just not on an Imperial Stout. Regardless though, this is an amazing beer and should not be missed. It's great and very affordable considering the size and style of the beer.","EgadBananas","Jun 05, 2010"

The aroma is an overwhelming amount of sweet malt with hints of caramel and toffee with a smaller amount of hops present in the nose. The taste isn't as syrupy sweet as I would have thought with a hefty amount of hop bitterness present, especially in the aftertaste. Well balanced and very easy to drink if a little thick. A great taste with very little hint of the large amount of alcohol present.","degerbah","May 20, 2010"

Roasted malts are right at the front of the nose, some hop presence is noticeable behind, with a sweet fruity aroma as well.

3.93,-4.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This pours practically black, with a nice dark brown head on it! The initial smell is that of lightly smoked chocolate! A very interesting nose on this one. As you sip this beer you primarily taste the smoked chocolate and coffee with a nice barley finish. The mouth feel is a little more carbonated then i would prefer...but that is probably because all the stouts I have been drinking have been years past vintages or barrel aged brews. Over all this is a great beer to finish off the evening with. Pick up a bottle if you see one or order a pint if possible! Give this one a solid 4.5 as well!","pastradul","Apr 14, 2010"

3.96,-4.1,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours, big, black, and bearish. Enormous beige head rests up top. The head here takes a while to calm down. Stays great-looking the whole time, you barely see the top of the beer the entire time. Leaves crazy thick lacing. Smell is a bit weak (gets a bit stronger once the head shrinks a bit), chocolate, caramel and a bit of dark fruit. Also a strange smell that resembles old leather? This stout isn't quite as "hefty" as I remember. Definitely much easier to drink and watery than your average RIS. Subdued tastes of roastiness and light chocolate sweetness combined with some hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit too watery for me and the tastes don't really stand out except for the amount of hops which is unusual in a stout. The highlight here is drinkability, one of the easiest-drinking RIS's I've had, good taste, no alcohol taste whatsoever and good price.","Chico1985","Mar 20, 2010"

Medium to thin(for a stout) mouthfeel. Crisp and carbonated, another opposite of great stouts.

The finish turns just a touch bitter, very well done. I wish the mouthfeel were just a touch thicker, but the medium carbonation is spot on, IMO.

I wish I had of spent a couple more dollars and tried something else. Even in its price range this doesn't compare to other RISs such as Storm King and Old Rasputin, which blow this away. I rarely say this, but I do not recommend this RIS unless you are trying to branch out into the style and do not want something too overpowering.","thegodfather2701","Aug 28, 2009"

Nice balance of bready and roasted malt notes. Flavor began with a nice roasted malt and included notes of coffee and caramel. This sweetness was nicely balanced by some hop bitterness in the finish, which was not overpowering and did not linger. Body was medium to full with medium carbonation and very smooth. Overall, while this beer did not seem to have anything unique about it, it is solid with a wonderfully balanced flavor and nice mouthfeel. A nice representation of the style, which I will definitely have again.","slk22","Aug 25, 2009"

I read one BA's observation that Black Bear was best served at room temperature, I will try that. Feel was rich, creamy and satisfying, full bodied.

4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured from the bottle to a pint glass. Pours black with dark red highlights if held up to the light. With the pour comes a nice big light tan head. The head quickly retracts to about a one finger head that is nice and rocky and frothy and leaves great lacing down the glass. The smell is what I was expecting as it's an Imperial Stout, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. The chocolate stands out the most to me in the smell. Despite the chocolate being upfront in the smell the coffee dominates the taste. The chocolate is still there and the roasted flavor is pretty apparent. Theres also a bit of a nut taste in there. Pretty good stuff. Mouthfeel is kind of thin and creamy, not bad but I was hoping for something a bit thicker, still not bad. Drinkabilty is good. Not to high of an ABV but not something I would drink all night, still easily drinkable. Overall a good stout for a cheap price. I think I paid under $4 for a bomber so not bad. I'll pick it up again.","dismal","Jul 27, 2009"
4.57,10.7,3.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Drinkability: As other reviews have stated, the 8.1% ABV is deceiving. The light mouthfeel combined with the incredible sweetness do wonders to mask the high ABV. The slight scent isn't close to enough to be off-putting, and the other properties of the beer more than make up the difference. This is definitely an RIS that will become a winter (and sometimes summer if it is cool enough) staple in this house for years to come.","COBeerBuff","Jul 20, 2009"

Aromas are roasted malts and coffee, with some dark chocolate hints. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and coats the palate well. Tastes are similar to aromas - very roasted and robust - bittersweet chocolate, black coffee, and molasses. Also some mild ripened dark fruity esters, but nothing overwhelming. Alcohol is completely concealed. It's somewhat sweet, but finishes nicely balanced with the roasted malts providing some bitterness with the hops. Overall, solid recommendation for the style. It's nothing outrageous, but very satisfying.","barnzy78","Jul 06, 2009"

Chocolate, coffee, berries, molasses, vanilla, lots of roasted malt, obviously, and a vague hint of the 8.1% ABV. All are present on the tongue along with a bitter finish. A very light and delicate mouthfeel for such a big beer. This is a very well made stout. I only knocked half a point off the drinkability because of the ABV - I'll always do that for relatively high-alcohol beers, no matter how good they might be, because they're not for knocking back all evening.","omnigrits","Jun 18, 2009"

3.23,-21.8,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Pours thick black, like a typical American Stout. A bit of lacing, nothing to write home about. Not much on the nose either, more hops than anything. A bit of dark malt. Taste... well, this tastes more to me like a dark IPA than a RIS. The hops prevail here. Not deep, dry rich hops, but pretty bitter kind of wet hops. Not too impressive to me. The dark malt tastes a back sweet, and the roastiness and sweetness takes a back seat. When drinking this I figured it to be a standard American Stout. It lacks the gravitas it needs to be a big rich RIS. It is nice and creamy though, so mouthfeel is good. Drinkability suffers because of the bitterness. Overall, next time I will pass on this one.","damienblack","Jun 07, 2009"
3.26,-21.1,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Flavors and basic appeal is also somewhat restrained. The body and flavors are not complex and are light simple malt/stone fruit but not very big and not very assertive and certainly not real complex. This is a basic "ok" drink. It was a treat to try the 2006 in 2009 but not something I'd go out of my way for again. All in all a bit thin in all respects.

Creamy, silky, 8% is completely hidden.

No way. My biggest beef with it is the color/opacity. It's a really deep and dark amber. And not opaque. I mean, with "Black Stout" in the name I'm waiting for something that's really black. No chance. I hold my glass up to the light and I see color through it. Besides, the beer is dark reddish brown. Not black. Low head. Big IPA nose. Big old ale taste - tons of smoother, sweeter dark malts. Caramel. Hints of chocolate and coffee (but only hints). Alas, with a thin and watery mouthfeel. More like a normal stout, I suppose.

I don't care for *fresh* Old Rasputin or Yeti, and I find that this is very similar. Nice, super dark body with beige coloured head. Nice lacing. Mouthfeel is heavy, almost oily, as it should be.

The aroma is very clean, the main scent is of malts and light hops, perhaps a hint of coffee. The flavor is very bold, a lot more hops up front than you typically find in a russian imperial, but a welcome flavor for sure. Continuing the glass you get everything from chocolate to currant and a bitter sweetness. The mouthfeel is a little on the bitter side, but this is probably the only negative thing I can say.

As one would expect from the name, pure black in color with only the smallest suggestion of orange around the outside. The nose is actually somewhat lowkey, doesn't force the coffee bean, carob, toffee on you and leaves sufficient room in your nostrils for things to move about, delivers green grape, red cherry fruit scents, whatever orange citrus might be there mostly drowned out, overall clean over complex. Medium-bodied, same demeanor in the mouth, presents suave coffee, dark chocolate, toffee and licorice nuances without any bitter or toasted archness. Allowing for this, the hops do create an erect gait and contribute to a dry mouth feel. Less fruit here and more dried fig or golden raisin. Can't find fault with the carbonation level. Tapers off at the end, not greatly, yet enough to get you reaching prematurely for a replenishing next sip.

Then it blends itself to a mild grassy bitterness, that grows to a earthy bitterness at the end.

4.15,0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"After numerous times saying that I was going to pick up this brew I finally decided to, pretty dumb of me waiting this long I suppose. Well this brew poured to a pitch-black color with a good sized dark tan head that had very good retention and left a ton of thick lacing at the top of the glass and then rings down the side. The aroma is very inviting with its very dark roasted/ astringently burnt malt that also gives strong impressions of chocolate, coffee and berry like fruit. Also lurking is a slight alcohol aroma that you knew would be there with this brew weighing in at 8.1. The flavor is nice, the astringent malt comes out quickly but that breaks down to a nice mixture of chocolate, caramel and a slight sweet berry flavor. As it warms more of a coffee/espresso flavor comes out mixed with a clearer alcohol warmth. Has a dry finish that adds a little bit to the astringency. This is a good brew, can't have many of these in one sitting as you will get in trouble quickly but a nice sipper, especially as the flavors do change a bit as it warms. I should not have passed this brew up and will try some other offerings from this brewery in the near future.","Stimack","Jan 12, 2009"

Taste is of some nice dark fruit up front with a highly enjoyable subtle hop presence throughout. Finish is quite chocolaty with a slight spicy kick @ the end. Nice roastiness from the malts on the linger as well. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a very nice amount of carbonation (not too much!). This beer has a mouth-coating finish that is cut nicely by a good amount of crispness and a touch of spice. Finally, despite its relatively high ABV, this beer is quite drinkable. It goes down smooth and its spicy crispness prevents it from feeling too heavy. The alcohol is certainly present but NOT overwhelmingly so. An excellent buy which I will surely be buying again in the future. Overall a truly remarkable stout.","Graham5161986","Jan 03, 2009"

4.36,5.6,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"1/29/10: 1-2 year old bottle with no bottling date purchased about 10 months ago from Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA). Poured into a Duvel tulip. Exceptional appearance -- completely opaque black, amber-ruby edges, and a healthy 2-finger beige head with staunch lacing. Aroma is way less hoppy than fresh with more chocolate malty tones and a cola-like aroma. Flavor is surprisingly malty considering how hoppy the fresh version is. WOnderful strong dark sweeter malt presence with milk chocolate and light roasted coffee bean. Hops are minimal and mainly provide a subtle leafy, bitter tobacco counterpoint to the sweet, chocolatey maltiness. The finish has a slightly stronger coffee flavor with a bit of char that carries to the aftertaste and hits on a bit of anise/licorice. The feel is still a little lighter than most imperial stouts, but I think it has increased in heft a little -- or maybe decreased in carbonation. A wonderful beer with about a year on it, and definitely a unique, hoppy stout fresh. A great value at $4.49 a bomber. I wonder how well it will hold up at 2 years, but at that price, there's definitely no harm in finding out. Stellar brew both fresh and with a year or two on it.","argock","Dec 25, 2008"

Maybe the "Imperial" designation gives me pause simply because the beer hides its alcohol so well. This beer -- even if it's not as flashy as stouts from breweries like Southern Tier and Stone -- is extremely pleasant and drinkable, and I wish I could get it in six packs. As it stands, carbon-footprint-related considerations might prevent me from buying it when I'm not visiting people out West, as other Eastern breweries, like Victory with their Storm King, also do the sub-Imperial Stout pretty well.

4.45,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Ok, I buy the style characterization. But the beer does hinge on the gavity of an American Stout. Very drinkable and enjoyable for either because the beer emphasizes the intensity of flavor over gravity or feel. This beer is cramed pack full of strong cocoa flavors that will rival Rogues Mocha Porter. Balance that with a strong coffee (nearly espresso) flavor notes that also complement the sharp, American hops that do resemble the younger American Stout. Fresh and intense describe the flavors well. The body is full for a standard American Stout, but not chewy or dense enought for a RIS. I don't seem to care, where it drops off in thickness, it makes up for with drinkability. Still I keep comming back to that intense cocoa / coffee / nutty / toasty blend that makes this beer work for me. Another hats off to Bear Republic for another world class beer. By the way, this beer could win beauty contests with it's appearance that I just didn't describe very well.","BEERchitect","Jun 12, 2008"

Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, but not syrupy. It coats your tongue and delivers a heavy chocolate flavor that lingers there and warms up the mouth. This thing is a fabulous dessert. I don't know if I'd call it an all out imperial stout, but if it were categorized by BJCP standards, it's probably my favorite American stout. The hops are restrained, it's not overly sweet and the flavors are all balanced perfectly. It's not an extreme beer, so it's approachable and delightfully drinkable.

Half-inch khaki-colored head consisted of tiny dense bubbles and a cap speckled with ringlets. Scent of malt and a hint of cocoa; metallic smell presented itself as brew warmed. Head was replenished with each pour. Sheets of consistent lacing with lots of leg. Taste consistent with nose, but a lightly charred coffee flavor is presented up front, as well as a lingering hops bitterness at the finish. Similar to the nose, I also detected a faint metallic flavor at the back. Mouthfeel is fair; somewhat watery and a little too effervescent, which is not what I consider to be characteristic of an RIS. Mild astringency experienced under the tongue and along the sides. Alcohol was well-hidden, and brew was reasonably priced. Faint metallic presence keeps this from being '4's across the board; a decent brew nonetheless.","Jwale73","Jun 05, 2008"

Taste doesn't quite live up to the nose's promise. Surprisingly hoppy - drying, bitter roasted malt rolles right into the citrus hop backbone. Short, hoppy aftertaste. Light sweet cookie malt. Not nearly as sweet as the aromas suggested. Body is medium and creamy. Good, not great. Overall, a really solid brew, although honestly a bit of a disappointment.

Aroma is of pure chocolate, fruity, light roast coffee, cane syrup, honey, almond extract, a hint of raisins and some earthy, woodsy hops. Alcohol is kind of prevalent in the aroma, but it kind of works here. Flavors are all very well-layered between the chocolate, roast, fruity esters, alcohol and herbal, leafy, floral hops. Very enjoyable, however, as it warms up, the hops get a little too forward. Mouthfeel is moderate to full with some buzzing carbonation. I really enjoyed this right off the bat, but the bomber gets to be a challenge as the hops come out more when warmed.","goochpunch","Apr 30, 2008"
4.37,5.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours thick with moderate heading, light-dark copper hue head. Smell really only contains some black licorice, chocolate, and some tree bark. Very light footed creamyness, that glides perfectly along the palate. S`moreish flavor profiles that are extenuated at the finish with the light roast style that doesn't overpower any aspect of this incredibly drinkable RIS.The alcohol isn't noticed at all. The beer is somewhat one dimensinal, although the flavor is perfect and its VERY hard to find a RIS that actually has BALANCE! I love this beer.","Twerknasty","Apr 23, 2008"

3.15,-23.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a deep dark brown with a light tan head that was nice and frothy, and, stuck around for a while. Aromas of deep roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, spicy hops, and maybe some caramel. The hops dominate the front of the taste, which are followed closely by the deep malts that come in the middle, turn very candy like, and finish the end.

4.07,-1.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"This poured an opaque reddish brown with tan head. It smelled like licorice with dark chocolate. It had a unique and very subdued flavor of heavy dark chocolate bitterness and oaky malt. It was thick and sticky with no carbonation and a bitter aftertaste.

The color was a shade of mahogany-black darkness. Pours with a tan head that lasts the entire time, and lacing that stretches from the top to bottom of the glass. The smell was full of roasted malt and coffee. Taste-wise, this was one of the best RIS that I have ever had. It was sweet and roasted all at the same time. All I could think of was caramel and chocolate covered coffee beans. Delicious. For an 8% abv beer, this one went down very smoothly. It's one of those beers that you think that you could easily drink 3-4 bombers. Not a bad idea. This is one of my new favorite beers from Bear Republic.","morebeergood","Feb 19, 2008"
4.12,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Hoppy goodness is all about it here. Pours your typical dark stout with a decent one finger, light brown head in a pint glass. Smell is super hoppy which I wasn't expecting in this stout. Taste had the same bitter hoppy notes and was light on the tongue, not a heavy drink. Slightly roasted malts were barely there, but the hops really took control on my palette. Went down easy and was quite enjoyable in the session.","ballewblake","Feb 19, 2008"

Big fluffy, tan head is formed with wide open bubbles; this is a sign of things to come. In the aroma, I wonder if someone dropped some squid ink in an IPA, this one is hop forward, very floral but there is also milk chocolate and a slight roastiness. On the palate, it is simply too hoppy. There isn't an overly roasted feel to it, it is closer to a hopped up brown or porter. Following that it is also overcarbonated for style, and a too thin body. Drinkability is low because when I want a solid RIS, I reach for a BCS or Expedition, not this hopped up monster. Besides, Storm King is already out there and this one seems like another clone.","dreadnatty08","Feb 18, 2008"
4.38,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black with ruby hints at the edges and over two fingers of luscious, pillowy brown head that exhibits excellent retention. Aroma is quite good, roasted malts are dominant with coffee and dark chocolate notes. Also present are some restrained citrusy hops as well as brown sugar and molasses. Taste is, at first, a bit sweet then predominantly malty. As we near the finish the roasted malts make their triumphant return as some subtle dark chocolate mingles with more powerful coffee flavors. Bitterness and some faint hoppiness then join the party. The bitterness is well rounded, not at all harsh, and definitely from both the roasted malts as well as generous hopping early in the boil. Mouthfeel is quite good, medium-full body that is velvety and not quite chewy with moderate carbonation. The 8.1% ABV is masked incredibly well and the only reason that I noticed is was a gentle warming sensation that I felt when I was about finished with the bottle. Overall this is one heck of a brew. I felt that this wasn't really an RIS (well, maybe a very American interpretation of the style) but an excellent American Double Stout. I highly recommend this brew.","mnj21655","Feb 17, 2008"

The beer poured a very dark black color with a creamy two finger head that seemed to hang around for quite a while. Nice aroma, with a hint of roasted malt. The initial taste was very sweet malt, which then turned to a roasted malt and slightly hoppy finish. Very low carbonation which was right on for this beer. Mouthfeel was very full and thick.

The taste was initially of sweet malt, but morphed nicely into a roasted malt and slight bitter hop finish. The carbonation was right on target (low, that is), making for a thicker, more syrupy mouthfeel.

4.31,4.4,5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours an opaque, oil-slick jet black with a big, durable tan head that never completely goes away. Smells of dark chocolate, vanilla, dark-roasted coffee and booze. The taste is a winner  again, bitter dark chocolate, creamy vanilla, pungent coffee and what seemed like bourbon and buttered rum notes. Additional creaminess as it settles  an overtone of what almost seems like Ghirardelli hot milk chocolate. Delicious. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, keeps this out of the Hall of Fame. A little thinner and watery than I would have anticipated. Still a wonderful evening sipper  paired great with 80% cacao Belgian dark chocolate after a hearty dinner.","eberkman","Jan 22, 2008"

The beer is big and black on the pour with a moderate head of chocolate-colored bubbling foam. There is a strong aroma of molasses, brown bread and caramel. The malt strikes first on the taste, with roasted flavors, licorice and espresso. There is a hint of hops at the outset that carries over strong at the finish. There is a much stronger hop presence that a traditional stout but it appeals to me even though I don't like getting hit over the head with hop bombs in other brews.

4.1,-0.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured black as night, as any good stout should, into my glass tankard. The head required a vigorous pour and was a pleasing brown/red hue, but this faded quickly to a thin layer on the surface of the brew. Aroma was slightly sour and of coffee; more like espresso perhaps? Delicious. Thick and malty flavors are constantly swapping with the bitter coffee and roast tastes while the beer is in the mouth. This fades once swallowed to a pleasantly herbal taste of hops on the back end. Once adjusted to the intense quality of the malt flavors, some esters of dark fruits and berries can be detected in the nose and appreciated on the taste buds. A beer this strong in alcohol and character is not the most drinkable because you cant just knock it back. However, its not as boring as many beers that you could just knock back. A fantastic beer.","BabaJohn","Jul 23, 2007"

Nose is a sweet zesty malt with deep dark fruits and cordial candies. Not as sweet as expected as it enters the mouth, bitter blackness paints the mouth. It is sharp and long but nicely integrated and very even. Sweetness does develop a bit more with some warming. Mouthfeel is of burnt malt. Alchol is well hidden. Wow! What a drinkable masterpiece.

I have been real impressed with what Bear Republic does so I have really been looking forward to this beer. It looks initially as if splashed in my glass like it was black used motor oil , but when held up close to light you discover it is really a very rich red. The head is fairly large and was the color of coffee with cream. Huge chunks of lacing were left as it settled. Overall the appearance, for a dark beer, is simply outstanding. The body and mouthfeel are not as heavy as its appearance would suggest but are velvet smooth, and both on the teeth and tongue are a sensory delight. The nose is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, spicy fruits, hops, and a touch of alcohol. Flavors are a mirror of the nose, but are even more intense, with the roasted malts and chocolate dominating. After all this, the finish surprisingly has a nice little bitter twitch. Overall it is very well balanced, and remarkably drinkable. I consider this at the very top of all the imperial stouts I have tried. It lived up to my expectations and more.","rkuhnel","Apr 11, 2007"
4.42,7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - The lighter-than-normal body attributes to the drinkability. In no way is it filling or overwhelming. The flavors don't consume the mouth, but slide around to hit every part of it, which I like. The alcohol is very light, if noticeable at all. I love the roasted characteristics of this brew. A very consistent and well-rounded Imperial Stout. Where some heavy IS's can have a lot of variables, this one stays true to the style. Heavy IS's may also not be for every beer lover, but I think Big Bear is an incredible example of this style and a great IS for anyone, be it the first time IS drinker or a seasoned veteran. I don't think Bear Republic can brew anything but an amazing beer.","Gatch","Mar 29, 2007"

The taste has some dark roasted malts a bit of chocolate and a slight after taste of alcohol.

The taste is much like the aroma, but even better. Boundless chocolate and espresso, roasted malts play prominently, but there is that leafy, earthy hop profile that makes this one stand out from the crowd.

And this is 8.1%? Where's the alcohol hidden? Dangerous! I could drink this all day and be happy with it. Incredible.","jj21","Dec 16, 2006"

A toffee-colored layer of thick, long-lasting, and lace-producing head remains perched atop the ink below it. Aromas are heavenly...a mixture of milk chocolate, espresso, caramel, roasted malt. The flavor carries all of this as well. Splashes of chocolate and caramel initially, the middle sees some of the chewy grains, with a co-op of ABV and choco-bitterness at the end (what a finish!).

A nice bit of earthiness and hoppy resiny flavors counter the sweetness. Darker chocolate is controlling. Some slight espresso roast is in there.

It looks quite majestic and retains a cap of foam that leaves moderate lacing throughout. The smell is more hoppy than malty, with a big grapefruit/pine hop resin aroma that overtakes that malts. The hops also dominate the flavor, with citric/pine being the most prevalent, but there are also lots of roasted/coffee malts and notes of chocolate and caramel malts to balance the big bitterness. The body is medium to thick, which isn't thick enough for my imperial stouts - I want to almost chew on them - but that is about my only complaint with this beer.

Nose is more subtle than I had expected - dark fruits, some bittering hops, and faint coffee at the end. The taste is also much more subtle than I would have thought -dark fruits, some citrus, mild hops and the faintest choco/coffee roastiness to balance out the hops. The alcohol is almost not noticible on the palate, a very well-hidden 8.1% abv. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but still refreshing along with solid carbonation on this ungodly hot Wisconsin night.

Pours a brown/tan one-finger head over a very dark liquid. Dark brown-red edgings when held to light. Smells potently of coffee/roasted grains that are countered by a sweet toffee. There is also a sour (from black patent). Tastes sweet and of rich chocolate, some coffee, and the sour of cherry that indicates a heavy hand of black patent. During the swallow, hop aromatic begins and there is an alcohol sting. Aftertaste is phenomenal. Waves of caramel and coffee rising on a backbone of chocolate. Thick creamy mouthfeel and mildly carbonated.","mentor","Jul 14, 2005"

I feel like it could stand to be a bit thicker to stand up to the big taste and ABV. That said, it's an incredibly drinkable stout for its power, and part of that is probably due to its light mouthfeel.

Rich, malty aroma with lots of chocolate and some molasses. Roasted and nutty provide some depth as well. Ripe fruit and alcohol are just noticeable. The flavour is big and malty, as expected, some dark chocolate, roasted and a bit of burnt under it all. Bitterness and hop flavour are present, but mainly provide balance to the malt. Finishes with mild alcohol warmth and a nice balance of malt and bitterness. Creamy texture, full body and medium carbonation. Very slight astringency from the dark malts.

It is quite a robust beer. It is full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This beer might not be the best session beer. It is not too high in alcohol, for a stout, but the flavor is a little off for a night of drinking. In small doses this beer is very good. It could maybe use a little less hop aroma though.

Smell was big roasted malts with hints of coffee and very slight caramel tones. Taste was all roasted malts up front with a slightly bitter-sweet finish and left a nice sweet after taste that lingered. As it warmed i could feel a bit more of the alcohol in the throat but it was well hidden overall. Mouthfeel was fairly robust and I would say full body-ish. Very easy to drink and a pleasure at that. I would definitnely pick one of these up again. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.","kegerator","Jan 20, 2005"

Toffee, and chocolate in the nose in addition to the roasted malt. Same flavors that I found in the nose along with a bit of hop flower and a pleasant tartness. Slightly oily mouth feel along with a nice warming. Good drinkability. For the 8% punch that this beer packs, it is remarkably balanced. Another great offering from this brewery.","carln26","Jan 16, 2005"
4.16,0.7,5,4,4,4,4.5,"Largely black in hue and basically opaque but when I held it to a light I could see some ruby highlights. The color of the liquid is lovely. The head was russet in color, about two fingers in height at its highest point. Head retention was very good; it slowly faded to a clumpy, bubbly cap that was fairly thick around the edges. This cap lasted the entire consumption. There was plenty of sticky, unorganized, subsequent lacing. The lacing was akin to tattered wallpaper. The appearance, on the whole, is excellent. The nose doesnt really contain that massive thumping, boastful roasted malt. The roasted malt is more secondary, it is found in the middle and it offers some char and coffee vibes. Upfront is a soft arrangement of cream and brown sugar. At the back are stiff notes of alcohol heat, kisses of molasses too. The hops are vaguely noticeable every third sniff or so (I wasnt really counting a ratio but I didnt smell them every time). Soft. Rounded. The nose does not impress me, there are plenty of muted yet pleasant aromas but this isnt very boastful for a stout of this sort. Dont get me wrong the bouquet is inviting. The palate does offer more than the nose but not enough for me to consider this beer great, very good at best. The creamy, espresso infused with milk flavor is a bit too strong; I wanted a louder, truer roast. Oh well. This softness makes me believe this beer is weaker than need be. The palate is very mellow, heavy on chocolate milk, light on bitterness. Hell, it is light on astringency too. Not much from the hops. There were some random influences of dark fruit. The abv is very well hidden, I could smell a tickle of alcohol in the nose but I dont taste anything. Amazing considering the 8.1% abv. I do feel the alcohol in my belly and on my brain. Mmm warm. Overall the palate is mellow and relaxing. It doesnt remind me of the typical Double American Stout. I wonder if only the alcohol content is truly big enough to be considered a Double Stout. Even if I looked at this beer as just a Stout it wouldnt be that big of a beer. Regardless this beer is tasty but Im not impressed. I like it but Im not wowed. Somewhat fuller than medium in body, the carbonation is moderate but appropriate for this beer, I like the mouthfeel it is kind of lazy but its not sluggish. It allows the flavors to lie on my tongue so I can soak them in. Satisfying. I do see a time and a place for this beer. If I wanted a tasty but mellow stout Id gladly drink this. If I didnt want to rip my tastebuds to pieces but I wanted to enjoy a good (and simple) quaff, Id drink this. I enjoyed my bomber with some Colby cheese and light crackers. Simple food, simple beer it was a tasty combination. Easy enough to enjoy but its nothing special, I like it fine. Yummy. I purchased a bomber in Milwaukee, WI. Worth a try.","bditty187","Jan 07, 2005"

The silky smooth liquid produces a rocky pock-marked head that fades to a tight, persistent layer. The lacing is thick and chunky, outstanding. Dark roasted black malt, molasses, freshly roasted coffee beans make up the aroma. Translate those aromas to liquid form and add a healthly dose of leafy, earthy hops, a touch of dark semi-sweet chocolate and presto, there you have this rich black nectar. The perfect brew to take this chill out of the recent coldspell that's beset the Northeast. A bit of warming Christmas cheer indeed.","John","Dec 20, 2004"

I was told this was a hoppy stout but this is not evident in the smell. Tastes as good as it smells. Full of roasty, toasty malty goodness that we love in a good stout. Hops are more evident in the finish but are subdued due to a year in the cellar.

4.2,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This dark beer pours black with a fairly thin brown head. When held up to light, the faintest amount is able to pierce through creating a few ruby highlights to break up the darkness. The aroma is chocolate with a bit of roasted malt. These 2 aromas are brought along by a nice blast of hops aroma. This smells like it will be a good one. The taste certainly doesn't let you down. Initially there's bittersweet chocolate with a subtle sweetness. Shortly, the sharply roasted malts join in with an exquisite bitterness. This bitterness from the roasted malt is shortly joined by a small amount of hop bitterness. The finish is dry and very clean. The alcohol makes itself known as it warms your stomach. The aftertaste intermingles all the flavors and adds a touch of espresso. The alcohol also coats your tongue a bit along with a bit of astringency. The mouthfeel is nice and full. The carbonation level is fairly light, just right for the style. This is an easily drinkable imperial stout. Very tasty, very dangerous.","Hagbard","Nov 19, 2004"

On the palate it is rich, slick and inundated with flavors of rum-soaked raisins, roasted hay, ancho chiles and sweet alcohol. The finish is dry and punctuated with charcoal bitterness. I doubt freezing did any damage to the specimen -- the worst thing would be its effect on dissolved gas, and that does not seem like a problem here. In any case, the excess of raw and burnt grain combined with simple sugar and alcohol flavors prevent this from earning top scores. Not bad; and certainly a "big" beer, for those who obsess about such things.","putnam","Sep 11, 2004"

Surprisingly, I'm picking up a lot of grassy and piney hops, too. The finish affirms this, there is a boatload of West Coast hops in there. Most of your roasty, malty, caramelly sweetness is up-front, smoothness (a touch of oat?) in the middle, but the oily, high-alpha dry finish keeps this monster drinkable.

Finish is quite long with some mammoth bitterness played against some burnt chocolate bits and espresso like flavors. Wow, what a long finish! It's more delicate up front, almost sweetish, but the bitterness kicks in not too soon after and it's scorched earth (or should I say scorched malt) not much later. A bit harsh, but fortunately I like the bitterness. It's almost over the top with espresso flavors and bitter hops. Could be more complex, but a decent stout..

Mouth entrance hits you with a little raw sugar moment which is swiftly followed by brown sugar and caramel maltiness. Again, rapidly, cascade hops take control leading to a dry hoppy finish (resin, pine, coniferous) paired with a classic slightly citric acidity.

Nice roasted malts over sweet caramel malts. A very nice, smooh, dark flavor prevails, leading to a subdoed hop flavor. A bold brew, but delicately balanced, and for that reason it suits any occasion. The alcohol content is hardly noticable, despite being 8.1%.","gnaussea","Mar 06, 2004"

The taste starts with burnt malt, toffee, and a little coffee. Also a hint of chocolate and brown sugar in there as well. The finish is fairly hoppy, maybe cascades?

It smelled mostly of roasty chocolate malts, with a tad of floral hoppiness to top it off...promising. The taste was big, with dark chocolate and smooth cola flavors with a bouncy bitter finish rounding it all off quite nicely. The stout was full and satisfying.

Lastly a really nice juicy hop finish cleans the whole thing up in a strong cup of espresso with lemon rind kind of way. This stuff is straight forward and awesome.

The taste is a wonderful blend of cascade hop bitterness, and floral hop goodness with some citric hop notes in the finish. This is very well balanced for such a big brew, and the 8+% Abv goes unnoticed. The mouthfeel is actually quite light and thin for this stout, but it actually works quite well here. The lighter body and well balanced flavor of this big bear give it a '5' in the drinkability department in my book. A new classic.","francisweizen","Dec 22, 2003"

It has a nice bite at the start, and they balance a bit later. Roasty grains and coffee flavors jump in next only to be met with sweet chocolate shortly after. It gets roasty again near the finish and then dries out with nice coffee flavors and touches of hops. The complexity of this beer is incredible, and it maintains such a great balance through out. Although it is a pretty big beer, it seems like it would not scare too many people away. I could definitely sit down with a few and not regret it a bit.

Very noticeable coffee flavors as well, followed by excellent roasted barley. While most of the taste is sweeter, a nice bitterness finishes it up and leads to the bitter chocolate and coffee aftertaste. Gets a little sweeter as it warms. Mouthfeel is very thick and rich, yet doesn't get too heavy as to make drinking it a chore. Man I like these imperial stouts. Is this as good as Old Rasputin? Maybe.

The aroma is milk chocolate, a bit of coffee and some molasses lurking in the background.

This beer reminded me of the Victory and the Rogue. Mostly hops, somewhat dry and thin. Pours nice, smells nice, tastes nice. Overall, a pretty good drinking experience. How beers like this end up rated in the top 10-20, however, I don't understand. As is the case with the micro IPA's, they start to taste alike, IMO.

The second mug was allowed to warm, and a bit more bitterness emerges at the back of the tongue, still smooth. This beer seems to blend elements of the dryness of and Irish stout, the malty heft of an English sweet stout and a touch of the hoppyness of an American interpretation.

Creamy, well retained tan head slowly settles into a tight, one fingered layer that leaves quasi Belgian lace. Wafts of rounded carob and nutty brittle hit the nose upfront, then are ensued by rich, smooth buttery milk chocolate and black licorice. Roasted barley sharpness and heaty ethanol emerge as the nose adjusts to the pronounced chocolate presence. Cocoa dusted caramel upfront in flavor is ceded by a bittersweet combination of molasses sweetened melted bakers chocolate and burnt barley. Prune laced sweetness emerges mid palate, then is immediately contrasted by tangerine tinged hop bitterness. Mellow diacetyl butterscotch undertone complements the dark, chocolate malt overtone, lending an agreeable yeast byproduct and roasted grain balance. Moderate in body with a dextrinous, lightly sugary, lactose like mouthfeel. Suggestion of bourbon macerated figs dipped in semi sweet chocolate emerges late. Finishes long and disparate, with maltose like sweetness and lingering hop bitterness uncontesting each other.

Up front the sweet flavors of cocoa powder introduce themselves. There's a hoppy bite to the finish which contributes some of its effect from the alcohol.

The nose displays a gently fruity (currant, black raspberry) dark chocolate, coffee, and sweet cocoa. The medium body teams with the very fine and moderate carbonation to create a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is of a creamy sweet caramel and fruit-tinged toffee with a roasted edge. It starts with a bitter espresso note and warms into more softly roasted cocoa notes. Some alcohol is apparent but unobtrusive. It finishes drying with a lingering bitterness, mild roastiness and soft notes of mocha. Exceptionally well balanced.

4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice creamy brown head.  Very opaque.  Smell of burnt malts and molasses.  Light body for a stout.  Some toffee undertones.  A bit of coffee too.  Very solid stout.","Bighuge","Mar 27, 2002"
