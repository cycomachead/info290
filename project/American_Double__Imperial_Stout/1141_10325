A great beer to share with non beer geeks - i guarantee you will blow their minds. I have never met anyone that did not love this beer. Not saying it's the best but it's damn close for me.","KATCanada","Yesterday at 06:40 PM"

I wish there were some hints of chocolate or roasted malts.  The mouthfeel is very good - but the nose and taste lacked depth beyond the coffee.  I thought I would be burned out by the coffee, at the end, but it actually tasted better as I reached the end.  I think this nudge it up a fraction.","fscottkey","Nov 22, 2014"

4.75,8,,,,,,"Pours a midnight black with a beautiful two finger mocha head. It smells like freshly brewed espresso, bakers chocolate, and darkly roasted grains. There is also a very big freshly ground espresso bean note, like the smell when you open up your coffee grinder and that dusty, intense coffee aroma flows in to your nostrils. The taste follows the nose, with intense, oily black espresso at the front. There is a light amount of sweetness to make sure the bitter coffee doesn't overwhelm. The beer is nicely carbonated and body is not quite full... The mouth feel is perfect for the delivery of the flavors. The astringency is spot on. This is a world class beer; try as hard as you can to get a taste. It's by far the best imperial coffee stout I've tasted.","Jack_Malts","Aug 30, 2014"

It was quite bitter, but had a lot of flavor to back up the bitterness. And that flavor was complex, with prominent coffee as well as a smoky taste. This is an excellent beer, and brewery, that you should seek out if you have the chance.","rjcohen","Aug 07, 2014"

4.33,-1.6,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"O: Great expression of an imperial coffee stout. The drying finish and lack of sweetness really accentuate the roasted notes of the malt and the bitter espresso character. I prefer a bit more balance in my imperial stouts in regards to residual sugar and a bit more sweetness, which makes me think that I would LOVE the bourbon barrel version. Still a fantastic beer, and I'll definitely grab it again whenever I see it.","More_betterness","Jun 28, 2014"

But the whole experience seems a bit thin and boozy, and at times bitter and astringent. There's a strange abrasiveness around the edges, especially when juxtaposed with the utterly smooth and luxurious flavors that are found elsewhere in this beer. Hmm, I'm conflicted but I find myself getting past the boozy bitterness and really enjoying the dark fruit/cherry center.","Mongrel","Jun 24, 2014"

It's actually quite hard to beat such high quality at this price point. The beer looks and feels great but falls short due to low carbonation. The smell and taste are just superb giving a very balanced coffee/chocolate bitterness. I would love to see how this beer improves with a nice long slumber in a bourbon barrel and perhaps a bit more carbonation, because that may be close to fives across the board. I will definitely be drinking many more of these in my day and am very pleased with how easy it is to acquire/what it doesn't do to my wallet.","ThreeLions","Jun 12, 2014"

4.44,0.9,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pub glass at Kawa espresso bar here in Calgary. Basically pitch black, opaque with no trace of light refraction or other sources of color other than the light brown sponge-toffee like head. Aroma is surprisingly vinous and fruity, with some caramel, dates and red wine along with the more-expected burnt coffee and singed grain elements. This beer is extremely well-regarded and I now understand the hype. There is none of the overpoweringly burnt flavor reminiscient of a dry ashtray that one can get with less well-crafted coffee stouts. The coffee flavor is bold and rich but balanced by caramel, milk chocolate, pecan, almond nougat, and red wine notes, and the coffee itself comes across like a smooth cappucino as opposed to gnarly, abrasive instant crystals. Features a moderately syrupy body, a silky smooth mouthfeel adds to the cappucino effect, and the carbonation is decidedly low-key. Finishes dry and spicy, with a little faint ash that does not detract and some black pepper. The fruity sweetness continues to linger for some time as well. The coffee features prominently but is checked just enough by fruit, nut, and caramel notes to avoid any nastiness. Wonderful beer and the best coffee stout I've yet to sample.","CalgaryFMC","May 12, 2014"

Initially, a 1-inch thick tan foamy head, which dissipated somewhat abruptly, yet leaving a collar with innumerable tiny bubbles and fine, sticky, beige lacing throughout the experience. The coffee scent jumped from the bottle and was noticeable even from a distance within moments after hitting the glass. Upon further inspection, roasted chocolate with notes of licorice and cinnamon spice were apparent, all of which were replicated on the palate at first sip. A little more carbonation than expected (based on the nose), while subtle hints of vanilla & coconut emerged. A little more sweetness and a little less bitter carbonation (a la BCBS and KBS) would make this stout truly special. Still, a very fine example of the style.","JohnParadee","Mar 17, 2014"

Taste is coffee, but not as bitter as a lot of coffee stouts. I also get some milk chocolate and vanilla. Silky and smooth. Full bodied with a low amount of carbonation that works well with this beer. Overall excellent stout worth seeking out.","Jas45678","Nov 13, 2013"

4.75,8,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Found a 12oz bottle of Peche Mortel at a local high quality bottle shop in San Francisco. Poured into a snifter, the brew had no head whatsoever, and amazed me with its pure thick dark black color. Carbonation is medium-strong and offers contrast to the thickness of the beer. Peche Mortel smells like espresso more than it smells like beer. No strong recognizable hop aromas come through, just the beautiful dense smell and flavor of pure dark chocolate and espresso. The beer truly hides the 9.5% alcohol well, even while warming. Toffee is also the only recognizable third flavor besides chocolate and coffee. This is a deep dark imperial espresso blast; a complex offering that is a peak example of the style.","BenHesk12","Nov 11, 2013"
4.19,-4.8,4.5,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,"O-This is a very good beer, but perhaps because my expectations for this brew were high, I felt a bit let-down. The coffee flavors are nice, but a bit dull and metallic when compared against the best of the style. On the other hand, the balance between coffee and beer is nice and unlike some beers, you don't feel like your drinking charred, bitter coffee grounds.","spoony","Nov 10, 2013"

Scents of coffee, roast malt, chocolate and slight soy sauce. A nose that is quite coffee heavy, predicting the beer's flavor. Flavors of black coffee, espresso and roast malt. Slight undertones of dark chocolate and cocoa powder. The black coffee and roast malt biterness linger on the aftertaste The flavors greatly increase in intensity as the beer warms, becoming very rich and satisfying. It's incredibly forward on the coffee and roasted malt, which is excellent. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, quite a good sipper, despite it's 9.5% ABV there is no alcohol warmth present. A very good feel, silky, thick and satisfying. Overall this is an amazing Imperial Stout, showcasing it's coffee overtones above all else. It does doing an excellent job at showcasing the rich, deep flavor of quality coffee mingled with the roasted malt of a fine stout. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Oct 11, 2013"

The roasted malts really take over the beer. Dark, bitter chocolate, burnt toast, strong bitterness, slight coffee vibes. As it warms, the coffee starts to come out more. There’s not a huge amount of depth but the flavors work very well here. Mouthfeel is decent, but not as good as it could be – there might be a little too much carbonation…it feels a little harsh with all the bitter roasted malts. This is still a very solid imperial stout.","greenmtn1111","Aug 07, 2013"

Very well-balanced combination of roasted grains and espresso, accentuated with a hint of bittersweet dark chocolate, and bitter licorice. Thick and hearty, yet soft and smooth.

Hints of chocolate but the main focus is the roasted coffee. The taste is no surprise, coffee, along with some sweet chocolate, roasted malts and earth. Maybe even hints of licorice. Not a huge alcohol presence. Silky and creamy. This one is almost like a delicious coffee milkshake. Good mix of roasted coffee and earthiness.

Seriously the carbonation was clear but the head was just a ring and despite a full bright light only the slighest cherry edge is visable. This growler's been warming all night and while I'm missing the masssive coffee smell, I do get alot of subtle balanced notes: coffee, chocolate covered cherries, echos of vanilla and lace. It's amazing how smooth and drinkable this is! I get the coffee bitterness, easily fading into subtle vanilla with cherry cola echos. Vanilla, cherry, cola echoing back and forth, then overcome with bitter coffee on the finish. The intesity of the lace on the swirl is impressive, as is the complete cloaking of the abv.

The aroma of coffee hit the nose even as the beer was being poured. There's some dark roasty malt in the nose that really blends well with the coffee. There's just a touch of chocolate in the nose. There's some nice dark coffee in the flavor with some good dark roasted barley malt in the flavor. The coffee aftertaste lingers in the mouth. There's a touch of chocolate there as well, which is something I found in the nose. I don't even taste the 9.5% ABV. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is high for an imperial stout. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Mar 05, 2013"

4.12,-6.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Peche Mortel pours jet black. Two fingers of mocha foam quickly fill the glass and threaten to spill out. Head retention is decent, and foam is left in a thick ring at the top of the glass, and fairly spotty below. The nose has a wonderful, potent fresh coffee aroma. It's offset by a subtle, perfectly complementary dark chocolate note. The flavor has that same great coffee presence, but it's a little bit more domineering here. There's still some chocolate, and a light earthy hop note, but the coffee is far and away the center of attention. It's to the point where the beer becomes a little bit one note. The carbonation is nice and subdued, but the body could stand to be just a little bit more rich and full. I find Peche Mortel to be consistently very good, but a step shy of outstanding in most aspects. That considered, it's definitely one of the best coffee stouts available year round.","axeman9182","Sep 27, 2012"

Strong espresso, dark fruit and roasted malt on the nose. Opens with espresso, rich roasted date, baked black cherry, and charred raisin joined by rich dark chocolate and finishes slightly bitter with strong coffee and slightly bitter earthy hops. The mouthfeel is incredible. Thick, silky, smooth and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation. This is one of the most complex beers and definitely one of the most complex imperial coffee stouts I've had. The coffee is very evident, yet doesn't overwhelm the other rich flavor aspects of this brew. Truly a masterpiece.","chanokokoro","Sep 26, 2012"

5,13.6,5,5,5,5,5,"Enjoyed this offering on brisk winter night out of a 11.5 oz bottle. Presents midnight black with a small dark brown head. Light to no carbonation with excellent lacing. Smell of toffee and coffee with lingering sweet notes. Taste is wordclass. Robust sweet espresso that lingers just long enough and masks the 9+% ABV very nicely. Thick on the palate as it should be with this style. If you have chance to try/buy this one its a must!!! Even better on tap.","Sirbaron","Dec 18, 2011"

A thick beige head hangs out for a few minutes before settling to a thin layer of crema, leaving a nice sheet of lacing in its wake. The aroma brings abundant coffee and chocolates amid a bed of roast and subtle booze. Well balanced, though coffee presence does emerge more than other aspects. Teeming with flavor, roast and dark chocolates are balanced by a delicate bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. Full bodied with appropriate carbonation. Overall, a terrific stout. Highly recommended.","Huhzubendah","Nov 07, 2011"

Smell is dank roasted coffee, hints of chocolate, and licorice. Taste is all of those things, the roasted coffee is the main attraction for sure. The body is a bit thin, plenty of carbonation, and fairly easy drinking for it's abv. This is good beer, but based on the reviews I really expected more.","SawDog505","Nov 06, 2011"

An excellent beer to help celebrate Halloween. Cheers.","ElGallo","Oct 31, 2011"

It's got a lot of flavor, a huge coffee profile, definite alcohol strength, but it just carries it all off with this sense of easy refinement that is very refreshing and inviting. This beer doesn't challenge you to drink it, it welcomes you, and after feeling like I was entering into a boxing ring with a lot of the beers I've tasted recently, this is a welcome experience. I highly reccomend you grab some of this beer.","etaggie09","Oct 09, 2011"

Taste is big roasted malt and a lot of coffee, leaving behind a bit of roasted bitterness and coffee aftertaste on a medium length finish. Smooth, medium-low carbonation and medium body.

This is one ridiculously good stout. Received a few bottles of this from a fine gentleman in Nova Scotia. I will be seeking this out at EVERY opportunity. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Guinness pint glass (wide mouth). Poured a thick, 2-3" head that quickly dissipated. This sucker is onyx black. Completely impervious to light penetration. One of the single best smelling beers ever. No joke, I could hold the glass under my nose and just inhale its aroma for minutes on end. Tons of chocolate and bourbon scents, despite the fact its not a bourbon-barreled beer. The most sublime taste. Caramel, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla... This beast is complex. This is so smooth. Doesn't rest heavy on the tongue or coat the inside of your mouth heavily. The taste left behind however is long lasting. You'll still taste this beer long after you've taken your last sip. I recommend this to absolutely all beer drinkers, even if stout isn't your bag. Seriously, if you don't like this, I'm quite certain we can't be friends.","Retail1LO","Aug 12, 2011"

It dissipates somewhat quickly, but leaves gobs of lacing behind. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee grounds, a touch of chocolate, and even less plum and raisin. Very minimal sugar is detectable, and the alcohol is completely hidden here. The taste shifts gears a bit. It begins with a sweet, dark fruit flavor, moves into a bit of chocolately, coffee-like center, and finished with a touch of roasty, almost charred malt in the rear. As it warms, some vanilla comes into play as well. No flavor is particularly overpowering, however, and it just seems very well balanced. Alcohol is completley hidden, but along with the carbonation, it's presence seems to help thin the otherwise viscous body quite considerably. Mouth finishes dry and a touch sticky on the roof of the mouth. Overall, a very good stout that I am very happy to have tried.","eclipse54","Aug 08, 2011"

4.7,6.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall- An amazing imperial stout although a little heavy on the coffee flavours at times although it is very well balanced by a perfect amount of roasted malts and a slight hint of dark chocolate. The smells again are of a lot of coffee then the taste comes through almost the same as well but it finishes with this very nice burnt malt smokiness that is very pleasant on the palate. Hides the high ABV very well, I can’t even taste any alcohol in this one what so ever, dangerously easy drinking, smooth, creamy and rich. A definite go to if I could ever find this one again, please bring this back to Ontario!","Roke87","May 27, 2011"

4.73,7.5,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Tastes of espresso and toasty malts predominate, with more minor burnt, vanilla, and chocolate flavors. Nice, fine carbonation. This stout is indeed heavy on the coffee, but I think it's blended in very naturally and it doesn't seem at all out of place. This is an excellent, complex, and well-balanced stout, and I will certainly buy it again at the first opportunity.","ILessThan3Brett","May 21, 2011"
4.23,-3.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured in my small Westvleteren chalice the beer looks very good, millions of tiny little bubbles making a one and a half finger head. Nice lacing in the glass.

4.48,1.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Pours intense black with a fluffy dark cream head, a medium to heavy-thickness oily body, and deep black-brown in color. Creamy vanilla, rich, roasted coffee and a powdery cocoa sweetness predominate in the nose. Also, some minor lactic sugars, caramel, dark cereal grains, and light bourbon. The body is very smooth, and all at once both rich and bitter. The coffee aspect of this beer builds throughout, allowing the finish to culminate in a interesting way with a roasted coffee and bitter earth combination. Up front, there’s some creamy lactic sugars and vanilla, then some minor dark fruits. Toffee, light bourbon, and toasted grains as well. The aroma and flavors play well off each other, though I’d like for the aroma to stand out a bit more. This beer was definitely brewed to be savoured. Very good stuff.","CuriousMonk","May 17, 2011"

Smells strongly of fresh brewed coffee with some roasted malt and cocoa powder. Coffee is definitely the dominant smell and this is one of the best coffee stouts I have smelled. Taste is of Hershey's chocolate syrup infused with fresh roasted coffee beans. The roasted coffee bitterness is very noticeable after each sip. Mouthfeel is very thick, creamy, and smooth. Very rich and heavy. Overall, this is a fantastic stout with an unbelievable coffee aroma and taste that is just delicious.","UCLABrewN84","May 10, 2011"

4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the mouthfeel. It was quite unique for the style, in the fact that it retained a glorious creaminess and slurpability, but was so airy and light. Many imperial stouts can be overly thick and syrupy, which is nice, but can become overbearing. Here we avoid that altogether, as we were delivered a beer that comes through in all the robust aromas and flavors, but remains highly drinkable and light.","TheBrewo","Apr 30, 2011"

Little vanilla as well and again, an overall sweetness. Mouthfeel I thought was a little too thin, but not bad at all.

The taste carries over a lot of what the nose provided but the beer is a touch too acidic to make it all work well together. The acidic nature combined with the surprisingly light medium body of the beer is really the downside of this beer. This is a very nice and easy beer to drink and as it warms it opens up nicely.

Chocolate on the front and more chocolate on the swallow. A nice blend of bitter at the beginning followed by a rich creamy cocoa, roasted malt finish. Smokey goodness lingers after the swallow. Light bitterness on the aftertaste. Perfect! Smooth and creamy all the way on the mouthfeel. A little oily but does not detract. Great drinkability...but the best way to enjoy this is in a snifter with light sips to fully get the most out of this phenomimal beer.","kaseydad","Feb 14, 2011"

The coffee is right up front, fresh beans. After the coffee there are nice roasted malts, cocoa and a touch of booze. The taste follows the smell but is very rich, glad I picked it as my dessert beer. The coffee is certainly a dark roast, the chocolate bitter sweet, the roasted malts bring a sweetness and charred taste. Smooth and thick going down. I rate this up with AleSmith's Speedway Stout for sure. A very fine example of the style. My second beer from this French Canadian Brewery and I'm sold.","OBeerMeGreatOne","Feb 07, 2011"

The aroma is pretty strong on coffee, pretty much dominates the smell. Other smells are a little bit of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is pretty much identical to what the smell has. And as this one warms up it gets better and better. I like this one a lot because although the taste and smell are pretty heavy with coffee it's not to much and overwhelming, unlike other coffee flavored stouts. The mouthfeel is very creamy which I didn't expect from this but it's very nice. Drinkability is kind of dangerous on this one. almost 10% ABV and I don't detect any alcohol. If I had more I could do a couple of these no problem. Overall I'd pick this up again for sure.

There is also an understated dry roastiness here that is very nice and keeps it from being overly silky sweet. The taste is bitter, fruity coffee upfront followed by a blast of dry dark chocolate and finishing with a chocolate covered coffee bean aftertaste on the tongue. Very slight booziness, but it is completely overpowered and overshadowed by the coffee and chocolate that ranges from bitter to sweet and back to bitter again. The depth of flavor here is phenomenal. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with just enough carbonation to keep it lively.

It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. It wasn't very complex as I would have hoped for, but it was still pretty damn tasty. With that being said, it was still kinda boozy. So I will say this... If you like liquor in your coffee this one is a must! If you don't, maybe you should try it sometime.

One of the finest uses of coffee/espresso I've seen in a stout. Seriously, I'm almost getting a coffee buzz here, despite nearly being at 10% alcohol! About two bottles of this would be about all I can handle in an evening, but nevertheless, the drinkability for such a thick, hearty, high ABV stout is still high for me.

The aroma is fairly light and clean, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, a dark roasted malt sweetness, a bit of a mineral quality, and only a faint hint of coffee. The flavor is much more aggressive, but it still doesn't scream coffee for me. The flavor is more of a standard imperial stout, with characteristics of charred malts, bitter chocolate, maybe a bit of black licorice. The coffee is certainly there, but it comes out subtly at first before becoming more prominent in the achingly bitter finish.

Huge coffee notes, and I'm sensing a bit of the alkeehawl in the background. Taste follows to a degree, blast of the rich roastiness is the initial impression. More espresso than you can imagine here, the coffee is almost overpowering; I almost get a sense of some cream or milkiness, can't tell if I'm fabricating this because of the mouthfeel or if this flavour is actually present. Regardless, alcohol isn't hidden by any stretch, well known as this hits the back of my throat. Definite creaminess and fullness in the mouth, slick as can be and just coats every part of my mouth, but finishes dry and bitter (coffee bitterness). Thick, fat and sludgy perfection. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit, chances are I couldn't sit down for more than a couple of these but that more a function of the ABV than the beer itself.

4.46,1.4,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. The beer pours out jet black, literally no light can go through. The head is quite unique, it's a creamy brown/orange/amber color. I expected it to be darker, but I was very intrigued by the slight orange color in it. Has some decent lacing that sticks around until it warms up. The aroma good, but doesn't smell that much like beer, more like a dessert liquor. Mostly coffee and chocolate when its a little colder but as it warms up it tastes like a dessert liquor or some type of "Irish Coffee." Still smells very good though. The taste is very good. For a 9.5 ABV, there isn't much detection in the taste. Here's where you start to realize it's a beer again. The strongest portion is the bittersweet from the coffee and chocolate, but the malts are very noticeable as well. Hops are a little more difficult to detect, but as it warms up they make themselves known. The Mouthfeel is perfect. It's it's smooth yet finishes clean, certainly a full bodied beer. The beer is very drinkable, dangerous for a beer of this alcohol content. 2nd beer I've had from this brewery 2 for 2!","AndyAvalanche","Jul 23, 2010"

Pour is jet black with no light coming through with a 1.5 inch creamy brown head which has now receded to a steady 3/8" head which is seeming to last. Nose from the glass is chocolate, rum, and almost a sweet cream smell. Taste is dark chocolate with a hint of sweetness. Taste sticks with you. I am suprised by the taste not being syrupy as it smelled from the bottle. Alcohol is not as apparent from the taste as it was from the smell. Beer is quite nice and alcohol is well hidden Mouthfeel is not nearly as creamy as I expected from the smell either, but is also pleasant.

The first initial taste was bitter, then the alcohol took over, followed lastly by an intense coffee flavor. I must say, after drinking the Mikkeller Breakfast stout, I was expecting the same result, but to my surprise I really enjoyed this stout.

This has a roasty fragrant spiciness that I can only attribute to the coffee used.

The head appears more than 2 fingers strong with a foam of brown creaminess that retains well and laces in patches all about the glassware. The aroma of this beer is a very rich sweet chocolate mingled with coffee at first. Than the dark grains and a slight touch of mineral character that is intertwined with the hops and this beer almost starts to presents itself a bit musty. Taste is roasty grain bitterness mixed with black coffee and a nice alcohol presence that warms the mouth and can be felt going all the way down when swallowed. Little bit of hops are evident in the finish that is a bitterness entensified by the roasted malt character. Lingering flavors of the dark malt are left in the mouth coupled with the alcohol which leaves tastes of chocolate and coffee lingering long after each sip. There is a medium feel with this beer and a modest amount of carbonation.

It is thin in the center, but thick and clinging to the sides at its edge. There is a healthy amount of clinging and rising carbonation. They are working their way through the foam, causing a few bubbles to appear on top. It has a bitter, roasted dark chocolate aroma. It smells a lot like fresh coffee beans. The flavor has tons of coffee bitterness throughout. There is some sweet malt flavor in the back that provides a great base. I don't have much else to say about the flavor, other than the simplicity of my review doesn't do the taste justice. This is a medium bodied stout. It leaves a good coat behind that is sticky but not overly sweet. In fact, it's mostly bitter. I find it to be a pretty drinkable coffee stout. I'm not a coffee drinker, and though the coffee flavor is strong, it isn't too bad. This beer is recommended.","ToasterChef","Apr 29, 2010"

Though their activities remain mostly unknown (classified?), they're definitely drinking some dark roast, to the point that Matt Murdock hisself wouldn't be able to pick out much of anything else though some molasses and chocolate might penetrate those superhuman nostrils. From beneath their posts bursts forth such roasted coffee flavors as to expect a green and white label on the bottle. The bitterness runs a bit high, but not so much as to cause a cringe. The molasses and chocolate are just as discriminated against as before (when will we come to our senses?), but still make their voices heard amidst the throngs of beans, keeping the proceedings from breaking out in a caffeine-fueled riot. The crowd is not too thick, though it still ain't easy to push your way to the back; the members are pretty somber; and, despite the numbers, they're able to move around as a unit pretty easily.

This is velvety, smooth, and creamy. Just yum in my mouth. I could easily drink a handful of these with ease and then pray i didn't pay for the alcohol content after.

We sometimes refer to stouts as having some coffee like flavors, but in comparison to this beer, most of the porters and stouts that claim the coffee mantle are just pale imitators. This is the reigning champ of coffee beers if there ever was such a thing. The beer is quite creamy and smooth as well.

For such an outrageous beer, this one is wonderfully balanced. Extraordinary body on this one, just very full and coating, without being syrupy and sticky. Creamy and velvety. Tremendous. Drinkability is great, especially considering the ABV. I could slug this down, though I want it to last for quite a while. I guess the closest thing I could liken this brew to is an amped up Founders Breakfast Stout. The finesse in this brew, however, is far superior to FBS (in spite of FBS's greatness).

Gives off a roasted coffee smell, toffee, vanilla, chocolate, and hints of dark fruits (prune, raisin). There is some smoke in the nose as well with some woody earthy olive notes. It was a delicious first sip, with deep chocolate and coffee flavors that are beautifully subtle. Smooth roasty flavors of coffee merge into a dark chocolate finish with a comforting warm alcohol finish that lingers. The flavor plays well with a rolling sweet throughout going from roasty to bitter coffee to sweet booming once more. This is a very good beer. It is rich and complex, subtle yet very bold when all the aspects of alcohol, coffee and chocolate combine in a delicious harmony. It has a slick mouthfeel, chewy, full bodied and leaves a stick on the mouth with residual warmth relative to a barrel aged beer.","Lldeegan","Jan 01, 2010"

Taste is quite amazing, big coffee taste obviously, a little bit of chocolate and vanilla. Alcohol is pretty much undetectable, the intense flavors cover it up very well. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and more or less perfect. Founders Breakfast Stout blew my mind when I first had it, this is very similar so it didn't have the same effect.

More espresso shows up in the taste with some roasted malt character and burnt dark chocolate. Not as complex as I'd hoped and the mouthfeel is that of a nitro can. The feel was medium thick, but thin on flavor and low on bubbles. Almost like it was sitting out open for a few hours.

Smell is of strong coffee with slight hints of chocolate and roasted malts. Alcohol sits at 9.5% giving it a bit of a kick but worth it all the while. Flavor is excellent with the coffee standing out tremendously but very well balanced with the other ingredients. I would have to say this is the best beer provided by Dieu Du Ciel and have drank it several times and hope there are many more to come. I revisit it regularly and have several in the basement aging just to see if it develops to be anything different. Can't wait to see what comes of it if anything.

Towards the end of the taste is a bitter bite from both the alcohol and the bean flavor. There may be just a bit of dark ripe fruits, but not as I've tasted in other RIS's.

Incredible coffee aromas waft from the beer with definite notes of chocolate and a roasty nuttiness that lets the drinker know this beer packs a flavour punch. Taste is deliciously roasted coffee-forward with rich dark chocolate undertones, subtle dark fruit and caramel (I get a bit of maple sugar in there too). Mouthfeel is very rich and ridiculously creamy, mouthcoating and smooth with a spicy, roasty kick on the finish and linger. This beer is very heavy.

Closer sniff is all coffee/espresso and roast. On to the taste. The first hit is all coffee. Very strong coffee...then as it moves to the back of the palate, more of the bitter chocolate tones come through. There's definitely a taste of alcohol and it's very bitter on the finish, but not overwhelming.

Dark roasted malts ride out the whole experience. Char and burnt malt give some bitterness. Blackberry and ainse oil intermingle nicely. Again, with some heavily roasted coffee flavor. Nice oily texture. Alcoholic presence is minimal and integrates nicely with the bold flavors. Body could use a boost, but that's a very minor "imperfection".

Has only a faint mist of head pierced by slicks of the beer underneath. The smell is of freshly poured cappuccino with generous amounts of cocoa powder combined with a bit of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is silk smoothness; not as thick or syrupy as some impys can get. The taste delivers on the strong preliminaries: pure mocha bliss. Just when you think that the bold espresso lead-in is going to be overwhelming, the sweetness of creme brulee (and a bit of banana bread) comes in to provide a bit of restraint. The sweetness then fades, leaving a lingering coffee aftertaste that is strong but not overly charred. I'll try to cellar a couple of these, but I must say this tastes fantastic fresh, leaving very little room for improvement. Should pair quite well with medium dark chocolate, smoked ham and gouda.","chicagobeerriot","Jun 28, 2009"

Some chocolate and vanilla, but dominated by the coffee. Viscous mouthfeel with a long, long finish. Powerful taste, possibly one of the strongest tasting stouts I've ever had. Bold roasted coffee and espressso throughout. Its laid on really heavy, like the blackest, most bitter coffee out there. The chocolate is not a reprieve. Dark and baker's variety. Just a bitter, bitter stout. Light vanilla and caramel flavors pop up periodically, as does a fuggels-like hop bite. Amazingly, this beer does the bitterness while avoiding the dreaded soy-sauce taste. The 9%+ is masked completely. Great beer.","magictrokini","Jun 26, 2009"

The coffee is definately there, the dark chocolate too, but that sweetness has to contend a little bit too hard with the bitter burnt tastes for my liking. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, but not as smooth as say, Speedway or Ten Fidy. This is a sipper for me, and not a repeat purchase.

Thin but sticky lace, a fair bit of sediment is left in the bottle. The aroma jumps right out of the glass with rich molasses, tree bark, cloves, dark chocolate, burnt coffee. Taste features a bit of hoppy astingency that is well under control, black coffee, bakers chocolate with an aftertaste that lingers; bitter notes, dry brazil nut texture and mouthfeel.

The taste is very boozy up front but as the beer warms it subsides and is virtually undetectable. Deep roasted malts, with espresso flavoring hit the taste buds first. There is brown sugar, dark chocolate and a dry roastiness that borders on burnt. The finish has a light hop bitterness with some fruitiness that is perhaps slight black cherries.

4.72,7.3,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Immediately after cracking the bottle, I got a big whiff of rich bitter coffee.  It looked awesome after being poured into the glass; pitch black body (honestly, light could not escape this) with a medium tan coloured head that gave off lots of coffee aromas and maybe a bit of alcohol. The beer tasted amazing.  Lots of espresso right upfront, then some alcohol warmth and a bit of sweetness from the malts.  Left with a pleasant bitter coffee aftertaste that forced me to keep sipping.  Only small sips though, the amount of flavour in every little gulp was incredible. Of the few I've tried, this is by far the best coffee stout I've had.","notdan","May 18, 2009"

The small brown head fades at first but comes back to maintain a nice thin frothy layer on top of the beer. The aroma is a first sweet dark and roasted malt that quickly gives way to rich oily coffee. There is just a hint of damp, stale coffee as well. Like the aroma, the flavor leads with sweet chocolatey dark malt but it quickly gives way to strong dark coffee. The crystal sweetness comes through again in the finish, but rich coffee lingers in the finish. There is just enough bitterness from the coffee and hops combined but no hop flavor to speak of. The alcohol is hidden but the sweetness shows the beer's strength and makes it a sipper for sure.","ericj551","May 11, 2009"

It's a bit harsh to start but after thirty minutes or so, it mellows into a simply sweet and stale coffee aroma. A bit sweet on the tongue, but with an over-roasted and vegetal coffee character, that ends on an alcoholic and slightly burnt bitterness. Syrupy but also a little thin. I don't get this one. tastes like they burnt the coffee beans and then let the coffee sit out overnight before adding it to the beer. Honestly hard to finish this one.","bulletrain76","May 11, 2009"

Tastes like cappucino, dark chocolate, etc.. not super strong flavor like KBS, though definitely very good. It does have an organic, natural quality to it. Bitter black coffee at end of the sip.

It became much richer and creamier as it warmed, and the alcohol notes subsided. It was oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was a very strong beer that's definitely meant for sipping. It had a very nice coffee flavor, but was nearly overwhelming.

Just a hint of hops to help cut through all the gobbledegook. Nice and creamy, not the biggest, awesomest mouthfeel, but enough to carry the flavors forward. I don't like to give 5s easily for any aspect, this is right on the cusp, but the flavor is concentrated enough, yet carries enough else to it that it warrants it, barely.

It's in a bottle, but the date mark is not informative enough for me to be able to announce her age;) This Coffee Stout pours dark dark like motor oil, but not so thick; it's dark as night as a whole, but really thin, so when it's held up to a bright light, it's difficult to recognize how dark it is because it appears to be a darker nut brown. It hit my mouth with a rather lite/bubbly booze reinforced warm Imperial feel. The decent and rather thick head dissipated quickly to not hardly a trace being left on top and nearly no lacing either. Huh...odd I think, but hey...it's a double stout pushing the 10% mark, so I suppose that it should be expected. Quite frankly I'm a bit embarrassed to say that there's not enough coffee coming out in this one, rather a chocolaty alcohol. Most certainly belongs with the bitter ones which lingers on and on.

Has a chocolate malt aroma with hints of dark fruit and coffee. Just a hint of alcohol is detected. Malt flavor up front. Chocolate and slightly fruity. The coffee does not come into play until the finish. This coffee stout is much more balanced than other coffee infused beers. A little warmth from the alcohol in the finish. Big body with low carbonation. Creamy and a good texture overall. I enjoyed this beer. The high ABV and high cost limits the amount I drink of this beer. Not the big coffee beer I was expecting but a balanced stout with fresh coffee flavor. This is a good stout with coffee flavors, not coffee with some beer flavor.","morimech","Mar 15, 2009"
4.31,-2,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Out of a bottle this beer was a true, opaque black color. The tan head was three fingers thick and retained nicely as a cap that became rocky after a while leaving excellent curtains of lacing all the way down. The aroma smelled strongly of fresh coffee, bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. The flavors were rich and delicious. I tasted hints of chocolate malt sweetness first then lots of deep, rich coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, espresso and hints of pipe tobacco. The bitterness was distinct but not biting and the finish lingered pleasantly on my tongue. Notably acidic, especially because of the coffee, but this helped cut through the thicker body of the beer. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation soft and the body full. I thought this was excellent, like drinking a cup of fresh brewed coffee that just happened to be alcoholic and served chilled. If you like coffee stouts like I do you cannot miss this.","thekevlarkid","Mar 15, 2009"

Slight hop bitterness, and I am suspecting that some of those hops are contributing to the citric flavors as well. Finishes sweet and sugary, doesn't quite get to the point of being cloying. Alcohol is noticeable and is accompanied by the same hints of dark fruits as in the nose. The alcohol adds richness to this similar to the way rum adds richness to tiramisu. Definitely a sipper.","NCBeernut","Mar 12, 2009"

The aroma is prominent coffee, malt, some hints of chocolate and an occasional whiff of sweet cream and butterscotch. Taste produces initial sweetness, the coffee is immediately apparent. This is quite complex with bittersweet bursts of taste weaved in between syrupy malt. This reminds me of Founders Breakfast Stout with espresso and some syrup. The last taste is a bit on the bitter side with a strong alcohol warming. This is thick and chewy just like I enjoy em. For me mouthfeel is hard to describe but when I taste them I know them. Drinkability is great for what this is but I'm afraid I am 1-2 and done for this one. This here is a tremendous offering but not at all sessionable.","jstilwell","Mar 04, 2009"

Ultimately big strong coffee flavored beers with the added big ABV make this a little less than drinkable for me.

Very big roasted coffee bean flavor hits hard and often right at the bell. Bitter sweet chocolate makes its presence known throughout with a touch of raisins in the end. Exceptional feel, thick and chewy, smoooth yet has a light prickly carbonation that breaks up the body. Finishes bitter from the strong roasted coffee flavor, alcohol is well hidden.

I've been enjoying several coffee stouts as of late, and this one has one of, if not THE best coffee noses I've come across so far. The aroma is all espresso back up by some light chocolate, lots of roasty notes and some alcohol. Upon my first taste, my first words were, "Oh My God!" This beer is rich in complex coffee goodness. It tastes exactly like those chocolate covered espresso bean treats. Flavor weaves in and out of chocolaty goodness and strong, bitter roasted coffee. This is easily the best coffee stout I've ever tasted. It's roasty, toasty, chocolaty, coffee goodness that just doesn't stop. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, incredibly smooth despite the large amounts of coffee and the bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden and alcohol is barely noticeable. It's just way too easy to drink for it's strength in flavor and alcohol, which is dangerous considering the ABV. This beer is just fantastic. I'm glad I picked up two bottles, as one will surely makes it's way into the cellar area of my basement. Coffee stouts, or any stout for that matter, just don't get any better than this.

Fascinating taste: roasted coffee loud and clear (but that was expected and isn't necessarily an endorsement), dark chocolate truffles, smoke and charry bitterness - I love it. Full-bodied but perfectly carbonated. For 4 dollars for an 11.5 oz bottle I was hoping for this kind of quality and I'm relieved that it delivered.

3.85,-12.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"This one pours out black with a giant, sticky brown head. The head falls back slowly, and is gone by the time you finish. You get decent lacing, as much as is expected from bottle-conditioned beers. The smell is coffee, but its not quite as coffee rich as some other similarly styled beers. You get a note of the roasted flavor, like the soy sauce flavor that accompanies the darkest of malts. The taste is really great. The backbone for many coffee beers is usually a bit sweeter, but this one is dark and roasty. Very interesting. You get the bitterness shining through, but there's also a very silky feeling to it. I'm a bit afraid that without the coffee you would get all soy sauce without the saltiness. But it's a flavor that I enjoy (though I doubt most other people would actually like it). You get quite a complex burst of flavors, that make you want to sit around and think about it. There's coffee and bittersweet malts, and the roasted flavors, all with a kick of silkiness, and you always want the next drink. I don't think this is as good as some other coffee stouts, but it's still good. I can't say I would buy cases of this and continue drinking it (which is quite normal for in my case most of the stronger stouts), but the likelihood of me finding it over and over again is rare enough that I would probably buy it if I see it again.","taylorhamrick","Dec 22, 2008"

The roasted malts add a nice maltbiterness and some chocolate notes. There is little carbonation, which is good too. Mouthfeel is superb, smooth and creamy. I wonder how they do that. The coffee never gets sharp or astringent and unlike my own coffee beers, it's aftertaste is smooth.

4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I remember when this beer began to buzz around the beer circuit a few years back. I saw it on the shelves a few years back and I was surprised to see it priced at $19.99 for a small bottle. Well, here it is, years later, and greater distribution provided me with a more reasonably priced bottle. I poured this into my Delirium snifter and the midnight black body formed a mocha colored head of medium sized carbonation. The body is totally opaque and the head provides wonderful lacing. Heavy carbonation lines the rim of the glass. The aroma is wonderfully expressive with massive espresso and cocoa bean notes. The sweetness is fresh ground coffee fills the nostrils and provides a wonderful entry point to the taste. There a remnants of malted milk balls that add anticipation. I am not sure if it is the odd or perfect. Just one of those aromas that seem familiar, yet so unique. The taste is filled with coffee and roasted malts. A big dose of bittering hops adds a wonderful balance of bitterness to the heavy malt body. The high abv is hardly noticeable although it adds a slight warmth to the mouthfeel. The body is rich yet thinned out and dried by the high carbonation. As this beer warms up, the delicate flavors open up a bit more and the sweetness comes out. This is a wonderful beer that is worth the hype. Not your everyday beer, but definitely one that should take up some space in your cellar.","ALESwhatCURESya","Sep 30, 2008"

4.25,-3.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Picked up a couple of bottles in Maine when I was there, JUST before they became available in Georgia. Oh well. Poured black with a healthy dark tan head that settled to a cap. Some lacing as well. Nice aroma of ground coffee in the nose, as well as a touch of dark fruit. Taste is similar- lots of ground coffee, some dark fruit, and a tiny bit of molasses sweetness. Overall, though, this is more bitter than sweet, and much more like black coffee than some with cream. That is unfortunate, because I really like the coffee stouts with a touch of creaminess to round out the coffee bitterness and acidity, and because the quality of the coffee used in coffee stouts, while often good is not always absolutely top notch. I'll drink my coffee black if it is something like Batdorf and Bronson Sumatra Tarwar, but if it is something less robust and more acidic, I like a little cream. Perhaps it is that the freshness of the aromatics in coffee are even more fleeting than those in hops, and that almost no one gets it just right and captures the balance and complexity of a really great cup of coffee in a stout. Those that do tend to have a creamy finish and more noticeable malt than this one has, or to have a winey complexity that goes beyond just "dark fruit". This is good, but for me it is not the alpha and omega of coffee stouts. Mouthfeel is substantial, but overall this brew is a bit too one dimensional- though it does have power. It also nicely disguises the alcohol.","Georgiabeer","Aug 05, 2008"

Aroma: notes of coffee, rum, port, roast malt, with hazelnut and dark chocolate as it warms. Flavour: strong coffee flavour, complemented by a nicely balanced sweetness. Plenty of dark roasty bite, but not unpleasantly astringent. Finishes with plenty of dark chocolate nuttiness. Port. For a beer this strong, it hides its alcohol well. Until it warms up, I would never have put this beer at 9.5. Not at all harsh, even when the alcohol starts to come out. Chocolate milkshake mouthfeel. Just enough carbonation to enliven it.

Lace sticks to the sides of the glass like boil over foam on the sides of a brew kettle. Head dissipates down to swirls and contrails of bubbles. The aroma is of sweet malts and iced Sumatra coffee; it's like mixing sweet wort with your morning brew then throwing it in the fridge to enjoy once it's cooled. The taste is like the aroma, sweet coffee with bitter hints of espresso. I pick up very faint chocolate flavor, but for only a split second then it evaporates away like somebody threw a quad shot of espresso at an ethereal apparition. This is outstandingly well balanced between the caramelized sugar flavor & coffee, with the coffee riding out the taste buds for an outstanding aftertaste. Wow, it's hard to imagine that there's any alcohol in this brew, let alone 9.5%. This is one of the smoothest drinking stouts that I've had, and that's helped with a nice medium mouthfeel and light effervescent carbonation that sticks around till the end.

4.1,-6.8,4,4,3.5,5,5,"I see why this beer is so highly regarded! It has a very nice thick rich sweetness that mingles with the coffee but is never overrun by it. The problem with large coffee beers, in my experience, is that they tend to become Starbucks drinks. This one teeters near that edge but doesn't fall over it, which is impressive. The malts are incredibly thick and rich, the mouthfeel is just luscious. There is a nice sweet malt backbone providing a bit of dark chocolate that mingles with the nice coffee flavors to produce a fine drink. The alcohol helps the acidic coffee finish dry the very sweet beer out, allowing for the next sip. A very nice concoction that, despite everything, is fairly straightforward. There is a slight note of oxidation in the bottle, which possibly suggests that it is a bit older, but the liquor store I bought it at is known for its quality control so I am forced to conclude that it is the brewer's fault. A very good beer, though ultimately a little one-dimensional.","shbobdb","Jul 12, 2008"

It has a nice coffee infused earthiness that lends itself nicely with the black malts. It's quite dry and bitter. The taste is good. It's smooth, but with a dry earthy finish. The coffee and patent malts create a very bitter flavor that would be a little easier to swallow with some chocolate malts. The mouthfeel is decent. It's a full bodied beer, but I would have liked a bit more body. It seems a little thin for a BIG beer. This is a very tastey beer. I love that Canada is brewing some world class craft beers.

Plenty of complex aromas here with deep roasted malts and burnt wood up front, roasted almonds, cigar smoke and dark chocolates in the middle, and some caramel and a bit of breadiness in the back. The taste is incredibly smooth yet complex and fulfilling with big roasted malts up front that are mixed in with dark and sweet chocolates, coffee, some dark fruits, and a sweet and spicy middle. The palate is left with a nice lingering essence of hops and maybe a slight bit of cream for the coffee. Mouth-feel is full bodied yet drinkable despite the alcohol content and somewhat crisp at times despite the aforementioned creamy quality.

This is certainly a drinkable beer, but if I'm in the midst of a night of fine beer sampling, I don't know if I wouldn't want to try something else instead of having another go at this.

Aroma is roasted coffee with some flowery hops distant in the background. Taste is heavy on the coffee, with some mocha hiding in there as well. A roasted bitterness consumes your mouth after each sip. Carbonation is a bit high for the style, but lends to a creaminess that offsets the bitter coffee.

The hops come out and linger after the initial coffee and roast flavors subside. I can feel the warmth of the etoh only slightly. A little syrupy on the tongue but can still feel the mild carbonation. Has a bit of a bitter bite.

Peche Mortel leaves a sweet, bitter coffee aftertaste in its wake, although the body is a touch on the over-carbonated side.

The alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's rich and silky with average carbonation. It's also very smooth, which along with the taste makes the drinkability very good.

Fresh dark roast with loads of bittering hops, vanilla, dry, bitter dark chocolate, some smoke. Bitter with long lived coffee aftertaste. Creamy, and very drinkable considering the ABV.

The java took centerstage and really ran the show, the beer provided all the background of black roasted grains and a hits of dry cocoa. I do think this beer is a bit over-rated.

There's a tiny bit of lactose in the nose as well that fits in perfectly. I have a feeling this is about to get even better. Taste begins with smokey coffee and sweet caramel malt with a booze-like sting. More chocolate, more espresso, and some dark fruits as well. Aftertaste is sweet syrupy molasses with a slight alcohol burn. Just a big bold coffee beer with lots of underlying complex flavors.

Some mild herbaceous hop notes follow but mainly I'm getting dark bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. Flavors break through with strong filtered coffee blended with whipped cream, truly a another great breakfast beer. Strong dark bitter chocolate flavor but tastes like coffee note much like a Bell's Java Stout or Founder's Breakfast Stout. That flavor comes off a bit one dimensional but it's okay with me I'm enjoying it, not much alcohol burn very well hidden. Not much noticeable hop notes either, but the dark chocolate and coffee bitterness reign supreme. Mouthfeel is full bodied soft even carbonation quite silky on the palate. Drinkability is challenging due to the complexity and rich chocolate and robust coffee flavors, not much alcohol noticeable but I guess that's the part that could get you.

Roasted coco beans are rich and stay chocolatey on the back of tongue long after each swallow. An ever so slight bitterness does arrise twords the end of the palate, but this just adds to the balance. Some winey dark fruits even show there face as the beer warms a bit.

Nose- all about the coffee so far. Really nice roast- not too dark. First sip- wow what a mouthfeel. Just glides on down. Really unique- the particular coffee used along with the drak malts imparts a sharp bitterness/burntness to it. A much darker burnt roasting than the nose suggests. At the same time, there is a touch of sweetness to the malts. very complex brew and commands attention! Very drying in the finish.

Coffee and roasted malts up front are soon followed by a strong sweet cola presence in the taste. A soft and subtle chocolate sweetness in the background of the medium body, finishing with a tangy roastiness that dwells into the somewhat dry aftertaste. Sweet cola seems to dominate the taste, hard to belive the alcohol is 9 percent as it is fairly non evident.

The aroma was coffee, coffee, coffee with a good hint of the alcohol within. The flavor has been described by others as ice coffee and I'd agree. Mouthfeel nice and solid. To be fair, I'm not a coffee drinker and generally don't like things with a lot of coffee flavor so the taste and drinkability take some hits for that.

It is possibly the most beautiful stout I have yet encountered: jet black, with a quarter inch of dense tan head. After taking an hour to eat dinner and review my first three samples, the head did not budge one millimeter, and it retained for the additional half-hour it took to consume and review this beer - I've rarely seen such head retention, especially in a brew of this strength. The aroma is packed with espresso, hot chocolate, and roasted malts - reminiscent of kahlua mixed with creme de cacao. There is a huge espresso presence on the palate with notes of chocolate/creme de cacao, apple?, green hops, and an assertive bitterness on top of a thick, incredibly smooth, drying, almost powdery body that leaves a prolonged finish, lasting until it is washed away when "Oaked, Smoked, and Ruined" with the Bros. and other BAs at the Deep Ellum.

Waking up to the perfect blend of coffee with some vanilla whipping on top. That's what this beer is; don't let it fool you, there is a lot of coffee, but this is no simple beer for simple-minded folk.

Three was not a shred of light getting through this beer...black as night. Smell was intense with coffee aromas dominating and hints of chocolate, espresso and whiskey hiding in there somewhere. The coffee was even stronger upon tasting...similar to Founder's Breakfast Stout except with more coffee if you can imagine that. Not cheap instant coffee mind you, but intoxicating Columbian coffee that will leave its presence with you for a while after finishing. As it warmed up a bit, some of the chocolate characters really made themselves known, offsetting the coffee ever so slightly. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and a tad lighter then I had anticipated, but the big flavors made up for it completely. One of my favorite things about this beer was the 9% alcohol...not weak by any means, but strong enough to make its presence known. Me being somebody who enjoys a good cup of coffee, I could drink this beer often without feeling too intimidated by the big tastes. Final verdict is that this is an exceptional beer. It might not appeal so much to people who don't like a cup o joe every now and again, but even so, its still a beer that is worth sampling for the complexities alone. It may be a bit pricy if you find it in your area at $16, but I can say that I'de pick it up again and save it for a special occasion. It is unique, rich, interesting and damn tasty.

Flavor shows off notes of dry roasted cocoa and a huge wallop of bitter Italian coffee beans. Blackened espresso. Yow. There's a lingering hop bitterness, but the coffee/espresso flavor brings all the bitterness you'll need. Sharp astringency on the tongue leads to a creamy smoothness that gradually thins out.

Smells woody coffeeish (a little bit like french roast coffee) and vanilla. A hint of something...not quite terpentine, but in that line. In context with the other flavors, it's not a negative, it's interesting. Tastes rich coffee, but also a really rich chocolate. Like crunching on a couple coffee beans while holding a mouth full of sweet dark chocolate. There is a bitter from the coffee and/or roasted barley, but the wet sweet of the chocolate counters it to the point that the aftertaste leaves my mouth watering for more candy. Too bad my wife wasn't around when I cracked open this one...she would have loved it. I've only had one glass (I shared the bomber with absolutesites), but it's quite filling. Alcohol burn is barely noticable during the swallow, as it mixes with the coffee bitter that is covered by the chocolate. Very intense flavors, but only flavors of coffee and chocolate...not much else. Considering the intensity of the flavors, I would have expected the body to be more than medium. Also in the mouthfeel, I should note the aftertaste almost felt like there were tiny pulverized bits of roast floating around in the chocolatey nectar that hung on my tongue. Carbonation is moderate and the head has hung around until the very end. Both the smell and taste are very enticing and I kept putting the glass to my mouth immediately after drawing it away from the last sip. This could become a banned substance someday.","mentor","Jul 15, 2005"

The taste is immediately that of chocolate malt and coffee beans fading into cherry tart on the back of the tongue but the taste of coffee never really surrenders. A swig is pretty silky on the tongue with a mat of light carbonation raised as it passes into the throat.

The heavy coffee aroma allows you to breath it in as you drink the beer. The coffee is followed quickly by a tangy citrus hop character, then the roast malt, and finally some cherry chocolate on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that retains for a while.

Sorta great European coffeehouse meets low earthiness. Taste for me was a total espresso experience, some astringency, dark roastiness, again cocoa nibs.
