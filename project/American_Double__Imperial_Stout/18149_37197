This is a big coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruit, dry finishing stout. Very drinkable for 11%. Definitely going to pick up  a few bottles to cellar.

It drives itself to the brink of being too sweet, but is pulled back by smoke and fire in the form of roasted malt and alcohol. It's an overall sensation of being so good it's bad--a dangerous pleasure...forbidden fruit, indeed. In the end, it was almost too much to take, but who doesn't like a little walk on the wild side?","BethanyB","Nov 23, 2014"

This Lost Abbey is doing a great job at my only of the beer categories (I'm allergic to most beers but stouts get by passably).  My wife's a completely different catagory of beer drinker than me and she swears by Lost Abbey's other offerings as much as I like this stout.  Serpent's Tail  warms well, I want it warm enough so the flavors expand horizontally and beneath the tongue... at these warmer temperatures, the viscera of the beer really gets turned inside out: the smokiness moves your intestines, you feel fumigations of sweet fruits and the strong  alcohol burn.  Very rich stout with mellow carbonation.  Drink it slowly enough to last a three hour computer session and the flavors keep on unfolding as the imperial burn intensifies.  One time I was having one of their bottles and my wife kissed me and she thought I'd been smoking and drinking odd brews with shamans in Peru because of my breath.  That's how deep the fermentation goes.  Keep it up Lost Abbey.","ctboom","Sep 27, 2014"

4.42,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2500th review! 750 ml bottle into snifter, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, smoke, light char, molasses, raisin, plum, light licorice, and roast/smokey earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and light-moderate fruitiness; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, smoke, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, light licorice, herbal, and roast/smokey earthiness. Good amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, smoke, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, light licorice, herbal, and roast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of intense dark/roasted malt, light-moderate fruitiness, and light earthy hop flavors; with an awesome roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and moderately slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible imperial stout! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of intense dark/roasted malt, light-moderate fruitiness, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An extremely outstanding offering.","superspak","Aug 08, 2014"

Always wanted it, but could never find it. This beer does not shit the bed. I am increasingly becoming more and more of a fan of The Lost Abbey. Easily one of the best craft breweries out of the US. Rich, complex and hearty. The kind of beer Vikings would have lapped up before terrorizing a small village. Definitely pick this up if you run into it.","Agent1","Jun 01, 2013"

The malts mesh perfectly. There is just enough hops to give it that dark chocolate/dark coffee bitterness. It's ridiculously drinkable for such a strong beer.

I think the age I opened my bottle is pretty close to optimal. The booze is not overwhelming and definitely feels mellowed, but the flavors don't feel muted. I definitely might get this again for the cellar. Very solid. I definitely would like to see a barrel aged variant of this beer available.","Gosox8787","Oct 01, 2012"

One of the most remarkable aspects is how drinkable the beer is for being 11% ABV. I’m really glad I got to try this one. This is going to be a fun night polishing off a 750 mL bottle myself.

3.91,-7.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Lost Abbey Serpent's Stout pours an intimidating black. The three or so fingers of cocoa colored foam that crowns the beer just sits there like some kind of mousse. Head retention is great, and the head leaves plenty of lacing in its wake. The nose doesn't really leap out the glass, but there are some chocolate and licorice aromas present, the former slightly more than the ltter. . The first thing that comes to mind when sipping on the beer is a chocolate milk shake. There's a fairly strong anise flavor, as well as some overly roasty grain. I don't mind those as supplementary/background notes, but thy're just a tad too present for me to truly love the flavor profile. The body here is nice and chewy, with a suitably understated carbonation. Serpent's Stout is far from an attention getting stout in terms of quality, but there are certainly plenty of less noteworthy ones in the market as well.","axeman9182","May 18, 2012"

The flavor follows suit with a rich and full bodied flavor: Roast upfront with hints of molasses and oak, after wards the vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit and malty sweetness are present to provide a well balanced beer. Mildly bitter. Finishes rich with a linger roast and light bourbon vanilla on the tongue. Very good. Full bodied and well carbonated. Creamy and smooth. Overall, this is a treat.

It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. This one was very booze forward without a doubt, so drink with caution. However, this mellows out as it reaches room temperature. Had a very nice roastiness and subtle bitterness to help balanced out the brew.

3.94,-6.9,3,4,4.5,3,3.5,"With barely a pop from the cork (Lost Abbey lives up to the rumors again) the beer flows forth into the glass looking very demonic indeed. Luckily this beer isnt flat, I suspect its just naturally very lowly carbonated. It supports a small dark brown head that fades quickly. The aroma is dominated by assertive alcohol. Plenty of chocolate comes out to give this a nice decadence. There is a woodsy, almost musty yeast aroma. If I am correct, I believe this beer uses Brett in some quantity. The more detailed you get into investigating the aroma you will find lots of chocolate covered raisins and figs with a dash of licorice. The taste is right in line with the aroma. It does, however, bring more sweet chocolate covered fruits than the bouquet does. That is a good thing for someone like me. The sweetness approaches the realm of a dessert beer but is never over the top. Alcohol is no slouch but its managed buy licorice, espresso roast, figgy fruit, and worn leather. A distinct yeasty set of flavors bring on flavors of old wood. Carbonation is much higher on the palate than you would expect. This hurts the overall feel of the body, disguising it as less full than it may really be.","MbpBugeye","Jan 19, 2011"

The beer is more on the dry side, without any of the creamy or thick characteristics of other stouts, but not quite a dry stout, either. The beer has aftertastes of nut and spice (red pepper and coriander??), with a slightly sour finish. Decent beer.","GarthDanielson","Dec 28, 2010"

The carbonation that is there begins to dissipate and this becomes a sticky black concoction that only the purest of men can resist. This isn't the most drinkable beer, as the booze certainly emerges more as this warms. A beer full of evil and good, much like the battle in the garden it gets its name from.

The beer itself feels great in your mouth, definitely one to let roll over your tongue and breathe in. The beer is rather viscous, almost syrupy, and very decadent and sweet. Strong notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and raisins. Serpent's Stout becomes truly exceptional when you factor in how drinkable it is, as normally something this syrupy and sweet is hard to put down, especially with as much alcohol as is present (11%ABV), but I had this 750ml all to myself and would have been happy to have another.","msmezher","Sep 15, 2010"

A faint hint of alcohol is also detected. This is one of the nicest smells I have noticed on an imperial stout. The taste is full of bitter roasting and coffee flavors; right up my alley. The belgian yeast works nicely to smooth out the harsh roasted flavors. There is a noticeable alcohol burn that I am okay with, but keeps it from being outstanding.

Hardly any head in formed, though a small colony of brown bubbles attempts a settlement, only to end up like Roanoke. The nose comprises heavily roasted malts, chocolate syrup, molasses, and a heapin' helpin' o' grain alcohol. The taste follows closely, adding force to the chocolate (making it closer to chocolate syrup) and a fairly strong vein of bitterness. The alcohol now expresses itself as a steady burn, just not too hot o' one. The body is thick and heavy, with very little carbonation and a smooth yet chewy feel.

The further I get into the bottle, the more I'm convinced that it had more of a hop presence in its youth. I need to try a fresh bottle. The only thing it overtly needs today is more body.

It leaves a little lacing, but with the drinking speed I had with this, the head didn't have a chance of making it to the finish. Very nice looking though. The smell is mostly raisins, burnt bread, a little roasted malt, some chocolate, with a hint of booze. Smells good. The taste is really interesting. Comes out very sticky, raisins, overripe plums, dark and sweet, but dried out a bit through fermentation. There's nutty grainy bread, and maybe a taste of earthiness. It's very dense, but the booze is immediately present. Very slow drinking. Actually, the carbonation was nice and light at the start, but by the end, there was nothing, just beer and the burn of some alcohol. Very strong in the flavor department, which makes it nice, but any small glaring weakness is intensified by the alcohol, and the intensity of flavors may overwhelm at points. But overall, a very good beer. I just have to say that to call this drinkable, would be a lie, a huge lie, this took me something like 3 or 4 hours, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it all throughout.","taylorhamrick","Dec 13, 2009"

The beer poured out of the bottle with a pitch-black hue and had a nice tan head that left lasting foam. The aroma had some sweet coffee and fruity yeast notes. The flavor was on the fruity side with lower bitterness and lots of dark chocolate. It was more sweet up front but faded into a darker chocolate finish.

4.53,7.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Pours thick, murky syrupy dark brown, almost black. Perky tan head, prototypical big stout lacing and appearance. Smell is baker's chocolate, a bit of coffee, a lot of roastedness. Again, prototypical big stout smell. Taste is absolutely mellifluent, big emphasis on the semi-sweet chocolate. A bit of coffee in there, but that along with a decent but not huge roasted component serve to underscore the main flavor. Also a bit of vanilla, a bit of anise, and almost like an oak-aged edge to it, which just basically reinforces the depth of flavor. Bit of bourboney-boozey kick, but not in a biting way at all, just get some of that flavor. I really want to give this a 5 for taste, just can't bring myself to do it. Mouthfeel shines, this beer is super creamy, just rolls off the tongue, and the flavor lingers just long enough on the palate for a roasty chocolatey taste without being cloying. It really helps to reinforce everything else going on. Average to low carbonation, sludgey heavy body, both very fitting and appropriate to style / what brewer was going for. Drinkability is superb, it's a huge 10%+ beer that goes down like nobody's business, a super easy drink. This is a fantastic huge stout, and my favorite LA beer to date. No matter the publicity they are getting as of late, this beer is fantastic, not to be missed next time around. I'm sure as hell going to stock up!","damienblack","Apr 20, 2009"

Sweet chocolately smell lets you know that you're in for a treat. Some coffee mixed in the smell too, but mostly sweet chocolate. The chocolate dominates the front end of the flavor. The coffee comes through much more in the taste. Also some alcohol in the flavor, but not too hot; it blends nicely. You won't confuse this beer for Ten Fidy. Mouthfeel is thinner than a lot of imperial stouts, although not too thin. Carbonation is fine. Drinkability is good, I actually had to slow down a bit to give it a chance to warm up.

Alc was easily detectable which wasn't a bad thing, I felt like it hit the mood very well for me. Also I was just relived to be drinking this other then the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti that I had the other night. A much needed break!

The flavors are a great mix of darkly toasted bread crust with semi-dark chocolate. The aroma has similar roasted grains, and black toast. This beer is made more drinkable by the lack of excess residual sugars and that pays off additionally with a dry, cocoa finish that balances an earlier chocolate sweetness. Yum.

Sometimes it resembles chocolate powder, other times dark chocolate cake, and even chocolate cheesecake at one point. The dark fruit (raspberries and strawberries come to mind) also sits in the background to complement everything else. Mouthfeel is perhaps a tad light, but still very good.

A seductive sweet chocolate with roast scents coming through. Alcohol is evident but not overpowering. Taste is great. Much more roast flavors coming through. At times, almost a hint of smoke. Very rich coffee flavors that blend with sweet flavors of chocolate. Similar to sweetened coffee. Just a big of funk added and also a hint of ripe fruit. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, so much softer than I expected. It's very delicate on the tongue and only makes you want to take the next sip sooner. Overall, a treat for sure. Thanks goes to seaoflament for the chance to try this one.","ncvbc","Aug 31, 2008"
4,-5.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Thanks for the trade Crushinat0r. Pours a chocolately thick dark brown with lots of attractive dark brown head. Balance is always worth currency, and this RIS has it. Chocolate and roast and not overdone though substantially roasty. Thick mouthfeel. I have had lots of great imperial stouts recently, and this is included in the group. Satisfying and very drinkable.","Sammy","Aug 16, 2008"

Finishes with good bitterness of coffee and licorice. Full bodied with good carbonation. Smooth and creamy, roasty, and sweet with a nice bitter finish and barely any sign of alcohol.

4.3,1.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"I've been looking forward to this one for a while... The cork gave a solid pop when the bottle was opened and a giant fluffy cap of brown bubbles appeared on the pour. Clumpy, streaky lacing formed as the foam slowly settled. The beer was basically black with faint reddish edges. Great head retention. Rich aroma, lots of malt and chocolate notes, nutty and roasted, light alcohol. As it warmed, dark fruits and vanilla notes appeared, perhaps a bit of lactose character. Very nice balance and complexity in the nose. Dry cocoa and dark chocolate flavours kicked things off, followed by roasted grains and alcohol towards the end. Lingering dark chocolate and alcohol. Hints of caramelized sugar, raisins, yeasty bread, and vanilla appeared as it warmed. Full bodied and smooth, but with high carbonation that didn't really work for me. As it warmed and the carbonation died down a bit the texture really improved. Significant alcohol warmth. I really liked this beer. Other than the initial carbonation, this was top notch and I really enjoyed it.","DrJay","Jul 18, 2008"

4.03,-4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle purchased at Yankee Spirits in Attleboro, MA in March 2008. Served in my DFH snifter. Dense 1.25 inch tight, mocha-colored head floated on an opaque black sea of malty goodness before eventually settling into a solid layer of foam and tight ringlets. Sheets of thick, but watery lacing revealed with each tilt of the glass left behind some thin trails of foam. Scent of dark fruit, chocolate and malt. Definitely some alcohol heat detectable up front. More dark fruit, cocoa and a mild coffee character supported by a backbone of malt. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, without being viscous, and lively with some carbonation burn, but also some astringency detectable along the sides of the cheeks and back of the throat before settling into a warming sensation that lingers between swallows. A very fine double that improves as it warms. Another excellent offering from Lost Abbey.","Jwale73","Jun 27, 2008"
4.8,13.5,5,5,4.5,5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 2" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head lasts and lasts, with tons of heavy froth lacing.

3.98,-5.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours the typical onyx black with a surprisingly large (for a snifter) two finger brown head that dies down to a full creamy layer of bubbles. Swirling the glass leaves a wall of thick foam on the sides, very sticky. Smell is dominated by dark fruits; dates, raisins, and fig up front. A good amount of booze with some chocolate sauce melted over gooey brownies and toasted oats in the nose. Underneath all that sweetness is a tiny bit of smokey malts as well. Taste is pretty charred up front with a bit of chocolate and caramel malt sweetness. The dark fruits emerge midway with a some oaky tones as well. Aftertaste is a sweet brown sugar and molasses with a hint of dry espresso. A creamy feel that's a bit rough around the edges due to the high level of carbonation. It's a bit chilly in Syracuse tonight for being almost June, this fits well seeing it's a chewy sipping beer that improves as it warms. Decent beer, but there are better double stouts out there for sure.","BeerTruth","May 27, 2008"

Their is a lot of sediment at the bottom so watch out when pouring.( a quarter sized piece settled at the bottom of my glass but I was careless when pouring) Smell is a mix of dark fruit covered with slight chocolate and medicinal hop smell with a lingering alcohol present.
