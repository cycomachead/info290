A year rest surely helped Uncle a great deal, another year for his 2 brothers dozing in the cellar before they try to do battle on the county.  They may try to race on Black Tuesday, but lack the legs and lungs. Rather than compete, they mare retire to the realm of liqueur and leave beer world forever.","Jjski","Yesterday at 09:48 AM"

The nose is deceptively tame with chocolate and caramel bourbon sweetness in the nose, but astringent alcohol begins to slice through as it warms. The taste is an overwhelming mix of malt and alcohol with choking bitterness in the finish. It's full bodied,  slightly chewy, but also astringent to the point of being undrinkable. General sentiments are that this beer is over-priced, over-hyped, and over-extracted.","ThePorterSorter","Beers"

This beer is so big you can actually smell how thick it is. It drinks thick and smooth, and the finish is boozy, semi dry with huge notes of sweet figs and slightly tart dried raisins. Big boozy bourbon on the nose and palate. A bit of heat. As with other high ABV beers from Avery such as Rumpkin and Pumpkyn, the alcohol is extremely subdued. This beer is best served ice cold, and when it is, it is extremely enjoyable.  I'm somewhere between 2 and 3 hours on this and loving it. It's a wonder Avery can consistently brew beers so strong that are so drinkable. Although not my favorite BA offering from them, still impressed and believe this is of the highest quality as with their other offerings.","antott0523","Mar 29, 2015"

Very dark brown in color and oh so thick like oil; you can see the viscosity!  Even after a somewhat aggressive pour not much in the way of a head with spotty bits of bubbles make up the lacing. Flavor is so smooth and complex.   Getting some bourbon, vanilla, wood, sweet chocolate, and coffee. So vicious and velvety, coats the palate extremely well and goes down way to easily for 16.9%. There is an evident burn from the alcohol but its to be expected. Probably one of my favorite bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts I’ve enjoyed to date. So awesome; go and treat yourself to one!","dpgoblejr","Mar 20, 2015"

There is a stronger alc finish in the BBCS, and the oak is stronger. I like the lighter balance in this beer better. Both are superb examples of the style.","brureview","Beers"

Quick sniff shows a bunch a sweet booziness as expected along with chocolate and vanilla.  The taste starts with boozy sweetness with a surprisingly spicy bite.  The middle sees the booze fade away and dense chocolate and vanilla flavors that are balanced by chewy caramel in the finish.  Low carbonation, full bodied, and at 16% abv it isn't close to cloying at all.  Overall, this didn't disappoint and its well deserving of a world class score.  Right up there with the best bourbon barrel stouts, and certaintly unique from the pack with a spicy alcohol bite and a great caramel/chocolate combo.","CTbrew32","Mar 17, 2015"

The bourbon barrel brings light toast and vanilla accent with somewhat nutty flavor mixed with mild alcohol in the back. The finish is semi-dry with mildly sweet aspect of residual sugar and dark malt in the taste. Overall I think this is intense and very tasty with lots of barrel character and an awesome base stout flavor with smooth body. I would say it is a highly drinkable American Strong Stout for 16.9%, one of the best in the style.","Slatetank","Mar 16, 2015"

Definitely stays on the sweet side of the stout family with the big vanilla and chocolate notes but still retains the roasted malt on the dry finish. This is a big beer and definitely worth a try for the experience alone. Only complaint is the finish is a bit too dry and the body fluctuates a bit between the sweet and smoky roasted malt that could be a bit more balanced","BergBeer","Oct 14, 2014"

Aroma of chocolate, mellow bourbon, vanilla, caramel, anise, oak char. Reminds me a lot of Black Note on the nose. Very rich smelling yet not over the top. Flavor follows with a nice vanilla chocolate caramel note, dark fruits, long roasty finish with lingering vanilla, definite char flavors from the oaky bourbon barrels. Huge rich mouthfeel that is right on the nose with low medium carbonation. While this has a hard yet more on the fruity side than I tend to like in the style, there is no question this is world class. The bourbon barrels only accent the flavors and this isn't just some huge bourbon bomb. Nicely done.","BMMillsy","Jun 30, 2014"

Nice big stouty aroma, dark malts, chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, barrel notes. The taste was good, but didn't quite live up to the aroma, rich malts, mostly sweet with a background roasty bitterness, bourbon-soaked oak with a dash of vanilla and toasted coconut, notes of dark dried fruits and a hint of smokiness. Body was on the fuller side of medium, robust mouthfeel, and pretty strong with booze, as you might expect for a 14+% beer (not unusual for Avery). Doesn't quite stack up to some of the bigger names in the world of barrel aged stouts, but in and of itself, this is still a very good brew.","Rifugium","Jun 16, 2014"

4.47,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black with a fine half finger light brown head with great retention and lacing. Delicious aroma of dark caramel and toasted malt, bourbon, dark dried fruit, chocolate truffle. Flavor follows, with dark toasted malt with little char, vanilla, bourbon, molasses, hints of chocolate and coffee, kinda boozy. Heavy bodied, almost syrupy, but with pleasant carbonation. A really nice bourbony imperial stout with complex flavor and perhaps a bit more booziness than expected (common with big Avery beers, I think). But after a few sips, all is forgiven. This seems like a prime candidate for aging and I will do so, if I can ever find more. Man, I love bourbon and beer together.","LiquidAmber","Apr 22, 2014"

4.43,0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours a thick midnight black/used motor oil look with mocha head. Aroma is intoxicating - heavy bourbon but so wonderful at the same time. Lots of vanilla, some light chocolate and roast and toasted coconut. Taste is much of the same with lots of alcohol and sticky mouthfeel and more heat from the alcohol, tons of alcohol. Overall this is a damn good bourbon barrel stout, it is certainly comparable with some of the big names out there like BCBS and Blacknote, although still a small step behind but certainly better than most, just a bit too much alcohol. However the outrageously high price certainly takes it down a notch.","hops202","Apr 15, 2014"

Bourbon hits the nose first, followed by dark chocolate, dark fruit, and coffee. Lots of bourbon on the palate along with cocoa and quite a bit of alcohol heat. Medium bodied with little carbonation. Overall, this is an outstanding BA stout, but at 17% ABV, it's a bruiser!","JohnG190","0"

4.12,-7,4.25,4,4,4.5,4.25,"Pours a dark brown to black color with at least a finger of tan head that enjoyed some lengthy retention. The nose has notes of bourbon. The body is full-bodied, sticky and creamy. The flavor profile leads off with a modest sweetness that is reminiscent of molasses. This initial blast is followed by wholesome roasted bitterness. The alcohol is a bit hot on this offering; this is definitely the type of beer that would be suitable for aging.","57md","Apr 10, 2014"

Also had the pleasure to meet the sales manger, and a couple of the brewers that were working there, that were also from NH & VT just like me. This is a great beer and it tasted even better being right there when it is made and where it is made. The sales manger was really a great guy and gave a mixed beer and juice drink he was having plus a special bottle of Kaiser to take home. The Avery stop was part of a four day, 16 brewery tour that my brother and a couple of other buddies did to Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins. Great trip....","ricknelson","Apr 07, 2014"

The smell is sweet with a strong molasses and chocolate scent. Taste was very sweet up front with strong flavor of milk chocolate and maple syrup. You catch a bit of alcohol heat on the finish, but it is welcome to balance the sweetness. This is a sticky beer, leaving a sweet coating on the lips that lingers long after the last sip. Overall I enjoyed this beer, although it was a bit sweeter than I normally prefer.","OneEye78","0"

It's up there in the BCBS territory in terms of quality, only it costs 3x as much as a single bottle of BCBS and is a lot harder to get in comparison to the distribution BCBS gets. So while I enjoyed this, I wouldn't go out of my way to get this when I can stock up on BCBS. Regardless, my conclusion is that Batch 1 at 2 years is drinking very well right now. Essentially covers the middle ground between BCBS and Black Tuesday in my opinion.","Stevedore","Mar 18, 2014"

Some vanilla and barrel notes, but more chocolate and bourbon. A delicious beer! So smooth. I honestly hadn't looked at the abv. I thought it was around 12-13%. 17.42% abv?!? Are you serious. Apparently, it's serious, because I felt pretty awesome after I finished my 6 oz. Outstanding beer and well deserving of the high ratings.","Huhzubendah","Feb 07, 2014"

This one pours a straight obsidian topped by a half-finger of light sienna foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate syrup, bourbon, light oak, light buttercream in the background, and dark molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, blending the chocolate, roast, and bourbon flavors incredibly well. The body is fairly hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel. Overall, a damn fine barrel-aged stout, one that doesn't overdo the barrel and melds the barrel very well with the base stout. Good times, indeed.","TMoney2591","Jul 27, 2013"

Not one to have every night, but worth trying this once and maybe a again a couple times each year. This is a beer worth holding onto in the cellar for a couple years while the flavors come together and the little alcohol heat settles a bit. in general, Avery's big beers age well to develop a 'completeness' in 2-3 years. While this could go longer, I wouldn't chance longer than 3 years.","mentor","Jul 26, 2013"

Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, alcohol, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, alcohol, dark chocolate, roasted malt, wood, and subtle dark fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. First off, if you are wanting to drink a few beers and not get drunk, this beer is not for you. This thing is a beast and lets you know it straight out of the gate with huge notes of alcohol upon first inspection. It is a little more subdued as the sip sits on the palate by becoming more roasty with a hint of dark fruit. A really well done brew, but drinker beware about the alcohol.

Although the flavor is dominated by bourbon, the barrel character is nicely integrated. Some dry oak, coconut and marshmallow mellow things out but that strong spicy bourbon bite is the star of this beer. I would have thought that it spent more than six months in the barrel. As it warms, a mix of sweet and roasted malt notes come forward. Again, I'm surprised that it's not a complete booze bomb, containing hints of rye, sweet and dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee bean, licorice and dark fruit. The very high ABV is nicely masked with little heat. There is lots of bourbon and sweet alcohol flavor but it's not intrusive at all with some nice warmth in the finish. I was a little skeptical after seeing 17.42% but this is a well crafted decently balanced beer.","corby112","Aug 29, 2012"

The smells of prunes, dates and figs with liquor infused vanilla and fine chocolate truffles alongside leather and rich caramels. Hints of smoky molasses up in the nose as well. Very pretty. Flavor backs up the nose with molasses, bourbon, oak, cocoa, rich sweet vanilla and toasted sugars. A good boozy character warms the throat and leather character brings it all together. Full and silky body with nice, fine carb and a good solid - long lasting finish that runs the duration of five minutes (this is a long time for those actually looking at the clock).

Huge notes of dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, bourbon barrels, and dark berry fruits offset the intensity of the residual sugars and make for an entirely complex, yet enjoyable flavor profile. The alcohol is extraordinarily well-hidden within the creamy, chewy body. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and heavy on the tongue, but velvety smooth and decadent--think along the lines of a melted fudge-sicle. All in all, an excellent beer.

A nice tan head forms around the top, it basically bubbles up out of the dark thick mud. Smell- Charred molasses, caramel, toffee, bourbon, milk chocolate, dark chocolate. This beer bitch slapped me already. Taste- just a super thick velvet of dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, charred molasses, and crazy amounts of booze wraps itself around my tongue and sides of my mouth. Jesus. This is an evil dark motherfucker of a beer. A little but of liquorice at the end of the booze, this reminds me of BCS in some ways, but its bigger and has a super thick mouthfeel. Wow. for 18%, and a beer thats basically fresh, the ABV is not too abrasive. It is there as you would expect it to be, but this is more drinkable than I expected.

Nose is heavy bourbon and vanilla with a considerable amount of char from the barrel. Waves of chocolate and roast emanate strongly with mild boozy character which I find surprising considering the massive gravity of this brew. The taste is very sweet up front with molasses and licorice. This is followed by by intense roast, dark chocolate, an highlights of vanilla. The mouthfeel is heavy but not syrupy. Very mild in the carbonation department. Overall, I am very impressed with the balance considering the high abv.

Not much distinctive bourbon here... some wet wood maybe, but little in the way of actual bourbon. Overall the flavors aren't all that cohesive, instead somewhat messy and it falls a bit flat.

Intense bourbon flavor with a great amount of toffee and vanilla. Subtle coffee flavors with mocha and more vanilla. Boozy warming sensation. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy.

It's a super fine stout with just the right amount of bourbon barrel. The thing that stands out to me is a sweetness in the taste that especially emerges over time. Reminiscent of Rumpkin (another fine beer from Avery) with that sweetness, though not as sweet as Rumpkin. Creamy and full mouthfeel.","UpToMeBeer","Jun 19, 2012"

I’ve had others that were very tasty but just didn’t have the bourbon flavor or feel I was looking for. This certainly does AND it has all the notes of a good stout. Although the ABV is really high at almost 18%, it is hidden extremely well and is not harsh at all. In fact, I think the higher ABV really adds to the bourbon feel. This was a great beer, and I’m very grateful to tacosandbeer for the opportunity to try it.","BlackBelt5112203","May 20, 2012"

Aroma gives off notes of chocolate, espresso, caramel, raisin, sweet dark licorice, brown sugar, vanilla-tinged-oak, and bourbon. Flavor is huge just as I hoped. A little too warm, but the fact that it’s chuck full of flavor helps it ease down the throat. Rich sweet dark chocolate tones on the palate first, some fig/raisin dark fruitiness, with a little tone of roasted coffee, some brown sugar, earthy licorice, caramel, a little bit of boozy vanilla, a twang of oak, and a mellow but warming bourbon ending.

A little sugar sweetness shows itself in the get go but its paired with some bourbon and alcohol, then the milk chocolate shows itself in the finish and stays strong into the after taste. Tastes like I have a bite of milk chocolate slowly melting in my mouth. Thick, rich, sugary, awesome. A nice creamy medium bodied mouthfeel to this with no carbonation to it, allowing the flavors to stick with you rather than be washed away. Overall, all I got to say about this is its fantastic. It's definitely got some heat to this but its balanced with a great, rich flavor. The bourbon barrel was used with great finesse, it contributes to this beer without taking over and dominating the beer's identity. One of the most enjoyable sippers I have come across.
