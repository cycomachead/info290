BA has it listed as year-round, but according to Founders website it is only available from Oct-Dec.  For a non-barrel-aged, moderate ABV, reasonably priced Imperial Stout, I can't think of a better one.  Very balanced and rich.  Bell's Expedition comes close.  Of course, I'm Midwest biased.","southsidejoe8089","Tuesday at 09:21 PM"

Taste is rich but smooth coffee with slightly metallic after taste. Mouth feel is smooth followed by a short tingle. After taste is sparse but warm for the alcohol content. It quickly fluxes from strong coffee to slow dissipating warm. A fun experience but not what I would consider a true oat meal stout. More of a coffee porter with darker coloring.","Stewsbrews24","Feb 28, 2015"

Imperial due to the flavors, because the hop isn't really that strong in flavor, but serves a nice purpose to balance and tame the malty character of the beer. This could be a meal. Or dessert.

Coffee seems to win out over the chocolate.  I assume the manageable bitterness comes from roasted coffee rather than chocolate.  Medium feel.  Wish it was a bit creamier and a little mellower lingering on the tongue.  A very good beer worthy of its high rating.","marieli","Feb 16, 2015"

Very smooth despite the heavy flavors and high ABV. Plan to let this beer age and hopefully let some flavors open up. Perhaps not worthy of a perfect score but definitely a phenomenal beer. Oh and I really really freaking hate the bottle/ label artwork. Are they trying to market baby food or something?! It even turns me off on the beer a little bit because I'm half expecting flavorless grey sludge to pour out of the bottle. Ok I'm getting off my soapbox now.

More carbonation than I expected, which detracts from its smoothness. The sweetness of the chocolate flavor helps neutralize the bitterness of the coffee, but the bitterness wins out. Overall: A special beer and a great stout. My hat's off to somebody who starts his day with this one; for me, I'll save it for after dinner. Drink at closer to room temperature.

The first sip was loaded with flavor– very dark & bittersweet chocolate with oats in the background. A nice, subtle use of bready/doughy malts. Wow, there's a dark roast coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and carbonated. Overall, I like the bitter and creamy qualities of this stout– a contrast to the many syrupy/sweet stouts out there. The control of the coffee flavor is incredible. In my opinion, much better than this year's BCBCS. Go Founders!","Jonoesh5","Jan 06, 2015"

It is a beautiful looking deep red to black beer with a creamy looking tan head that makes this even more coffee like in appearance. The mouthfeel is smooth, with a creaminess and full body that is extremely inviting. Light enough not to be overwhelming. There is a slightly acrid, toasted bitterness present which plays well with the lively coffee accent. A classic, make no mistake.","Barnoloid","Jan 04, 2015"
4.3,-4.9,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"A: Poured aggressively into a pint glass, gives about a finger and a half of tan head lacing very minimal lacing. Black in color, not allowing any light to pass through. S: Amazing to say the least. Smells very chocolaty with hints of coffee and maple syrup with subtle notes of dark fruit. Not any hints of oatmeal. T: Immediately taste chocolate and coffee, and after it goes down it leaves very very strong oatmeal flavor with hints of maple syrup. F: Moderate carbonation, I was expecting it to be smoother, like a milky froth, but does not take away from the quality of the beer. O: 4.25. Great treating beer. Would not recommend drinking with breakfast, as this is a heavy, strong tasting beer, but perfect for a winter night, or summer of you're like me and enjoy stouts all year round.","mschipper","Jan 04, 2015"

You can drink the strongest IPA known to man, crack this Breakfast Stout open, and forget what Cascade or Citra hops even taste like… And by this I mean, it is powerful enough to look right in the face of an overly hopped beer and tell it to shut up and sit down.

Great balance of flavors though with the chocolate and oats.  The mouth feel is very good, but I love the feel of Old Rasputin the best so I can't give this one the top rating.  Great beer for a desert or maybe or a cigar, or just to sip away on to relax and unwind.  It's fantastic!","mikeborglum","Nov 29, 2014"

Solid pour - dies down slowly with good lacing. Smells strongly of malts and chocolate with some coffee tones. Taste lingers just right. Full bodied with tons of great flavors. Chocolate/oats/malts to start with a solid coffee finish. Amazing beer. Can not recommend this more.","Whatrabbit","Nov 17, 2014"

4.77,5.5,5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Wow! What a gorgeous almost pitch black and thick liquid it pours. Coming out the bottle it looks syrupy and viscous. A nice thick brown and white head subsides into a creamy lace that clings to the side of the glass like a Saturn ring. Smells of roasted, slightly burnt (not in a bad way) coffee and chocolate. Taste is coffee like, milky, chocolatey, malty sweet and oatmeal. A nice slightly bitter hops finish balances it out. I had this with chocolate (obviously) and it goes great together. I could alsosee it going with a creamy and less salty cheese like brie as a counterpoint. Feel is creamy with low carbonation but full bodied and viscous.  As the name suggests, it really feels like something you could have for breakfast.(Not that I would recommend this, but perhaps if you are on vacation) would also make a great dessert drink or go with mussels. I have heard about this one for a while and finally had it. Now that the colder season is arriving, I'm looking forward to trying more porters and stouts. This one did not disappoint!!","Gajo74","Nov 12, 2014"

This leads to an enjoyable, medium-body. The whole taste impression is very harmonic from the first moment it hits the palate. Carbonation fits great, adds a subtle freshness, which sweetens the chocolate in the midst of a whole lot of cream. Uprising chocolate-sweetness gets perfectly quenched by a coffee bitterness, which has the exact same intensity, leading to an outstanding balance. The finish is defined by bready malts, and fresh coffee beans, resulting in an enjoyable, earthy bitterness, which sticks for a long time.","aleigator","Oct 29, 2014"

Its a great base to compare other stouts to, although 9 times out of 10 they cant compare to this great one.  Perfect on a winter's day, near the fireplace, or sipping a nightcap.  The only thing to make this any better would be to barrel age it, but thats what KBS is for.","EveningCordial","Oct 25, 2014"

Beers that you'd be lucky to even try once. Some of those beers are only JUST as good as Breakfast Stout. And this is readily available almost anywhere.","EvoRich","Oct 13, 2014"

Between this, their always excellent porter (a go-to), and KBS, I don't think any other brewery makes such excellent darker beers. These aren't the biggest and boldest of beers, but there excellent balance is precisely why I think they excel past any over-hyped IPA or stout.","TCJ0100","Oct 12, 2014"

However, the coffee and chocolate flavors are amazing and the creamy/dry mouthfeel combo is great as well.  Big plus for me is the abv and drinkability, as this drinks like a 5% brew, but matches the depth of a 12% stout. (96/100)","CTbrew32","Oct 10, 2014"

5,10.6,,,,,,"Poured a deep, gorgeous black body with no light shining through at all and a one finger thick tan stout head. A very good looking stout, perfect for the style. Scents of rich black coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa powder and roast malt. Coffee is the most abundant aroma and is simply wonderful. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich, deep, wonderfully coffee-forward stout. Flavor begins with a strong flavor of dark roast coffee, with just a touch of cream and flavors of rich dark chocolate and cocoa. This moves into a middle that is even more coffee-forward, strongly reminiscent of dark roasted beans before being brewed, with lesser notes of cream, roast malt and hints of cocoa. Finish is coffee-forward, with notes of roast malt, cocoa powder and very dark chocolate and faint alcohol. Aftertaste is rich dark chocolate, strong notes of black coffee and dark roasted malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely coffee-forward stout that keeps from being one note with the wonderful cocoa, dark chocolate and cocoa. Mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and smooth, creamy feel. Overall impression mouthfeel is of a nicely rich and creamy Imperial stout that is full bodied, yet not overwhelming and is vey pleasant to drink. Overall this is an excellent Imperial stout that has a wonderful aroma and flavor that are both rich, full and coffee-forward and are not too rich, but perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel aids drinkability and the entire beer is simply wonderful.","Auraan","Oct 07, 2014"

Decadent roasted malts with huge chocolate flavor, with hints of smoke like a cigar. Was expecting a dominant Kona coffee flavor, but this was more subtle. The ABV of 8.3% is a little low for a stout, but the pure decadence makes up for this. This beer is currently rated as #28 out of Beer advocate ' s Top 250 beers, and I feel like it should be higher.  Probably the smoothest stout I've ever had, and overall one of the best stouts I've ever had. I rarely give a perfect score, but I give this one a perfect 100/100 points.","Lionhearted1987","Sep 22, 2014"

Coffee is the beverage I cheat on beer with during the day, so I loooove when beers incorporate good coffee flavors (instead of the usual overly-roasted mess), and this one is the best of the best.  The balance of bitterness and sweetness is perfect, and there is absolutely nothing I would change about this.  This is a staple that I wait all spring and summer for.

Rather than go through the usual A-S-T-M review that a thousand other BA's have done before me, I just want to talk about how important it is to age this beer for approx. 8-12 months. I realize that it's only 8.3% abv and not bourbon barelled, but when you drink this beer fresh right off the shelf it has a bit of a hop bite that doesn't blend well with the malt and the mouthfeel isn't smooth and creamy. At six months it still isn't quite right but starting around eight months it becomes a great beer. Now here's the strange part, I age the bottles at 36 degrees. I don't know why it works (all my higher abv imperial stouts are aged at 68 degrees) it just does.","ELS","Jul 18, 2014"

If you see this on the store, and if you like stouts, you're a fool not to pick it up! Each sip literally has something delightful and interesting about it. Something that will always be in my fridge when I can get my hands on it!","FrostyFoster72","Jul 07, 2014"

As it warms, the beer opens up a bit and chocolate is present. It's not overly complex but the coffee and chocolate characteristics do play nicely with each other. The mouthfeel is thinner and more bitter than I had expected as well. I prefer FIS to this. Overall it's a well made beer but in my opinion not perfect as both BA and The Bros suggest.","Bone53","Jul 04, 2014"

I don't know if Wegmans found them in the back and put them out a year later, or they just sat neglected on the shelf, which would be a shame. At either rate, they were a good find and I am glad I tried it. Not as strong as I expected. Strong notes of coffee and chocolate, however, the coffee was not as strong as the smell lead on to be. Despite this, one of the best stouts I have ever had, and very, very enjoyable.","Seanem44","May 20, 2014"

I may be unfairly comparing this to the KBS because I had the two so closely together. This beer is good on its own, but pales in comparison to the bourbon-y brother. Coffee aroma on the nose with dark roasted malt. Very light texture for a stout with the coffee flavors coming through along with some light chocolate notes. Next time I'll have to give it a more fair shake as a standalone taste, but still a solid beer.","Dawgboned37","May 20, 2014"

Not much carbonation creates a silky mouthfeel; it is pleasant on the way down as far as texture is concerned. Coffee and strong chocolate notes throughout with a bitter finish that dulls out the flavor a bit. Enjoyable but nothing too special here.","Stoutontap","May 13, 2014"

The appearance was pitch black with a nice coffee head that stuck around. The smell was heavy with hints of toast, and a lot of coffee. The taste was a velvet smooth mixture of heavy flavors like coffee and chocolate making for a very nice experience. A solid beer to drink right now, or to let age for a little while to mature it's flavors. Whole-heartedly recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","May 10, 2014"

Perfect balance of coffee and chocolate, a little creamy, just overall an amazing beer. When poured into a glass has a thick creamy head that gives a nice supplementary flavor to the beer. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Guinness.","mwelch17","Apr 12, 2014"

This ale pours a deep dark almost black color with a very slight tan head that quickly dissipates to a light film and very little lacing. The nose is packed with coffee notes highlighted by some burnt dried fruits and cacao. The mouthfeel is the best thing about this beer. It is so silky and creamy and smooth; an utter delight to swirl around your mouth and slowly swallow. The flavor is quite simple for a beer of this caliber. Lots of coffee, a little dark chocolate, a pleasantly bitter bite towards the end, and just a little sting and taste of alcohol on the tail. Simple and awesome. This offering from one of my favorite breweries is so simple in its flavors and craft that it is simply brilliant. They always say that if you are going to make something simple then it has to be done perfectly to be great and Founders has nailed it perfectly and simple.","lochef81","Mar 17, 2014"

The coffee and chocolate stood out to me most in taste, with each sip almost alternating the intensity of the two building block flavors.

I am not sure, and the only reason I'm not sure is that there are still other beers out there in the world that I haven't tried. It pours heavy, no head and minimal lacing, into a tulip glass (next time I'll use a snifter). It tastes sweet, and bitter, and chocolatey - I sense coffee, but on my palate the chocolate is more present - and heavy. Like I really could have it for breakfast. And by God the next time I don't have to work and my kid is already at daycare, I will have one for breakfast, and by then maybe I'll decide it truly is the best stout ever.","schris","Mar 12, 2014"

During a month where I had 2012 Parabola, Old Raspy XV, Berserker, Black Butte XXIII, 2010 Abyss, 2012 Black Tuesday, etc. This beer isnt even close when it comes to depth, mouthfeel, complexity, etc. If it was available at my store, I would probably drink this a lot because of the price point and the quality it delivers, but from a 1-100 rating it just does not stand up to the barrel aged big boys.

The chocolate is rich but not over powering with a medium coffee flavor. The after taste is sweet and not as bitter as you would expect from a a beer with coffee flavor. Overall I would say this stout is fantastic for anybody that really enjoys a full body stout and coffee.","alexspiller29","Feb 06, 2014"

A very clever marketing campaign seems to have overwhelmed people's sensibilities, if not the 8%+ alcohol content. Bottom line: I enjoyed it, I'll drink it again for sure, but perhaps it's not quite the apotheosis of brewing that some make it to be. For an all-around great stout that's also world class and a bit more affordable, try Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout.","Carolvs","Feb 01, 2014"

Hard pour and you get more of a stout look, with better head retention and lacing possibilities. This beer must be in a snifter or an oversized wine glass at all times, to impart better smells and expand better tastes. Top shelf. This beer doesn't have to be improved, but if the body were thicker and the head were as well, Breakfast Stout would be literally perfect. But what is perfect in life? Breakfast Stout is the epitome of NEAR PERFECT.","shacawgo24","Jan 26, 2014"

Oddly enough, this smells like a Waffle House (in the best ay possible): coffee, slightly overdone toast, starchy stuff on the flat griddle, cigarette ash. I get a little bit of chocolate in there as well. Flavors of caramel and roasted malts and coffee are the strongest up front. Chocolate plays very much a supporting role. Slight roasty bitterness is apparent, but the 60 ibus go unnoticed. I don't pick up any hop flavor, really. Kind of sweet for me. Carbonation is great in this: smooth yet lively. I could take this a little more viscous, however. This is a good stout, but nothing mindblowing. A bit too sweet for my liking overall.","goochpunch","Jan 23, 2014"

Fades into fresh and than roasted coffee. Finishes with oat and sweet. Tastes very similar in the best way. Hits you with chocolate than malt. Right into coffee that tastes like a great espresso. Everything lingers and melds nicely and stays on your palate for awhile. Nice creamy mouthfeel without feeling too heavy. Just a great stout, that made me really just go 'damn' and pass it around.

The appearance is dark as night with a very thin tan head that hangs around until the bitter end. The smell blends coffee, espresso, and enough coco beans to make Willy Wonka blush. I felt the taste took on different characteristics as the glass emptied. At first, the coffee and bitterness dominates the palate with an introduction that's smooth as Billy Dee Williams greeting Chew-bacca. However, nearing the bottom of the glass, the chocolate flavor resonated leaving the taste buds coated, relaxed and wanting more. Well done, Founders, well done.","BSK_ONE","Dec 06, 2013"

The smoky sumatran is nice and good overall, but doesn't have the depth to support it's reputation.","babaracas","Nov 24, 2013"

4.95,9.5,5,5,5,5,4.75,"I think this is the perfect stout. I know many out there would argue some of the bigger bolder (harder to get) stouts are superior, but I think this is just right in many ways. While the likes of Founders KBS and CBS are of course delicious, they can be a bit overpowering in taste, abv, and price. Not to mention nearly impossible to find. I find that stout's are often too thin, bordering on a porter or too big and just a bit too much to truly enjoy. At 8.30 the alcohol is barely noticeable, not even a hint of booze. The smell is of roasted coffee and dark chocolate, flawless as is the pitch black appearance with light brown foamy head. I've chased all the big stouts and after a few years of experimenting, I've come back to this as my all time favorite. The best part is the price, at $9.99 and readily available you can't beat it. If it were in large format (22 oz) that would translate to about $4.50 for a bomber for a world class beer. Considering you can't find a decent large format stout for under $8, that works out to be a tremendous value. Cheers!","eddibilderback","Nov 20, 2013"

4.75,5.1,,,,,,"A solid American Double Imperial Stout. Pours to build a nice one to one and a half inch head. Doesn't have that coffee smell of coffee stout. Has plenty of flabor. Goes down smooth, rich and surprisingly clean. It is not as thick or heavy as you would perceive it to be. Very drinkable (although afer 3 I am toast). Great drink on a cold winters night.

Not as amazing as advertised and I won't be going through the trouble to get this again. I would drink it all the time if it were easily accessible and around 3 bucks a bottle.

If you don't like Espresso you'll outright hate this beer, however, if you like a nice hot cup of coffee in the morning, this brew will certainly take a spot in your heart once you taste it. It truly is a perfect blend of rich coffee flavor without going overboard or heavily bitter. For me personally, it's not an everyday beer, but it's great for an after dinner wind down and I totally understand people saying they could drink this forever. As far as Stouts go, this one is on the money. I plan on getting a pack for after Thanksgiving dinner, which is kind of a perfect time for it, with a big ol slice of Pumpkin or Carrot Cake. For some reason this beer kinda had the feel of sitting in a 1940's wooden rocking chair listening to the am radio or something. Kind of odd, since I'm no where near old enough to know what that felt like, and I doubt many people reading this are, but I don't know, maybe you'll understand when you taste it, haha.","JRPuffNStuff","Oct 14, 2013"

Dark brown, nearly black pour with a creamy caramel-colored one finger head with decent retention and great lacing. The nose is amazing! Roasty fresh brewed coffee and tons of chocolate and cocoa totally dominate. Also getting hints of warm milk, espresso, and just a touch of booze. The taste is just as big and just as bold as the nose! Huge amounts of roasty coffee and crazy intense chocolate are the stars. Toasted oats emerge as it warms along with hints of fresh cream, mocha, vanilla, and just a touch of cinnamon. The mouthfeel is unbelievably thick and creamy and absolutely smooth as silk. The balance is nearly perfect with malty sweetness up front and a subtle bitterness on the finish. Overall, I'm totally blown away. I've had this beer once before and remember really liking it, but not to this extent. I don't know if cellaring it for nearly 3 years did it, but this is definitely the best coffee stout I've ever tasted. I will definitely pick up more of this immediately!","beerdrifter","Oct 11, 2013"

It smells so good you can’t wait to drink it. Appearance is think and black. The head is frothy and creamy with substantial lacing. Taste is just delicious. Taste of coffee and espresso comes through first and then you take chocolate. Lingering flavor. Savor this one and allow it to warm up to room temperature as you drink. Palate - Rich, thick and creamy. It feels substantial. Not much carbonation. I love this beer.","Fastmedic","Oct 07, 2013"

I've had this in bottle form many times over the past several years, but was fortunate enough to experience on tap from an appropriately aged keg(about 4 months) just recently. I slightly overindulged on this particular evening. 5 pints in a row as I recall, and had to take a taxi home. It was a good night. I can't say enough to express my undying love for FBS. Thank you Founders for creating a beer just for me. So perfect in every way. I would even consider mainlining it. IV anyone?","crazyfoMostout","Jul 17, 2013"

Some oats and a small hint of alcohol. Nose warms with some dry toast and a hint of vanilla. Taste is sublime, bitter chocolate and coffee. Sweeter than you think. The roast is smooth but lends a touch of bitter to the hops which have waited in the wings with a touch of floral and bitter. Alcohol is warming and it finishes dry and with a touch of vanilla in the aftertaste. Velvety smooth, this a great stout.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

The appearance is just like a typical imperial stout; pitch black with a decent head that dissipates in about 3 minutes. The smell is just awesome, coffee, heavy chocolate, roasted malts and more chocolate. The taste is just like the smell very delicious, very creamy. The first flavor you palate detects is the rich coffee, followed by tons and tones of dark chocolate, ending in a pleasant bitterness. This could be perhaps the best Russian stout out there. I highly recommend!","tvl89","May 23, 2013"

The body is viscous, bringing the elements of the taste and a persistent bitterness stemming from roasted barley/malt. The alcohol is present, warm, and hop bitterness, although present, is completely dominated by the toasty character of this beer. Great beer indeed - despite my skepticism.","HabiMendes","Apr 28, 2013"

Taste follows the nose for the most part, but I get some dark fruits in there too. Alcohol covered up very nicely and a good bitterness from, what I'm assuming, is a combination of hops and coffee. I also noticed a weird metallic taste as well. The oatmeal really gives this beer a nice smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty low but fits the style well. Overall, I still think this is a great stout, but is it a 100? Probably not. Also, I'm not sure how much the coffee and chocolate actually add to the taste. I've had plenty of imperial stouts that didn't have coffee or chocolate added but had just as much flavor.","MisSigsFan","Apr 28, 2013"

Brewed with an abundance of flaked oats, bitter and sweetened imported chocolates, Sumatra and Kona coffee. We’re actually not sure if this is some type of coffee cake or a beer. Either way you can drink this ale with a fork. Breakfast Stout has an intense fresh roasted coffee nose toped with a cinnamon colored frothy head that seems to never fade and makes you wish breakfast could last forever. Yummy with cake or desertions ice cream.","Joethebeerpro","Apr 10, 2013"

4.43,-2,4,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,"After a quick pour this one is an opaque inky black in the glass with a half a finger tall dark khaki head that falls relatively quickly but laces nicely around the edges. The smell is impressive consisting of layers of dark roasted black coffee, dark chocolate and charred wood. The taste all coffee up front and rather bitter to slightly astringent due to some of the black malts. Unsweetened dark chocolate is next along with a great mix of some spicy hops, a touch of yeast and warming alcohol. If I had to criticize, I think I'd say that I wish this had a bit more sweetness to balance the bittering character of the dark malts and moderate IBUs. This is a thickly chewy heavy beer. Low carbonation with added body as a result of the oatmeal make this really pleasant in the mouth. I can't believe I've taken this long to give this beer a try. What an impressive offering, perhaps it doesn't define the style but it leads the coffee heavy stouts, really well done.","fank2788","Apr 06, 2013"

Taste hits all the right buttons: rich, bitter cocoa, roasty toasty delicious. Goes down smooth too, with a café of flavor and aroma left in the mouth.

4.75,5.1,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"A serious stout. nobody should pass up a breakfast stout. An eye opener and belly expander of a beer. This has all the flavor you would expect and then doubles it until you feel completely satisfied. Chocolate, coffee, oatmeal and stout all perfectly balanced yet strong, and worth sharing if the need arises because you should buy as much as you can, just so you can dish out the goods and get all the credit; or just drink it to the head daily because you're worth it. Nice texture goes down like melted butter and chocolate roasted over an open fire. If you've gotten through all that truth and fluff I just wrote you should know this is a great beer that shouldn't get better by making it stronger in abv. or aged in barrels; because some things are better left alone. I've had some stout with more coffee or more chocolate or roast but this one succeeds in making them all come together well without one characteristic taking over completely, except perhaps the coffee. Then again the chocolate malt flavor comes out so well throughout the entire beer too with the coffee and some hops keeping it from being overly sweet. it's drink ability-- just about flawless. As I've already said in so many words: smooth, flavorful and good carbonation. You'd want to drink this all day but to do so I recommend spending it at a barbeque or some big, big breakfast.","BeerTheater","Mar 22, 2013"

It pours quickly with very little head, but what is there has a nice coffee color. Huge coffe and chocolate influence in all aspects of this rich, yet easy to drink beer. I love taking a big whiff of it as I toss it back. Dark as night and slick going down. No hint of the high ABV. Not as earthy as it could be, but still so hearty. I can drink one after another and keep going back for more. This one of those highly ranked beers that really delivers everytime. I've spent the last couple of months drinking highly rated stout after stout. And, everytime I always think about how good the Breakfast Stout is in comparison. I wonder how these taste with a little age on it. Can't wait to find out.","Jake_Ramrod","Mar 20, 2013"

This is actually an extremely drinkable rep of this style. Dark roasted kona is definitely up front in the aroma and taste, I don't really get much chocolate at first, but as this beer warms a litte! Whoa! Huge mocha flavor just turns on and it gets a lot more complex. I do love love the fact that there is not a bitter after taste that most other coffee infused stouts seem to come with. Much thanks to mpayne5 and Nuckbuck for the hook-up! This little gem is making me rethink my whole attitude on coffee stouts for sure. Overall a solid stout, I would highly recommend this to everybody.","Qwest_35","Mar 19, 2013"

Smell was just what I expected and more. Malty chocolate, coffee and just a hint of oats. Taste was full of chocolate and coffee and lingered just long enough to get to the next mouthful. I'm a Pilsner drinker and that won't change, but on those occaisions when I feel like a change I will definetly have Breakfast Stout at the top of the list.","BeerBear55","Mar 03, 2013"

4.99,10.4,4.75,5,5,5,5,"Poured this American Double Stout from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a pitch black color, produced a thick tan head, nice retention and it left an outstanding amount of lacing on the glass.

Full bodied, off the charts mouthfeel- Creamy, Velvet, smooth- Roasted Malt, smooth oatmeal, milk chocolate, coffee, and hoppy bitterness, warming alcohol. By far, one of my most favorite brews- one of the best brews on the planet, For sure the top American Double Stout I have sampled.","GossageBrewery","Feb 13, 2013"

Only a bit of barrel aging, or perhaps a larger cream and toffee presence, could improve the flavor, and a slightly more viscous mouthfeel would be nice. These are, however, picky notes, and should be largely disregarded; the beer is excellent as-is. Well worth trying.","jondeelee","Feb 10, 2013"

The aroma distinctly blends bittersweet chocolate with a healthy amount of roasted coffee. Each sip reveals the smoothly blended magical flavors of chocolate and coffee. The addition of making this an Oatmeal Stout definitely helps make this huge beer an easy sipper along with adding some needed fullness to the body. Each sip lingers delicious chocolate and coffee begging you to take another one.","JMC_TM","Jan 23, 2013"

The thickness makes it taste like a meal, the flavor makes it enjoyable. You get intense dark chocolate and amazing smooth coffee. Most coffee stouts have a bitter flavor from the beans but this is the gold standard. You get a great smoothness from the oatmeal to balance it out perfectly.

The mouthfeel is amazing. Super thick and creamy. The tastes are fantastic and that thick mouthfeel holds them together beautifully. Overall its a beautiful beer.","Groulxsome","Jan 01, 2013"

It is poured freely into a huge balloon wine glass, no head, slight brown edges with pitch black 95%. The coffee and hops have faded slightly over the year, but honestly not that much as it has been in the garage beer fridge since it was about 3 weeks old. The chocolate layers are just exquisite with the age. Mouthfeel is on the thin side for the style, but the dryness from the bitter chocolate and hops and perfect carbonation make it an easy drinker. Cliche or not, I could totally drink this for breakfast. This is my second favorite coffee forward non barreled imperial stout. Just short of a Alesmith Speedway Stout. And that's not even a good comparison considering the huge abv difference. I absolutely recommend buying as much of this as you can find/afford. But I must say, it is best around 3 months of age, just as Founders recommends "drink all of our beer fresh". The hops and coffee fade and they are the highlights of the beer.","Ivegotmule","Jan 01, 2013"

It’s certainly an outstanding example of a double stout, and the wife and I both agree that it’s delicious in its own right. However for me, it’s just another check box and not one I’d go out of my way for again. Just too many good beers in styles I like better. YMMV. Enjoy.","jettjon","Dec 31, 2012"

Aroma is darkly roasted barley, sweetish chocolate, and mild coffee and just a little lettuce-y hops. First hit is unexpectedly not sweet, alot more coffee flavor than chocolate. The chocolate begins to dominate with warming: bittersweet chocolate, more bitter than sweet with the hop twang finish adding to the bitterness. Seems just a little flat to me, could add a bit more carbonation. Overall good but not exceptional.","atomicbeer","Dec 31, 2012"

4.73,4.6,4,4.75,4.75,4.5,5,"Pours black with a slight mocha head that recedes to the edges. Aroma is awesome; rich, sweet, and roasty. The chocolate and sugars from the oats give it a nice sweetness,some great dark roast coffee beans and roasted barley offer some great roastiness. A touch of unoffensive alcohol is there too. I will add that as it warms up the coffee really comes alive. Flavor is everything I hoped it would be. Huge dark roasted coffee, chocolate that starts off on the bitter end of the spectrum but quickly transitions into sweeter chocolate alongside the sugars from the oats, on top of a nice roasted malt foundation and with a nice slightly bitter char finish. Beautiful. A medium bodied, silky mouthfeel. Overall, loved it and I was not let down one bit. Everything I hoped it would be and totally worth all the hype/love it gets.","denver10","Dec 29, 2012"

4.92,8.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Overall: Breakfast Stout is one of the finest imperial stouts around; it's my personal favorite because it's relatively lower in alcohol and more drinkable than most beers in the style. Its extraordinary mix of coffee, chocolate, and oatmeal stout characteristics is impressive. This is a decadent treat that is also very reasonably priced (I bought my 4-pack for $11.99 at the local liquor store in Hyde Park). Great stuff. Don't be fooled into thinking Breakfast Stout is a lesser beer next to Founders' other stouts, especially the "white whales" in the stable–Kentucky Breakfast and Canadian Breakfast stouts. It's wonderful in its own right! Go buy some before the weather warms up.","hagbergl","Dec 19, 2012"

4.92,8.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"I love beer of all kinds! I love the hoppy, the malty, the dark, the light, the thick, the smooth, the strong, and the refreshing. I love beer, and Founder's Breakfast Stout is hands down the finest beer I have ever had. Ever. This is the kind of beer that will please almost anyone, except those who prefer mild, light beer. I imagine this will describe almost no one who is on this site. This beer presents as a super dark chocolate stout, which might lead you to expect something thick, like Guinness. However, the mouthfeel is much thinner than you might expect, and pleasantly refreshing for a stout. And while there are overtones of chocolate in the palate, the taste is largely that of a malty coffee. Many coffee flavored beers come off bitter, which for us hop heads is not always bad, but Founder's Breakfast Stout is remarkably balanced. I have tried this beer both from the bottle and on-tap. Both retain the integrity of this exemplary brew. And unlike most beers with this high of alcohol content, Breakfast Stout finishes smooth. It is good on the morning, as its name implies, it is good in the afternoon (the time I am currently enjoying it), and it is good late at night (my personal favorite time to enjoy it). Grand Rapids has been voted the best beer city in America, Founders Brewery is widely seen as the best brewery in the city, and for my money Breakfast Stout is the best of the many great beers they brew. It only comes around for a short time toward the end of the fall, so if you see this brew available at your local pub or in your local beer case, do yourself a favor and grab a few. You won't regret it!","actinphishy","Dec 08, 2012"

4.33,-4.2,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours seal brown with a decent amount of mocha foam. Aroma smells strongly of fresh roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The roasted malt dominates the flavor profile, lending a coffee flavor that is smooth and slightly bitter. The coffee actually tastes a bit blacker than I recall, which is a slight detraction. Dark chocolate is present as well, but it struggles some to assert itself. The mouthfeel is smooth and luxurious, reinforcing a rather decadent vibe overall. A malty stickiness lingers on the lips after each sip. My lone complaint here is that I wish there was a bit more balance between the coffee and the chocolate. As is, the coffee becomes a bit too astringent as the beer warms, but this is undoubtedly a fine brew regardless.","MaximalC","Dec 02, 2012"

4.13,-8.6,5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Black. No light gets through at all, not even the edges. Head was only a couple of millimeters, dissipated quickly, but stayed at the edges the entire time. Smelled very nutty with some sweetness. Taste is roasty. Bitterness is mostly roasty bitter and only lightly hop bitter. There's a real nice cocoa powder bitterness as it warms. Mouthfeel is heavy but not chokingly thick. Carbonation is sharp on the tongue and creamy on the swallow. It starts sweet and and semi-sweet. Sweetness is nice but I'm pretty sure two of these would get sickening sweet. Alcohol is masked very well. It's my first for the style so I can't really compare. I can find no faults and would recommend it for a nice cold winter night.","Justin23060","Nov 30, 2012"
4.53,0.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Yeah, It's really good, as the hype would make you expect, It is good, its very well balanced, has a great aroma to it, taste is good, I was sort of expecting better, don't get me wrong it it is very good, but it didn't blow me away, as has happened with other high class beers, but it is really good, it has low carbonation, its smooth, rich, thick, good volume to it, its pretty expensive, $10 for a 4 pack, but I'd say its worth it, great depth to it, almost as rewarding as a good meal but in a bottle, of course, I recommend everyone to try this, Pure Michigan.","Mavigo","Nov 30, 2012"

The smell isn't overwhelming, as none of the different flavors differentiates itself. Rather there's a good mingle. The taste is brilliant. The beer is heavy enough to just hang in your mouth, but it goes down extremely smooth. The flavors really hit you the longer you hold the sip, and the aftertaste leaves nothing to be desired. I paid $19 for the growler and feel like I really stuck it to my local shop.","hays23","Nov 11, 2012"

The beer has a thick sweet chocolate smell tempered by bitter coffee. Light earthy and sursprisingly slightly citrusy hop flavors stay in the background. A bready malt base seems to thicken the aroma of this beer, making it feel viscous in the nostrils. Tastes delicious. starts out a little chocolately sweet drops quickly into bitter astringent coffee and slowly gos back to sweet, this time with toffee notes. The finish is strong, bitter and dry. not as thick as i would have expected, but i expected it to be too thick so this is perfect. weighty enough to carry the beer accross the tongue and more. This beer is long complex and delicious. the alcohol is midly warming but doesnt interfere with this beers drinkability. If i had anything negative to say its trhat i probably couldnt do too many of these in a sitting as it could get a little sappy.

4.82,6.6,4,4.5,5,5,5,"What can be said about this legendary offering that hasn't been said before. It is not just beer, but liquid art. It pours a deep mahogany with a 1/4 inch caramel colored head, and no a whole lot of lacing. Smell is mostly coffee but also some roasted malt and a bot of smokiness. Mouthfeel is a thick and wonderful. Taste is a sweet molasses up front and finished with a complex coffee, dark chocolate and roasted nut flavor. Like my daughter would say, this is the "bomb diggedy!!"","Mojo","Oct 23, 2012"

4.95,9.5,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Founders Breakfast Stout is an incredibly black beer topped with a thick, light brown foam that has wonderful retention. Coffee and chocolate fill out a pretty heavy aroma. It smells very fresh, with hints of stone and wood. Vanilla seems like a main player here. It smells a little sweet and somehow warm. It's full, soft and smooth on the tongue. The finish is dry and leaves the mouth a little dusty. This has an abundant, roasted flavor. Dark roast coffee and dark chocolate seem to be responsible for most of the taste. It's not sweet or dry. There's a resiny bitterness that persists after the swallow as baking chocolate. I've heard a lot of hype about this beer and I see that it's deserved. This is a pretty legendary beer. Thanks to Mitch for getting me this bottle for my thousandth beer review.","yesyouam","Oct 21, 2012"

The roasted coffee, sweet oatmeal and satisfying bittersweet chocolate flavors play so nicely together with the spicy, bitter hop resins and inherent booziness of the style.

Smell is of fine dark chocolate and coffee, but it's not as aromatic as I would've thought. Taste is outstanding, you can just taste the quality. Some beers use chocolate and coffee that tastes cheap. I felt like I was having good coffee with Ghirardelli dark chocolate in it. It's more dark and roasted in flavor than sweet. Mouthfeel was perfect considering this is over 8% abv. I have had the experience where beers in this category are so sugary sweet they leave my mouth feeling like I had coke, but not with this. Once again I think the quality of ingredients just pulls everything together. Overall this has to be one of the best beers I've ever had. Liquid awesomeness.","theHoff77","Oct 03, 2012"

I paid $11 for a 4-pack of this beer at a local liquor store, and I would gladly buy another 4-pack again for that price. Also, I think that the lower-than-expected heaviness of this beer would make it a good introductory stout for those wishing to expand their palate.

Tasted coffee like crazy! Served at a slightly colder temp than I reviewed it the first time. Tonight, it has a great balance; not overly thick as some oatmeal stouts, with an awesome, roasty coffee finish. Large format serving was definitely better than the bottle serving I reviewed earlier this month. If you have the chance to try this one on tap, DO IT! Still didn't even get a hint of this brew's 8.3% ABV. Tonight's taste reaffirmed my initial impression: "Remarkably drinkable."","BWHD","Sep 11, 2012"

Upon first learning that Founders had a beer with all these elements, I knew that the second I tasted it that it would be my favorite beer of all time. I'm extremely happy that Founders delivered. They may not have thousands of offerings like some other breweries but the 10 or so that they do compete with the best any brewery has to offer. I'm giving this 5's across the board but as I taste the variants I may have to revisit this. But as of right now, this is the perfect brew for me.","RichD","Sep 06, 2012"

Full bodied beer here, smooth and creamy, rich and delicious, touches of bitterness, strong coffee after taste.

4.65,2.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours like a browned overcast midnight with a very thin tanned head on top that can leave lovely walls of sticky lacing down the side. In the middle of the skim of head there is a maelstrom of steady bubbles pounding to the surface in order to replenish the slight head, but other than that, nothing of the insides of this beer can be discerned. This beer is dark. The beer has a wonderfully heavy dark roasted coffee smell with hints of dark chocolate and some slight smooth oatmeal rounding out the edges of the smell. The beer’s taste follows suit with the smell, delivering a terrific wallop of dark roast coffee and slight dark chocolate and smooth oatmeal. The middle brings forward the chocolate more, reminiscent of a dark chocolate candy bar. The after taste is a lovely linger of black coffee and a slight sweet bite of chocolate. The mouthfeel begins with very faint pinpricks of carbonation which immediately dissipate to leave the beer velvety smooth and thickly chewy on the tongue, it leaves the mouth fat with drizzling saliva that wants more, and the roasty dry reverberations that you get after drinking coffee. Overall, this is a tremendous representation of the imperial stout, and a phenomenal drink to have for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. It masks its alcohol wonderfully, only leaving a hint of it in the warming that it gives the stomach. This beer could practically serve as a meal in and of itself. This is worthy of a drink.","Maxwell","Aug 22, 2012"

Real espresso aroma, some roast grain and a bit of dark chocolate. Taste is well balanced, good mix of the malty sweetness and cold bitter coffee for something approximately right down the middle point flavor-wise. Alcohol is well hidden, palate is well adjusted, medium carbonation for a very full body. Tasty stuff, one of the better Founders beers for sure.","Luk13","Jul 17, 2012"

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are big malt dark roasted malt aromas along with coffee and chocolate. It's mildly sweet and it comes across as roasty to the nose. The taste follows the nose. There are dark roasted barley malts, coffee, and chocolate as well as oats and dark fruits. The flavors are big, but also well balanced. The 8.3% ABV is well hidden in the taste. I can barely taste the alcohol. The body is full with light carbonation. It is smooth thanks to the oats. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer and a fantastic example of an imperial stout. This is also appropriately named because I could see myself enjoying one of these with breakfast.","acevenom","Jun 07, 2012"

Huge coffee and chocolate presence define this beer, but what separates it from the others is the superb craftsmanship that the men at founders did with the other characteristics. Any homebrewer can come up with the idea to brew a stout with a bunch of chocolate and coffee, but it takes a truly talented brewer to make it this damn good.

As great as many Russian Imperial Stouts are, they're not something I'm going to drink on a regular basis. Others may be more complex, or with more alcohol, or have something else that makes them a little better, but Founders Breakfast Stout has a great balance. It's light enough and balanced enough to be an everyday beer and great enough to be a special occasion beer.","JohnQVD","Jun 02, 2012"

The coffee has mellowed slightly but nothing else has really came forward. I'll crack another one at the 1 year mark. Overall, this is a very tasty coffee stout and probably the most coffee-dominant beer I've yet to try.

4.22,-6.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Beer pours a pitch black with a thin tan head. Smell is a fantastic mix of coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malts. The primary flavor here is the coffee, but at the same time for a coffee beer, this has a lot of other flavors going on so that the coffee isn't the only thing I'm tasting. It's not nearly as bitter as other such stouts and has a really nice dark chocolate finish. It's quite well-balanced and tasty. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I'm typically not the biggest fan of coffee stouts, but Founders Breakfast Stout is one of the only ones that I come back to over and over. It's one of my favorite non-barrel aged stouts out there.","starrdogg","Apr 28, 2012"

The Breakfast stout had a lovely chocolate and coffee, earthy aroma to it, it poured a opaque color and had about 1/8" head on it, with descent lacing. The picture on the label really caught my attention. And I'm glad I gave it a whirl. It is now close to the top of my list of all time greats. A lot of overstock is being sold now at good package/liquor stores, but fortunately it ages well. Pairs well after dinner or with game, but really is a stand alone beer.

Fully coats the mouth with the chocolatey coffee flavor followed by a malty finish. The head hung on for the whole ride. Overall, a great one and done beer to end a meal or replace a dessert.

4.7,4,4,4,5,5,5,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle at cellar temp into a tulip. A fairly small, tan head collapses to an espresso-like crema on top of a completely black, opaque liquid. The somewhat restrained nose is of roasted cocoa. Flavors explode on the tongue: coffee, cocoa, and roasted grain, supported by a nice bitterness that does not distract from the smooth chocolate notes. The finish is simultaneously dry and sweet. There is no cloying character; the mouthfeel, while full, does not coat. This is an absolutely outstanding stout, and very little could be done to improve it.","MCDuhamel","Feb 24, 2012"

Strong coffee, with some slight chocolate hints, then more earthy spicy coffee. Goes down easy. While many imperial stouts come off syrupy, this is incredibly drinkable and smooth. Perfect carbonation and a nice bitterness that goes well with the roasty flavor here, massive coffee, and the perfect amount of chocolate sweetness. Not overly sweet. Honestly, I find this to be better than the heralded KBS by a good margin. Excellent beer!","BMMillsy","Feb 20, 2012"

The thickness of the stout borders on oil as it is difficult to see light through a glass. The thickness also leaves a generous coat on the tongue. Initially, the stout produces a flavor of strong coffee bitterness with dark chocolate yielding to hints of bread and malt. The chocolate becomes slightly sweeter in the aftertaste. If I were to offer one criticism to Breakfast Stout, I would love to taste a little more sweetness hidden in the aftertaste. It would be close to perfect at that point.","JohnnyHopps","Feb 19, 2012"

Not much of a head forms, but the one that does is a medium-shade mocha color. Aromas of smoke, coffee, and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is heavy on the tongue initially, but as it is swallowed, it thins out quite a bit. A lot of olive flavor. Some griddle smokiness. Quite a bit of strong, black coffee. There's a peculiar flavor that I'm not able to put my finger on that emerges late. It's not necessarily an absolutely unique flavor, but it is so misplaced in a beer like this that I can't determine what it is. Smoky olive bitterness at the finish.

4.42,-2.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours black with a nice dark mocha colored head that leaves quickly but leaves a nice ring of lacing. Coffee smell hits you in the face this is like a cold cup of coffee, the funny thing is I dont like coffee (hot drink) but I love the flavor and smell besides the coffee there is a little chocolate but its very hard to pick up and a slight sweetness form the malt. The taste is great nice punch of coffee like in the nose but the chocolate comes through a lot more and a nice sweetness from the malt to balance out the roasted coffee flavor. It coats my mouth very well but not as viscous as other beers in this style, very little carbonation but again that is very similar to others in this style. Overall this is a great coffee beer if you don't like coffee flavor you will hate this beer. When this beer comes out I always buy at least 2-3 four packs of this every year. Lastly I don't not recommend cellaring this beer the coffee tends to fade pretty quickly after 1 year IMO.","phisigben","Feb 15, 2012"

4.13,-8.6,4.5,4,4,5,4,"Overall- These guys really know what they were going for, and did it. It might be sacrilege, but I was hoping for something a bit more complex. It's a big beer, and well balanced, but in the end it's about what you would expect when you consider the ingredients. Double up the well-above-standard recipe, throw in some coffee and cocoa, and voila! I'm big into stouts, but this had little of the complex spicy, woody, and dark fruit character I've seen in some of my favorites. Well worth the $10 I dropped on the four-pack, but not what the hype would lead you to think. As a stand-alone beer, it’s great, but you wouldn’t want more than one or two, and it kills the palate. I don't really see it going with food. I might pick it up once in a while, but it's not going to make my go-to list in the near future.","Lawl3ss","Feb 06, 2012"

Anyways, the aroma is just blasting from the glass. It's mostly chocolate and alcohol, with some oatmeal. Smells really nice. Just from the smell you can imagine the creaminess you're about to experience. Tastes like hot cocoa mixed with an oatmeal stout. Delicious. Very smooth and creamy. There is a presence of alcohol, but it seems more present when it's colder. I'm also getting a bitter touch from the hops in the middle, and the aftertaste is a smooth coffee flavor that lingers for a minute. Nice full, creamy body. Low carbonation.

It smells amazing- a very smooth coffee smell literally the most like coffee of any beer and also a distinctly different scent of cocoa. The taste is very much like it smells the exception being a wonderfully rich blend of dark malt. The mouthfeel is exceptional as well- very lightly carbonated with a full, rich body.

I paid $11.99 for the 4-pack, and thankfully, this was the last one. Had there been more, I would've bought them, I mean. And if there had been none, I wouldn't have been too thrilled. So it worked out. This is my first chance finally reviewing it in the bottle, since I haven't found it in a long time and finally recently stumbled upon it, and it seems like nothing has changed. An intense, balanced, beautifully crafted Imperial Stout from one of my favorite breweries. It'll always be a staple for me if I can ever find it enough to make it one.","asabreed","Jan 12, 2012"

The taste has too much of a green earthy coffee taste and the body is thin. Anyway, the year old FBS still is quite outstanding. I wondered how it would hold up and it has much better than I expected. I suspect it wouldn't do well for that much longer. But I would trade the rest of the FBS I bought for last year's.

Good carbonation and fun to swirl and sip. This is a complex brew that seems to get better and better as you drink it. I suppose more complexity comes out as it warms up. This brew is perfect for sitting around a campfire and talking with friends or family. Overall this stuff is fantastic and I understand what the hype is about now. Will definitely buy again.","TrappistJohnMD","Dec 31, 2011"
4.62,2.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had to travel to Asheville to score this, as Founders is not sold here in SC. And let me say, it was worth the trip. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beautiful jet black with a bold 2 finger tan head that stuck around for a bit with good lacing. Smell is huge coffee, roasted malts, figs, toffee and perhaps some chocolate. Taste follows the nose, but what was surprising was the balance and complex taste. Starts off coffee and then the chocolate hits with the hops and malts. Sweet but bold on the finish and just difficult to put down. Excellent sipping beer on a cold night. Breakfast Stout is the perfect name for this. Feel is thick and creamy with good carbonation. Silky and pleasant on the tongue. Overall- Top notch for the style and my favorite to date. Complex and full with excellet taste and smell. Huge coffee and mocca with perfect balance. Founders knocked this out of the park. Letting another bottle age in the cellar and we will see what happens. A must try","TheDinger","Dec 31, 2011"

The nose is super complex and delightful. Coffee, chocolate, malt, bitterness. Incredible. One of the best stout noses around. Perfect. Masterful. Taste follows up with more awesomeness. Bitter with a solid backbone of sweetness. Well balanced too. This is an absolutely amazing beer. Mouthfeel could be a little more energetic, although my pour was pretty aggressive. I might revise the mouthfeel up after my second glass. Overall, highly recommended, one of the best stouts I've ever had and the best with the particular additions they made, coffee, chocolate...sometimes these additions ruin a stout and you wonder why the brewer didn't just make a great simple stout. Not in this case. Incredible brew.","chicagoabbot","Nov 24, 2011"

Aroma is certainly that of bitter chocolate, fresh ground coffee and herbal hops. Quite an alluring nose. Deep and dark roast coffee ground flavor that is nicely held in check by a fair amount of sweetness. Coffee bitterness and acidity are there but are delivered with a creamy smoothness and subtle carbonation. Dry notes of rich earthy chocolate fudge ice cream resonate on the palate long after the finish. I'm highly considering this to pair with holiday desserts this year. Coffee lovers, beware--there's a reason it's called "Breakfast Stout"...","albertjr21","Nov 20, 2011"

I mean, I love coffee and coffee beers, but Breakfast is like drinking cold coffee straight up. No nuances here, not much chocolate or oatmeal. Goes down well, though, good drinkability. A note about the new description: “Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout”. WTF? Gimme a break…","DoubleSimcoe","Nov 18, 2011"

Sweet iced coffee on the palate, followed by burnt chocolate with some nice bitterness. Some warming alcohol to finish, but not offensive. This is amazing. I love the mocha coffee profile. The mouthfeel is grainy and moderately fizzy. This beer rocks. I wish the head was better, but the taste makes up for the poor pour. This is my favorite stout. Not the best I have ever had, but my favorite considering price, drinkability and availability.","JohnWaynes44","Nov 17, 2011"
4.54,0.4,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours out pitch black like motor oil, thick and viscous with an ample tan head that forms up and recedes over a few minutes to a wispy layering. Big aroma of coffee is upfront, alongside sweet chocolate, toffee, and caramel. Taste is all coffee at first, rich and bold with a nice bitterness that coats the tongue. Touch of pine breaks through and blends with the coffee, while chocolate and tobacco mingle around on the tastebuds. Slight bitterness, roasted malts, and touch of alcohol arrive at the end of the sip, confirming to the brain that this is in fact a beer, not a cup of extra bold coffee. Mouthfeel is heavy with mild carbonation, smooth and creamy. Overall, this is an amazing beer. Recommended to all those who like a little beer in their morning coffee.","jsdunlop","Nov 17, 2011"

4.73,4.6,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"O - this is what a coffee stout should be. Although the coffee and chocolate are intense, they're not overwhelming. There's nothing "one note" about the flavor profile as everything works well together. FBS continues to be my yardstick for this beer style.","ChiHophead13","Nov 13, 2011"
4.35,-3.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - This beer is fantastic. It is something that i could literally drink for breakfast, and would work especially work well with some buttered toast and eggs.

4.89,8.2,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Not a session beer, by any means, too complex and interesting - but worth a visit each Fall as it comes available - if you haven't tried it yet, do so... its a Stout worth writing home about.","demuzik","Nov 13, 2011"
4.45,-1.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Damn delicious beer with lots of rich flavors. It definitely hit the spot and would likely be a good cellar-ing candidate. I'd try they beer again and whole-heartedly recommend it to others.","ThePorterSorter","Nov 12, 2011"

4.84,7.1,4,5,5,4,5,"Fast forward 4 years later. Bottled 11-04-2011. Coffee taste and smell is stronger and more pleasing than in any other stout I have drank, including Mikkeller Brunch Weasel (which I would never have thought possible). The moderate hop contrast is welcome, keeping this from being one delicious note. Absolutely the BEST stout I have had to date.","Onibubba","Nov 11, 2011"
4.39,-2.9,4,5,4,4.5,4.5,"D: This beer is exceptionally easy to drink, especially considering the ABV. I think the coffee flavor is a bit overpowering, but for people who drink black coffee every day, this would be a real treat.","schlimenhaumer","Nov 10, 2011"
4.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Al that being said, its definitely a breakfast stout. Coffee is everywhere, and everything else just accents that dark roast coffee. Get one, enjoy it while it lasts. Definition of world class.","VncentLIFE","Nov 10, 2011"

4.7,4,5,5,4.5,4,5,"O- I have read so many reviews and heard so many great things about this beer. After a long wait I can now say that the anticipation that built up before now was not in vein. Worth the wait and definitely worth the search. Great beer. Absolutely one of the best.","stckhndlr","Nov 09, 2011"
4.62,2.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is a great beer and one that I would drink again and again if this were available. The smell is pretty much perfect with sweet creaminess and lush chocolate that belie the first couple of sips that instead give me a more bitter background. As the beer warms the bitterness mellows out and gives a sweet chocolate and cream mouthfeel and taste, picking up more cream and less water as the dominant characteristic in mouthfeel. I would drink this at any time of the day and also have a couple in a row because it is highly drinkable and delicious. The taste noticeably improves as the beer warms so don't drink it too fast.","bkrueger","Nov 08, 2011"
4.82,6.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"FBS is a very iconic beer and it's easy to see why. The label brands the beer as a double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout, and that is exactly what it is. In my mind it is an almost perfect example of the coffee/chocolate stout. So glad I got my hands on some very fresh bottles of this.","mullenpc","Nov 08, 2011"

4.5,-0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It goes without saying that this is one of my favorite, easily accessible beers.

4.8,6.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"O- an excellent beer. Most people shy away from porter based on color alone. This is a very balanced yet flavorable beer- I got my fiancee to try this beer and she liked it also.","OsuJohn","Nov 06, 2011"
4.85,7.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"I love this stout. It is one of my all time favorite beers. It has been a go-to brew in suggestions for friends who are interested in trying stouts for the first time.

4.56,0.9,5,4,4.5,5,5,"Wow- Breakfast in in a beer. Dark like the nights. Year old beer and was perfect. Can't imagine Fresh. Chocolate and coffee cascading over your mouth. Should be good as a milkshake as well with some ice cream- no joke. Smell was roasted malt and hints of coffee. Only wish it had more head to it but could be that is is so old. Masterful Beer.","boyfromthenorth","Nov 05, 2011"
4.5,-0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a pils glss. Just a wonderful offering from Founders! Pours black, with a 1/4" brown head that every world class stout has. Smell was of dark, burnt roasted malt and cocoa...followed by the dark roasted coffee. Taste followed the smell in order of the flavors that hit your tastebuds. Mouthfeel was would you would expect of a stout of this caliber....silky....no...velvetty. Fantastic beer!","Brambleman","Nov 04, 2011"
4.38,-3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is one my favorite beers that is readily available. I must say I prefer a fresh bottle as the hops balance out the massive roastiness. Regardless this is one to savor. Founders Brews some of the BEST STOUT beers.","Icepak","Nov 04, 2011"
4.42,-2.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours pitch black with a finger of light brown head. Thick, sticky lacing. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. Taste mirrors the nose with huge coffee notes and layers of decadent chocolate. A nice roasted malt backbone asserts itself mid-palate. There's a hint of hoppy bitterness and pepper in the finish which is really nice. The beer is full bodied with a low level of carbonation which lends a creamy quality to it. The quintessential oatmeal stout. One of my all time favorites. Highly recommended.","Sideswipe","Nov 03, 2011"

3.62,-19.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a very dark brown/black. A dark tan head never really forms and recedes quickly to a wash. Smell is a *lot* of dark-roasted coffee, with a hint of sweetness. Taste starts off creamy, and like nutty, roasted beans with a dollop of sweeter dark chocolate. But this quickly morphs into a bitter, drying cacao. A *lot* of bittering hops for this one, and they overshadow the roast & chocolate. Finishes intensely dry. Has a fair amount of complexity going for it, but I just did not get the amount of chocolate I was hoping for. Or oats. The heat is noticeable. I can't help but feel let down by this high-rated brew..","sixerofelixir","Nov 02, 2011"
3.77,-16.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: My expectations led me to believe this would be a creamier beer. The higher IBU and alcoholic content + presence of bottle sediment lead me to believe this beer would benefit significantly from aging. If I could intuit another brewer's mindset, the 60 IBUs is a preservation technique, not so much a flavor effort. That being said, this beer should begin ripening in approximately 6 months and continue to grow over an indefinite number of months.","beerismysavior","Nov 02, 2011"

4.18,-7.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O: I was a little disappointed, as I bit on the massive hype surrounding FBS and its brethren. I'd love to get my hand on some CBS and see how it compares. I prefer the direction an Imperial Stout like Parabola goes rather than this one.","tito42","Nov 01, 2011"

4.8,6.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The taste backs up the smell. It's so complex and yet so simple in it's presentation. All the flavors that you have on the nose greet you with every sip. There isn't anything buried here and the taste is consistent throughout every sip. It leaves you with a fine coffee finish that lingers until you take another taste. It's almost punishment at this point. You want the experience to last all night but as the glass empties I have regret in knowing my supply is diminishing.","robboyd","Oct 31, 2011"

4.55,0.7,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"I will say right out front that this is bar far my favorite stout ever. Excluding the CBS and to be tasted soon, KBS. This thing pours with a bit of tan head; amazing coffee and chocolate smell that lasts the entire time. It only get better as it warm. I could drink this right out of the package no refrigeration at all. The oatmeal seems to add just the right amount of feel to this stout to make this a nice slow drinker but the alcohol is just in the right proportion that i want to drink this all night. For the few bottles ive had the carbonation has been a little all over the place; some have had a bit more than other but i cant complain. Founders you keep making great beers and i will keep buying.","HOPPYKC","Oct 28, 2011"
4.33,-4.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"One of the best stouts I've had to date. Heavy on flavor without being a huge, hot, sipping beer. Imperial stouts are rarely something that impress me very much, but this one definitely did.","musicforairports","Oct 28, 2011"

4.68,3.5,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Wonderful taste, wonderful mouthfeel. Everything to be expected, chocolate, roastiness, coffee. Where this beer excels is the cleanliness. It tasted so fresh and well crafted, there were no faults to be found. As the beer warmed I could really wrap my mouth around it. This is a must try.","FaustieMo","Oct 25, 2011"
4.52,0,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5," The taste begins slightly nutty and sweet w/ mild caramel malt and launches into a roasty coffee flavor which is both earthy, spicy and slight bitter with mild burnt elements, but very mild char with the yeast giving an almost creamy and fruity tanginess which compliments the tannin from the dark grain well. The hop spice and roasted malt character is not too far to come off as harsh, just enough to let the beans contribute their delightful flavor with a very mild alcohol compliment in the semi-dry roasty finish. Overall a classic coffee stout, simple hones to goodness and you get the added benefit of a little cocoa for an all around mocha-like Imperial stout. I recommend this to anyone who likes stouts coffee or both!","Slatetank","Oct 25, 2011"
4.53,0.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"overall this beer is solid. this is the benchmark stout as far as im concerned. this is going to be the stout that i want my homebrewed stouts to taste like.","spitInTheOcean","Oct 24, 2011"

The fact that the brewer had made it a chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee stout at the same time is simply astonishing, as is the way these ingredients all work out together.

I'm a fan of coffee things (but not hot coffee itself, I add irrelevantly), and this falls into that category, but I don't know if I'm going to be going after it with equal anticipation next fall.

4.5,-0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - Superb. It goes without saying though, that you must be a fan coffee/expresso flavors.

4.62,2.2,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"O- It's no secret that this is world class beer, and I feel like it's become much more readily available in the midwest during its seasonal run, thus spoiling me towards just about any other stouts I bring home in its place. I honestly haven't had actual coffee this smooth and well-defined, and that goes double for any stout that regulates its own sweetness so well.","gigaknight","Oct 17, 2011"
3.77,-16.6,2.5,3,4.5,2,4.5,"So..kinda conflicted about this. It tastes delicious but isn't particularly attractive and feels weird in the mouth which makes it difficult to enjoy.

I gave it some points cause I appreciate the craftsmanship even if it isn't for me","HossMcGraw","Oct 17, 2011"
4.21,-6.9,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"O - Still one of my all time favorite stouts. The nitro pour, while offering amazing looks and feels, does hurt the smell and taste a tiny bit. I will never turn down a pour of BS but I may stick with regular tap from now on.","orangesol","Oct 17, 2011"

4.72,4.4,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"There's not much I can say except that this is absolutely masterful--it's very dark, very smoky, lovely cereal taste, with dark full chocolate on the front of the tongue and then an incredibly long coffee finish, maybe one of the longest finishes I've ever experienced in an alcoholic beverage. So smooth yet thick, so assertive, such a great combination of chocolate, espresso, and just enough hop bite... the only reason I can't give it 5s across the board is that I've had Kentucky Breakfast Stout, and I liked that even better.","lstokes","Oct 16, 2011"

3.92,-13.3,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"D/O: This double stout seems to have all the bases covered, but like its peers that also occupy the range of 8-9% abv, it would be so much more impressive if it were not as strong. Hops are apparently not for breakfast, leaving this beer to gather its aromatic qualities almost entirely from the coffee that is quite bold in its sensory profile. It is able to be more than just a one-note coffee bomb, even though coffee is the single most intense quality present. Oddly, there is too much cardboard present for a strong stout that is this fresh. Despite the heavy coffee presence and other minor question marks, this beer is easy to consume while staying interesting from start to finish.","beagle75","Oct 15, 2011"

4,-11.5,4,4,4,4,4,"O- a really good Imperial Stout that isn't too strong like some cough syrup tasting Imperials, but isn't too weak either. Very smooth, very delicious, very strong... it's ma go to brew! Not a session beer, one is enough usually. On tap at Founders it tastes quite a bit better than in a bottle, more so than most beers.","FoundersFanatic","Oct 14, 2011"
4.5,-0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"T/M: The creamy oats makes this beer smooth drinking. Wonderful notes of cocoa, coffee and milk, mocha, chocolate chip muffin, buttery notes, cookie dough; balance is present with hoppy suggestions in the finish along with an espresso-like bitterness, as a matter of fact that is dead on the aftertaste in an espresso. Some burnt sugar, pie crust, rum bread. Like all Founders big beers, the alcohol is just non-existent, this stout is such great drinking not sure if it gets much better for a seasonal stout that is pretty much in abundance every year.","biga7346","Oct 14, 2011"
4.05,-10.4,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This is an excellent beer. This beer pours jet black with very little head. It smells of coffee concentrate and dark chocolate. The carbonation is unobtrusive. This beer was less creamy then I expected, although one could not exactly call it thin either. Coffee dominates the taste, although chocolate notes creep in the finish, especially as the beer warms. Good stuff, and I would drink it more often if I could.","mentaltraveller","Oct 14, 2011"

The head was thin and tan colored with very nice lace. Smell was coffee/espresso with some sweet malt. The taste was very good....decent bodied stout with coffee/espresso taste tahe dominates. The mouthfeel was awesome... I like full bodies stouts that don not mess around. Overall this was a very good stout and I highly recommend it. Would love to drink this a an early morning tailgate.","WoodBrew","Oct 13, 2011"

4.47,-1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Sad this beer is not distributed to Florida. Breakfast stout is in a class of its own.

4.38,-3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: There isn't anything else to say about this beer. I could drink this beer at any meal, any season of the year (although, a cold morning paired with some maple syrup oatmeal would make for the perfect start of a day).","bramsdell","Oct 09, 2011"

4.25,-6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours black with an ample cocoa head. Fantastic looking. Holy crap this beer smells good. One of the best smelling non-hoppy beers under 9% (yeah, its a lot, just go with it). Smell is deep, rich coffee, oats, roasted malts. Yum. Taste is pretty nice, but maybe a touch below the smell. The oatmeal overpowers the coffee a touch, and it melds into a really, good, but just slightly acrid. The mouthfeel is big, but not quite as creamy as I would have hoped, but I am being picky. Solid carbonation. Overall, this is a really, really solid beer.","seeswo","Oct 08, 2011"
4.92,8.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"O -- This is an absolutely fantastic beer. I've had it before, and thought it was good, but having this fresh bottle makes me realize how much the coffee had faded in the older bottles I'd had the last time I had Breakfast Stout. Founders proves again why they're one of the top 3 breweries in the world.","mmmmmbeeer","Oct 08, 2011"

4.4,-2.7,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Black with a slight brown head that gathers at the intersection of glass and brew. Completely opaque. Strong smell of coffee. Very smooth, tastes like coffee and a little chocolate. Finishes slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is the best aspect of this brew. Very smooth and heavy with little carbonation.

4.45,-1.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Really well made beer that shines above a lot of the rest that have the same qualities and complexity.  I imagine it is above others due to the quality of ingredients used, but also due to the balance.  Incredibly smooth and delicious beer that is always a pleasure to have. ","Mississipping","Oct 08, 2011"
4.43,-2,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"O- Certainly a favorite. While it isn't complex, this beer does everything right. It's very much like Speedway Stout in that matter: doesn't do anything revolutionary, but everything it does is done perfectly. Could I drink this for breakfast? Hell yes. The beer has no alcohol flavor, tons of coffee and chocolate aroma and taste, is affordable, and goes down frighteningly easy. What a beer.","jm1229","Oct 07, 2011"
4.43,-2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall / Drinkability: Well, maybe I should have this for breakfast some day with that very strong coffee flavor. Otherwise, a great after-dinner beer (went well with a few pieces of dark chocolate) but I would bet that this would be really good with diner food or a burger. Or...well - breakfast.

4.15,-8.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall - A great stout with complex flavors...the front, middle, and backend flavors are well-aligned and flow very well together. Sweetness and bitterness are extremely well-banced. However, the lack of a more silky texture keeps this from being an upper echelon stout...although it is 8.3% ABV, it drinks as a more pedestrian oatmeal stout.","Uhlikm","Sep 28, 2011"

While still having one in my cellar from my cousin, I'm glad I found this one (and grabbing one of the last 6 they had) to see what this one was all about. So complexed, you could drink this over and over and still get new attributes! Very much enjoyed this brew and am excited to try one that is going to age for years to come.","DCon","Sep 27, 2011"

Each sip follows easily from the last gradually the level of the liquid lowers with never a moment during which one thinks, “I’ve had enough of this one.” My overall impression is that this beer deserves its recognition as an outstanding example of the class. That said, however, I must confess that I’m coming to prefer my stouts with just a touch more sweetness to add to the complexity. I'm also not 100% sold on strong coffee flavors in a stout.","drtth","Sep 21, 2011"

The taste is a very strong roasted bitter chocolate with some hints of coffee and molasses throughout. The oatmeal keeps it from becoming too bitter while making it chewy and smooth at the same time. The mouthfeel is very smooth, thick and sticky at the end. Overall this is a chocolate lovers dream come true. A yummy winning beer with a good quality chocolate taste.","DannyDan","Sep 15, 2011"

4.39,-2.9,4,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Very deep dark brown almost black. Not using a good glass, so I have little to no head, just a thin mocha lacing. Previous experience is a thick tight chocolaty brown head. From the time I popped the cap it's been nothing but coffee. After sticking my nose in the glass, I get a hint of bitter chocolate with overtones of oatmeal...but mainly a shit-ton of awesome coffee. The flavor follows the nose well, big sweet oatmeal upfront, with a nice transition to a smooth chocolate flavor fading into bitter chocolate and huge dark roasted slightly bitter coffee. The big silky mouthfeel gets washed away nicely by the carbonation letting the coffee and hop bitterness play on the back of the pallete nicely. If I could drink this for breakfast everyday I would. Kudos to founders for yet another incredible stout!","PhineasGage","Sep 15, 2011"

4.44,-1.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Black in color with dark brown hues on the edges of the glass. Poured with a brief beige headthat quickly dissipated quickly leaving a beige ring around the glass. A nice combination of dark roasted mat and freshly ground dark coffee aromas. Earthy vanilla and dark choclate aromas intensify as this warms up a bit. Delicate, buttery smooth, but thick feel. Dark roasted malt flavors up front that slowly allow dark roasted coffee flavors thru the middle to end. A nice even bitter dark chocolate and herbal hopines from beginning to end that lingers after the finish. Similar to the aroma, mellow vanilla and dark chocolate flavors intensify as the beer warms a bit. The higher abv is only apparent in the warmth of this beer as the intense flavors squash the potetnial booziness. Delicate textures and complex flavor and aromas made this very enjoyable.","IronLover","Sep 14, 2011"

This beer smells like a coffee shop. Taste strong notes of coffee, complemented with bitterness from the hops and is balanced out by the sweetness from the chocolate. All of the flavors mesh together perfectly. Beer is well carbonated and finish is smooth. Overall this is an amazing beer.

Mouthfeel is creamy but not too thick, very easy to drink for the style. Taste is smooth and chocolatey upfront giving way to a massive blast of rich coffee flavor and bitterness. Hardly any alcohol is detectable. Overall, one of my all time favorites. Have been drinking it for years but haven't reviewed it until now.

That's exactly what it tasted like, with a finish of bittersweet chocolate and toasted oatmeal. It's thick, creamy, and quite bitter. It reads more like a coffee with alcohol than it does a beer, but that's fine by me.","McNealc31","Sep 05, 2011"

There is lots of soapy bubbles at the top but then they condense finely further down. I would have liked to see more lacing though. Aroma is ridiculously good. Tons of roasted coffee, toasted grains, dark chocolate, and a sweet milky background. Not really picking up any alcohol in the nose. Sweet caramel and roasted bittersweet coffee up front. Getting more toasted grains and some bitter dark chocolate through the middle. Finish is chocolaty and has a nice touch of warming alcohol. Mouth feel is excellent.

The smell is roasted and super chocolatey! The coffee kind of blends in with the malts and chocolate. The taste is so nice, the flavors are just balanced so well.

Last night he went hard on some gladiolus and luxuriance and passed out shortly thereafter. But how long could he keep up with this hardcore lifestyle. His manager didn’t care for him, he just propped him up with more vocab lists every night. His publicist just wanted him to win win win.

A bit overcarbonated and not quite as deep tasting as I remember it being in the bottle. Nice bitter and chocolate notes, but slightly thinner and a little less seemless and layered than in the bottle. A little like an egg cream in overall effect, I'd prefer a little more depth.

Taste is awesome, I actually will have this with breakfast sometime. It's like coffee but it's beer. Malts keep it from tasting bitter like cold coffee. Medium bodied with active carbonation. Overall, a fantastic beer and a great example of the style that I can toss back much too easily in the morning.","RodneyX","May 31, 2011"
3.74,-17.3,3.5,4.5,3,4.5,4,"Founder's Breakfast Stout pours an unflinching black. The tan head is on the small side, and the foam leaves a little bit of lacing stuck to the inside of the glass. The nose smells like I'm at work (candy shop) and just too a whiff of the jar of chocolate covered coffee beans, it's a spot on blend between coffee and milk chocolate. That balance isn't maintained though, as drinking the beer I have a hard time finding much chocolate at all. It's not quite drinking cold coffee, but it's disappointingly close. The mouthfeel is everything I've come to expect from Founder's Breakfast Stout beers. The beer's got a supremely rich and full body, with the smooth texture that oats contribute, and it's paired with a perfectly subdued carbonation that manages to stay out of the beer's way. I don't know if it was just being consumed at the same time as KBS and CBS, but FBS just didn't impress me as much as those two (and the imperial stout) did. As far as breakfast stouts go. I think I'd find myself reaching for Terrapin Wake n Bake instead.","axeman9182","May 27, 2011"

Moderately-high hoppiness, of the earthy/herbal type shows up in the finish as well, and meshes with the coffee quite nicely. Malts are super thick - only a few sips and already my lips are sticky sweet. It's really an amazing beer - starts with all that malt and chocolate sweetness, and then seamlessly transitions to a big coffee/hop bitterness. A bit of that oatmeal smoothness as well, which really brings everything together and keeps this from going "too far" into the extreme beer world. But make no mistake, this is a big beer that is certainly extreme. Alcohol imperceptable. Mouthfeel is superb. Finely carbonated but overall light in that department. Velvety smooth. Dangerously drinkable.","ExtraStout","May 23, 2011"

Toasted coffee & touches of chocolate on nose. Gentle upfront, dry nut bitterness & subtle sweetness. Coffee & traces of chocolate, once again, on the aftertaste. High carbonated, repeats on. Unfortunately froth doesn´t last, quickly dissipated lacing. Final sensation is a little disapointing.Fairly bland overall.","GONZALOYANNA","May 16, 2011"

Smells of robust coffee, dark chocolate, and some roasted oats. Taste starts with rich coffee followed by cocoa powder and the oats. Slight cocoa nib bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer is on the thicker side with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel even with a low level of carbonation.

Smells like roasted malts plus breakfast: coffee, creamy oatmeal, a tinge of chocolate. Chocolate is more prominent on the palate, with more coffee. Carbonation is medium, body is medium-light with some creaminess from the oatmeal, with the alcohol barely noticeable. Overall, a tasty everyday stout. My only beef with this is that the coffee taste has an uncanny resemblance to Folgers.","pmarlowe","May 09, 2011"

I got to say this is some very fine beer. The pour resulted in a medium brown two finger head with lots of clinging lace. The color of this brew is black, a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. I think this is the darkest beer I have had. Sort of looks like used motor oil, and has some of the clinging effect. Smell...wow, almost like a chocolate bar in liquid. There are aromas of chocolate, coffee, molasses, toffee, and cooked oats. Flavor is intoxication at room temperature. I taste milk chocolate, caramel, coffee, toffee, malt, molasses, and chocolate... oh I said that. Mouthfeel is like heavy cream and silk. Very rich and thick, with zing.

Even if this tastes extremely comparably to WnB, this will probably become my go-to Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout simply due to the fact that I can buy it locally when it's in season. The fact that it's 8% ABV and you can't taste or smell any of that heat is impresive. For $10/4 pack, you really can't go wrong.

Coffee dominates the scrumptuous flavor - quality coffee, worthy of a fine restaurant. There are also hints of unsweet chocolate and molasses. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy.

Smells very strong of coffee despite being a 2009 bottle (i would have expected the coffee to taper off). Coffee, burnt and toasted malts that make the chocolate flavor apparent. Tastes like exactly what the bottle describes, smooth, smooth, smooth dark chocolates, roasted malts bind together to form a very ominous delicious beer. No hop flavor or aroma really apparent, makes sense considering it's age but man is it good, and not too sweet. Carbonation is low and mouthfeel is sticky and viscous but not too sweet making this beer much easier to drink, considering it's alcohol you would never know it.

The fresh coffee carries over into the flavor. Big roasted coffee beans, coffee, coffee, coffee. Lesser, but still pronounced chocolate notes, oat, vanilla and sweet cream finish off the flavor. Exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. Can't believe this one is an imperial stout with it's massive drinkability and super smooth flavor. Such a huge, but perfectly crafted stout.","uustal","Feb 16, 2011"

However, the dimples on the sides of the glass allow the aromas of espresso to really come out. I started drinking espresso since I was a baby and this has the best qualities of it. The dark richness, and incredible scent. Beware, it's a sneaky beer. It isn't hairy like Old Rasputin, where you know the hammer will drop.

The taste is also world class, with malt and chocolate hitting me first, with an aftertaste of coffee. Pretty dry finish. Very smooth, and very drinkable. The alcohol is sneaky, as I don't taste it at all, but it's 8.3%. Probably wouldn't drink more than 2 of these in one sitting. GREAT beer- either on draft or in the bottle.

Very low carbonation, which is how a double stout should taste like. Coats your mouth and seems to stay with you for a few minutes afterwards. You've got to love coffee to fully appreciate the beer.

Taste is spectacular and follows the nose. A big beer probably designed to sip but i could finish this pint like i was drinking a glass of chocolate milk. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, very little carbonation which adds to the thickness.

The smell was very nice, but my expectations were very high. Roasted coffee and chocolate, not as in your face as expected. I let it warm for along 15 minutes, because I felt the temp was throwing off the smell. Finally dove in for a nice big gulp. Wow blew the smell away, desert in a glass. Coffee smacks you in the face, with a chocolate kiss at the end. Some hops, but just in the backround. Nice and thick mouthfeel, not over the top.

Looks like coffee mixed with cherry coke. LOTS of roasted coffee on the nose. Burnt coffee grounds even. But in a good way. Light chocolate and some roasted malt. A light caramel sweetness is the first taste to hit my tongue and then a blast of lower cacao dark chocolate. Really rich roasty burnt toasty coffee. Flavor to spare.

Taste is incredibly rich and amazing with nice balance of dark chocolate and bitter coffee, with caramel, oat, burnt malts, molasses, and a bit of vanilla. Small amount of bitterness present on the finish with lingering notes of dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla, molasses, and caramel.

4.37,-3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer is slightly buttery, it has a strong coffee/toffee flavor and is chocolaty to perfection. It pours beautifully portraying a thick creamy head and drinks very well in a V shaped pilsner class. I would session all night, for a thick beer it is balanced perfectly by base hops which really contrast the chocolate roasted malts.","BeerEndevour14","Nov 23, 2010"
4.37,-3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a viscous motor-oil black with a dense tan head. Aroma is a bouquet of roasted malts, espresso, and dark chocolate. Taste is coffee, coffee, and more coffee, or, if you want to be specific about it, roasted coffee beans. Some dark chocolate as well. Malt sweetness is a little muted, and so is the bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, and creamy. This one has been sitting on the shelf for almost two years, so it's definitely mellowed out a bit. I could probably go for more than one in a sitting.","NeutroMan","Nov 23, 2010"

I was led to believe this was a spiced stout more like a Christmas stout, but was happily surprised by the "coffee spicing" noted.

4.77,5.5,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Got this one in my first trade a while back. Thanks again Steve for popping my cherry! This bottle is from 2009 and poured into a tulip. The pour is pitch black with about three fingers of creamy looking mocha colored head that leaves sticking lacing along the side. The first smell into this one is full of dark fruits right away. Another dive in reveals a ton of chocolate aromas with hints of coarsely ground coffee. The aroma is spot on for this, everything I could want from an imperial stout; coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and good roasted malts. The taste mirrors the aroma perfectly. It starts with dark fruits and undertones of chocolate and coffee finish nicely. Again, everything I could want. The mouthfeel seems a bit light and the abv peers through ever so slightly. However, the drinkability is tough to beat for the style.","Bendurgin","Nov 09, 2010"

The nose comprises chocolate (both dark and milk), coffee, roasted malts, and molasses. The taste follows this pre-beaten path, though the molasses is diminished, the chocolate seems entirely dark, and the coffee lends a nice bit o' bitterness with its roastedness. The body is a rather hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a chewy feel.

The smell is mainly of smoked malts and coffee, with a bit of whiskey in the back. The taste is mainly whiskey and smoke. There are hints of both vanilla and roasted chocolate. This is a fairly smooth beer, but the alcohol is astringent on the palate. In spite of that it's still rather smooth and a extraordinarily nice drinking beer.

Nope, just coffee. Maybe a hint of hops, but everything is overshadowed by a fresh brewed coffee smell. Taste is bitter coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts and a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly coating, with a light/medium carbonation. Drinkability is good for the style despite the overpowering coffee flavor (I happen to love coffee). Gets much more balanced as it warms.","nkersten","Oct 20, 2010"

I'd have rated this brew the same in all regards though, as the aged 2009 bottles I had a couple months ago.

Let's hope I'm not disappointed. Hmmm... The smell, wow, just wow. A wonderful coffee aroma emits from glass, with a hint of sweet chocolate. My god, The taste is even better than the smell. It's a bit chewy, and exceptionally creamy. It tastes like smooth coffee, with espresso and dark dark chocolate thrown in, with the faintest amount of hops coming through in the aftertaste. I had nearly peed my pants when I saw this sitting on the shelf of my local beer and wine store, and boy it did not disappoint. I'll definitely be coming back for more.

Sour is as it should be with a healthy head of rather dark foam. Nose is a one dimensional but solid toast coffee malt wonderful. Boozy warm with a coffee grounds grit.

Some definite lacing going on here. Smell is of coffee and, more strongly, dark chocolate. The taste is incredibly smooth. I expected something bitter, but it's actually very smooth. The chocolate really comes out but it's not as complex as I would have expected. There isn't even a hint of the alcohol in this one. Mouthfeel is much thinner than the beer looks. In a way, this is a good thing, but I would have liked it a biiit thicker. It slides right on down, hardly coats the mouth and leaves almost no aftertaste.

Breakfast stout has more toasted malt in the flavor whearas KBS has more coffee. This beer reminds me of a vintage car. Probably one of the best of its time (when it first came out) and still pretty good, although no longer top of the line. I feel it's status in the top 10 is more of a historic level than current.

Right now it seems a bit more disjointed and spicy as the flavors are moving through their paces after you swallow, but are each too "raw" and are tuned to a cedar-like intensity.

The aroma is rich with black coffee and chocolate. Some caramel sweetness is also evident. The flavor is good, but a bit sweet and sorta washed out compared to the aroma. The coffee seems to get in the way in taste, unlike aroma where the coffee blends well. It just ends a little blandly coffee bitter and overpowers the other flavors. The feel is creamy and very smooth. Although I very much enjoyed the beer, the whole isn't quite greater than the parts.","popery","Sep 06, 2010"

The head sticks to my glass and leaves wonderful lacing as I partake of its yummy goodness. The aroma has a full on coffee kung-fu grip on my nostrils and I am loving it. Dark roasted malts and bitter cocoa fight to stand out against the beans, but despite their best effort, they only managed to add support and depth. The flavor is superb with more of the fresh coffee beans from the nose, bitter chocolate, astringent roasted dark malts and, what's this? Herbal, grassy and slightly skunky hops somehow make their way through the pitch black madness. This is one of those stouts that it is easy to close your eyes and imagine you are eating some sort of delicious dessert. The body is full, but not crushingly heavy or chewy. It has a great smoothness to it and a finish that is a mile long. The ABV is totally hidden and I could drink quite a few of these and still want more.

This beer tastes SO WELL BALANCED. I love it! Initially, I get such a soothing taste of espresso, followed by a very tasty chocolate that just makes my palate extremely happy. I then get some very sweet notes that linger on my palate (kinda like sweet coffee ice cream). I must also add, that as this beer warms up, the scents sort of blend together to make a sort of chocolate cake scent. The alcohol is scary how well hidden it is. The mouthfeel is almost perfect.

The biggest difference in that comparison would be viscosity of the two - as this one pours fairly watery. Breakfast Stout does not leave a bunch of lacing on the sides of my glass, and the smell/taste are definitely reminiscent of black coffee. I detect a hint of vanilla (not sure if this is correct?) and definitely some heavy tones of dark chocolate. Beautifully roasted malt action here to be sure. I wouldn't say this is my all time favorite stout, but it's darn close. I'm impressed that the alcohol isn't terribly noticeable despite checking in at 8.3%, but then again many brewers seem to be hiding the ABV well these days. This is my first time sampling from the bottle as I have only previously enjoyed this one on tap.

Lots of coffee, dark chocolate, and an oatmeal sweetness. The nose really comes through on the palate with coffee upfront that blends into a deep tart sweet ester finish that leaves a long dark coffee tartness in your mouth. This is a great non-session beer. I feel that its brother (KBS) often overshadows it (respectively). This is a different beast and will take the chill out of winter.

Aroma of wonderful black coffee and dark chocolate. The flavor that seems to hit the palette first is the coffee but when you swirl it around in your mouth it's amazing how all of the different flavors stand out. The kona coffee, dark chocolates, roasted malt and a bit of hop presence. This is a great beer.","CaptinRedBeard","Jan 28, 2010"

I'm not even sure it's top-50. Maybe I'm a curmudgeon. Who knows. Mikeller Beer Geek Breakfast is still the stuff for me when it comes to coffee stouts.

4.3,-4.9,4,4,4,5,5,"The label shows a little kid in a bib eating a bowl of oatmeal. It also states it contains 60 IBU's and 8.3% alcohol by volume (ABV). Founders only offers this beer November through January and it is fairly difficult to find. This particular batch was bottled 11-6-2009 as evidenced by the born on date. After an aggressive pour, 3 fingers of espresso foam colored head formed which gradually receded to a thin top layer that never dissipated. The beer itself was jet black and completely opaque even to direct light. The lacing on this beer was wonderful. It built up at every level the beer was left after every gulp the whole way down the glass like growth rings on a tree. Fantastic aroma gave off the smell of stale coffee, grainy hops, and sweet roasted malts. Flavors ranged from bitter sweet chocolate, to strong brewed iced coffee, to the aggressive bitters of the 60 IBU's derived from the hops. Rather high for IBU's in a stout but it worked very well without a distinct floral hop essence. Extremely creamy and smooth texture is probably due to the oatmeal they used in the brewing process and gives the perfect not-to-thin not-to-thick mouth feel. For the ABV this is a scary easy to drink beer with a slightly sessionable feel to it. The only significant sign of the size of this beer is the slightly sticky feeling it leaves on your lips after a swig. This is the third founder's beer I have tried in just over a week and have to say this is a top notch brewery! The Breakfast Stout clearly stands out as an upper tier offering and I highly recommend it. Worth the search.","hopsbreath","Jan 26, 2010"
4.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"OVERALL: This stuff is what people write home to their mothers about. Fantastic stuff and well worth the hype. By far the best coffee flavored stout I've had so far, and the flavors mesh excellently with the chocolate and oatmeal. Very enjoyable, though the bold flavors do start to get a little overwhelming after a glass or two. Non-the-less, this one is a real treat of the brewing industry and I hope it continues to find its way overseas.","Jeffo","Jan 26, 2010"

Smell is mainly of very good coffee. Taste follows the smell, and you get very tasty coffee right away. I get a perfect blend of a bit of hops, toasted malt and a hint of chocolate too. The most harmonious blend of tastes I've ever had in a stout. They blend perfectly. Mouthfeel is great. Not too thick or syrupy, but has substance. A solid dark beer.

With that criteria in mind, this is an almost flawless beer. There are so many different things going on in the smell and taste that each assert themselves boldly and clearly. When you couple that with a beer that also extremely smooth and drinkable, you have a really exceptional brew.

It pours a beautiful cocoa color with lacing throughout the drink. The smell on this is the best part. It has a great chocolate smell with the coffee underneath lingering in your nose. It has an extremely subtle taste. It's heavy on the coffee with just a hint of oat on the back end. Pretty high drinkability for a stout. This creamy concoction just rolls over the tongue.

My first impression upon a mouthful is a nice herbal hop and deep coffee malt. The hops don't hit you hard but it's a real nice blend with a fair alcohol note. It's fairly bitter while delivering malty sweetness and has a velvetty feel. The drinkability is probably marginal but boy it's tastey stuff.","Durge","Dec 29, 2009"
4.55,0.7,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Pours thick black with a medium sized brown head. Smell has notes of coffee and roasted malt but I think the dominant aroma is strong dark chocolate. Black coffee flavor up front with some roasted malt. Deep bitter chocolate flavors throughout blend nicely. Really nice. Some moderate bitterness throughout. Underneath there is a slight sweetness which provides some balance. Medium to full bodied but not as heavy as you might expect. Smooth. Pretty easily drinkable. A really great stout.","burnstar","Dec 29, 2009"

Big punch of coffee and roasted malt in the nose, I get a sense of hops but its out done by the roast and coffee. The taste repeats the smell and is big on black coffee and roasted malt. Bitterness is respectable and the hops are there. Its drinkable, which I must say, I really like. I love a huge 10% stout just as much as the next person but I really appreciate a stout with huge flavor and less alcohol because I always want a second.

As the beer warmed to room temperature, I got more of a chocolate smell but coffee was always the main aroma. The taste is expectedly black coffee, easily the most coffee-filled beer I have ever drank. You never get too much chocolate flavor, but you get bitterness from the chocolate which is nice.

The coffee essence is strong but not overwhelming and the chocolate oatmeal and thick malt might as well be a chocolate breakfast cereal, or better yet, oatmeal with a splash of Bailey's in it. The sweet characteristics border on overwhelming the palate, but there is definite malt bitterness to hold it off, and the hop presence in the finish (which is so subtle that it could easily be missed) is a nice contrast. Overall, this is a very nice beer, though it lacks a certain depth and vividness that prevents it from reaching the level of the very best Imperial stouts that I have had.","nickfl","Nov 22, 2009"

The aroma is very rich roasted coffee and chocolate scents. The flavor is smooth packed full off roasted barley, coffee, and chocolate flavors. Very little hop presence behind such big flavors but the balance is great. The body is very thick from the oatmeal and is smooth and velvety with low carbonation.

The billowy head shows various shades of light brown and leaves nice lacing. Smells like good french roast coffee beans and bitter chocolate. Some tanginess from hops and smokiness. Tastes like it smells with some toffee, citrus, and dark fruits, especially as it warms a bit. Goes down way too easy, and I would have to make an effort not to drink too many of these if I had such a supply! Alcohol isn't detected at all, and the mouthfeel shows that oatmeal slickness.

The Coffee is strong, but i do also set hints of chocolate, as if i'm about to drink a mocha beer-ccino. The taste is overpoweringly coffee, the chocolate that i smelled is now also fairly prevelant. The beer is also very heavy, to the point that after I had drank half of it, i no longer wanted to eat. This is the definition of "meal in a glass".

Some hints of dark chocolate start to poke through and a hint of sweetness eventually appears after several sips. Almost half the beer is gone before i really discern any hop flavors. Mouthfeel is decent, but perhaps a bit thin for the size of the beer. Drinkability is also good.

4.62,2.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured it into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass (after much debate as I do with many stouts). I've never seen a beer with this look before, incredibly impressive. It pours out completely jet black with a small dark brown head that is really more like a ring around the edges. When held up to the light there is still nothing but black the whole way around, it doesn't even get lighter on the edges, very impressive. There really isn't much lacing to it. The lace slides down the side back to the liquid, there are a couple of small patches that stay on the glass, but you can count them all on one hand. The smell is so complex but amazing. You can smell dark bittersweet chocolate, espresso and coffee. It's all pretty potent and even after all that you can smell hops. Yes, this is a well hopped brew which I found pretty intriguing. ***I had to let this beer warm up a bit, when it was cold it really compromises the taste and smell, I'd recommend only leaving it in the fridge for about a half and hour than drinking it, or maybe don't even put it in the fridge at all. When drinking it too cold it taste and smells a little more like a cheap coffee ingredient which I don't believe is the case.*** The taste was just as complex as the smell. You can taste the oatmeal, both bitter and sweet chocolate as well as espresso and coffee. All that is followed by some what tastes like dry hops which again goes after the bitter taste buds on the tongue. There also tastes like there area roasted and burned malts. The balance among all the flavors and tastes is quite incredible. The mouthfeel is obviously very full bodied, it's such a thick beer it's like drinking a thick hot chocolate when it's not so hot. This beer is incredibly drinkable, I could sip on it all day.","AndyAvalanche","Oct 14, 2009"

The coffee and chocolate play in the background. Bitterness is moderate. Alcohol is not detected. Medium to full body with nice carbonation. Texture is a tad unremarkable.

The aroma is definitely coffee-centered, but the flavor brings a lot more to the table. In addition to the roasted and bitter coffee flavor, a wonderfully subtle malt sweetness and the earthiness of the oatmeal brings a terrific balance. The overall experience is still very much like a blend of a good dry stout with some fresh brewed java, but with the combination being better than the sum of the parts. I often drink my coffee black, so by comparison FBS goes down surprisingly smooth. I find it to be not nearly as heavy as it looks or as its stats would indicate, and it is dangerously drinkable.

This is probably the fourth or fifth time I have had this baby, finally get the chance to review it. This is probably the way a stout should look, pitch black with a dark TAN two finger head that retains like a swimming pool evaporates, it sticks around for a while. This also has the thickest lacing I have ever seen, I love it, my glass is pretty much tan now instead of clear, the lacing also sticks of the glass about 1mm into the glass, crazy. Stouts should aim for this look. Smell is great here but it's probably the weakest part of the beer, somehow. It is mostly coffee and roasted malts, the chocolate doesn't really shine through for me and I would want it to more. Taste is absolutely orgasmic. You get lots of coffee, lots of oatmeal sweetness, some dark bitter chocolate and roasted malts also, there is some hoppiness in the end of the taste also, a great balance of many tastes that I love. I just picked up on a milky/vanilla flavor in the end of the taste. The mouthfeel is great for the style and this beer, it is thick like oil, has great carbonation, no real alcohol presence at all and leaves a great bitter coffee aftertaste on the tongue, another five. Drinkability is perfect for me also, the taste is enough for me to drink those one many times in the future, I don't think I would get sick of the flavors after one or two of these (would never session this one anyways), the price is fine for the amazing quality of this one, I will definitely buy this one again, thank you Founders.","cbutova","Sep 19, 2009"

Huge coffee bitterness mellowed by a great balance of dark chocolate and oatmeal. The coffee taste on this one is great, compares the intensity of speedway or peche. Very well balanced flavors here. Very creamy on the tongue, full bodied and a nice heavy coat with the finish. The carbonation lays low here, and the alcohol is masked quite well. This is very drinkable for what it is.

Some oatmeal flavor is present, adding to the wholesomeness of this beer. Medium bodied with an excellent finish with espresso and dark chocolate characteristics, it's awesome. The nitro-pour is a little disappointing, though - the first few sips are incredibly creamy, but as I wait for the beer to warm up, it turns to being a little flat and just a little watery.

To be sure, this is an impressive brew in many ways, for instance the manner in which the chocolate and the coffee interact with each other and present a united front to one's palate.

It's 8:25p.m. and the OVERPOWERING coffee nose has me thinking I'm late for work! Chocolate and malt play the role of The Pips to the Gladys Knight that is the coffee nose. Very complimentary and one I could spend all night only taking giant whiffs of this beer and be content. Just as the coffee dominates the smell, it takes over the taste as well. I love a good cup or two of coffee each morning, but I was expecting the chocolate to come out differently in this - possibly sweeter? Don't get me wrong, the chocolate is present, but it reminds me of a baker's chocolate - very sharp. The malts do play off of the coffee well, however. Being surprised, actually very surprised, at the taste doesn't degrade this in my book as I now view it in a different yet positive light than my expectations going in. Mouthfeel is light, not chewy but coats the throat and leaves a noticeable aftertaste. I am only halfway through my beer and just like every morning 12 hours from now with my first large coffee, I find myself involuntarily wanting another.

The coffee nose on this is far more intense on tap than in the bottle, some bitter chocolate and roasted malt notes dance in the background but it's all about the coffee with this one. The first go 'round I rated this beer as a 5 on the taste and having it on tap only solidifies the 5 stance. Insane coffee flavoring. It's prominent and in your face but not over the top. Roasted malt flavoring evens it out a bit in the middle and and creamy flavoring mixed with a deep bitter chocolate round this out at the end. The flavor on this baby was really, really intense. I you like coffee, you'll love this! Even though roasted coffee was the main flavor there was good balance here. I noticed some malts and some cream flavor and maybe some bittersweet chocolate in the finish. This is a full bodied, low carbonation, rich, silky and creamy body with a thick sticky finish to it. In this case, my 5 drinkability lends more to simply sitting and enjoying rather than sessionable. Though... in bottle form I've put a few back.

The flavors were equally apropos to the style, lots of roasted malt and chocolate, both milk and dark along with some smoked notes and earth. The alcohol was surprisingly well-concealed yet the flavors still robust and rich - complex but dangerously drinkable! Oh my! The body was full, the carbonation perfect and the mouthfeel smooth.

I could immediately smell everything that went into the beer, the oats, the rich chocolate, and the sweet distinct aroma of steeping coffee. On the palate, it was very creamy with tastes of burnt breakfast cereal, thick chocolate and the bitterness of coffee to finish. It tasted like cheerios, mixed with chocolate milk, with a cup of strong Italian roasted coffee in a pint glass. My mouth was exploding with flavor as the beer coated and clung every square inch of my mouth.

I just don't think it's "A-worthy." The balance for me is a bit off and the coffee too intense. About mid-bottle it hit me that this tastes nearly EXACTLY like one of my homebrews (muck and mire version #2, batch #12). I've still got a bunch of it because I just don't care for it too much. It hits the spot once in a while, but for the most part it's just not what I would normally go for.

Less sweet than many big stouts, with lots of coffee, light roasted malt, chocolate, and mild hops. Medium-full body with smooth texture.

It smells mildly of coffee and chocolate, and tastes mildly of coffee, chocolate, a bit of roast, and not much more than a hint of oatmeal. The flavors are surprisingly mild for a stout, though they are a nicely balanced mix. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout--this one actually reminds me of Deschutes Black Butte porter.

It seems to be a little bit "boozy." As it lingers in the mouth the roasted flavors start to come out towards the finish and the aftertaste. I can pick up chocolate very late and probably in fact in the aftertaste. The coffee flavors carry the day late in the flavor for sure. It actually causes me to flip back in my beer notes to a beer that I had a couple months ago from Flat Earth Brewing in Saint Paul, MN called Black Helicopter Coffee stout. I think that I had really hyped this beer up in my mind because of its reputation on this site, and its tough to live up to that much hype. Its good, but I have had stouts that I have enjoyed more.

The waves of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors try to hold off the alcohol as long as they can, but it slowly creeps in near the end of the glass to remind you that this is an imperial stout after all.  Drinkability is quite nice for 8%+ ABV stout, but I think this is best enjoyed as a sipper.

Smell is wonderful with coffee dominating and a slight earthiness detectable deep down. Taste is coffee flavours from start to finish with a slight earthy hop bitterness augmenting the coffee on the finish. Mouthfeel is quite heavy with *just* enough carbonation. Terrific and worthy of 5,0 in my opinion! The 8,3%abv is rather well concealed, too, making this very drinkable (all things considered). A very well crafted stout that represents the style well. I'll certainly seek this out in the future.","SilentSabre","Apr 04, 2009"

More of the coffee comes through on the taste, which is also nice and complex with dark chocolate and roasted dark malt. Finish is dry, roasted malt, with some hoppy bitterness.

Thsi beer is everything a double stout should be: medium-to-full bodied, smooth and creamy like butter, sweet with chocolate notes and yet has a dry backbite thanks to the roasted and coffee notes. Mixed well and also has some chewiness to it from some bread malt. Even has some minor molasses and/or maple syrup notes as it can get sticky at times.

Burnt, bitter flavors dominate the taste with gobs of coffee and some dark cacao. Earthy character with an astringent finish. As hard as it is for an RIS to be unbalanced, this one is; a dry stout beefed up with spent Folger's grinds. It does have a thick feel, but it's too oily to be a real positive. Definitely a sipper.

Smell was quite interesting: once again I utilized my mom's nose to better distinguish it and she nailed it: smells smoky, but it has a distinct Greek olive smell. Those big Greek olives you get on your salad. Since I don't really like that smell, I had to knock it down a bit. Taste was fantastic - chocolatey, smokey, raisins, and black black coffee. Definitely not a taste for the faint-hearted. Mouthfeel was the strongest feature - creamy, smooth, and soft all the way down your throat. This isn't a session beer, but with its abv, I'd probably order two or three, especially on tap. Don't pass this one up, gents.","raoulduke37","Feb 11, 2009"

The taste was just as good if not better, I take that back it was better. Again with the coffee and chocolate, more coffee than chocolate for sure though. Medium to full bodied .

The taste is complex and inviting: the floral notes are forward, passing though to the savory robustness of mocha on through to a bitter finish with some drying but slight alcohol burn. The carbonation is very mild, and the body is thinner than you'd expect -- no sludge here. It's an easy one to drink, but a better one to savor.","gory4d","Feb 01, 2009"

4.87,7.7,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"I was so happy to stumble on this Founders brew, this is the first time that I have been able to locate any of their products, and thankfully it was the Breakfast Stout. This brew poured to a pitch black color with possibly some dark brown like highlights. The pour generated a full sized medium colored tan head of small bubbles that has very good retention. This retention gives great lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma, whoa, getting strong fresh coffee notes, almost like wet coffee grounds that is so inviting. Chocolate is also there, bitter sweet (?), that gives a fantastic mix. Also some roasty nut like aromas peak through. The flavor is intense, coffee flavor is clear from the start and then the end seems to give a coffee bitter finish. Chocolate is also there and that might be also playing into the bitter end that I notice. This is an amazing brew, such a fantastic flavor, this should be a sipper with the 8.3 %alcohol in it, which is not noticeable one bit, but is going down fast. The feel of this brew is nice and thick, yet smooth. The carbonation is on the lighter side which I like as its does not interfere with the rich malt flavors. This is one of the best brews that I have ever had, it packs so much into it and every part is simply spot on. I will never give a perfect score to a brew but this one is up there.

Full-bodied, smooth in mouthfeel with persistent carbonation for its weight. The grapey sweetness frames the attack, plum, raisin and raspberry fruit. Quite soon after the chicory, espresso bean, grilled nut, dark chocolate shades ratchet up the bitterness. The oatmeal and light caramel notes salve the wound.

Dark chocolate also is present, except it's not a real bitter dark chocolate, it's very in tune to the rest of the beer. A lot sweeter than I had imagined it would be. Just the barest hint of hops at the end, but this still trends towards the sweet side (for a big stout). has an oatmeal like smoothness to it, smooth but still a little sticky, doesn't quite have that velvety feel. Big, slick yet coating, without a ton of carbonation. In this case, it works. Maybe a little thin, not quite as all-enveloping that I had hoped. But it had big expectations to live up to.

The head lasted the entire time, even though I was drinking slowly. There's some good lacing. The beer itself is black and very beautiful. The smell is primarily coffee, but you get quite a good roasted scent, dark malts, some sweetness, but it's limited by the coffee. The taste is smooth, a bit bitter from the coffee, but backed up well by a roasted sweetness. The taste is really hitting on something nice, a bit more tolerable than pure bitter black coffee. The mouthfeel is good, with a decent rush of carbonation. The aftertaste does not have as much of the acrid coffee taste, especially after a couple of months. It's pretty easy to drink for an 'imperial' stout, though many beers in the category have similar ABVs which are lower than a RIS, but they have pumped up flavors. This beer is really great, and I could have another. I can say that in the future, I will probably purchase more.","taylorhamrick","Dec 26, 2008"

As this beer resided it left no lacing. The aroma is of strong coffee, bitter chocolate, molasses, and just a bit of cream. The flavor reminds me of coffee that has been sitting on for a couple hours and boiled down to a really strong concentration. The flavor follows suit with coffee dominating the flavor profile but honestly it's not a good coffee flavor. This beer is really astringent and the astringency drowns out the milk chocolate and molasses that are slightly detectable in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. It definitely has that nice oatmeal-y mouthfeel. While I'm generally a person that absolutely loves coffee stouts, this one just doesn't really do it for me.

Every little flavor character in this brew compliments and bring a balance to each. It's finishes just a robust as it starts never once giving you the impression that this it's an 8.3% cuz it's crafted so well.

Tight and slightly vocal brown head. The coffee and chocolate aroma is dead on. Not too bitter, perfectly balanced with just the right amount of sweetness. Much is the same with its taste. The oatmeal used makes for an extremely light body for its style and adds a mellowing bitterness to the sweet and high quality chocolate malts. The slightest of grassy hop twangs just before the finish adds to the overall greatness. I cant say enough about this one. The only problem i have about this beer is that i drink it too fast.

If I were to close my eyes when smelling this beer, I would swear I was smelling a fresh brewed cup of coffee. Bittersweet cocoa and fresh ground coffee beans prevail. It is black as night, with a cinnamon (yes, the label is very accurate) colored head that is slow to build and leaves bits of lace dotting the sides of the tulip glass all the way down. As I drink this, I am reminded of dark chocolated covered espresso bean candies. Bitter cocoa followed by a bitter coffee flavor. A slight hint of alcohol is also present. Mouthfeel is fairly thick, with a definite warming all the way down. The flavor clings to my mouth, not wanting to really disappear even after several minutes. Overall, I had quite high expectations for this beer. I can't say it has let me down, but I am also not sure that it is the best big stout I have had.

Decent sized head that faded quickly. Smell was of delicious roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste was fantastic. Tons of deep, dark flavors of wood, cocoa, and coffee. Nice and thick mouthfeel too, which is the way all Imperial Stouts should be. This is not a beer that you can drink quickly, though.

A band of foam coalesced around the shoulders of the glass. Some lacing present during the tasting, but weak legs. Nose is coffee beans, brown sugar, malt and a grapefruit sweetness (weird and out of place, but I picked it up nonetheless). Taste follows nose as well as oats. Mouthfeel is medium and lightly effervescent. Could have had a little more body for the style. Finish was also a bit chalky. All and all, easy drinking and flavorful without being overly sweet.

In short, its one damn fine looking beer. The aroma is incredible. Roasted coffee is dominant but there is more going on here, there is a bit of fudge as well. I can smell the coffee in this beer from a few feet away. Just after looking at and smelling this beer I cannot wait to try it. This beer does not disappoint. The roastyness is, initially less intense than the aroma, this simply serves to allow the malt, silky oats, and bitter chocolatey goodness to show themselves. There is a slight acrid character to this from the roasted malts (usually not something I welcome in beers but) it pairs incredibly well with the other flavors here. The roasted malts come after the chocolate but are replaced by a smooth silkiness from the oats. This flavor is overtaken by the coffee which lingers long into the finish. The mouthfeel is wonderful. At first it felt a bit thin but then as I let it linger a bit on my palate I was able to appreciate its greatness. It is medium-full in body and smooth as silk. It feels almost weightless yet heavy and robust at the same time. Drinkability on this is awesome, damn near exceptional. I'm trying to make the bottle last because it has evolved so wonderfully over the course on this glass that I can't wait to see how it'll change next. I had high expectations that got even higher after reveling in its beauty and intriguing aromas and, needless to say, my expectations were met.","mnj21655","Oct 04, 2008"

With the noticeable chocolate in it, as well, it is very, very reminiscent of chocolate-covered espresso beans. Thats basically exactly what this is.. a beer that is like drinking chocolate-covered espresso beans. Mouthfeel is fairly typical for a stout, though a little on the lighter side, definitely not as heavy as many stouts, which is a plus to me. Drinkability is, I feel, as good as a stout can be.

The flavor profile is a perfect match for the nose with a rich wave of bitter coffee at first quickly followed by a rush of bitter chocolate. The roasted grain also makes an appearance as does cherry and vanilla, but those flavors are lingering in the background when compared to the coffee and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel isn't as thick as one would probably expect, but it is medium to full bodied and velvety smooth.

4.27,-5.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours dark, opaque brown just short of black with a somewhat slight tan head. Smells of maple, honey, molasses, pear and coffee grounds. The taste is very coffee forward, like the bottom of a used coffee filter. That sounds like a knock, but I like it, not off putting or acrid, just bitter and heavily roasted. That note remains prominent throughout. A touch of prune pops up, along with a decent dose of semisweet chocolate. A drop of honey crops up toward the back. Hops seem nonexistent and the alcohol's pretty under the radar - really smooth. Coffee's where all the bitterness is coming from. The relatively thin (for the style) mouthfeel works here given the surprisingly mellow profile. Reminds me a ton of Mikkeller's Black Hole, but without the burn. Lacks a certain something, perhaps the abv kick the KBS gives, along with something to balance out the slightly too dominant coffee. I prefer the KBS myself, but my significant other with whom this was shared prefers the FBS. At any rate, a really nice Imperial Stout - thanks to autumnaldave for the Founders twofer.","grandq","Apr 27, 2008"
4.38,-3.1,5,4.5,4.5,3,4.5,"Breakfast Stout pours pitch black with full dark cream colored head that dissipates to a consistency of fluffy foamed milk leaving lacing down the side of the pint glass. The smell is bursting forth with coffee, really dominating the flavor, but there is certainly a lingering presence of sweet roasted and chocolaty maltiness. As the beer rolls over the tongue, the coffee again comes bursting to the forefront along with that malt characteristic that you would expect. This is very sweet and tasty. The mouthfeel is honestly a bit thin and very carbonated. I have seen a couple coffee imperial stouts come out quite carbonated (homebrew, and Terrapin's Wake-n-Bake) and wonder if this is a direct effect of the coffee. Overall, a remarkable easy drinking imperial stout with a fantastic in your face coffee flavor.","MSchae1017","Apr 26, 2008"

This feels more like a thick coffee than it does beer, but it's a good brew, not that free crap you might find at an auto shop or something. Fairly drinkable, but you've gotta love java.

4.69,3.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"A strong pour of both and I only get a half inch of head on the 05 but nothing but a few bubbles on the 07. Head is chocolate brown in color. Body on both is pitch thick oily black. The nose on each beer is a very different beast with the 07 you get full up front roasty coffee freshness like a fresh opened can of Folgers. On the 05 it is much more dark fruit, very over ripe and almost port like. The coffee is still there but plays a much more backround role. On first sip you get a very well balanced stout with roasty coffee intertwined nicely. Sweetness is long and topped off at the end with an even mineral based bitter. Now with the 05 once again the coffee feel is much subdued. The entire flavor profile is very mellowed out with a cleaner smooth mouthfeel. The dark fruit feel and soft sweetness are very even. Mouthfeel is textured and doughy but nice. While the mouthfeel for the 07 is a little more coffee bitter and more desireable. Overall these beers are both super drinkable. I must say I do like what this beer is fresh better though. I will make my ratings based on the fresh version.","SPLITGRIN","Apr 02, 2008"

4.87,7.7,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Pours a thick, viscous, sticky black liquid into a Duvel tulip, forming a good finger of khaki colored head and descending into a thin layer on top. Spotty lacing is left behind. Smells of rich roasted coffee, vanilla beans, dry oatmeal flakes, fresh cocoa beans. I get this in a lot of coffee stouts, but again I get notes similar to soy sauce. This is not a turn off in any way, just eludes to the potency of the malt character (4.5, smell). Taste is quite amazing, with the coffee character initially dominating but then falling back and letting the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla flavors come forward. There is a nice bitterness in the finish that is reminiscent of the bitterness you would expect from a rich dark chocolate. Coffee character stays in the nose after a good mouth-full. The alcohol is completely masked in taste. I can only recognize the alcohol in a little heat that I get in my cheeks in the mouthfeel. The flavors really come together to give a strong contrasting, yet beautifully balanced profile. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and can't wait until the next time I get the chance to try it once again. Thank you Founders.","beavers","Mar 24, 2008"

Served at cellar temperature, in an Imperial pint glass, from a twelve ounce brown, stubby bottle. Poured a deep thick black, almost like a cup of freshly brewed black coffee. Good thing I used an Imperial pint glass, to hold the amazing, three finger, coarsely bubbled, chocolate brown head. A huge head from a rather gentle pour. Head seemed never ending, leaving generous gobs of thick, sticky lace on the glass. Smell was thick with black coffee, some bitter sweet chocolate aromas, and some nice roasted/toasted malts and oats. A great nose on this one. A great flavor to it as well. More bitter black coffee, some sweet chocolate notes, and tons of flaked oats. Finished rather smooth and bitter with a tiny bit of warming alcohol. Just the perfect amount of carbonation. A nice smoothmouthfeel that seems a bit thin, but thin in a perfect way. Very good drinkability. The perfect start to the day.","jaxon53","Dec 24, 2007"

All the flavors of the nose come forth in tangy complexity. Sweetness and bitterness dance with each other, leaving roasted coffee and some citrusy hoppy bitterness in the finish...but the bitterness does not overwhelm.

Smell is of all the ingredients listed on the label.Tingles the mouth with what feels like bit of hops but that fades as soon as it makes its way down my throat. (I'm puzzled by this because the IBUs are only 25 and it doesn't seem like enough to be assert itself here). Heavy on roasted chocolate then transitions to coffe. Really painfully good.

Taste is very coffee like. Not getting any oatmeal or sweetness, but rather big roasty malt, and burnt, slightly bitter coffee grounds. It could use a bit more sweetness to pull it all together in my opinion, but it is still good. Overall, too burnt, and not enough sweetness.

Taste is rich, dry espresso, dark chocolate, strong roasted backdrop, mocha-coffee with a pronounced nutty bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and full, substantial body ... then a brazilnut or walnut dryness in a long, lingering finish that impresses. The finish is really quite remarkable as it just stays with you for a long, long time. Overall, there's a myriad of flavours and textures, complex, rich and rewarding; this is a real delight. The only drawback I thought was a bit of astringency that came with the long, drawn out finish. Not recommended for the timid, but essential for every other lover of well crafted beer.

The taste was awesome, simply awesome. A super smooth blend of rich coffee and chocolate, mixed in with just enough hoppiness to get you to notice. This was defintly top notch. I really loved the way it was all blended together. Nothing really overpowering, but the whole mix was just soo smooth. Rich creamy full bodied feel, very thick. I could easily have one on any cold night, this was just a super nightcap. Defintly lived up to its hype, one of the best coffee stouts I have ever tasted and I would love to have it again.

4.53,0.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appears a dark fully opaque brand of oatmeal stout, unlike anything I've ever seen before. Pretty incredible full mocha tan head envelopes the dark astringently filled dark body that simply eats all light. No ruby highlights here to note just a full jet black zone of color spectrum absorption, that is a thing of beauty my friends. Head dwindles slowly with even bands of evenly dispersed lacing. Aromatics full of deep grains meaning oats and other cereal supplements that are simply remarkable when it comes to beer components. Dark roasted chocolate malt out does all other spectrums when that is all my senses are receiving, quite easily the most amazing beer aromatics I've come across since day one in the beer hunting I've embarked since age nineteen. Flavors come off full of deep dark coffee notes without any cream or sugar straight up just the way us "old timers" like it. If we were playing a gracious round of kegs and eggs I would be winning with this dark baker's chocolate dryness and roasted coffee goodness this beer has to offer what can I say, "I'm licking my bowl". Yes I know that doesn't sound to manly but when in the moment there's no power higher here on earth. Pure coffee grounds are repeated for me in a beet formula, did I mention I feel this position alone is bliss. Mouthfeel is one of the fullest in the land, with malt outweighing most comprehension of body this beer is fuller than it's custardized midwestern friend that can't be mistaken. Drinkability is great and will repeat in all it's fullness, I have a bottle aging here in the fridge that I won't forget too soon, wonderful stuff not overrated in the least.","WVbeergeek","Oct 27, 2007"

The aroma was heavy on the coffee but could also detect lots of chocolate and some sour cherry. The taste was really good and I hate coffee so that says alot about how good this one is. Has a nice solid taste from start to finish. Just the right amount of bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was creamy and solid. Because of my general dislike of coffee, I had to mark down the drinkability since while it's excellent it's not one that I'd reach right away for a second one.

Very rich upon the initial sips; an espresso-like creaminess with tons of flavorings, most notable are dark roasted coffee beans, brownies and chocolate. There is a sharp bitterness that couples with the massive flavorings of this gem! There are traces of oatmeal, hops and dark fruits--strawberries and pitted cherries.

Its a bit thick for my tastes, but it's a very wild and fun beer to drink. Extreme roasted flavors.

4.77,5.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Many thanks for the opportunity to try this beer must go out to hoppymeal and czoch75. Served slightly chilled in a 17-ounce snifter, this coveted beer is a thick obsidian color with a modest but dense and creamy looking light brown head, which settles to a very thin surface pattern and persistent ring. Lovely mocha aromas waft upward from the glass, with the bitter dark-roasted coffee scents swirling deftly with an extremely decadent bitter chocolate syrup bouquet. This melds into an overall aroma that conjures images of wet wood chips that have been soaked in mocha-coffee-infused rum. In a word, outstanding nose. Slightly bitter coffee flavor with some cocoa and walnut-skin character. A bit boozy as well. Some woody aspects emerge in the flavor as well, which is unexpected as I know that this is not a barrel-aged beer. Not as chocolatey in the flavor as expected, either; rather, there is a suitably complex grain taste that dominates the latter half of each sip. Overall, this seems to be primarily designed as a showcase for a skillful use of coffee in a stout. A very silky mouthfeel on this one, but surprisingly light in body, at least for the style, anyway. Not really a problem as this lends an incredible easiness to the drinkability. While not quite the elixir that is Kentucky Breakfast Stout, this is without a doubt an amazing accomplishment in brewing. I'd wish for a bit more chocolate in the flavor, since the label gives priority to chocolate before coffee and oatmeal. Regardless, one of the finest stouts to ever cross my lips and one I will certainly continue to enjoy and seek out.","orfeu","Jan 04, 2007"

Coffee beans are quite pronounced in the taste, as is some bakers' chocolate. The mouthfeel is the creamiest thing I've ever tasted. It's velvety smooth.

Coffee sits over chocolate maltiness and dark fruits. Toasted, bitter coffee beans up front. Becomes roastier and smokier and more intense. Chocolate and dark fruits swell, providing some sweetness. The coffee flavor and roasted bitterness pretty much overshadow this though. The bitterness controls the finish, which is redolent of a mocha latte with a shot of peaty whiskey.

A subtle coffee presence is appreciated, but drinking a cold carbonated mocha isn't what I want when I want a stout.

Even while pouring it, I can smell the coffee with a sweet hint of chocolate. Going down even closer I can smell strong coffee, it smells like cold coffee, but not coffee that has gone bad, more iced coffee. Chocolate hides in there as well, with a big grainy, beer smell. It tastes outstanding. Coffee is what first hits your mouth, but then chocolate comes in to share it. You don't get a dominant flavor, more like they begin to meld together until the coffee, chocolate and creamy flavor of the stout come together. The only complaint I have is that cold coffee sometimes can taste sour, and this has the sour coffee taste. All in all, I love this beer.

The mocha flavor continues well into the finish and carries a fair amount of bitterness. Alcohol may be strong, but hard to notice behind all the powerfull flavors. The mouthfeel carries a solid thickness but is arousingly smooth due to the oats, and the carbonation is perfection.

Flavor has a great burnt edge and alcohol presence to give it zip and some depth (which is good, because the yeast seems to add no other depth to this). Thin silky body goes down very easily and pleasingly at first, but the coffee-twang in the finish grew tiring for me, hindering the drinkability. Throughout, a vanilla nougat flavor shines. I don't know...it is a cool beer, but after half the bottle is gone some of the flavors grate on me a little. Nice, but strikes me as a bit of a novelty without too much enjoyable drinking potential.

The bittertness is not overpowering just enough to make you know its there. Not a very dry stout either. It didn't leavneeding a drink to wet my whistle, which is a nice feel from a stout.

The nose is fantastic roasted coffee beans, creamy vanilla under tones, and a warm inviting presence of alcohal. The taste on the palate is very nice, creamy, milky, it starts bitter, roasted espresso is very present. You can taste a toffee sweetness, also some bittersweet chocolate is infused in this brew, it then finishes syrup thick that coats the tongue. I love this brew it just solidifies my love for the American Stout.","Franchise","Feb 05, 2006"
3.62,-19.9,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,3,"Appears a dark pitch brown color, a wimpy head that dissapears quickly. Smells extremely roasty and sweet, but with a ton of nice bitterness in the form of coffee and bitter chocolate. Maybe even from the hops but I can't really detect any. Taste could be full of complex flavors, and the potential is there, but the palate is really overrun with the intense coffee bean chocolate party that's going on in this beer. I've already talked about that part... The real saving grace of this beer is the mouthfeel. Soft and pillowy, it's so smooth and just velvety on the palate with a slight chewyness. If I had no tastebuds even I would drink this just for the texture. To finish up, it could just be me or a stylistic sort of preference thing, but the strong coffee flavors don't work for this beer I hate to say. Check out the Black Rye from Founders, there's a killer beer for ya.","twelvsies","Feb 04, 2006"

Pours an opaque black like day old coffee with a miniscule brown head that fell away quickly to a light glass coating lacing. Aroma is just like a rich, inviting cup of dark roasted coffee, only smells a hint sweeter but still bitter, and has some undertones of malt present as well. Taste starts creamy and sweet, then lets the the bitter coffee/dark chocolate flavors take the helm. Leaves an appreciative bitter aftertaste like a good coffee or beer would, in this case, this seems to be both mixed into one. Mouthfeel is heavier bodied, moderate to light carbonation, feels creamy and silky smooth on the tongue, goes down nice and easy. Very drinkable beer, hardly hints towards it's unbelievably well hidden 8.3%. Would seek out again, this is my first yet far from last Founder's offering.","danielocean03","Feb 01, 2006"

Taste is even more impressive, with huge coffee flavors and shots of espresso...you can literally taste the coffee beans. There are also traces of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel is thick and robust, but still easy to drink. Finished up with a mocha character and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Well after all of the anticipation, I wouldn't say I was blown away, but still very very satisfied. If it were up to me, this would replace my daily cup of coffee. Thanks to Battlekow for the sample.

The coffee flavor is similar to when the pot is left a bit too long on the burner and the beer sours and bitters. Not too bad, but enough to notice. Also, if it is possible, I swear that in addition to the dark chocolate there is also a bit of white chocolate dribbled in the flavor. Not much in the way of any hops. Maybe a bit towards the end but I think I have that confused with the bitterness from the coffee and chocolate. Heavy and thick body that just clings to the cheeks like a nice dark roast. Quite relaxing and soothing too. Extremely smooth drinking, but just make sure you don't mind the taste of coffee in your beer.","MuddyFeet","Jan 09, 2006"

THe slight bitterness of the coffee and the smoothness of the proteins oats or otherwise add a nice combo. Overall the flavor is not horribly complex mostly coffee with some sweetness and a bit of nutty oats rolled in chocolate in the aftertaste.

I managed to get a 1 finger but it quickly disapated. the espresso aroma is a little overwellming but I could still smell malt, burnt carmel, and molasses. Mouthfeel is smooth and thick with mild carbonation. The taste is definitely coffee and bakers dark chocolate. Has a small bit of Alchol burn right after it goes down.

Aromas of heavenly malt, coffee, chocolate, earth, smoke, wood and toffee made my mouth water in anticipation of this liquid treat. Taste was phenominal; truely amazing flavors of coffee, oats, chocolate, toffee, malt and earth blend perfectly. Mouthfeel was great; very thick and chewy, like a liquid granola bar.

Heavy doses of a double expresso with a bakers chocolate finish. The mouthfeel is remarkably smooth for a high abv and the coffee taste is not cloying. Unbelievable beer overall.

To be honest, I think this one gets caught in between being an over-the-top coffee stout (like Bells Java Stout) and a stout where the addition of coffee serves to accentuate the existing stout characteristics (like Dark Lord). This seems to be a nicely crafted stout, but every time the subtle nuances (chocolate, caramel, vanilla) try to push their way forward, your palate is hit with burnt coffee flavors. Finish lasts forever. Could benefit from less coffee or more sweetness to balance it out a bit. However, being a fan of coffee, I cant help but like this beer.

Lacing is fine and plasters the side of the glass as the opaque tide recedes. Initial rush of cappucino as I stole a whiff from the bottle. Once poured, the aromas where much more subdued--coffee with sweet chocolate. The taste is fairly sweet with a good blend of the milk chocolate and coffee. A slight bitterness lingers, similar to after drinking coffee. The mouthfeel is both creamy smooth and subtley crisp. Drinkability is very good with almost no evidence of the alcohol in the taste.

Incredibly intense, intricate, and complex both on the nose and the palate. A real work of art. WOW. Amazing stuff here. Alcohol comes out a little more as it warms and in turn warms your belly. Mouthfeel is heavy and well-carbonated for a stout. Probably couldn't drink more than two of these, based on the heaviness and the 8.3% abv, but I don't want to stop. Just an outstanding beer here.

This afternoon, after a few other, less in-your-face beers, I decided to approach this one again. The mouthfeel is the stand-out feature of this beer. Incredibly thick and satisfying to drink. Upon my first tasting, I found the coffee elements to be too assertive, and the bitterness factor a bit high. It tastes like a different brew now (though from the same six-pack). Had I rated it, I wouldn't have done it justice. I would highly reccomend building up to this one in a session rather than beginning with. Despite the name, this beer would be much too much for me in the morning - though I do percieve (and appreciate) the coffee element.","MarkBlackout","Jul 08, 2005"

4.79,6,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Inky black and completely opaque with a light brown, thin lace of head. Good retention and lacing. The aroma consists of coffee, nutty roasted malts, and bitter dark chocolate. A light smell of dark fruits and a hint of alcohol are also present. The flavour starts malty and sweet, big and roasted with plenty of coffee, and just gets better from there. Bitterness comes from both hops and the roasted malts, and carries through right to the finish. Plenty of chocolate as well. There's a hint of hop flavour that shows up towards the end, which finishes with a medium sweetness but still slightly dry from the grain. Viscous, full body with a smooth, creamy texture. Moderately low carbonation that allows all the flavours to stand front and centre. The alcohol is hidden very well.

Taste is of roasted coffee, chocolate, and grains. Very smooth in mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth in taste. Boy, this goes down easy with such a high ABV.

Smooth dark malts begin the experience, with roasted grain and chocolate malt becoming more apparent. Unsweetened dark chocolate comes in and blends with the black coffee. Very subtle oats and slight charcoal make a quick appearance. The finish is great - big on the roasted grain and coffee, leaving an aftertaste that stays around til the cows come home.

Taste starts with sweet chocolate grains, hearty oats in the middle, and fades to a somewhat bitter, dry coffee close.

A perfect end is found in a softly expressed creamy finish which rounds out the delights of this alcoholic coffee. If you like black coffee and thick beer, this is the trick. A more than suitable early morning eye opener to prime the pump for an all day excursion, or just to compliment a fine meal or wind down after a long day.","SupaCelt","Mar 28, 2005"

I also taste rosted malts. This beer is very rich. It is also quite thick. The flavor is very aggressive. It leaves my mouth tasting like I just sucked on a coffee bean. This beer is carbonated just right. This beer is very god, but I dont think I could drink it all night long. It is so very rich and filling that I would probably feel bloated after a few.

Pouring this beer turned my pint glass into a black hole through which no light could escape. Even holding the glass an inch from a 100 watt bulb revealed nothing about the interior. The head was dark brown and thick, and left gobs of clumpy brown lace all round the walls of the glass. The aroma was laden with coffee, chocolate, and raisins. The dry and roasty taste was that of burnt oats, coffee, and chocolate. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy, and aftertaste a bit warm. Like eating a coffee cake (without too much sugar), this meal in a glass satisfied nearly all senses, and left me in a state of fulfillment, and in grateful appreciation of the art of brewing.

The aroma is really roasty with coffee and a bit of chocolate. Full-bodied and creamy, with a smoky flavor that came out of nowhere. Coffee, roasted malt and chocolate flavors are present too. The aftertaste is bitter and lasting, and the smokiness lingers long after. All in all this beer met my expectations but I am not sure that it lives up to all the hype. Still I wouldnt kick it out of bed in the morning.","Dogbrick","Jan 24, 2005"
4.5,-0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very solid and bursting with flavor yet balance between all of the big things going on - high gravity, plenty of roast malts, chocolate, coffee, just about everything but the kitchen sink, yet it all integrates well. The most surprising point was the drinkability - its a strong-flavored stout yet it resides, not wrecks, on the palette.","nomad","Jan 24, 2005"

4.97,10,4.5,5,5,5,5,"I don't usually like drinking when I wake up, but this beer has changed my opinion on the subject. I also don't like the watery feel of coffee, but love the flavors and aroma, suitable replacement? This is now the #1 reason why I love Founders. I'm going back to bed, wake me when it's time for another.","Skidz","Jan 21, 2005"
4.47,-1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Sampled on 1/09/05 from a 12oz bottle. Pitch black body with a healthy dark brown head sitting on top. Decent scattering of lace was left around the glass as I drank this. Strong roasted coffee in the aroma that really dominates. Along with that is dark chocolate and a slight nuttiness. Maybe a touch of caramel as well but damn that coffee is kicking. Flavor is full of coffee, bittersweet chocolate and a light sweet caramel. Very strong flavors that mixes together quite well. A bit of oatmeal and roastiness are adding to the complexity. A nice lingering roasty coffee is what you get on the finish, mmm. Mouthfeel is thick, smooth going down and creamy. I could have a few of these, if I had a few of these. Great brew that keep me really impressed with Founders and disappointed that its not available anywhere near where I live. Thanks to tikkigodxxx for this great brew.","meathookjones","Jan 19, 2005"
4.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"what an awesome brew from this new-to-me bre-we-ry:-) Dark opaque black with a nice tan head of foam as well. This one leaves nice lacing as well, impressive. Aromas of chocolate, nuts, coffee, caramel, alcohol, dark fruits, and more. The taste is oaty, nutty, and chocolaty with some other lovely hints of coffee, booze, and more. The mouthfeel is thick, slick, and truly awesome. Drinkability is damn good for a stout of this nature and power as well. What a damn good, flaky oatmeal stout. Lovely, on all accounts. Vicar, can I have some more? VICAR!","francisweizen","Jan 17, 2005"
4.01,-11.3,5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"As expected, quite ambitious and, in a sense, perfectly executed. A little too sweet and alcoholic to re-drink very soon. Perhaps this will improve with some age...","putnam","Jan 17, 2005"
4.3,-4.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Surprisingly smooth, silky even, in the finish for all of its rough edges. They probably could have reduced the hop load just a bit. The roasted bitterness and burnt chocolate flavors tame the sweetness well enough on their own. Then again, maybe not.","marburg","Jan 17, 2005"
4.82,6.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Very complex and full bodied. Very filling, and much like the liquid food that I think the brewer had in mind. I'm beginning to prefer Founders, over Dogfish Head, when it comes to pushing the boundaries of certain styles. Thanks to mentor for sharing breakfast.","merlin48","Jan 14, 2005"
4.5,-0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another impressive offering from Founders, and another very attractive label, even if it does suggest that a child has been consuming the product...watch for for the Grand Rapids Board of Health and Human Services, guys!","feloniousmonk","Jan 14, 2005"
4.15,-8.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Black pour without much head, but what is there is intimidatingly dark brown. Strong roasty aroma. Overwhelming dry coffee flavors (seek this one out if thats your thing), grainy/oatmeal-ish, cocoa abundance. Rich dark malts components. More of the same on the tongue. Well developped sweet/bitter balance. Roastiness is deep and expressive over a small hints at green oily hops. Smooth going. Very dryish mouthfeel, powdery like the cocoa it includes which make it feel almost chalky. Firm and enjoyable medium to full body. Remarkably good. Among the good stouts available Id say, Id even rack this among the imperials, as a smaller and less desserty Péché Mortel.","Rastacouere","Jan 12, 2005"
4.08,-9.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"from the bottle. poured a dark brown with garnet around th edges, with a medium sized brown head. aroma roasted malts, coffee, plums, chocolate and a nice sweetness. flavor. coffee, more like coffee beans,dark fruits, brown sugar, raisins, roasted malts, and a smokey, molasses on the back of the tongue. this is a very good beer, I am glad I got my hands on this one. It looks like I was lucky to get to get this 4 pack. went back and got another 4 pack to hold on to for some future use","walleye","Jan 07, 2005"

4.43,-2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This is an impressive beer. Pours very thickly into my pint glass. A creamy head that actually hangs out for a while, given the ABV of this brew. Taste is an exposion of coffee up front, followed by a following of chocolate, then some english hops in the aftertaste. Smells sweet and slightly nutty-roasty. This is a thick beer in the mouth and it is quickly becoming one of my favorites.","deejaydan","Dec 19, 2004"
4.6,1.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Thanks to deejaydan....err, Santa...for this amazing beer!!! I remember the recent thread about how Founders had just passed Kalamazoo, and after this one as well as the Devil Dancer I absolutely see why. This is so beautiful, literally breakfast in a bottle with so many of the flavors that makes breakfast so wonderful. Just as you can't live without breakfast, neither should you live without Breakfast Stout, and this is one of the ones I'll seriously try to use to get Founders distributed in PA (though for now can fortunately go to Ohio), and this is one I'll certainly have again!!!","beergeek279","Dec 19, 2004"
4.78,5.8,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I've been looking forward to this stout for a long time, and I am not at all disappointed. The name Breakfast Stout is earned by its substantial body, but I think I'll drink this to end my nights, rather than start my days.","frazbri","Dec 08, 2004"
4.23,-6.4,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The metal and alcohol twang kinda hurts it's otherwise excellent profile...this is a huge beer and I celebrate Founder's willingness to push the envelope and craft such amazing brews. These guys just blow me away with their excellence, and this is no exception. One hell of a beer...this is an entire meal in a bottle. Try it!","Mitchster","Dec 06, 2004"
4.63,2.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"12 oz. bottle, no date. Pours a black liquid, that seems fairly thick. Thick creamy dark tan head that remained for a good time. Good lace on the glass. Smells of dark roast coffe, maybe even espresso. Maybe some chocolate in the nose as well. Roasty sweet flavors, followed by coffee. Sweet milk chocolate, carmel. Silky and creamy, with low carbonation. This is one spectacular brew. I am a fan of coffee, and coffee flavors in beer, and this has it and more. Drink your breakfast!","Bierguy5","Nov 20, 2004"
4.38,-3.1,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep jet black color with three fingers of dark tan head. Great lacing. The smell is all coffee baby. Rich roasted malt and lots of coffee, I'm buzzin' already! The taste is about the same, all about the coffee. Some caramel and molasses sweetness up front, but lots of fresh ground espresso bean flavor takes over. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy and it's pretty smooth. The drinkability is good for an 8% brew too. An awesome brew!","SheepNutz","Nov 20, 2004"
4.67,3.3,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability is high and at 8.5 ABV tough to call a session brew but it tastes so could and goes down so easily it could be. Richness makes it a very filling but great beer.","CRJMellor","Nov 20, 2004"
4.77,5.5,4.5,5,5,5,4,"What a cool name and idea. A breakfast beer. Described as a double chocolate, coffee, oatmeal stout. I'm intrigued. Pours a very dark color with a small tan head that quickly disappears and lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma was big and filled with expresso and chocolate - dark malts. The flavor was not at all what I was expecting. The first thing that hits you is a very strong dark coffee flavor, as this is the predominant thing. Next there is a bitter coffee and dark roasted malts. Incredibly smooth and creamy mouthfeel. If I liked coffee a little more, I would drink this one all night long ... or at least until I passed out, because it's got some alcohol in it. Great beer!","clvand0","Nov 08, 2004"
4.35,-3.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer is now available in a four pak for people outside of Southern Michigan to enjoy. This beer poured pitch black with no light getting through this one. If formed a nice dark tan bubbly head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A heavy aroma of coffee, chocolate (or mocha coffee if you will), malts and some smokiness. The flavor was of malt, and very heavy on coffee, particularly a burnt aspect of it. Not as much chocolate comes through in the flavor. A slightly creamy body with a bit of a burnt finish. A heavy beer that leans towards an imperial style and gives Java Stout a run for it's money.","Wildman","Nov 07, 2004"

5,10.6,5,5,5,5,5,"After having this about a gazillion times at the brewery and going through 5 four packs of this since it's been released in bottles I have realized that this is my beer and only straight 5's will justify my love for this beer. I love the roasty flavors mixed with the rich coffee experience then milky chocolate, bitter chocolate, creaminess and smoothness in a thick body. I thought that maybe I would get sick of it but it appears I need it more and more the more I drink it. Just an amazing beer and one that I can get nearly all the time at the brewery. Thanks Founders.","granger10","Jun 13, 2004"
