Chocolate complements the coffee and roast malt nicely. Fairly hot. After this sits around a bit, the coffee becomes secondary to rich chocolate, and heat subsides.","barczar","Saturday at 08:32 AM"

4.17,-3,4,4.5,4,4,4.25,"12oz bottle poured into tall stout snifter. A sliver of red peeks out beneath an opaque black beer. A finger of tan head quickly recedes to a thin ring of tiny bubbles and a small central island. Aroma is a blast of coffee with roast malt, solvent, booze, and bakers chocolate. A vanilla element grows as the beer warms. Taste is coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, and some molasses sweetness followed by a big pinch of char and leafy hop bitterness on the finish. Full body, creamy, thick, mouth-coating texture thanks to the oatmeal, soft but complimentary carbonation, and a surprisingly abrupt finish. Phantoms of coffee and wisps of booze linger, but it takes a little searching. Very enjoyable after an afternoon of snow day sledding.","SierraFlight","Mar 02, 2015"

Rich nose of  coffee (most pronounced) and semisweet dark chocolate (background).  Minor notes of roast and dark fruit (prunes).  As it warms, alcohol and prunes are quite noticeable.   Medium bodied with a smooth texture - and it has to be nearly room temperature to achieve this.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is reasonably intense, reasonably balanced, but lacks the complexity of World Class stouts.  It begins with a blend of coffee, dark chocolate and alcohol flavors that slowly separate over a slight sweetness.  In the middle, prunes and alcohol dominate over slight notes of roast and bitterness.  These fade out slowly as the finish.  Very good, at best.","tillmac62","Jan 02, 2015"

4.75,10.5,,,,,,"2013 batch served at or just below room temperature (55-60). Initially poured a pretty vigorous head but it died down pretty quickly to a faint tan rim around the glass. Smell is instantly of coffee and rich chocolate. Also some cinnamon. Opaque in color. No light showing though. Taste is initially of bitter chocolate followed by a mellow spiced coffee. To be a year old, there is still plenty of sharp chocolate. Very little in the way of alcohol bite but some boozy warm is still there. Mouthfeel is rich and chewy. To me this is where the oatmeal really comes through. Gives this beer that extra layer of complexity that Founders Breakfast Stout lacks. Such an incredible beer and really the cutting edge of the breakfast/coffee style in my opinion. Hopefully I will have the patience to lay a 2014 bottle down for more than a year. Would love to see a barrel aged variant of this in the future.","ILMbrew","Oct 27, 2014"

This bottle is totally different. Really nice balance between the dark malts and coffee. The little bit of sweetness really makes this a really nice beer. I say "little" bit of sweetness and mean "little" bit as it is not cloying or anywhere close to overwhelming. Just a nice little sweetness.","TheBeerDrinker","May 05, 2014"

Ground black coffee dominates the nose, which also has dark chocolate, toasted oats, raisins, and a hint of vanilla. I taste a lot of dark chocolate up front with some vanilla and caramel, then coffee on the back end with roasted malts. The flavor profile is great and the beer really evolves in the mouth, but I get an astringency from the roasted malts that detracts from the taste.

4.39,2.1,4.25,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Overall, the most enjoyable aspect of this beer was its aroma, followed closely by flavoring. Actually, another realy striking thing about this beer is its look. Once the head pulls down enough, it reveals with wildly oily film that jets and boats over the top of the drink for the remainder of the tasting. Going back to the meat of it, coffee invades all aspects of this beer in wonderful authenticity, with enough sourness and fiery roast to keep things moving along nicely. One downside to this, if you have an aversion to coffee, is the big metallic notes that are inherent to any genuine coffee beer, as such. With such a heavy, rich, and deeply complex flavor it is a surprise how cleanly and easily it drinks back. These highpoints combined could go up against any coffee beer out there, punch for punch. As a social note, we are so happy to finally have found our way to this beer. With being in Atlanta for only two days we were certainly itching to finally try some Terrapin, and were happily surprised to find it widely available on the shelves. As our first taste of the brewery and of the state we were not disappointed, and as we look to W-n-B’s kin cooling in the mini fridge of our cheap hotel room we say, “Cheers, Georgia.”","TheBrewo","Mar 22, 2014"

Chocolate, molasses, roast coffee, and woody notes, too. Smooth, creamy bodied. The aftertaste is rich and sugary sweet, with a smooth, clean finish. Amazing beer.

It’s got depth, it’s got complexity, it’s got body and character, it’s plenty bold, and it doesn’t sacrifice any of these things in the name of anything gimmicky. It doesn’t redefine the style or anything, but man oh man, I’m pretty sure it nails whatever it set out to do. Really, this is a quality, high-value Imperial Stout that could seriously convert neophytes to the dark side. For the value, this is absolutely worth seeking out.","fmccormi","Jan 29, 2014"

A very enjoyable Oatmeal Stout, Love to drink it in the morning or if I need a pick me up.

Of course I am inclined to compare this to Founders Breakfast Stout (which I have had many times) and in my opinion it stands up very well. The most glaring difference between this and FBS is that there's not a lot of intense coffee on the palate with this beer. Given the nose, I half-expected this to be a coffee bomb on the palate (like FBS), but it's not. Instead, it is very well-balanced and the coffee doesn't wash out all the other flavors.

Based on taste, it needs to set. Currently too bitter and harsh from the coffee, roasted malt, and hops. Still very enjoyable. Nice mouthfeel. Overall, reminds me a lot of fresh Expedition stout with an addition of the coffee presence. It's a great stout, but not enthusiastic about the changes made to the beer nor the increased price this year. Honestly, the best way to drink this is a "Wake n Moo."

Low carbonation, however smooth, thick, and creamy mouthfeel. Overall this is my favorite imperial stout right now. Definitely worth picking up if you can.","scvance","Dec 03, 2013"

Smells like a very rich and fresh brewed coffee. The name justifies the taste almost perfectly, if people drank alcohol for breakfast, this would probably be a popular choice. Mouth feel is nice, bursting with coffee flavor. This beer has won several awards, including best recipe, and rightfully so!

4.56,6,4,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,"The beer pours like thin, black motor oil with coffee brown tints. The beer pours with a small dark khaki head that quickly fades into a ring of tight small bubbles around the glass. In body, the beer is impenetrable to the eye. It sits in the glass as a dark and brooding enigma. The beer leaves a splotchy and light lacing, leaving slick dots of bubbles on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of big meaty coffee beans with dry cocoa and some slight charred malts poking through. In many ways it smells like a very coffee forward mocha, with great nuances to the coffee smell. The smell is coffee heaven for sure. Comparable to Founder’s Breakfast Stout, only more coffee forward. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and then roasty bitter with slight savory hints of chocolate and meaty coffee. In flavors, the beer begins as sweet chocolate, almost moving into light dark fruit characters before it blossoms into roasted coffee and cocoa powder with light notes of charred malts. The flavors are superbly mellow and balanced, especially in comparison to the big nose, though still plenty large enough to please the palate. The finish is bitter black coffee with touches of light fruit and chocolate, which moves slowly into rich cocoa powder. The aftertaste is of light, generic dark fruit flavors with slight bitter coffee and a ghost of savory salt lingering on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels thick in body with a light velvety carbonation that helps the beer to slither across the palate. The mouth is left slightly wet with coffee’s bitter lingering feel. Overall, this is a phenomenal imperial stout with coffee and oatmeal. There are beautiful nuances in this beer and some beautiful balance between rather dominant flavors. This beer is in many ways comparable to Founder’s Breakfast Stout, and, in my current memory, it seems to have more balance and coffee richness than FBS. That being said, my bottle is a couple months old and might have mellowed from its original flavors. This beer is great, though, try it.","Maxwell","Apr 23, 2013"

Chocolate was quite hidden, but a fairly well balanced brew. Minimal hop finish, as the coffe hits again on the end. Feel is good for the style. A rich, thick, creamy, well carbonated hit on the tongue. Overall, a very good beer that I wish had a little more malt/chocolate and less coffee. Don't get me wrong, I'm splitting hairs. It's a top notch beer that 's name fits it perfectly. If you are a coffee strong beer lover, this is all for you.

4.24,-1.4,4,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle, the stout was dark in color with a reddish hue to it. Stouts normally do not have such a color unless heavy concentrations of fruit as added. Based on that, I am not really sure what accounts for the color. A fairly substantial mocha head was present, which quickly dissolved. Lacing remained around the cylinder of the glass. Aroma was a little on the faint side, but had a smooth malty quality. In the initial taste, one detects a smooth chocolate taste with notes of tart cherry, vanilla, black licorice. The stout is noticeably malty, but there is so much more. When one considers a coffee-like backbone, there is so much going on here. In the aftertaste, one gets dark chocolate taking over for the sweet chocolate. To accompany the aftertaste is a pleasant warming sensation. This is a well structured and diverse stout. I would certainly do this one again.","JohnnyHopps","Feb 15, 2013"

Flavor starts of medium roasted coffee and roasted malt, then in the rear some chocolate comes in pretty largely, and closes out with a bitter coffee finish. A medium bodied, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. For it being an imperial oatmeal stout, I would have expected more out of the mouthfeel to be honest. Overall, a great beer.","denver10","Jan 09, 2013"

I'm a coffee lover and a beer lover and when my two favorite drinks are put together it usually is a "can't miss" scenario. However, I was truly let down by this beer. I'm not going to go into the specifics (a,s,t,m,o) but to say that I feel it's under carbonated, poor lacing, bitter smell and taste. The coffee used is not smooth and seems like an average quality blend which is unacceptable for a beer that costs $3.50 for a 12 ounce bottle. Terrapin should learn a lesson from GI who puts an excellent quality coffee in their BCBCS and it shows! To each his own but I just don't see why this beer is rated so high.","ELS","Jan 03, 2013"

4.92,14.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Thanks are due to EgadBananas for providing this bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a thin, dark tan head. The beer is completely opaque. The head dissipates quickly, leaving a wispy cap atop the beer. Coffee is very forward in the nose. There are also well pronounced aromas of dark roasted barley malt, chocolate, and oats. There's a mild sweetness in the smell and the ABV is well-hidden by all the aromas. The taste follows the nose. The coffee flavor is very forward in the taste. The coffee notes marry well with the dark roasted barley malts, oats, dark chocolate, and molasses. For an 8.1% ABV beer, I can't taste the alcohol at all until it starts to warm up. The flavors are well balanced. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer. This coffee stout works well as a breakfast drink or as an afternoon beer.","acevenom","Jun 10, 2012"

Worth every bit of the love that it gets on this site.","siege06nd","May 20, 2012"

It's excellent to revisit it after trying so many other truely great brews to see that it still holds it's own with aplomb. I'm one of the few that prefer WnB to Founders Breakfast Stout, favoring the unyielding great coffee flavors. Many other beers have strong coffee but for me this particular blend exceeds them all. Still one of my all-time favorites and a must-try for any fan of coffee stouts. ","ThickNStout","May 09, 2012"

Looks nice, smells good, tastes great, and has a great full body. What more can you ask for? For me, this is on the sweeter end of some of the "coffee" stouts I've had, but it is simply a different quality, not a bad one. The sweetness does not overpower the beer, does not taste artificial, and does not overshadow the coffee bitterness.

Nice swirling legs, however, do adorn the surface of the liquid. The aroma is of coffee, vanilla, caramel, cocoa, oatmeal, raisin, and sugar. Smells like a freshly baked cookie was ground into a stout. Tastes of oatmeal, raisin, vanilla, cocoa, coffee grounds, mocha, toasted sugar, and caramel. Very well balanced and complex; well done. Mouthfeel is not overly sweet, as the nose may suggest, nor does it finish dry or resinous. Ample carbonation promotes a clean finish, and accentuates some of the more subtle flavors.

This is truly a black hole- like motor oil in appearance. The nose is really pleasant- coffee, vanilla, hops, chocolate- no 'burned coffee' smell, which I'm not a fan of- It smells fresh. The flavor is right in line with the nose profile, but it's just a little on the thin/dry side for me. I'd like more malt last through the taste. The hops definitely take over after the first second and into the aftertaste. Still, that's nitpicking- this is a really excellent brew. Feel is malty and on the thin side of medium. Hops immediately take over for an acidty/bite through the aftertaste- w/ a dry finish. Overall, a really good beer. I'll definitely pick this up again. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Jan 10, 2012"

I mean, this beer is good.. really good, there is very evident and strong/bitter coffee, the Oatmeal really thickens up the beer for a wonderful mouthfeel, and overall it delivers everything that I'd like.. almost. The high evidence of the alcohol and near division of the sweet and bitter with nearly no overlap isn't exactly ideal (in my opinion). Still a good beer, and something I can tout as a local favorite as an Athens, GA resident.

Pours blacker than black with a finger and a half width, espresso hued foam cap. Nose is straight, unadulterated coffee. This reminds me of a bold cup of black coffee with just a touch of roasted toffee. The taste is a marvelous display of coffee with a tinge of sweetness. I can seriously see how a person could crack one of these on a Saturday or Sunday morning, and have it with a stack of french toast, pancakes, or with a Belgian waffle, laden with maple syrup and accompanied by a couple strips of bacon or a pair of sausage patties. This really is a marvelous coffee brew. The mouthfeel is very thick with a decent amount of carbonation, and a mild astringency.

Aroma is pretty much like smelling a handful of ground coffee. Because of this I can't pick up much else. More coffee in the taste which is also dominating but I love coffee so that is fine fr my taste but may be overwhelming for others. Some milk chocolate notes throughout.

Beer is dangerously drinkable. You could drink it quick, and I've done it with a few bottles, but you gotta try not too, it's too good not to savor. This beer could literally be drank at any time of the day. Good enough to have with dinner, with dessert, with lunch, with a donut (or any breakfast), and even by itself.

4.48,4.2,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5," I ordered a Terrapin Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout. The bartender felt the need to warn me that it was an $8 bottle of beer (she seemed to have PTSD from a previous patron's response to the bill), but it was worth every penny. It's dark-brown to black with a creamy brown head. The overwhelming flavor is that of dark roasted coffee with hints of chocolate and toffee. Not too much of alcohol taste despite a high gravity. Epic. Delicious. I wish I had one right now.","HerculesRM","Aug 03, 2011"

Decadent and up there with the best of them. Taste- bittersweet dark chocolate first, espresso coffee second, bitter hops bite third, finished by espresso again. Just so much going on here. Mouthfeel- the thickness of this stout is impressive. Absolutely one of my favorite coffee stouts I've ever had. Drinkability- this says it is 8.1% ABV, it is not detectable at all.

The smell of the beer is deeply roasted coffee and chocolate, along with some burnt oats. The taste has some really nice coffee flavors and rich dark chocolate throughout. The mouthfeel of the beer is thick and oily, it's got a light carbonation to it also. Overall this is my favorite release from Terrapin, I enjoyed this beer a lot.

Smells very rich with roasted coffee beans, toasted oats and dark malts, and some bittersweet baking chocolate. Taste is also very rich with a complex blend of sweetened coffee, toasted oats, and chocolate syrup. There is also a slight vanilla flavor I am getting as well. There is a low but still bubbly level of carbonation that is perfect for this beer. Very smooth and creamy in the mouth.

The flavors are initially of sweet chocolate before becoming bitter and finished with a nice roasted coffee flavor. It drinks very, very smoothly and full in body.

I'm well aware that coffee fades in these beer, so if you're expectations are to age it and still get a taste bud punch of coffee then you need to skip that and drink fresh. But if you know what you're getting into it's a pleasant surprise when you crack one after 1-1.5 years. The 2008 was definitely pushing it, so I'd keep that in mind if planning to age.","tclapper","May 18, 2011"

If I drank more coffee or ever really wanted to drink a coffee stout in the AM I could see myself drinking this when I could get my hands on it. On normal drinking nights, this would be enjoyable every week or two when I'm getting tired of IPAs. Would I want one every time I drink? No. Do I think this is a great nightcap? Absolutely! Overall, I feel like I'd give it a quick rating of a 3.75 out of 5, but 4s accoss the board warrants a 4.0 out of 5.

4.02,-6.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"2010 bottle that I got as a lovely extra from BA user AlexFields. Well this beer is like a black pearl with just a hint of tan head. A thin off white/tan ring always hangs around the edge of my glass, no light penetrates this beer. The aroma highlights the coffee, roasty malts, cacao, and "breakfast" quality (probably the oats). So well balanced, I love how the oat in this beer contributes to its roundness. There are amazing coffee, cacao, and complex roasted flavors. The flavors play well together, the taste is the strong point here. A tad sharp and hot on the finish, but otherwise a nice thick toothsome stout. In total I truly like this creation.","pmlondrigan","Apr 19, 2011"

The finish is perfectly bitter. The flavor lasts long after the glass is empty, as does the lacing. Wake'n'Bake has an excellent mouthfeel - creamy and rich with just the right amount of carbonation. Excellent served cold or room temperature.","BeerArtEtc","Apr 18, 2011"

I just feel that the body of a beer and the body of coffee are two entirely different textures that, when put together on this level, do not complement each other at all. It's too thick, and the subdued nature of the things that make a beer bright and lively, hops and carbonation, make this feel utterly bogged-down. I also don't think the coffee adds any aroma complexities to justify its heavy use. Roasted malt smells like coffee most of the time anyways. It's not a terrible brew, but cut back on the coffee.","TheWhiskerReview","Mar 21, 2011"

Smells rather intensely of coffee with a backing of chocolate and however you would describe that oatmeal stout smell (oats?). Smells good. Oh, ugh. The taste up front is roasted coffee and chocolate, but the back is bitter metallic chocolate oatmeal. It just hangs on the palate, as though someone dropped a penny in my drink or something. I don't know whether to blame over-roasted coffee, catching fading hops at the worst possible time or what, but the finish of this beer is really unpleasant. A metallic bitterness just lingers on the back of the tongue... But, the mouthfeel is good...medium, high carbonation and medium-full bodied without being syrupy. The drinkability...well, I mean, the awful, lingering aftertaste totally kills it. I really thought I was going to love this beer and I just cannot get over what seems to be a major flaw.

The roast takes an aback to the nice caramel sweetness from the malts. The roast does however show it's head when it comes time to taste. I sampled flavors ranging from coffee to vanilla and sweet caramel butterscotch. I think I also was able to detect some almost fruity characteristics from the body, almost a faint raspberry taste.

The nose comprises heavy roasted malts, coffee, smoke (sorta hammy, but not overly so), and a few drops of molasses. The taste runs very similarly, with the roasted malts taking the van again, followed by the coffee, some bitter dark chocolate, and some nice char smoke. I feel the darkness, people, and I am pleased, to say the least. The body is a solid medium, with a moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very nice stout.

The pour into a reg pint started with a nice 1-1.5 inch light coffee colored head. This receded rather quickly. The nose was a bit surprising in that I did not get much coffee but rather a caramely and sweet scent, huh. When I took my first sip I noticed some coffee (hoped for more, I love coffee) but not alot, with notes of chocolate and finishing with a mild mix of malt and hops. The mouthfeel is very nice in that it coats the pallet well but does not become cumbersome.

This beer reeks of coffee and a little Kahlua like booziness. Taste is more coffee, on the sweet side, with caramel and chocolate notes. Smooth and silky mouthfeel.

This coffee is probably what makes the beer even darker than the darkest stouts. The head is even reminiscent of the color of cappuccino foam. The beer is definitely coffee-heavy and there is a lot of caramel and malt sweetness that comes through that makes this hard to drink a lot of especially when I usually drink my coffees black and like dryer stouts. The oatmeal and lower carbonation contributes a lot of silkiness and smoothness on the tongue that is very nice.

The beer is very bitter and could use a little more oatmeal to balance. The mouthfeel is creamy with low carbonation. Overall it is a somewhat easy drink the biteerness could deter you from more.","goblue3509","Jan 16, 2011"

Dark espresso with hints of dark chocolate and... you guessed it, oatmeal. I could seriously drink this with my breakfast... It's for coffee lovers indeed, but perfectly balanced so that the sweet malt backbone only enhances the combination of flavors. Carbonation is spot on, but lacing is surprisingly minimal. Mouthfeel is great and the drinkability.... well, lets just say that I normally take a good bit of time to drink one of these... letting it warm before the finish. I couldn't quit bringing the glass to my mouth. Well done Terrapin, I've finally found one that I like more than Founder's BS... and that's saying A LOT.","Macky20","Jan 11, 2011"

Well while it does not blow Breakfast Stout away, I do agree that I like it better which is saying a lot. The pour is dark and perfect with a half finger of head that lingers. The aroma is a much more refined coffee bean than Breakfast Stout which is why I think I like this beer so much. The taste is of chocolate and a hint of coffee that doesnt overpower you. This beer is way too easy to drink, but at 8% you can easily drink more than one in a session. This is my new favorite Oatmeal Stout.","mcgwire756","Jan 09, 2011"

This is definitely a plus if you're a coffee lover. Probably one of the most aggressive coffee tastes I've experienced in a beer.

It's exactly what I'd figured it would be in the aroma. Tons of rich bitter coffee! Rich molasses and bakers chocolate are present but this is simply dominated by a big coffee aroma. Flavor is definitely sound on this one. Taste like coffee. The flavor on this is the peak of what I would want from a coffee stout.

Tastes, combined with the soft pleasant carbonation, leave a cola-like tingling on my tongue. The beer is a bit watery up front, but develops nicely through the back as the oats help increase the heft of the mouthfeel and help make this beer a bit chewy and slightly viscous.

Great deep taste, with a wonderful dark roasty malt flavor; nice coffee tones, but not overdone like too many coffee stouts, the perfect amount for a coffee stout; nice slight sweetness from the oats, but no oat flavors to overcome the others, including a slight plum/prune flavor.

There is a doughy quality to the malt that makes the beer taste like the fresh baked cookies on the label. Mouthfeel is slick from the oatmeal, full-bodied, and warming.

Like I said, it has a very rich taste. the coffee hits you up front, but there is a slight dry oatmeal taste to finish it, and it compliment each other very well.This doesn't scream coffee, but it dont beat you with an oatmeal stout taste either. very malty, and no noticeable hop presence , but very enjoyable. There are hints of alcohol, but nothing that screams it. Also has a coco taste as well. Full, but overly so, mouth feel. This blend everything together pretty well.

Dark as night with a 2 finger tan cap atop, this beer looked GOOD! The taste was of some coffee with dark chocolate. The texture was silky smooth and easy on the palate.

Not a bad after taste. Worth a try for the coffee fan, even if your not a fan of crafts.

Full-bodied, drops like an anchor into your mouth, the carbonation thankfully has some sizzle to it and slowly gets the flavors moving around. These being coffee, coffee and more coffee. As well as dark chocolate, nuts, chicory and raw baking dough. Turns very dry through the finish, hops appear to contribute more to the texture than array of flavors, not the creamiest of stouts.

Some burnt coffee bean starts things off in the taste, some chalky esters in between, and ending on a viscous dark chocolate note....really nice finish. Silky mouthfeel, but never feeling too heavy on the palate. Drinkability is good, but one is better off sipping as opposed to gulping. This is a damn good heavy stout from the team at Terrapin.

It doesn't necessarily detract from the overall smell of the beer (which is mostly coffee), but throws me off a little from the times I have had it in the past and remembering it having a different aroma, more of dark malt. The strange smell carries over to the flavor, with coffee and dark roasted malt being at the front, but having a strange funky(not sour though) aftertaste. Coffee ends up overpowering everything else in the taste department. Mouthfeel is just right for a stout, and demonstrates perfectly the thick and silky texture oatmeal gives to a brew. As far as drinkability goes, this hits all the right notes except for the off taste.

A huge surge of coffee and roasted/toasted malts takes the tastebuds for a ride but is balanced by the oatmeal for a mix of dry and sweet tastes.

Coffee is ront and center, dark bitter chocolate is next on the flavor wave, followed by a nice roastiness, sweet at first, but dry and bitter on the finish.

Only a few spots of lacing present during the tasting. Big coffee nose - rich grounds, as well as some molasses, but I also got a bit of a vegetal aroma off the cap pop; luckily it dissipated in the glass. Taste follows nose, but there is also a great deal of sweetness, as well as bitter (perhaps baker's) chocolate and molasses. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slick across the tongue with a light effervescence in the background and a slightly chalky quality at the finish.

I watched the lady bring it over from the bar to my table and could not take my eyes off the wonderful looking head this beer had. Brown with what looks to be coffee grinds in it. Once it got to me though the smell was of coffee, strong coffee with maybe a hint of chocolate. Taste is of coffee and cocoa with a nice hint of oatmeal to smooth everything out. After you drink it the bitterness pulls everything together. I also got a nice warming feel from the alcohol once drank. Overall this is by far the best coffee stout I have ever had and it's something everyone should try.","nhudson","Jan 14, 2009"

The first pour released the exquisite smell of beans, the modern day urban nectar of the gods. Pitch black fills the glass foaming to a pleasant chocolaty head. It fizzled away fast to a nice lacing that clung to the glass. After being in the center of a coffee explosion more scents revealed themselves. The almost perfect balance of coffee and Oatmeal entered the frame creating an olfactory yin and yang. After noticing this, the other subtitles shone through, chocolates, spices and malts were at the front but too numerous to detect them all. The chocolate-coffee-oatmeal taste bursts in your mouth with a force un-denied; the balance is unique and irresistible. The syrup like texture with mild carbonation glides smoothly in the mouth, thick and creamy enough to make you want to chew it. In the end the sure richness and complexity of this drink is uniformly almost perfect. To me this is black gold, worth repeating its alluring and has a scent that screams come hither.

(Because it would go good with the chocolate chip cookies, of course!) mouthfeel is thinner than I expected by the viscosity of the appearance, but still very viscous.

Nose is dominated by coffee, no surprise, and bittersweet chocolate. Swirling the glass uncovers a different smell that strikes me as roasted red peppers. I was shocked by the first taste. No alcohol sensed at all, but ABV is lower than most. Extremely smooth mouthfeel. Roasty and burnt malt flavors very pronounced with zero off flavors, great job. Oats have really affected the mouthfeel to be this smooth. Excellent carbonation rinses clean and leaves nothing behind. Drinkability is quite good and I could have a few in a sitting.

As I take first sip the first thing that comes into my mind is wow this isnt quite right, an old soured coffee with an electric fuzzy hue that sticks on the back of the tongue. This quickly shines through as a bitter coffee feel. You really need to drink this beer close to room tempature. It lacks considerable balance that would make this brew a real winner that it should be. Mouthfeel is a sour bitter hue that hangs on long.

The taste of coffee is very dominate on the palate and almost overwhelms everything, but it isn't just the flavor regular coffee. It is like if you mixed a cup of espresso with a shot of regular coffee and melted some sweet chocolate and finally some toasted malt. This is really nice. The mouthfeel is very smooth from the oatmeal flakes in the brewing process. Slight alcohol warmth to this with medium carbonation.

The dark tan and chocolate color pour lets you know what youre in for. The fresh coffee smell comes out well in the nose. The first few drinks give youre mouth a shock before you get used to the full taste. The coffee is a bit over powering at first but calms down later in the beer. There is notes of dark chocolate but it as well as the toasted malt flavor are somewhat masked by the powerful coffee.

Sweet caramel maltiness provided some balance and there was a pleasant nutty flavour as well. It finished with a little extra bitterness and some green, grassy hops. There was too much carbonation for me, it really got in the way of the body and texture. Once flat, it had a decent, full body. Some warmth and dryness towards the end.

Nice sweet caramel malt taste with a fresh ground coffee kick. Mouthfeel could use some help. I thought it was lacking in thickness, especially for this style. It also had a bit too much carbonation for a double stout IMO. Drinkability takes a hit because of the bubbles, but it still goes down pretty well. Turtles rule, give this one a try.","BeerTruth","Jun 07, 2007"

4.57,6.3,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"12 oz. bottle, label mistakenly says 2006, but is a 2007. Pouring in snifter yields 1.5 cm mocha head, which stays around for around 5 minutes, before yielding a ring, the thickness of which is determined by the size of the bubbles contained within. Smell is delightful- strong coffee smell, with hints of roasted malt, creamy chocolate, and oatmeal cookies. Like with the smell, coffee dominates the taste- maybe a bit overpowering for some, but I find it quite pleasant- there are bitter chocolate notes in the taste as well, bitterness being most detected in the finish. Mouthfeel is a heavy medium, with a slick viscosity, carbonation is mostly limited to a tinge of bubbles on the tip of the tongue at initial contact. For a double stout- incredibly drinkable!","llitsua","Apr 09, 2007"

Beautiful scent, full and rich; a major contender against the other well-known "morning meal" stout in this category, for sure. Huge chocolate notes in the taste, followed by a mellower-than-expected dark-brewed toddy flavor, relatively acrid and with substantial staying power. There is a grainy sweetness as well, sort of sharp and tangy, too. Not quite as pleasing as the nose, but delicious all the same. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, with the kind of oil-slick viscosity that makes one want to keep from swallowing for as long as possible. Just what I look for in big stouts like this. No trace of alcohol, but I guess 7.5% isn't that much for this style. Very satisfying. A most excellent coffee stout -- definitely in the top three of those I've sampled. Plenty of coffee, but far from one-dimensional. Many thanks to oldirtysurfer for the bottle.","orfeu","Mar 02, 2007"

The rich coffee and chocolate aromas are amazingly potent and they draw me in. The taste is even better that the smell. As soon as the beer hits my lips I can immediately taste coffee just like the beer has been mixed with fresh brewed coffee. There is also a strong dark chocolate flavor that nearly equals the coffee flavor and a great roasted note. Almost as if they planned this in advance (wink wink), the smoothness of the oatmeal ties the strong flavors together and creates an amazing beer. The drinkability on this is awesome.

The awesome thing is that it has no astringency to it. The finish is where it gets even better, it starts out as previously described, but then some cocoa and a noticeable, but soft roastiness sets in and lingers. Mouthfeel started out medium bodied, but carbonation was a bit high, so I swirled my glass for a while and then the carbonation was about perfect.

The smell is all roasted coffee beans up front, with some winey malt at the back end. The taste starts out with some of the same sort of vinous flavors found in the aroma, progresses to some slightly metallic flavors with some noticeable hops,then a creamy sweet coffee flavor and a late slightly sour coffee finish. Decent quality cofee was obviously used and the coffee flavor is quite pronounced- in fact, it tastes more like the whole bean than a cupof coffee. Mouthfeel is predominantly creamy, with a lot of fizzy/creamy carbonation and medium weight. Pretty drinkable, but a little too one dimensional to make it a regular habit.

4.5,4.7,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Pours a thick dark brown with ruby black undertones. Small lite brown head that separates to the sides of the glass. Absolutely a beautiful beer for a stout. Smells like roasted chocolate malts, and grains of oat. I don't smell much coffee until it warms. Taste is sweet coffee and oatmeal in the front, like a milk stout, then somewhat bitter from the roasted malt, and overall warming from the higher alcohol content, like an imperial. I would have thought this beer had a higher abv than 7.5% The mouthfeel is also thick like it looks when pouring. A good chewy oatmeal feel. Overall, this is one a my favorite beers. Nothing better than one first thing in the morning for breakfast, no, just kidding, though it is filling enough for a breakfast drink. I do however love to have one in the evening after dinner. It is a wonderful dessert beer without being over the top sweet! Terrapin you guys rock!","finepaws","Jun 01, 2006"

The tatse is semi-sweet chocolate malt and tones of coffee. The strong alcohol flavor was there at first but as the glass emptied, everything balanced out perfectly. A nice, creamy texture that is pleasantly thick, but somehow very drinkable. I would love to get ahold of this the next time it is released.","jhammerly","May 24, 2006"

The flavor was very good, leading off with a malty chocolate and caramel feel and ending with a smoky and bitter taste, mayeb some floral and bitter hops.

As the beer warmed I could also taste a little bit of sourness, but it meshed pretty well with the overall taste of the beer. Mouthfeel was very smooth. Alcohol was barely evident and it was easy drinking for a beer of this strength(8.1% as stated on the bottle). Don't drink this one too cold though.

It poured absolutely black with a medium brown coloured head. Looks as a stout should. Smell is a lovely mix of cold coffee and any number of well build stouts with the coffee easily overpowering the other. The flavour of the coffee is very assertive in the batch, and honestly, almost the only flavour profile I can easily detect. Mouthfeel is absolutely delightful in that it is rather creamy and actually coats your mouth. This is truly a treat to those who enjoy a good stout, and if it's a coffee beer you seek, this will make you very happy indeed.

Poured without much caution resulting with a very thin chestnut film that disappeared fast. No lacing as I drink either. A very dark, opaque body. Strong aromas of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts with no hint of hop aroma. Malty sweet. The chocolate, coffee and a slick hit of the oats are the main attraction. The finish is long on all the malts. The alcohol becomes more evident when you near the 3/4 finish line. If this beer would have done better up front it would have scored much higher. I love the taste and the finish. Still a very nice beer to drink.","jlh8643","Mar 01, 2006"

Nose is deep fig, chocolate, and a puff of alcohol. I'm not getting a lot of coffee aroma in there. Flavor brings the coffee in, though nicely balanced. I'm getting dark fig, chocolate. It moves to sweet coffee on the finish. Very smooth and tasty, but nothing over the top and offensive. Vey well blended. Feel is thick, with a light carbonation. There is also a slight slickness to the feel as well. I think the components of this brew work well together. The flavor is really damn good, with a great blend of fruity, chocolate and coffee notes, with nothing dominating. The sweetness is there to back all the flavors as well.

The taste is of dark roasted coffee, slightly bitter, but the oatmeal smoothes and sweetens this. The label shows oatmeal cookies and I swear I can taste them. Fairly big bodied and a great creamy mouthfeel. Incredibly smooth and rounded, velvety almost. Fine carbonation. The bottle says the alcohol is 8.1%, but I never tasted even a hint. Well hidden.
