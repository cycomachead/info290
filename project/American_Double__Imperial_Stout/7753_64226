4.4,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Bottle from Joe. Thanks brah. Pitch black pour, small fizzy dark brown head. Huge anise aroma with some coconut, lots of bourbon and woody oak, roast, sweet chocolate, caramel, yum. Flavor follows with lots of bourbon and anise and settles into vanilla and caramel. Roast and chocolate are there, and there's an extra sweet tang that I assume is from the honey. Surprised how well this stands up to the barrels at only 8.5%. Rich body, medium low carbonation. Even better than expected.","BMMillsy","Apr 03, 2015"

4.35,-0.2,4,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.25,"The flavor profile is borderline World Class.  It is intense, extremely complex and one of the most balanced BA imperial stouts I've encountered.  It's only shortcoming, which is slight, is the lack of total alcohol coverage.  It begins with a bourbon slap that quickly yields to a rich semi-sweet rush of chocolate.  The middle is a light bitterness over a fading chocolate that allows the astringent alcohol flavor to manifest itself over a coffee note.  As this fades into the finish, light plum notes appear over a sweet vanilla and bourbon background.  The finish is slightly astringent and has a moderate alcohol heat.","tillmac62","Feb 17, 2015"

Probably the best representation of chocolate in a stout that I have come across. Chocolate dominates the palate with hints of vanilla, bourbon, and dark fruit.  Full bodied mouthfeel that is bolstered by the utter lack of carbonation. Finishes slightly bitter, with a final flourish of chocolate. Overall, an extremely complex and layered stout that definately benefited from a year in the cellar.","JohnG190","Nov 30, 2014"

Taste is a slightly tart cherry-chocolate followed by roasted malt and a little bit of coffee.  Mouthfeel is dense, viscous, and almost flat carbonation.  A huge sipper of a beer - much larger than its ABV would indicate.  Overall, an enjoyable dessert stout, but not one you'd drink the whole bomber by yourself.","FFreak","Nov 03, 2014"

Very sweet smelling. Reminds me of the smell of melting chocolate. Some mild fruit aromas as well. Very tasty. Lots of boozy bourbon flavor. More than most barrel aged beers. Lots of roasty sweet chocolate flavors. Slightly raisin and floral tastes. Pretty good. Very heavy though. I’m sitting in my hotel room by myself. Wish I had someone to share this with.

Flavor is big and powerful, avoiding the sometimes overly boozy punch of stronger BA beers. Oaky vanilla Bourbon richness, honey, tobacco, and graham crackers all rolled into a smooth malty package.

Aromas of rich molasses, old world fruit, roasted coffee, booze, raw honey, cream, vanilla, and woody highlights. Very heavy, layered nose. Flavors are rich and smooth, with an immediate blast of booze and warmth. Wow, this is a beast. Black strap molasses, cocoa nibs, cream, and booze all blend for the initial wave across the taste buds. You also get a solid measure of old world fruits, such as dates and raisins. Extremely dynamic. Wood and vanilla imparts can be picked up throughout, and the warmth continues to build. This is velvety smooth with every sip, although extremely heavy, as well, making you work for the enjoyment you are receiving. Nothing worth having comes for free. The aftertaste has a bit more bitterness to help balance, with more of the chocolate notes coming forward to balance all the rich sweetness, including the continued raw honey highlights. Very nice. The finish is smooth, with a slightly sweet linger that avoids cloying, and just begs you to continue drinking. Can't wait to see how this bad boy ages!","GarthDanielson","Mar 06, 2014"

Nose is quite reminiscent of BCBS - bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and ethanol. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of lactose. Less bourbon is present in the flavor profile than is expressed in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light and a little on the thin side for the style. Texture is creamy with a light, even carbonation throughout. Overall, a great beer that would be fantastic with just a little more to the body.","Jwale73","Nov 24, 2013"

There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

I don't know what barrels they used here, but I only have smelled this nose in PVW 20+ yr barrel aged beers. Minerals, nougat, vanilla, booze, cocoa, marzipan and honey in here. Really complex nose. Flavor is robust with sweet malts, some caramel, some fudge and some molasses. Again the honey is evident - which surprises me. Mineral character still there also. Full bodied with low carb and an off-dry finish. Nice beer, really the nose does it, the flavor doesn't do the olfactory justice.","harrymel","Feb 14, 2013"

At 8.5%, it is super smooth and extremely easy to drink. While I love the BCBS, the 15% can sometimes be overwhemling whereas Event Horizon's % is perfect.

It was poured into my favorite imperial pint glass and allowed to open up to the air for several minutes. The color was dark and murky just like a good stout should be. It had a slight red hue but overall a pretty good indication of what was ahead. The smell was so nice a slight sweetness but also had a richness to it. Also you could smell the bourbon in the beer which I love. I don't know how accurate the information I received was but I hear it was aged in used Pappy Van Winkle barrels, which is the big chief in bourbon these days. That information alone shows that these guys know there stuff when aging beer. The taste was thick and inviting with a sweetness but not cloying. You could definitely taste some dark plum, dried fruit, but also coffee, toffee and the honey playing a subtle role in all of it. The biggest and most impressive characteristic was the bourbon. You could definitely taste the bourbon and oh it was so grand, although this does have a good bit of alcohol it is balanced well with the more prevalent flavors incorporated in this very complex stout. I would rate this beer as one of the best ones I have ever had in its category and look forward to trying some of the 2012 editions as I have a few bottles being cellared as this is written. If you can get your hands on this beer, whatever edition you will not be dissatisfied.","humuloner22","Feb 10, 2013"

The mouthfeel is exceedingly decadent & rich with lingering barrel flavors and a touch of drying honey. This beer pushes the honey forward more than most stouts I've had with a honey addition.

4.17,-4.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The Event Horizon pours jet black, and a careful pour yields almost three fingers of burnt caramel tinted foam that actually rises up past the rim of the glass, without spilling out over the side. Head retention is pretty good, but lacing is definitely a bit spotty. The nose is wonderful, with aromas of cocoa powder, oak, bourbon, brown sugar, and vanilla all wafting out of the glass. The flavor profile shifts and consolidates a little bit. The beer is definitely more oak and bourbon forward on my palate than in the aroma, and most of the vanilla is phased out and replaced by more brown sugar. Dark chocolate continues to provide a base for all of these characteristics to play off of. The mouthfeel is great, because while it still has that slightly chewy aspect to it, it feels a little bit less heavy (thanks to the honey?) than most big stouts, and as a result it comes across as a fair bit more drinkable. As with all great stouts, the carbonation is nice and muted. I found this super fresh bottle of The Event Horizon to be just a tad barrel forward for my taste. It's still a very good beer, but even just a little time to mellow and come together should yield spectacular results.","axeman9182","Dec 11, 2012"

This is a good example of the barrel complimenting the beer as opposed to dominating it. The rougher and slightly hot feel held it back a little, unfortunately. As a comparison, the 2010 vintage was perfectly smooth and showcased an even better balance between base beer and barrel. Decadent and impressive. Either this beer does great after a year, or the first bottling in 2010 was slightly superior. In the end, this is a solid beer worth tracking down, and I’d love to drink it again.

The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, molasses, sweet honey (really more of a vague sweetness, but I'm attributing it to the honey anyway), and a dusting of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of oak and an even lighter touch of mild bourbon. I thought I got a bit of coffee in there, too, but it could have been caused by the several cups of java circulating around me at this point in the evening. The body is a strong medium, bordering on heft, with a light moderate carbonation and a very lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout.

Pours a dark brown with small light chocolate head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is chocolate, bourbon, some light oak and vanilla, as well as a bit of caramel. The taste is sweet dark chocolate, some bourbon, vanilla, and oak, and a bit of caramel. The finish is smooth with some light alcohol. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation. Fairly enjoyable, but not great. Comes off a little bit too sweet.","jethrodium","Dec 13, 2011"

4.32,-0.9,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"It tastes and feels rich. There's an abundant sweetness: honey and chocolate and bourbon. It's like decadent, but nearly overwhelming. Has the beer been sitting in barrels since the last bottling? It's heavy like that. The feel teeters on cordial. I'm glad everybody's fired up about this one. I'd say it's the Carolinas Abyss! The honey adds sweetness you could counter is unnecessary, but it adds some smoothness that pulls it ahead of a BA Blackbeerd. Disclaimer: only had the BT, wish I could've tried the Beam variety.

Starts sweet with molasses, brown sugar, that then goes to a rich chocolaty roasted flavor. The bourbon is well incorporated. Overall, I am really impressed with this one.

The nose is sweet malts and dark fruit, bourbon, oak. Smells fine. Taste is that sweet malt, dark fruit, and very understated barrel character. One note until the finish. The finish is acrid burnt something and hops. Burnt honey and bittering hops? Whatever it is, the finish does not work for me at all. It's that same finish that is present in a lot of maple imperial stouts/black ales that does not work for me at all. Good body for the ABV, which was oddly low. We had a good lineup, but this bottle wasn't finished. Let me state that again. There were 8 people there and this bottle was not finished. Everyone else was defending that it was fine, but that is not exactly what my expectation was. In my opinion, this was very forgettable and in the opinion of my group, it was only slightly better.

4.32,-0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O-- A much bigger feeling stout than it really is. Big beer but easy to drink. Could use a bit more carbonation and more of a silky feel to it though, as it became very coffee acidic in the end. Quite unique as the hints of bourbon and Oak just toy with the senses. This was far more about malts than anything else. Worth trying.","mulder1010","Jul 16, 2011"

Madeira-soaked dried plums, vanilla, nougat, wood, dark chocolate and soft charcoal rush the nose ... very aromatic and mouthwatering. Slick package, fullish body unfolds slowly. More oak than vanilla-bourbon to start; lush maltiness turns roasty as quick as the oakiness pulls the palate. Light on the hops--or at least they mellowed out. Chocolate and sweetness fade quick. Slow drinking here, which helps to let the beer evolve. Very enjoyable.","BeerAdvocate","Mar 23, 2011"

Whopper malt, molasses, honey. Smells great, but it shouldn't smell like this, smells like a bw...

I can't say I'm disappointed, and I prefer this to any other North Carolina barrel-aged stouts, with the exception of one or two vintages of ORF. I love the dark cherry and toasted coconut notes, the bourbon is well-integrated, the fudge is luscious, and the body is mind-blowing. I wish I had more than this one bottle.","Verecund","Feb 17, 2011"
4.6,5.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Complex aroma with a good balance of hops, bourbon barrel ans honey. Hints of pine up front along with a prominent bourbon character. Hints of sweet spirit and oak as well as a healthy dose of vanilla in the nose. Viscous, chewy medium body that's on the full end with lots chocolate malt, a very prominent hop forward bitterness, oak, vanilla, honey and almost the perfect amount of bourbon. Mid-palate sweet chocolate malt, honey and licorice. I was expecting much more of a bourbon bomb but this beer is incredibly well balanced, complex and delicious. This is the best NC beer I have had to date.","ssuggs01","Feb 17, 2011"
4.53,3.9,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"An amazingly bold flavors for a lower abv barrel aged imp. stout. Milk chocolate and rich malt coats your tongue. Finishes with high quality bitter dark chocolate and medium toasted oak. Bourbon doesn't push through very well but is rather soft and intertwined within the milk chocolate. I wouldn't mind it being more pronounced. This beer is so rich and silky and you could easily put back a few glasses. Hype warranted.","BearsOnAcid","Feb 16, 2011"

4.37,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Beer is medium bodied, creamy on the mouth. Fills out nicely in the back half of the beer. The lead off here is the malt syrupy sweetness, not too sweet or cloying, just enough, the bourbon lets loose next giving some mild heat, not off putting but it is definitely aggressive, the back end is bitter with the roast with a nice finish, the swallow allows the flavor to rediffuse through the palate leaving you wanting another drink. It's a good beer, not the best barrel aged stout I've had but it's up there. Thanks.","drabmuh","Feb 01, 2011"
3.1,-28.9,3,3,3.5,3,2.5,"Sampled at Sexual Chocolate 2011. Pours a deep black color with a thick brownish white head and a small amount of lacing. Smells of sweet chocolate and coffee.

The alcohol is noticable in flashes as you sip the beer, but at 8.5%, this is a one and done for sure. I think some age would do this beer well. Hopefully some of the overt sweetness will fade out.

4.05,-7.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Center pour gets you three fingers of extremely dark brown foam, the top comprised of larger, thin-skinned bubbles, hence dissolves at a swift pace, does leave thick, messy slabs of lacing behind and the final layer across the surface has staying power. About the blackest pour you will ever see shoot out of a beer bottle, this said when logically black is just black and does not admit of gradients. Naturally, fully opaque. The nose is like a chocolate factory on fire, all roasted and toasted cocoa, mocha, caramel, coffee ice cream, butterscotch and even a suggestion of chicory, all this with a good dose of pine and orange zest blended in, the booziness gives the fruit scents a plum, raisin, cherry cast, dessert-like, otherwise too monolithic for much else to enunciate clearly. Full-bodied for sure, dry and powdery in texture, you can feel it cake up on the tongue, the oak wood evident in many different manners. So much chocolate and cocoa that it's kind of embarrassing to mention other components, the caramel, butterscotch and honey a distant second. Rum raisin, alcohol drenched poached plum, cherry to pear fruit. Lower pine here, more dried herbal and grass matter, tree bark. The grill smoke adds a helpful sour dimension. Underneath the intentional "black star" density is a fairly complex beer trying to get out. If it had more flow and "give" it would be highly notable within its category.","farrago","Jan 24, 2011"

4.37,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"NOTE: I'm pretty sure the 8.5% ABV can't be correct. The base beer is listed at 10.2%!! However, if it really is only 8.5% it sure packs in a lot of flavor and heft, while still maintaining fairly well-hidden alcohol.","MasterSki","Jan 10, 2011"
4.32,-0.9,4,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Drinkability: I tried to show up to Duckworth's in time to try this on tap alongside Mother Earth's Silent Night. This one had kicked by the time I arrived so I was only able to try the Silent Night, but I was fortunate enough to grab this one in a bottle, at which time I was assured it was the superior beer. Now that I've had both, I have to agree. Particularly if you like "light" RISs, this one is for you - fruity, lighter, with plenty of barrel character but not an overwhelming (or even prominent) amount of bourbon. To make this beer perfect, I'd leave it in either fresher barrels, or - if these were first cut barrels - for twice as long, as well as amp up the underlying base malts, giving it a little more body and grain character. Sure, it'll probably take the abv up from 8.5% (where it was extraordinarily manageable, by the way) to something a little more intense, but that'd be a fair trade off to bring this beer a little closer to perfection. As it stands, it's an excellent beer, worth seeking out, but stands a little beneath North Carolina's best -bal RIS (Olde Rabbit's Foot, BA Sexy Choc) and some of the great -bal RISs out there (Abyss, Black Note). Nonetheless, worth seeking out.","CrellMoset","Jan 08, 2011"

Very rich and intense aromas of dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso and burbon. All very balanced and working together as a cohesive unit. The flavor is very intense without being too much. This beer walks that fine line perfectly. The flavor is a mixture of dark chocolate, espresso, roasted oats and grains, and burbon. Thick, creamy and smooth mouthfeel.

4.62,6,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Served from bottle that was split with JackTheBear at Duckworth's after picking some of these up at the store into a goblet. Poured pitch black with a half finger tan head that subsided quickly to a minimal amount. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, and honey. The flavor was of sweet malt, slightly roasted malt, slight alcohol, caramel, dark chocolate, and honey. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this brew amazed me. For this to be a relatively fresh BA brew it is very mellowed out to begin with. Olde Hickory says on the bottle that this one will stand up to aging and get better with time. I don't see how that is possible as this thing is drinking awesome right now. If this is true, some people are going to be in for a treat in a year or two. The flavor on this one is one of the most complex I have gotten from an BA stout to-date. Everything blended together very nicely and in unison. Damn good nose on this one as well. Only 1000 bottles and limited kegs, but if you get a chance to get some of this, DO IT! You won't regret it.","thagr81us","Dec 13, 2010"
4.37,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Excellent mouthfeel as this completely coats and warms the palate. Silky smooth. Soft finish. The bourbon quality complements this beer excellently, but is not in-your-face at all. Lots of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, mild cold coffee, honey, and hints of vanilla tannins. And only 8.50%, are you kidding me?! This was such a treat. I could sip this one all day. Best thing OHB has ever put out. For those that enjoy the big boozy BBA Stouts, this may not be your favorite, but I loved it.","Onenote81","Dec 13, 2010"
