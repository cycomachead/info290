I'm stunned at the high ratings really, it's good, but certainly not THAT good.","Bonsall_Phil","Monday at 07:27 PM"

Perfect nose for the style - coffee and roasted malts with hints of brown sugar and toffee. Near perfect body as well - heavy enough to such staniate the beer but not overly chewy. The sweetness has started to show signs of a shift toward a more roasty, bitterness, but I don't see this ever melding into something I wouldn't still consider sweet. Still, by and large, the standard deviation by which all non-BA coffee stouts should be compared (just hairs above FBS, imo). I'd be curious to know if lactose and/or oatmeal were used, because this shows great characteristics of each. Cheers!","HowardTheDuck","Mar 30, 2015"

It poured thick and had a nice mouthfeel, but missed some of the creaminess I like with a stout clocking in at 12% ABV. My overall experience with the beer went through a couple of phases initially i thought the flavor was lacking in sweetness, but as i sipped the carmel flavors started to build and i thought the beer was starting to round out as it warmed, however as i continued to drink the alcohol seemed to overpower the overall flavor of the beer.","Jackolope","Mar 27, 2015"

Lots of chocolate in the flavor too, with fruity coffee bean, leather, molasses, and a touch of smoke, drying out with a little black malt lingering into the finish.

Aroma is about a pound of chocolate and roast coffee beans, caramel glazed, with soft vanilla, berries and nuts, musky wood, and a little bit of something wine-like. Very fun dark sniffings with a bright fruity edge... And time for a sip. Thick dark chocolate, roasty malt, blackstrap molasses, tobacco, meat seasonings, leather, smoke, all smooth and heavy with a sharp and elongated bitterness that works its way in at the end of each sip, then holds on until the next. Pretty big guns here... This is not meant to be consumed quickly. A lot of flavor to behold and very aromatic. Slight alcohol warming, otherwise its strength is not conveyed by the taste or sense of alcohol. This however does feel like an extra strong beer due to the intensity of all its flavors.

Taste is bold chocolate and high quality coffee beans. There is a slight spiciness on the finish. I keep waiting for the same blast of alcohol I got on the nose, but it never comes. It just finishes smooth as can be with no burn (surprising given the ABV). Feel is that also, smooth and velvety/creamy with an adequate level of carbonation. Overall, a super impressive brew. Wasn't sure I'd want the whole bottle to myself, but halfway through my first glass I'm already looking forward to the second. It's a bit pricey, but not out-of-this-world expensive, and certainly worth picking up now and then.","ZebraCakez","Jan 04, 2015"

Dark chocolate with strong coffee overtones, sticky and sweet but also deep and complex. The balance is perfect and I could drink this all day. Very enjoyable at a moderately chilled temperature, becomes more sticky and heavy as it warms up. Very hefty price tag but certainly worth trying at least once.","bfisher91","Dec 25, 2014"

The flavors of chocolate and coffee work so well together, and the big vanilla and caramel flavors add the perfect touch to make this such an outstanding beer. The alcohol is also masked dangerously well for 12%, with only a small hint of it on the finish. This beer is very, very complex.

Tons of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt.  A bit winy from the high alcohol content - you can really sense it.  A big beer, well-carbonated and surprisingly smooth.  This beer is truly a pleasure to drink.","PacNWDad","Nov 06, 2014"

As an admitted non bourbon barrel-aged stout fan, I was surprised to find so many similar notes of BBA stouts in this. Slight milk chocolate note  over vanilla-y yogurt covered raisins and then some alcohol. Note that I do not really enjoy a noticeable alcohol content. Just not enjoying this nearly as much as so many other RISs out there. Glad to have tried it, but not one I would recommend. Sorry Alesmith, maybe I just had much higher hopes. With such a vast number of Russian imperial stouts out there, I would gladly reach for a year-round RIS over this any day.","Ngntjp","Nov 01, 2014"

The nose has some roast but it is far milder than expectations would dictate. The flavor profile includes a touch of bittersweet and also includes residual coffee notes. The flavor is complex but there is certainly something lacking in the roasted malts compared to other big stouts. The alcohol esters come on strong in the finish and become less than pleasant.","57md","Aug 06, 2014"

Bottle #1 put me off primarily because it was too chewy and bitter-tasting to me IMO. So easy to meander up to Wisconsin, though, and snag this for $10.99 a bomber so I owed this WC beer another try and this time I was not disappointed. The rich, deep, and dark chocolate/coffee influence I experienced was outstanding. Definitely thick and chewable to me but that is part of experiencing this beer when you bring it to the table. Toasty and roasty? Absolutely. I would recommend it and support it as a world-class beer which is very reasonably priced (a luxury these days).","bowzer4birdie","Jun 12, 2014"

The main difference is almost acidic tinge the beer has. Perhaps the hop bitterness...perhaps the fusel alcohols. I don't know. What I do know is that this is a change that happened almost immediately a few years back. They used to brew this beer in low rider, cheese making bins. They used to claim the low fermenting "pressure" produced less fusel alcohols. Perhaps this is the difference. All I know for certain is that it is not a good as it used to be.","jomo","Jun 05, 2014"

4.29,-2.3,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Was super excited to get a bottle of this from a recent online order. It pours a jet black hue with a frothy tan head with hood retention and lacing. The nose is a boozy blend of coffee, vanilla, dark roasted fruits, and some woody notes. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Flavor is big and in your face. Lots of coffee and roasted malts. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Alcohol is definitely present. This was great but I can't help but think how much better it would be with some age on it. Hopefully I can get another at some point and put it aside for a few years.","lochef81","Jun 05, 2014"

It has great color and smells wonderful. The one knock I have is that it has a little acidic hint on the back end which is a bit unpleasant.","ThatOlBoy","Jun 04, 2014"

Another whiff brings black strap molasses out. Brussels lacing. Mouth is bone dry and surprisingly smooth for the style. The flavor starts off with dark roasted malt on the front of the palate and thens into an odd pairing of sweet plum and molasses along with bitter notes from the roasted barley and coffee.

It poured beautifully. Totally black with a huge dark khaki head that held up for quite a while. The nose was dark sweet malts, some cocoa, gas station coffee, milk chocolate, no hints of alcohol. The taste was sweetened dark chocolate, maybe some charred/smoky marshmallow, but it was dominant coffee flavor that turned me off. Admittedly it grew on me as the beer warmed but I still found it to be too one noted and too much like cold gas station coffee for me. No traces of the 12% alcohol. All that said, it felt fantastic going down - rich, smooth and thick without being cloying. I really wanted to love this beer as it is clearly well crafted and highly regarded, but the single noted coffee flavor was too much for me to get past and really enjoy.","jwchestnut","Feb 24, 2014"

The feel is still a menace and the look is good, but something went horribly wrong with this batch. Rotten vegetables and band aids all over the place. Nasty. The Kopi was a touch better and BA Kopi was the best, though that's not saying much.","Jeffo","Jan 27, 2014"

Dark and rich, the bitter chocolate profile brings about dark fruit nuances and pairs well with the addition of Ryan Bros. Coffee. Earthy is the key though, as this medium-full bodied beer finishes balanced but bitter-leaning with a clearly warming smoothness.","BeerFMAndy","Dec 22, 2013"

Surely the best imperial stout over 10% abv. I've had. Among the best period. A definite sipper. Thick, smooth drinking despite the high alcohol. Quite an achievement. At room temperature for this tasting due to a hotel without a keyless refrigerator. I wish i could take more on our cruise, but rules are rules. A superb bottle score while in Seattle.

The first taste was stronger coffee and chocolate which mellowed and became much smoother and decadent as it warmed. The Speedway Stout clocks in at a 12% ABV so by the time I finished my first glass I though this was easily the best beer on the planet! In retrospect I would put it up there with some of the best beers in the world, but to call it the best is more a matter of taste and mood.

I feel the caffeine as much as the booze, which totally works at the lunch hour. chocolate as it finishes, not much bitterness at all, more like a cappuccino than an espresso, also okay. as big as body gets in beer, a definite bottle to share. overall exceptional, but not as distinct as I thought it would be. memorable but not the best ive ever tasted.","StonedTrippin","Oct 24, 2013"

4.53,3.2,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Overall: This beer is definitely top 10 in its style, maybe even top 5. The chocolate and coffee work extremely well together as opposed to some other brews that allow both to stand alone. I mentioned a bit about some alcohol burn, but for 12% this is extremely impressive. There's nothing overbearing about this beer. When it comes to non-barrel aged imperial stouts, this definitely is right up there with the best of them. I now really want to get my hands on the different coffee variants and the barrel aged versions of this. For right now though, I'll stick with the deliciousness of the original. Alesmith has themselves a quality product on their hands.","RichD","Jul 01, 2013"

It was so dark it was like looking into Ray Liotta's soul. The aroma oozed out of the snifter - chocolate, dark roast coffee, caramel, maybe a little vanilla. In contrast to my opening remark, the mouthfeel was not that of syrup or caramel but I'd more liken it to a dark chocolate covered espresso bean. This is just a fantastic beer. I saved this one for a night when I could just chill out and enjoy a sunset and a beer.","SteveTheDog","Jun 15, 2013"

Nose is chocolate, roasted coffee, dark roasted malts and a touch of cherry. A little alcohol on the nose but it is 12% after all. Malt goes doughy and deep as it warms and there is bread in this. Taste is huge alright. Greets you with espresso and plenty of roasted coffee flavors, then smooth doughy malt mid palate with some faint floral from the hops, unsweetened cocoa and the dark fruit, then a hint of the molasses aspect of the malt and a grainy feeling on the tongue. It finishes dry and toasted with the chocolate coming in again only sweet this time and with a delectable oily hop bitter. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky with good carbonation. Some alcohol on the palate. It’s the coffee that makes this one stand out and it’s done to perfection. This is truly an impeccable stout.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

The smell is a little sharp, perhaps some hops character coming through. The body is thin for a stout like this, I expected something more chewy; I love a thick syrupy imperial but this isn't even close. The flavor was not very well balanced, dominated by the unmasked alcohol. Granted 12% is hard to mask, but there is very little sweetness, it's like they didn't even try. Notes of coffee and chocolate are apparent, but not as dominating as I'd like. The vanilla notes are hidden behind what seems to be a bit of unsavory tinny hops on the finish. I only began to notice the vanilla about half way through. While there is a lot going on in this stout, it just didn't seem to come together. Perhaps this would be a good one for the cellar to let it mellow out and come together.","Kevin73","Apr 16, 2013"
4.3,-2.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Even though the taste of roasted coffee beans was around every corner, the taste never got boring. Like every other AleSmith beer, the price is a tad on the high side.

The heat is somewhat well-disguised within all the flavours of the beer which tells me a lot. I'll keep my final bottle to age a year and see how things turn out. But for its style, imperial coffee stout, and its price point, I have got to say that it's the best non-BA imperial stout with coffee I've had so far. (4.5)","Stevedore","Mar 28, 2013"

Just a hint of toffee as well in there before a finish of pure dark roasted coffee beans. The coffee flavor in here isn't as intense as a beer like KBS, but I think it's more refined. There's just a hint of warmness and a drying sensation on the finish that reminds you this is a big boy. I highly recommend drinking this just below room temp. It's a totally different animal when it's cold.","notchucknorris","Mar 17, 2013"

4.39,0,4.25,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,"O: One of the better coffee stouts I've ever had. It's not pure coffee like some, instead it melds nicely while still being quite a strong aspect. The maltiness of the 12% really helps compete, I think. Mouthfeel is top notch on this one, like brownie batter in your mouth. Makes it surprisingly drinkable despite the strong flavors and bigger ABV. Overall the beer is surprisingly mellow and well-integrated.","Dope","Jan 29, 2013"

Aroma is on the sour milk side. nice chocolate and a little bit of coffee. Pretty simple and boring. Flavor is huge with a sweet coffee hitting you right up front. This goes to a bitter chocolate and nice coffee finish. Simple, strong, and delicious. Also has hints of vanilla and caramel. Creamy in flavor but not as much on the tongue. Mouth feel is a little lacking, the carbonation is good but body seems a bit weak. Overall a very good beer with great coffee tones, probably the best coffee I've had.","RuckusDu","Jan 27, 2013"

I'm nitpicking, but there's a bit too much anise for my liking, yet the fact there's no harshness in what you'll find in some Imperials (Old Rasputin, for example) puts this RIS in the upper echelon territory. Very Assertive. I thought at first it might be infected, because it seemed somewhat sour initially, but once it warmed all that classic RIS flavor came out in full force. To be honest, I may have to re-review the Oskar Blues TenFidy, because I'm finding a lot of similarities between the two, but I'm enjoying this substantially more than I did my initial intro to TenFidy.","TheSixthRing","Jan 20, 2013"

The taste is excellent upfront, with tons of chocolate and a great heavy velvet feel. The back half of this stout is where I have to downgrade just a bit because of the over the top bitter coffee taste at the end. I'm not a coffee drinker so maybe that's why I knock this a bit. However, a beer like Fonders Breakfast Stout has the chocolate and coffee too but doesn't leave that aftertaste. So bottling line, this beer is really good, no doubt, but does not hang with the the top in this category.","sjones5045","Jan 01, 2013"

What I got instead was much more on the mature chocolate front. Not too sweet but so rich. Multiple things going on from baked dark chocolate brownie to coffee to woodiness to fruit to nice burn. So rich and well balanced. Very very nice. Bravo. The hype always worries me thanks to past letdowns, but this one lives up to it.","BrownNut","Dec 06, 2012"

Taste is all about the strong expresso flavor, the nose is awesome, but can't compare to the flavor. Body is medium large, a good amount of life, a little dry, and very drinkable for the size.

Was hoping for more on the aroma (the only knock here and it is minor). Huge coffee flavor with a nice bitterness. A bit of a cocoa powder lingering on the palate. Another sip reveals a bit of dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel, lighter than I had expected but still pretty chewy. Love this because it doesn’t go all syrupy like some others. Really coffee forward with the right carbonation. Alcohol hidden but leaves a lingering warmth. Heavy lacing as it goes. Very nice. Really want to try the BA version.","BMMillsy","Nov 23, 2012"

The taste does cause me a slight schizophrenia as it was at times harshly bitter and at times cloyingly sweet. Usually those two balance eachother out well, but I think the creaminess of the mouthfeel (which was unquestionably my favorite aspect of this beer) allows the residual beer to sit on the tongue just a bit longer and confuse you with it's progressions. Nonetheless, a must have in the cellar for any die hard stout fan.","Wreckoncile","Nov 07, 2012"

The beer presents itself as an opaque, nearly black with a huge, frothy, long-lasting mocha head. Aromas are characterized by milk chocolate, malted milk balls, brewed coffee, brown spirits, and perhaps some raisin. Silky, viscous, warm (not from alcohol, but like a parka for the palate), creamy, pleasant mouthfeel. Initial coffee acidity, yielding sweet roasted marshmallows, tons of lactose, and finally, cherry. Finishes with mild, but lingering bitterness. Nearly no alcohol warmth or flavor.","DocJitsu","Aug 04, 2012"

Smell- dark chocolate, dark fruit (reminds me in some ways of Black Metal with the yeast?) Booze definitely present. What I can't get out of this is the presence of coffee. Really nice aroma. Taste- whoa. Sweet dark chocolate bitterness blasts the back of my mouth. The roast coffee is the lighter note, its there on the end as well, and just melds perfectly with the aggressive bitter chocolate notes. Warming alcohol warms my chest- this is pretty assertive, a quality I like in my big stouts. The carbonation is appropriate here too.

Pretty incredible, thick and smooth, somewhat silky, mouthfeel results. Drawback is ethanol burn and heat, felt clearly in the nostrils and the back of the throat. Finish is dry and slightly sticky from small amounts of residual sugars.","falloutsnow","May 08, 2012"

Served in a snifter, a dark brown-black pour with a creamy cap of mocha-colored head that receded to a dense ringlet, leaving some attractive lacing on the glass throughout the session. Aroma is pretty much straight-up dark chocolate and booze. Taste is heavy with creamy dark chocolate (one of the biggest dark chocolate profiles I've ever had in a beer actually), dark malts, moderately roasty, booze that's not at all timid, and minor notes of espresso, grass, and cherry cordial. Full bodied and delicious, probably just short of a "5" on mouthfeel due to the heat, but let it come down to a warmer temperature and the smoothness will improve. Very tasty and a great brew overall; one of the better non-BA stouts out there.","Rifugium","Apr 27, 2012"

Really looks great. The nose is a pleasant blend of roast, coffee, bakers chocolate, without even a hint of the alcohol. The flavor builds upon the nose with an initial rush of the roast and coffee. The chocolate mellows the beer out well. Mildly bitter with a hint of heat, but very appealing. Smooth and creamy, viscous. Full bodied and well carbonated. The flavors linger forever, terrific. Overall, this beer lived up to the hype from the bottle shop in Escondido, wish I had more!","hopfacebrew","Apr 23, 2012"

4.33,-1.4,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Alesmith Speedway Stout pours in the glass a pretty thick coat of dark black with just a touch of dark brow foam up top that leaves some gunk. Some swirls bring out some more life, a lot of activity for a 12% stout. Smell is all about the roasted malt with roasted coffee mixed in. It's bold and smells like the pure Columbian kind. Some faint chocolate and earthy hops, but this is all about the COFFEE. Taste is extremely roasty and some bitterness comes with the coffee. The main ingredient delivers. Small traces of vanilla and a small hop bite at the end. This must be a fresh keg. Pretty creamy and a nice full feel, carb is light, just like the bottles that I have had, but it works for this type of beer. Not a lot of alcohol or heat as well. I drank this quicker than most huge stouts which speaks for it's ease of drink. Not the most impressive stout in terms of balance, but one of the more impressive ones that's main ingredient is coffee.","BARFLYB","Apr 14, 2012"

This beer absolutely lives up to its rating on BA. It was so tasty that I bought 4 bombers for my cellar. It certainly isn’t as good as KBS but I think it is a well-blended stout. I get lots of roasted malts and coffee. It is smooth and yet bitter… I thought this would be a let down after the KBS but it wasn’t at all. Its masks the booze well but there is a hint of the booze in the finish as it warms. I plan on cellaring the 4 bottles that I bought and breaking them out over the next few years. I will report back with my findings.","bvdubn","Apr 12, 2012"

4.41,0.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Speedway Stout pours solid black, with two and a half fingers of mocha foam. Head retention is superb, it positively creeps its way down the glass. At the same time, absolute sheets of lacing are left clinging to the inside of the glass. The nose screams coffee at first sip, but some rich chocolate becomes more prominent as the beer warms. A brief, yet potent swirl of milk chocolate greets my taste buds with each sip, before giving way to a big, yet smooth coffee note. A light touch of anise on the back end adds a touch of complexity that really serves to elevate the beer. The mouthfeel is absolutely luxurious. The body is full and creamy, and paired with a carbonation that just does enough to cut through the malt. All in all, it could stand to be just a touch more rich/viscous, but that's a minor quibble. Speedway Stout is a stunning, decadent imperial stout, one of my absolute favorites of the style.","axeman9182","Mar 22, 2012"

Yes its dark as hell; yes it's got the coffee notes; and yes it's a great stout. However, there's something else going on here--couldn't ever put my finger on it; that is until my wife chimed in. APPLE. Now that she's mentioned it, I can't stop thinking about it as I'm tasting this beer. There's a prominent GREEN APPLE aftertaste. It's unique but a weird aftertaste for a stout.

Aromas of big dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, toast, caramel, molasses, biscuit, herbal spiciness, smoke, and earthiness. Amazing aromas with great balance and strength. Taste of huge dark roasted chocolate, coffee, black roasted malt, caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, smoke, earthiness, vanilla, and herbal spice. Very light amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big dark chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, molasses, and biscuit on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel. Alcohol is pretty much invisible considering the 12%, with only a faint warming well after the finish present.

Speedway Stout is a HUGE Imperial Stout, with pounds and pounds of coffee added during conditioning for a little extra kick! Pours jet black, with a toast-brown head with beautiful lacing that lasts throughout. Aromatics of coffee, roasty chocolate, hints of cococa nibs, and caramels. The flavor begins with a strong coffee and dark chocolate sensation, then fades to a multitude of toasty, roasty and caramelly flavors. Finishes with a nice fullness but dry enough not to be cloying. Velvety smooth texture. Clean and crisp, full-bodied. Warmth from the high alcohol content lightens up the feel a bit. What an excellent huge beer!","CuriousMonk","Dec 29, 2011"

Pretty straigth forward big flavors well carried out. Alcohol very well masked for its strength. Thick, very full bodied, and rich. Long aftertaste.

A gross slug of yeast or something plopped into my glass at the end of the pour from the bottle. Ew. Smell is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, slight chocolate, and a noticeable alcohol sting. Taste is of dark roasted malt, rich roasted coffee, and bitter chocolate. There is a nice roasty bitterness that sticks to the palate after each sip. A low level of carbonation makes for a smooth and thick mouthfeel.

For being a 12% offering, this didn't taste nearly as boozy as I'd anticipated. This has a nice solid mouthfeel to it. Thick, coats your entire mouth, and has some staying power to it.

In fact, this is one of those stouts that I actually think would be better fresh (or at least with six months of age or less).

Poured pitch black with a one finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, and subtle acidity. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee, and coffee acidity. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I can tell that a lot of the coffee aspect on this one had faded as it sat in my cellar. However it was still very present and quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel on this one was spot on for what I would expect from a brew of this style. Got to try this one side-by-side with BA Speedway Stout as well, but found BA to be superior due to the added woodiness and sweet alcohol aspect. Still a really good brew that I would suggest to anyone I came across.","thagr81us","Aug 10, 2011"

Coffee plays a lessor role in the taste, but it's still wonderful. Lots of roasted malts and hints of sweet dark fruits are subtle. It's just stellar.

Pours a jet black with a decent tan head. As others have said, decent amount of carbonation for an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and raisins. This beer is huge on the palate, the coffee comes through but so does a serious amount of sweetness and a bit of booze as well. However, the alcohol level, while present (as it should be in a 12% abv beer) is kept in check by the sweetness and intensity of the other flavors present. Overall this is as well balanced as a huge over the top Imperial Stout can be. One of the first "extreme" beers I had when I was really starting to get into craft beer 5 or 6 years ago and it still holds up well.","BeerAmbassador","Jul 27, 2011"

I taste the chocolate, coffee(some dark coffee) and alcohol. The coffee from Ryan Bros coffee beans is really heavy on the after taste so it lingers with me as I type this.

It drinks like lightly roasted chocolate coffee beans with a touch of cream and a light boozy finish. It's also sweet but not too sweet. It's nice but the coffee features a little more bitterness when compared to a bevy of other stouts. The alcohol isn't very present for being so high in abv.

4.03,-8.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The mighty Speedway Stout, managed to finally get a bottle from my local shop in Bethlehem. I knew that it's said to be better with age but I was very excited to try it and didn't bother waiting more than a week or two to open it up. The pour was pitch black and gave off a nice brown colored head on it. The smell was deeply roasted and had elements of coffee and chocolate. The flavor of the beer seemed to me like it was lacking something. The flavors were pretty good but not something that I was expecting. I guess I was missing the WOW factor of it all. The flavors were the same as what was picked up on the nose with a subtle hoppiness to it. The mouthfeel was pretty good, not overly thick but still had enough body to keep it intact with the style. Overall I wasn't extremely impressed with this, I've picked up another bottle since and I plan on aging it for a while. I plan on revising this review when that time comes.","Knapp85","Jun 15, 2011"
4.74,8,4,5,5,4,4.5,"Pours pitch black, with no head and nothing but little brownish bubbles at the top of the beer. Just looking at it, you can tell this is one thick beer. Smell is HUGE amounts of coffee. Oh man, so much coffee in the aroma, and a very nice chocolate smell to compliment it. Taste is just like the smell..coffee. Really good coffee though. Very little hops or bitterness to it, just smooth coffee and chocolate. Absolutely delicious. This is by far the best coffee stout I've had. Mouthfeel is very oily and think...not a lot of carbonation, but it works pretty well as this is a huge beer. The alcohol is not even noticable. Fantastic beer.","atowle25","Jun 13, 2011"

The smell was not very strong but was nice and plesent. The taste was of a well balanced coffee, roasty, dark fruit flavor. Honestly they all seemed to match very well, but the biggest problem was no carbonation. The carbonation in this brew was way to low and hard to find honestly. I felt for this flavor profile it needed just a dash more to tie everything together. I am hoping I had a bad bottle but this was my second bottle both of which were different years. So I am just chacking this up to not my style. Don't get me wrong this a good Stout just not something I will seek out again. If it was sold in m area I would probably pick it up from time to time.

They remind of lots of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, and leather. The taste is holy crap a lot of coffee. It was more of a punch in the face with the amount of bitterness that came up front. The coffee flavor took over the taste of this beer with mostly dark roast. The more this beer was drank the more it grew on me, but initially it was hard to swallow. This beer was consumed at the appropriate temperature and my coffee loving participant in this experience with me agreed this is a lot of delicious coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is still acidic and astringent, but with that kinda being the point I remain lenient to them. Overall this was a damn good coffee imperial stout, it's odd that they don't advertise it at that.

The beer's carbonation makes it seem creamy and it never crosses over into chocolate syrup territory. The beer is very drinkable and enjoyable. There's great flavor and Alemsmith has done a great job masking the booze. The taste doesn't have quite the punch I remember, but it's very pleasant and all the required elements are in their place.

Certainly a great thing, coffee being in the forefront with a sweet toffee finish. The body is full and chewy. With the giant head I was afraid this would be over carbonated but it's really on point.

The taste follows the nose, heavy with dark roasted coffee and the astringent bitterness that comes from too much roasting, chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Too much roast when fresh. A very smooth and creamy stout with a great mouth-feel, but it was hard to appreciate because of the bitterness. A very good stout that should be aged, even with all the coffee notes.

Not as much complexity as a Peche Mortel or Founder's Breakfast Stout, but as a coffee geek, this does the trick.

Smell brings a mellow but good scent of fresh roasted coffee beans with a light touch of cream. A faint nuttyness from the roast and malts is also present along with a bit of boozy cherry liqour. Initial taste brings a quick touch of warm, cherry liqour like boozyness (my first hint that this 2010 release should have aged longer), as it sits the flavors develop into a smooth creamy taste of dark roasted (but not burnt) espresso beans with nice touched of chocolate and cream. Faint hints of spice, like cinammon on the palate as well as minor notes of vanilla from the oak. Full bodied, rich, creamy without being too heavy, perfect carbonation.

Taste is roasted coffee, chocolate and bourbon up front, with notes of vanilla and dark fruit. Finish is both dry and sweet. Mouthfeel is medium to thick, creamy with good carbonation.

Huge coffee beans and chocolate fudge, big dark fruit, some vanilla and some hop bitterness there too.

4.63,5.5,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Pours black as a starless night with a thickness that is evident in the pour. It is capped with a fluffy mocha head that slowly melts into the viscous black liquid. The aroma is full of roasted coffee and the darkest coca, as well as a dark malty sweetness and a hint of licorice. The flavor is wonderful. Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, burnt marshmallow sweetness, licorice, molassas and a touch of chalkiness. All the flavors are well incorporated and the alcohol is well hidden, though it warms nicely as it settles in my stomach. Also, as this beer warms I realize just how bitter it is. Strangely, this bitterness is not overwhelming and works with, and not against the roastyness. The mouthfeel is also wondrous and is full, chewy and smooth. The finish is both sticky and slick at the same time, but just right for style. Very drinkable and just delicious. So far Alesmith is 2-2 and I will definitely be picking some of this up for friends to sample.","zoso1967","Jun 21, 2010"

Can't imagine what the other two I have will taste like after years of cellaring. With initial sip, the booze is not present, but the warming sensation follows soon after.

Aroma hits the nose with deep dark roasted molasses, with chocolate and coffee coming through strong as well. Touch of earthiness and dark fruit (raisin). As it warms, much more deep dark chocolate comes out. Very full-bodied, only a touch of sweetness. Then, a pleasantly bitter coffee comes bursting through.

A decent amount of lacing is left behind. The nose drops off a bit, being dominated by coffee and chocolate, though some dark malts and some kind of wood are also detectable. The tongue finds itself agreeing heartily with the nose, as coffee and bitter dark chocolate spark off the proceedings here. Again, some dark malts and a vague woodiness are also there, but the coffee and chocolate are the real stories here. Not that all of this is necessarily bad, but not very complex at all and, as things progress, somewhat boring. But still pretty tasty nonetheless. Ironically (maybe), it's complicated. The body is rightfully heavy, with a light smattering of carbonation and an extremely smooth feel. Overall, for such a husky little man, the drinkability is relatively high, but he's just not as impressive as others have made out.

A pour generates a 1.5 finger sized head. The stout has a deep roasted malty aroma that has a vinous depth. The alcohol is evident but not overpowering. Some hops add a floral florish without detracting from the malts. The stout has a big bold taste. The first flavors to hit the tongue are heavily roasted, almost burnt malts. The intensely roasted flavors border on a very dry chocolate flavor. As the beer warms in the moith, a distinct, intense alcohol flavor emerges that is astringent. Back to the malts, this beer has a fairly subtle acidity that belies the coffee beans.

Aroma consists of sweet malts, burnt oak, earthy hops, black licorice, roasted almonds and toffee, all of which are in near perfect harmony. Taste is sweet and a little vinegary up front, but a huge hit of hops, more roasted nuts and coffee swoop in quickly, adding an almost intimidating boldness to the overall taste. Behind all of that is a welcomed layer of alcohol heat mixed in with some dark chocolates. A good amount of carbonation keeps the brew from being too heavy going down. Mouth-feel is medium-to full bodied and isn't as creamy as expected. Not for the faint of heart.","stephens101","Sep 04, 2009"

The pour even from the growler produces a delightful 2cm head on the 30cl of thick black liquid. The head is a lovely espresso cream color that lines the glass as consumed. Aroma begins with pure coffee, but as it warms it moves more towards burnt coffee (in a good way) with roasted malts coming through and I still detect very little in the way of alcohol. The taste leads with sweet black coffee with a malt undertone but not too bitter nor too sweet, perfectly balanced. The finish leaves a nice slightly bitter coffee taste on the palate.

It was quite thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a super clean flavor that was strong but nice to sip. Very nice body too. As with other AleSmith beers, the hops are so juicy and delicious, making this a great beer while fresh. But I could also see this improving with age, becoming richer and maltier.

4.37,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours with a thin, super dark brown head, doesn't take long to all but fully disappear. The lacing is thin as well but persistent. The expected impenetrable black color, no variation at the rims nor from any angle. The nose is grapey and sweet at first, soon run down by coffee grinds, bitter dark chocolate and butterscotch, suggestions of nutmeg and cinnamon stick, even as the individual scents fall off the sheer penetrating punch keeps it active in your nostrils. Full-bodied, not quite nimble but never clumsy, just takes some time to change direction. The coffee aspect is obvious, omnipresent and enduring, colors the rest. The grape, plum, cherry and apple fruit shades more black fruit but not always. A shy glance of grapefruit reminds you there's hops in there and the more you sip it, the more you get semi-bitter graininess. Yes, it can be sour and acidic, but that's kind of the point. Plays to its strengths but not a simple stout by any measure.","farrago","May 14, 2009"

A nice two finger, creamed coffee head forms, excellent retention, and surprisingly nice lacing on the glass for the high ABV. Smell has nice chocolate presence but I'm not getting a lot of coffee notes, which is a bit disappointing, but it smells awfully nice, with lots of roastiness, some brown sugar and caramel. Flavor is right on with the nose, loads of chocolate and caramel, very sweet at first, lots of brown sugar encrusted chocolate bars, a touch of vanilla and graham cracker, with a nice hit of darkly roasted coffee beans on the finish. Possibly a bit of dark fruit flavors and raisins show up as it warms. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, creamy and viscous. Nicely textured. Drinkability is on the higher side for an IS, as I can barely notice the alcohol at 12%. Overall this is a pretty great tasting imperial coffee stout, but it's no Peche Mortel in my book.

Bitterness jumps out of the gate first for aroma, along with unsweetened dark chocolate, mocha mousse and cafe o' lait. Coffee and roasted malts are definitely represented in this speed demon. Alcohol is discernable in flavor. Bitter chocolate and espresso flavors dominate. It's like sucking on a handful of greasy, dark roasted espresso beans. Body is oily and dense. Malts seem to favor flavor over viscosity. Definitely has its share of IBUs. Moderate carbonation is probably livelier on the palate than in actuality because of the dactylic touch of alcohol. Finish is warming, bitter and mouth watering. While I served it at about 55 degrees as recommended on the bottle, I liked it better as it got even warmer, say 60-65 degrees.

Huge notes of dark roasted malts, combined with strongly roasted espresso beans, and dark chocolate nibs. The flavor really follows suit with heavily roasted malts being the major flavor with bitter chocolate and some seriously cold pressed espresso beans. Also there are hints of vanilla and just a subtle booziness to it. Nothing over the top but all blended very well together. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Just like licking a 70's velvet of Elvis.

Finishes much less bitter than many imperials. Lingering mocha latte. If there was an imperial milk stout, this could be it. The best of both, the roast, bittering and ABV of the imperial stout combined with the creamy mouthfeel and chocolate of a milk stout. At this point it is close, but I think this might be the best beer I've had nearly ever. I've rated the Bell's double cream stout higher because it's abv allows for more prolonged comsumption. This is the first time such a high expectation was met. That being said, I may be rating a little based on expectations. We'll see after the other 3 I have age a bit.

The smell is almost all roasted malt and mocha, with a bittersweet chocolate backbone. The true beauty of this stout comes out in it's flavor. The coffee is very prominent, with hints of bittersweet chocolate and molasses. The mild hop bitterness shines through on the finish. Speedway Stout is not as full-bodied as I expected it to be, despite it's 12% ABV. It is medium bodied, and very drinkable. It could be dangerous to those who taste this beer and crave more.","WYVYRN527","Oct 31, 2008"

It is capped off by a small mocha colored head that didn't have much staying power. I could smell all of that delicious stout coming out of the bottle into my glass. I get strong scents of dark roasted malt, espresso, coffee, molasses, and dark cherries. I'm amazed that I don't get much alcohol in the nose at 12% ABV. The flavor profile is a nice melding of coffee, caramel, cocoa, espresso, and roasted grain. I am surprised at how non-dominant the coffee flavor is in this beer. I thought it was going to the main focus point in this beer. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and chewy with moderate carbonation. I still don't really detect any alcohol on this behemoth of a beer. I think the drinkability would hold up nicely for another glass, but I wouldn't push it to much with the ABV.","TheodorHerzl","Oct 29, 2008"

Poured cola brown with a dense, quarter inch mocha-colored cap embedded with tiny bubbles. Some strands of watery lacing, but weak legs. Head is replenished with a gentle swirl. Nose is malty sweet, brown sugar, molasses, cocoa and dark fruit (somewhat vinous, but maybe some cherry) with a light boozy quality. Taste follows nose, but then the coffee beans are revealed. Exquisite flavor without tasting charred. Some light hops bittering is also expressed in the mouth. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lightly effervescent.

The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some dark fruit (cherries) and vanilla noticable too. Although the bitter coffee comes out the most in this brew, there's also a good amount of sweetness. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy, rich, slick and velvety smooth. Drinkability is pretty good, the alcohol is well hidden but after finishing a bottle of it you know it's there. This is definitely an excellent brew.

A little oak and rum creep out at the end to try and redeem itself, but I can't sign on to this one.

The bottom line is I went from not in the mood / disappointed to really enjoying this sucker by the time I was facing the last few gulps. I think it's better served a bit colder, rather then warmed then room temp, but is pretty good for a big stout. I'll admit it's not my favorite style, and I much prefer their barleywine and IPA.

Initial flavor is coffee heavy with a hint of chocolate that changes to a balance of previous flavors plus malts and a slight hop bite at the end.

A nice coffe ride in the beginning, not like breakfast stout that just slaps you in the face with a cold dead coffee fish. Just enough. roasted malt is apparent in the flavor next. roasty and toasty goodness. The hop bitternes comes last. The only part of the taste that I am not an immeadiate fan of is a slight metallic taste in between the middle of the swallow and the hop bitterness on the end. Just a bit of a copper twinge, but defenitely not enough to take much away from the amazing flavor of this wonderful stout. A nice alcohol warmth on the finish, in a good way. The mouthfeel is just a touch thinner than I would like, but still very very good. Drinkability is simply divine for a beer coming in at 12%.

4.67,6.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours an opaque deep dark brown color with a thin wispy dark tan head that's gone in flash. Spotty patterns of lacing in it's wake. Not a super impressive pour, but at 12% ABV i guess the bar is lowered. I can't help but compare this to Sexual Chocolate that i recently considered (thanks Joel), but that's a RIS (i don't get it, but I'm a babe in the woods). The smell is right on the bar for a Double Stout. Aggressive rich Ghirardelli-like dark chocolate with a moderately roasted coffee mix, vanilla and a bit of the alcohol. That's complexity and it shouts "standby, this is a rich heavy creamy beer". Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied, oily and conditioned with a tang from the alcohol. IMO, the edge of the alcohol is rounded off nicely by the coffee character. Full flavored, the choco-java taste and slick mouth texture leave the door open for the vanilla notes of the alcohol to walk right in. It permeates with the wonderful 'coating' texture of my favorite Double Stouts. A real easy drinker. My first experience was a draft serving from Naja's Place, on the waterfront at Redondo Beach, CA. The 12% is gently warming but otherwise well integrated. Time out... Surgeon General's warning...this will kick your ass.

Alcohol however, is very noticeable, and detracts from it for me. After opening up for a while, I get the faintest hint of coffee in the aftertaste, but not like I'd expect from something that mentions coffee in the Description 4 times.

Everything you could want out of a stout. ABV starts to show through as it warms. Taste of burnt and roasted malts. Taste is actually a little bit of a drop off from the smell but is still way above average. Finishes with a little bit of an alcohol warming that lets you know this one is a big hitter.

After that initial smell there seems to be sweet espresso mixed in with lucious milk and dark chocolate. Toasted nut seems to tingle in the nose as well. First sip is so creamy and thick, almost like a coffee milkshake. Boozey burn on the tounge and within the mouth, but I could care less. Sweet black coffee flavor mid-way with a sweet caramel aftertaste with some dryness. Powerfull, full-flavored Stout. I can't imagine drinking an entire bottle myself, but I'm sure others have.

Certainly worth a try and not bad, but you must be crazy if you are going to tell me this is one of the top 10 beers in the world.

As the foam makes a hasty exit, it leaves substantial lacing draped around the inside of the snifter. The aroma is of toasted malts, coffee and chocolate. The taste is very rich. Big time roasted coffee character accompanied by a wide range of chocolate notes and a faint hop bitterness.

Probably better to drink in the winter as opposed to the 95 degree day we had in DC today but I just brewed a coffee stout and wanted to see what I was up against. I think I lost big time !!

The taste exhibits that same deep bitterness, particularly on the finish. Dark fruit and bitter chocolate are prevalant along with a nice creaminess in the flavor and mouthfeel. A tiny bit of vanilla sweetness rides along with the other flavors, but it is definitely a subtext. Surprisingly drinkable given the high abv. Very, very good, but not the best RIS.

Outstanding nose, tempting and provoctative. Massive alcohol-infused chocolate bitterness smacks the palate up front with burnt malt and coffee flavors fighting for distinction shortly thereafter. A blackened dark fruit puree, remeniscent of charred currants and plums, emerges somewhere in the middle, right before a nearly acrid coffee flavor washes over and finishes, all with a truly tongue-numbing buzz that lasts for several long minutes. Sweet cherry-chocolate memories in the aftertaste with a demure yet bright espresso kick. Oil-like viscousness on the palate; thicker than all but one other beer I've sampled (Goose Island Bourbon County Stout). Alcohol is certainly present with a noticeable slickness and pepperiness in the mouthfeel, but it is never intrusive, only ever adding to the complexity of this fascinating stout. Coffee flavors become more prominent as the beer warms, lending a fuller, more well-rounded experience. Really wonderful, persistent head retention, with frothy sheets of lacing. This is a perfect beer to share or to sip slowly over the course of two or three hours. I will without fail continue to seek this out again and again, hopefully bringing back several bottles from my upcoming trip to Arizona in March. Thank you, AleSmith for this phenomenal experience.","orfeu","Feb 02, 2007"

4.77,8.7,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"This incredible beer poured an unforgiving, moonless midnight into my glass. The smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt give way to a rich chestnut colored head. The taste matched the smells beautifully as nuances of chocolate, espresso, toffee, and incredibly subtle warming alcohol notes (surprisingly subtle for the 12 percent ABV that this huge stout carries) hit you in stages. The body was medium heavy, not to thick, but still a good representation of the heaviness of an American Double Stout. This beer went great with baked ham, but on it's own is definitely an option...Enjoy","Greenfloyd","Jan 31, 2007"

It was sweet and rich and malty with chocolate flavors coming through more as the beer warmed. There was also a light taste of alcohol.

This review comes from my sampling tonight at the Liars Club after the Anvil ESB left me a little flat. The beer arrived in a 10oz fluted glass with minimal head. It was a rich deep dark chocolaty black. The aromas that hit you are of roasted malt, caramel and French roast coffee. These are what hit you when you drink it too, followed by a warmness fromt he high alcohol content. You definitely taste the alcohol here, but you shoudlin an Imperial stout. This thick creamy treat is one that everyone should try given the opportunity, a fine very well crafted beer.","sleazo","Dec 29, 2006"
4.83,10,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This pours black with thick towering brown colored head that leaves great lacing. Huge roasty nose, along with deep caramel, molasses, coffee, chocolate and dark fruit esters. Initially starts off a touch sweet with mild, almost milk chocolate. This quickly fleshes into full blown stout glory with deep roasted malts, raspberry syrup, figs, molasses, dark chocolate and more than a touch of hops. Coffee is omnipresent and delicious, but really takes off through the finish, intermixing with hops and bittering the massive malt of this beautifully. Mouthfeel is terrific, very full (though less so than i anticipated) yet with lots of very fine bubbled soft carbonation giving a very creamy impression. Drinkability is very very good considering the weight of this beer (no hint of 12% whatsoever). Quite probably the best american double stout i've had yet.","numenor1","Dec 29, 2006"

Twangy like acidic roastiness, chocolate and a little bourbon booziness in the aroma. Taste at room temp is a soft and silky mixture of coffee and chocolate, very nice. There is also some cola flavor in the taste and some acidity in the finish as the roast flavor grows stronger and mixes with a decently dry finish. There is a small peppery bite and alcohol warmth in the finish as well. Body is medium to heavy, not overly syrupy but very rich and smooth feeling. I especially enjoyed the chocolate and roast mix of flavors that worked quite well with the body.","hoppymeal","Dec 22, 2006"

Without a doubt, one of the best five beers I've ever experienced. tons and tons of fanastic coffee beans are involved in making this brew. Lots of chocolate and rich malts balance out the slight hoppiness. Cannot tell it's high ABV.

It pours a ominous black with no light penetration through the body that leaves a dark tan head that is frothy but disappears quickly. The aroma is chocolate, malted milk, light coffee, reminds me of the smell when I use to walk by this chocolate factory in Cambridge, MA. The taste is top-notch starts sweet like melted chocolate, then moves to a vanilla rich coffee bean bitterness, airy and light is the feel on the palate low in carbonation.

On the other hand, it doesn't take much at all to start you buzzing, so it is definitely to be appreciated in moderation.

Tastes as if Hershey just released a new chocolate bar that has been infused with some strong ass coffee. Roast, smoke, char, and tobacco undertones. Medium body. Oily slick, and prickly. Of all the coffee stouts Ive rated over the last few weeks, this is the best. Still not a fan of the coffee.","tjthresh","Dec 02, 2006"

They mix together with a sweet syrupy aftertaste that makes this so palatable. The back of your throat warms and burns with a nice alcohol spice that is mostly imperceivable but is enough to warrant mention. So subtle and delicious, this beer is very very good. It is heavy as hell though, and you have to sip it, otherwise it's not enjoyable. That's the only knock. But when you pay this much for so little (sorry, 750 ml is too little for this fine brew), who cares? Sip and enjoy.","Litterbean","Dec 01, 2006"

It's been poured for about 10 minutes and is still just as big as when it was poured. The smell must be teased out, but the most dominant is alcohol. There is also a bit of burnt malt and hops to it. The taste is wonderful, and probably one of the most balanced beers that I have had ever. Its so well balanced that its almost impossible to discern the different tastes that go into it... all my drinking buddies agree thats its hard to get a handle on the taste.

Medium body and the alcohol lightens it all up a bit with a noce burn form the heat. Nice enough but not sure I would pick this up again.","MuddyFeet","Jul 25, 2006"

Molasses and lots of toffee and coffee but mostly a sweet milk chocolate covered pot leaf that I loved. Starts out with vanilla, toffee and tons of cocoa. The mid-palate was full of chocolate but not the usual chocolate but more of a melted milk chocolate. The finish was amazing and hard to put into words. It was a tobacco laden coffee bean dripping with chocolate and it was very lingering. The coffee beans served there purpose, molding all the flavors together and eliminating a lot of the alcohol flavors. This was a 12% beer and I could barely taste any alcohol and I think it was the coffee beans than eliminated it. This beer was amazing and the past few days I have been sitting in the middle of class and I could swear that I tasted the tobacco laden coffee bean dripping with chocolate finish.

My review is all over the map, I think one of the reasons as this one would most likely benefit with some ageing (it's actually recommended to do so on the bottle). Initial impression after the bottle was opened was that it was a boozy monster with a syupy mouthfeel. I was actually a little nervous and thought, I hope some of our fellow bar patrons can help us finish the bottle if we aren't able to. Well, guess what, we had no problems finiishing the bottle, so let's see what we had. Poured into tulip glasses, it had a nice coal black color with mahogany highlights in the light. I loved the deep rich coffee crema head, but it dissipated and only left me with some small skim coat on the sides. The aroma was initially boozy, but as we became accostomed to it, the coffee came to the fore, and some depth was provided by some stone fruit notes as well. Mouthfeel was initially syrupy, however as we made our way through the bottle, it became rougher, with fine prominent carbonation. Tastewise, there's a ton of coffee, milk chocolate, roasted notes from both. I enjoyed it, and it did become easier to drink as we made our way through the bottle. Actually did not feel intoxicated at the end, but that's where a big meal, and tons of water help out. Would love to try again in six months.","PatandDavid","Mar 09, 2006"

4.45,1.4,4,4,5,4.5,4,"Another one of the beers I recently picked up at Hi-Time Wine in Costa Mesa, and curiously one of several Imperial Stouts with coffee I seem to have run into lately. Out of the green 750 ml. bomber, and into the goblet, the beer came out deep reddish black with a one finger thick light brown head. The body was opaque when held up to the light with some brown highlights at the extreme edge. Aroma was chocolate malt and leafy hops mingling together. The first taste was about as intense as I have ever had in a beer. The acrid roastiness of the malts provided the backbone of the flavor profile, while the green bitterness and acidity of the hop oils provided the muscular heft. Together they had quite a tug of war on my tongue. I believe the hops won out in the end. They claim to have poured in pounds and pounds of coffee beans in the brew, but the other flavors were so strong, the coffee was barely detectable as a distinct taste. There was a lingering note of chocolate in the aftertaste. The body was thick and smooth, providing an excellent feel on the palette, which was spoiled only a little by the peppery spiciness of the alcohol. The strength was well covered by the abundance of the flavor while the beer was in the mouth, but since there are no taste buds in the stomach, the warmth spreading to the extremities from there was dead giveaway. This is a beer best suited for a nightcap duty, although the large bomber size gets in the way of that a bit. I would love to see what some age can bring out, as at this fresh stage the hops dominated everything else. Maybe I can get my hands on some more to set it aside for a while.","rajendra82","Jan 28, 2006"

Let's get down to business. Black, opaque, with a thin head. No light sneaks through. I've been trying to coin a term "pitch brown", for those dark blackish beers that are really brown, but this is a black beer. I didn't know this before I bought it, but apparently there's real coffee beans in this one, and you can sure smell it. Definite chocolate notes as well on top of the rich roasted malts. Ooh boy this is an evil one. Ok... let's see. First of all, I'm a big fan of all beer styles, your uber light, crisp pilsner all the way up to your double extra engine oil drilbbling thick sout and everything in between, as long as they're well made. That being said, I'm pretty sick of the coffee and chocolate stouts, just adding shit to get some extra flavor. Sometimes, it seems artificial. I mean, yes, this is America, and we all love it, but let's not over-simplify things. There's a lot of beers that can impart that roasty coffee or chocolate flavor just with the roasted malts and with out extra ingredients. But this one is alright in my book. It's got enough other complexity and character to balance the beans. An excellent vanilla creamy character to this one. It borders on the more vinous English stout characteristics, with really fruity undertones of rasperries and raisons, combined with the slight kick of alcohol, which is barely detectable, only by the sweet welcoming warmth. I'm urging all you stout fans, and I know there's a lot of you out there, to go buy this beer, and soil yourself, because this is a stout lover's dream. So rich, so dark, so. I'm recognizing it as an amazing brew, very well made, and I'm really enjoying it right now myself. What it lacks, and what I crave, is a bit of balance, as is true for any brew in my book. It does provide that needed bitterness via the burnt malts, but I really am struggling to identify any presence of hops here, and I ain't no hop head. I'm trying though. If I could taste the least bit of spice here, a littel hoppy spice, (just a tad folks!) I'd be jumping for joy. But hey, I know everyone else out there is looking for this to be your ultimate black hole dark stout, and that's what it is. So if you want a well balanced beer, go buy a hop devil or something. Let's not split hairs here. Go git your darkness people. Enjoy it.","twelvsies","Nov 19, 2005"

4.58,4.3,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Speedway is a fast spinning kaleidoscope of flavor. Just the alcohol alone had three distinct flavors moving as the beer warmed. At first, the hot spicy alcohol reminded me of bourbon with hints of vanilla. Next, the alcohol turned astringent reminding me of some vodka and cola. Then the alcohol turned vinous reminding me of port. While java and bittersweet chocolate form this beers core and host of other characteristics come to light and transform. I found Speedway tangy, rich, malty, and smoky all at different times. Clearly, this thinner and less carbonated (for the style) recipe helps Speedways flavor change so much.

Smell was intense to say the least. Deep, dark, chocolate, sweet, overripe cherries, scorched toffee, chocolate-covered peanuts, dark-roast coffee, and a kiss of anise. Sublime. Taste... holy crap, it's as good as I imagined. Hella chocolatey up front, intermixed with the darkest, sweetest, ripest of fruits. Brandy-like at times as a result. Nicely peppery in the middle. Finishes of over-sugared, bitter, dark-roast coffee that hangs in the back of your throat until you're ready for your next sip. Shit, this stuff tastes like morning and night.

Very intense grapefruity hops also come into play in here. Palate is dry altogether. Taste is very hoppy, grapefruity although alcohol shows more and more as it warms, then it becomes more on the vinous side. Medium to full bodied, silky, round mouthfeel. Warming for sure, but definitely not close to my expectations. In fact, in the blind tasting, I never came close to guessing this was the speedway. I expected it to burst in my face with coffee flavors and frankly, this doesn't have so much coffee flavors, it's in fact only in my notes regarding the aroma and I insisted far more on the hazelnut. That being said, after the 10th imperial stout, I was sure the last one (11th) would be the speedway, it passed that anonym. It remains very well done though with all the elements you look for in an impy including a big roasty character, but you've got to be in the mood for alcohol and a very long west-coast hoppy aftertaste.

4.69,6.8,3.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"This beer is very lightly carbonated, it forms a wispy brown head. Deep black in color. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and burnt grain waft from my glass. It is quite thick, this is definitely a sipping brew. Luckily, despite its thickness, this beer is not syrupy, which I don't really like in a beer. Definitely tastes of coffee, with chocolate and alcohol in the finish. Reminds me of a good creamy dark chocolate bar. A definite malty sweetness is here, it is controlled by the roast flavors though. A certain restrained fruitiness is here, the closest analogy would be burnt raisin. This is quite good, and though I was disappointed at first, the carbonation is just about perfect for this heavy beer. The roasted - coffee notes of this beer just linger in your mouth, it is quite wonderful. This is a dark, black beast that is thoroughly enjoyable.","Gueuzedude","Dec 14, 2003"
4.58,4.3,5,4.5,5,4,4,"Those couple of warning shots about Speedway Stouts %ABV are no joke and should not be ignored. At 12.5% this brew can definitely put a dent in your sobriety. That stated, the alcohol content is the only downside to this beers drinkability. If you love beer and coffee, Speedway Stout will hit the spot.","Boilermaker88","Dec 08, 2003"

4.72,7.5,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I think this is the 2002 bottling. Pours jet black with very little head, which is almost brown. That's understandable for a beer with this much alcohol. Roasted coffee beans are definitely in the aroma, as well as massive blackened chocolate and a little caramel along with some faint hoppiness. Faint alcohol presence. Extremely rich and robust flavors, and an absolutely creamy mouthfeel. Massive rush of dark chocolate and coffee, all burnt to a crisp. A little charred caramel and molasses here and there. Leafy and slightly rind-like hops provide the small amount of balance this needs. They come out more in the back and definitely in the finish. No alcohol is detectable after it's in your mouth. Just the way an imperial stout should be. It really doesn't need a head to add anything to the mouthfeel. Very well done, the coffee beans added to this brew are not out of place at all, they add quite a bit to it. A must-try for imperial stout lovers! My second favorite imperial stout.","hyuga","Sep 30, 2003"
4.65,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Acquired via trade. This definitely fits the bill as a Big Beer. Pours almost sludge-like out of the champagne bottle. Thick and black with a miniscule beige head. Next to no lacing. The aroma is all roasted coffee. The body is big and bold and the flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and warming alcohol really pack a whollop. It never becomes too much though. The beer remains smooth throughout. This is one of those beers that you wouldn't know was 12% by the flavor, only by the effect. The finish is dry and slightly bitter. Superb.","Dogbrick","Sep 21, 2003"

4.03,-8.2,5,4.5,4.5,3.5,2.5,"Notes: Between the prohibitive $9-10 cost, stupor inducing 12% ABV and the above noted carbonation troubles, I will probably never buy this again; that said, the 4oz. tap sampler I had out in San Marcos was downright beautiful and one of the tastiest examples of an Imperial stout I have ever had.","Mustard","Aug 28, 2003"
4.58,4.3,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Another first for me...at the Stone 7th Anniversary fiesta. I still would like to try this from a bottle. But from the tap, this monster was Penzoil black. I mean it was like black rubber from the tire of a "speedway" race car. Hahahaha! Hilarious. Anyway, nice-sized brown head. Smell was, as expected, complex. I caught whiffs of sweet malts, sherry, roastiness, plums, raisins, and plenty of the good stuff--yep, alcohol. Taste was much the same as the smell. Velvety smooth, for such a high abv brew and yet another exemplary imperial stout. I like imperial stouts.","alexgash","Aug 25, 2003"
3.64,-17.1,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This brew pours a dark brown head of large quickly disappearing bubbles and an uncarbonated black as night colored body. It has a very strong coffee alcohol aroma and a very strong alcohol flavor. This brew is one that should at least be on everyone's list of beers to try.","TheDM","Jul 26, 2003"
4.44,1.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tasted at 48F. The body is black with a mahogany glint beneath the thin head of dense orange-ish tan cream. The head drops shortly but leaves some interesting lace and maintains a thin surface covering - which is surprising considering its 12%abv! Roasted malts and deeply caramelized sugars appear in the nose alongside a splash of fresh brewed coffee. The body is full, smooth, and exceptionally creamy due to a very fine and moderate carbonation from bottle conditioning. Alcohol and coffee appear upfront before it softens to reveal some sugary caramel and cocoa in the swallow. A solid bitterness rises in its long, dry finish. As it warms, the alcohol falls more into place and richer coffee notes appear - although it still remains a bit overdone strength-wise. An alcohol content more in the range of 9-10% might do wonders for this beer - particularily adding to its drinkability! Still, quite an impressive brew!","NeroFiddled","Jul 24, 2003"

4.22,-3.9,4,4.5,4,5,4,"After lifting the cap off of this green 750ml bottle, vigorous pouring yielded a dense tan frothy head the width of my pinky finger. This deep ebony brew settled nicely into its stylish looking Alesmith pint glass sporting an etched logo on clear glass. The aroma wafting upwards was of an intense roasted malt, heavy with notes of coffee and alcohol. The texture of this stout is incredibly smooth, possibly the smoothest, creamiest stout I've had. The flavor is deep, dark, and delicious. Coffee, bitter chocolate and a warming alcohol sensation leaves the finish only slightly dry with a hint of bitterness. This is one hell of a big stout. Full of flavor and strong, yet remarkably easy to drink. This stout will not dissapoint. Kick back with some soothing sounds and enjoy the ride. I plan on putting one of these away for next winter to see how it improves.","BierReise","Jul 07, 2003"
4.4,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Now here's a stout I can get in to. This reminded me a lot of Expedition, only I think this is even better. Thick, black pour, little head, no retention. Smells and tastes of strong (good) coffee. Has that nice, warming feel from the first sip. Full, oily body, not thin like some of the other renowned imperials. One bottle of this and it's off to bed, but what a drinking experience! This may be the greatest beer I've ever had.","JohnnyDuvel","Jun 29, 2003"

4.55,3.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Eclipse black color. Large tan head. Aroma is coffee and roasted malts. A very full-bodied stout. Thick and rich, nearly chewy. Flavors are mainly of coffee, but there are also lots of chocolate, toffee, roasted malts, vanilla and cherries. Its amazingly complex and the flavors are at the same time very separate and blend well together in an amalgam of flavors. Extremely smooth. Excellent sipping beer. Hides the 12% alcohol very well. A WORLD CLASS stout. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. The 750ml bottle disappeared all too quickly. Thanks to Herbjones for this one.","beerguy101","Jun 13, 2003"

5,13.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Ah, what a site the paradigmatic deep and dark brooding monster of a beer sitting in its chalice, the perfectly sized head lovely in its chocolate brown coat with a creamy rich texture. As the head slowly and painfully dissolves, it leaves a sensuous covering of fine lace to caress the glass. Aromatic is the nose with its aromas of Starbucks coffee, sweet chocolate, roasted grain, and a most exquisite nose it is. Fully malt sweet at the start, the top thick and chewy, the finish perfectly hopped, pleasingly acidic, sweet chocolate dry after taste that is also alcohol bitter as the 12 percent ABV makes its presence felt on your palate and as it warms Tummy in a quite pleasing manner. Personally I class this Stout as World Class", and another "Magnificent Beer" from a World Class Brewery, which much to my delectation will be available here quite soon, hopefully by Christmas as my stash is gone.","Gusler","Dec 11, 2002"

4.87,10.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"It's jet-black with a surprisingly thick tan head compared to most Imperials. Thanks to the general dose of coffee beans, the smell is espresso but also has noticeable chocoloate and roasted malt. The taste is a journey through everything that is good about Imperials: the aformentioned coffee, chocolate, and roasted flavors all mix around nicely with just enough hops to give it some bite and a pronounced but welcome presence of alcohol at 12%. The mouthfeel is nice and chunky; perhaps thee Speedway designation comes from the similarity of the color and viscosity to some well used motor oil. It's simply amazing that two breweries (Stone and Alesmith) that are so close in location can be turning out two of the best Imperials in the world. At ~$15.00 for a 750 ml, it's not cheap but the experience is easily worth the outlay.","mickeymac","Nov 09, 2002"
