4.77,14.9,4.5,4.25,5,4.75,5,"Overall, this is honestly one of the best dark beers we’ve ever had.  At first, you’re a bit surprised at the aroma.  It is, no doubt, dark and brooding, but there isn’t much strength or punch to make you think anything incredible is hiding in the flavoring.  The sip absolutely obliterates this notion.  The level of roast is beyond most anything we can conjure up, leaving the drinker with this fiery, lingering bitterness of said grain.  Mixing in are swirls of smoke, taking things to the next level and beyond.  Through all of this the finish is incredibly smooth.  We certainly agree with the label that they don’t make ‘em much like this anymore.  The oak doesn’t do too much, but it doesn’t really need to.  For whatever reason we’ve sat on this bottle in our cellar for a while now, and only recently found time to give it the proper time it deserves.  We’re so glad we did, and have already put our feelers out for a replacement bottle, or five, to be consumed immediately.","TheBrewo","Feb 10, 2015"

Well, at this beer gets better with age.  Enjoyable now and enjoyable years from now.","Flounder57","Feb 08, 2015"

I let it sit and warm a bit and the aroma sent notes of sweet malts, vanilla and booze. The taste was like a huge barely wine brewed with loads of chocolate malts and notes of vanilla, dark chocolate, a bit of coffee, and booze. You can taste the oak barrel aging and it gives it some nice depth and a really smooth character. The Old Viscosity is a big and bold exceptional beer that is something really special.","brurevu","Nov 13, 2013"

4.02,-3.1,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Bottle from Let's Pour. Smells like roasted grain with a hint of cocoa coffee. Lighter on the palate than expected. A hop bite after some smokey roasted malt, bit of chocolate but more roast than anything else. Very flavorful. Probably best described as a porter. But has enough hop bite for the black ipa category. A good changeup from overly sweet stouts, though a bit more body would have been nice. Especially with a name like viscosity.","BMMillsy","Oct 19, 2013"

4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/7/2012. Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, toffee, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, char, toast, dark bread, light raisin, toffee, and roasted earthiness. Moderate coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, char, toast, dark bread, light raisin, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, chalky, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial stout. All around great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

I'd encourage trying a few Imperial Stouts and a few Scotch Ales/Wee Heavies first, and then going on to this, because it bridges the gap between perfectly.","ISmith87","Sep 27, 2013"

A very average beer, that had such an overwhelming bitter burnt coffee taste, that it basically masked all other flavors in it, including any signs of barrel aging. Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but when I split a bomber 3 ways, and still end up with about 3 ounces being poured out, it's a rather epic fail.","Jimmeekrek","Apr 01, 2013"

The smell was dominated by cocoa powder, with a minor contribution by vanilla, and just a hint of toffee. The taste had coffee, maple syrup, vanilla, and burnt toast in it. The beer was quite astringent and drying in the finish, with lingering, warm, alcohol burn. The oak barrel aging was quite evident in the character of this beer. The fresh beer drank a little hot for my tastes, and would probably be better with some age on it.","rajendra82","Jan 13, 2013"

4.28,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured from undated bomber to pint glass the beer arrives an opaque deep rich black with black edges and appears quite viscous. The head is a nice 2 finger mocha brown that actually lightens as it fades with superb retention and lacing. Looks great. The nose is roast dominated with tones of oak, vanilla, bourbon, and cream. You can smell the smooth character of the beer, if that makes sense. The flavor very much follows suit and is enjoyable. None of the characteristics are overpowering and actually work well together. Roast is most dominant with hints of vanilla, molasses, oak, and a kiss of bourbon. The beer finishes smooth and creamy with a lingering mild roast sweetness. Well carbonated and full bodied. Another great beer from Port. Highly recommended.","hopfacebrew","May 02, 2012"

Notes of cocoa & biscuit to the nose. Incredible smooth sensation in mouth. Bitterness is quickly substituted by toasted malts leaving such a sweet palate rounded by underliying ripe dark fruits. Full body, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish followed by notes of aged brandy. High ABV profile is well balanced in this flavorful beer.","GONZALOYANNA","Apr 29, 2012"
4.48,8,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours black with a three thumbs width thick, foamy mocha head and great lacing. A wonderful aroma of chocolate, vanilla, wood, roasted barley, and a shot of alcohol. Flavor starts off sweet with some chocolate cocoa, and liquorice alongside some oak, the roasted barley comes in strong mid stream, vanilla and some coffee closes things out. The alchohol does show itself, especially as it warms, leaving you feeling nice and warm after each sip. A wonderfully layered flavor. At best, a medium bodied to this. Feels more like a porter than a stout in consistency. Overall, a wonderful beer and worthy of the hype. Kinda feels like a tweener in style, a cross between a porter and stout and I say that in the most positive way. The high abv certainly makes it a sipper but the wonderful flavor followed by the inner warmth that follows makes for a ridiculously pleasant experience.","denver10","Apr 28, 2012"

The beer pours dark brown/black with an inch of a creamy tan head which stays around for a while. There’s also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like chocolate, molasses, roasted and burnt/charred malt, vanilla, and maybe some oak. The smell is actually kinda light, but enough to make out the wonderful character. The brew tastes like bittersweet chocolate, coffee, anise, vanilla, oak, molasses, and some burnt/charred malt. There’s also a nice roasty bitter finish. As it warms, the ABV presents it's self...In a good way.

I can appreciate it being slightly more bitter and easier to take in, and for what it's worth, the value of this beer for the price just kills Older. While I wish there was more of Older, this bomber at half the price of Older would be my way to go 9 times out of 10.","BBP","Jan 11, 2012"

Taste is all of that, but more dark chocolate and bourbon then then rest, that is a positive. Nice amount of body, wish it was larger. Carbonation was perfect and not overly dry, drinks fairly easily for a barrel aged 10% abv stout.

There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like chocolate, molasses, roasted and burnt/charred malt, vanilla, and some oak and coffee. The brew tastes like bittersweet chocolate, coffee, anise, vanilla, oak, molasses, and some burnt/charred malt. There's also a nice roasty bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and coating with good carbonation. I liked this beer a lot. And at $7.99 a bomber, I'd buy this again the next time I see it.

3.78,-8.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"For some reason the name "old viscosity" suggested to me a barleywine or old ale. I would describe this as more of an Imperial American Porter.

According to portbrewing.com the gravity is 1.092 original and 1.014 final. That's a point ratio of over 6.5:1 -- depending on the desired style, most homebrewers would kill for that.

4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"D: I'm not quite sure I would call this one an Imperial Stout. It has a unique flavor to it, hard to describe but it's different than a stout.

Smells of cola, roasted malt, burnt sugar, and (if you really search) some vanilla in the background. Taste is more smokey malt, a little dry, rough oakiness, and burnt coffee. Bone dry. A burnt bitterness lingers for quite awhile, with noticeable alcohol presence. Medium body and relatively high carbonation for a stout, with a definite warming sensation from the alcohol. Overall, I was expecting this to be more of an Older Viscosity Lite, but instead what I got was an average stout. It would've been nice for a little more sweetness, chocolate, vanilla, etc. Maybe they should up the percentage of the blend which is barrel aged.","pmarlowe","Jul 04, 2011"

They also produce Lost Abbey line of beers, so for a big beer like Old Viscosity, which is partially barrel aged, this price tag makes it seem silly to shell out big bucks for Lost Abbey beers. Hail Port Brewing! In closing, I would start to agree that this is not an Imperial Stout. It's something akin to an American Strong Ale, with similarities to a Belgian Strong Dark Ale (sans the yeast) and some similarities to a Stout. Buy often, but respect! It's a strong SOB.","fox227","Jun 08, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, sweet alcohol, cream, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. The thing that stood out most to me on this one was the booziness of it. The followthrough was a little harsh on this one with the alcohol notes. Despite this, the flavors present were quite nice. The aroma was quite weak in intensity though.

Flavor is - um, you sure this is an American Strong Ale and not a porter or stout? I LOVE stouts and porters, and this sure tastes like one! OK - mouth-filling flavor has tones of semi-sweet chocolate, quality coffee, caramel and licorice with a subtle hint of citrus. Texture is fizzy and lively, leaving behind a firm and pleasant tingle.

On the nose I got signs of bitterness to come in the taste that were really nice and non-astringent, perhaps some roasted malt and coffee, and cocoa underneath it all. In the mouth the cocoa kind of disappeared for me and it was mostly roasted malt with just a hint of smoke, all with a surprising medium body, tons of carbonation, and a bit of nice alcoholic heat that carried it all down. A strange brew, kind of all over the map. Will revisit later.","EricCioe","Feb 15, 2011"

Vaguely sweet, but balanced by decent bitterness and assertive alcohol which thins this out just enough to be smooth and dangerous. Slight bit of oak astringency very complimentary.

Bitter coffee flavor balanced with a sweet spice (ginger?), and undertones of bittersweet chocolate. The beer has an increased carbonation, making it sharp in mouth and leading to a crisp aftertaste. The aftertaste is somewhat sour, which is surprising with all the sweet and bitter flavors. The bittersweet chocolate is also present in the aftertaste. Crisp, dry finish.

Taste starts with lots of chocolate but not so much that it's overpowering, now I get what people are talking about when they refer to "chocolate chip cookie" flavors. Lots of roasted malts with some dark fruit notes. One big drawback was the fact that it tasted quite boozey; however, this seemed to go away as it warmed, or maybe I was just getting drunk, probably could have been either, or both.

Very nice drinking dark ale body isn't thick but it's full carbonation is mellow and it chugs along slowly on the palate flavor really stays on the tongue between sips.

This is definitely a case in which the barrel process drastically improves a beer. Beer is medium in body and has a primary bitterness from the roasted malts.

Taste replicates nose, very chocolate and coffee dominated, a wee bit of vanilla, a good slap of bitterness on the backend. Chewy mouthfeel, medium effervescence. At this ABV, beware. IMHO this is more of an Imperial Stout, and on that grounds, this is pretty good. This bottle is a bit over a year old and the alcohol has definitely mellowed out quite a bit, have two bottles stashed from same bottling to taste over the holidays. Recommended for Imperial Stout fans, for those looking for a Arrogant Bastard- like AStA experience, you may be a bit overwhelmed with the chocolate/coffee character.

An almost pitch black pour with a 1.5 finger head that dissipated mildly. The pour wasn't quite black, but a very very dark brown that could fool you for being black, but is not. So it gets me thinking this is a stout again. When I smell it, this beer is roasty and fruity! When I tasted it it had strong fruity esters that come along with alcohol heat, and it also contained a lot of toasty roasted malts too! This is what craft beer is about. Not taking to a certain style, but making your own beer! Mouthfeel is thick, but was carbonated higher than a stout, which the thickness should be compared to. This is definitely a sipper.

When compared to Santa's Little Helper, this is not a stout but a very dark imperial ale. The smell was not that impressive. It was almost scentless. I reallly had to look for a scent. The taste was almost devoid of what black brews taste like. I tried to warm it up bu letting it sit and it did a little help. What I was looking for was a roasty flavor but it was not there. I think the bourbon barrels masked this away. Also there was not a wood texture that most barrel beers have. It was boozy, which was not evident, which was a plus. I just did not enjoy this when compared to other darkies. It was think but not like syrup yet it was a bit carbonated. I felt that it was a good mouthfeel. It was hard to drink.

Alcohol was also present both in flavor and providing a warming sensation. The scotch flavor was more than I would like, although it seems to mellow a bit as it warms.

It's more like a strong American Stout. Heavy in malts, high in alcohol, but the hops are hidden in the background. Plus, this one is a blend of a new Old Viscosity, and one that has been hanging around in bourbon barrels for a while.

Entirely, impenetrably opaque, looks more like dark, dark, dark brown than black, no hue changes around the rims. In the nose you primarily get mixed dark and milk chocolate, coffee ice cream, candied cherry, plum, date, chocolate covered raisin scents, when swirled it releases more bitter pink grapefruit and chicory notes, so thick and alcoholic that these fall back quickly into the mix. Full-bodied, has a creamy and strongly carbonated mouth feel which relieves a good deal of heaviness. The chicory, wood smoke bitterness more obvious here, the grapefruit element less so. There's a drier complexion to the chocolate, coffee bits, hence no real caramel undertones. The plum, raisin, date, cherry, fig fruit shines best towards the finish.

Brewed with two-row, wheat, crystal, chocolate and Carafa III, hopped with Magnum, fermented with WLP001 and their house strain; 80% stainless-aged, 20% bourbon barrel-aged. It pours into the snifter almost inky black, a little thin at the edges, with an inch of cappuccino head that reduces to a tiny collar and leaves little lacing. The aroma starts with vanilla, chocolate and hints of alcohol, with caramel, a late fruitiness, and some slowly-emerging green hops. It smells more like bourbon the more I drink. The flavor is incredibly complex, with chocolate and dark/charred malts, caramel, peppery/spicy alcohol, vanilla and black cherry. There is an astringency, a light sourness and a definite bourbon note. Very nice. It is thick on the palate, with a light tingle, coating dark malts, a tannin-like dryness, and warming alcohol. Silky-smooth by the end, with a long bourbon/hop finish. A delicious barrel-aged ale that comes across very much like an imperial stout with an old ale kicker.

The taste is deceiving but definitely not disappointing. First mouthful tastes of vanilla, brown sugar, cappuccino. Mellows out to a heart-warming cask-esque, sweet, deliciously thick ale that's reminiscent of most imperials.

On top of this is the hint of oak and booze in the background that burns the nose ever so slightly. Taste is a slightly harsher version of the aroma with a big roasted character on top of the malt background and dark fruit flavors. Coffee and chocolate are present as well.

Head eventually subsided into a broken swirl of foam; some lacing present during the tasting, but poor adherence. Scents of coffee, dark fruit, vanilla and some boozy bourbon notes. Taste follows nose on this one with the bourbon flavor masked in the mouth, and a bit of cocoa that shows through as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light effervescence, not at all thick or viscous. Some alcohol warmth makes an appearance without being boozy.

Some light hops in the background. Taste is like a strong sweet stout; coffee, but it has the spirt/hop and alcohol profile of an American strong ale. Intresting Combination.

It looked quite thick off the pour too. Caramel aroma with roasty, dark malts and a bit of fruit. Fairly mellow with a bit of chocolate too. Mild alcohol, slightly vinous. Great flavour. Sweetness up front balanced by roasted grains and moderate bitterness. Notes of chocolate and licorice filled out the middle, along with mild fruit (cherry and raisin). Alcohol became more prominent towards the end, with a peppery finish. Lingering roast and toffee. Lots of chocolate as it warmed. Full bodied, low carbonation, silky/malty texture with plenty of warmth. This is great stuff. Superb balance for such strong character. You definitely need to let this one warm up to at least cellar temperature before the flavour really pops. Too cold and it loses its punch.","DrJay","Feb 02, 2008"

No light penetrates this beast of a beer, and there is a small cap of illy espresso foam on the top of this brew that stays for the duration of the tipple. Aromas are dark, burnt, roasted malts, chocolate, heavy duty coffee, and more roasted malts. Hops are green and piney but only faintly in the background here as this is a malt bomb. Taste i heavy with roasted malts, some caramel, chocolate, and more coffee. This is pretty straight up but the balance is so rock solid and that is what really elevates this one to the next level.

Enters the mouth just as darkness should, long rich and full of flavors such as burnt malt nuttiness, toasted biscuits and subtle dry sweetness. A big dark beer with wonderful complexity.

Mouthfeel is pretty nice, although not as full as the pour led me to believe it would be. Flavor is also not really what I thought it'd be. It was more of a porter or chocolate stout than a Strong Ale, in my opinion. There wasn't really that much bourbon flavor to it.

4.37,5.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Take me to school yet another time this week. I understand that American Strong Ale enjoys a wide interpretation, but this one does remind one of a Double Stout or a RIS. Pours an opaque darkness with a shallow dark tan head that fades fairly quickly and leaves a nice striated lacing pattern. The smell is full, rich and thick and chocolaty. Lightly toasted with a nice whiff of vanilla from the barrel treatment. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel of this sipper is full bodied, silky smooth with a light tang from the warming 10% ABV. The texture coats the tongue lightly, as you might expect from name, but it isn't as pronounced as some Double Stouts. Full flavored, the taste is great. A nice lightly toasted malt, chocolate and cherry vanilla that lingers appropriately. A really nice drinker. Highly recommended.","jjayjaye","Dec 18, 2007"

Very malt driven, which is a nice change in an american big beer. The bottle can't be more than a year and a half old, but it tastes like a 3-4 year old barleywine at least.

The taste is very bitter up front with lots of piney hops, gentian, and bitter orange. These bitter flavors are followed by long creamy dry malt and whiskey notes.

Bitter, long lived aftertaste that picks up a licorice/anise flavor. As it warmed up, I could pick up flavors ranging from tobacco to burnt malts. This is pretty complex, but a little on the bitter and burnt side for my taste. The mouthfeel is good. Full bodied with oily to syruppy feel and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is decent but not great. I would put it in the stout/imperial stout category. I would prefer something less burnt. Paired with a sweet dessert, the edge is taken off a little.

Sharp burnt coffee bitterneess that continues in the aftertaste and well into the finish. Leafy hop notes skip in and out. Thick and full bodied with an almost impy stout like feel to it. Extremely smooth ont the palate---it's almost creamy, but just not to that point. High bozzyness is more apparent as it warms, but doesn't deter from it's flavor or aroma.

It poured a dark dark complexion (although not black enough so that no light made it through), with a white head that had nice retention all around. In th smell was a bit of must, cocoa, chocolate cake, blackberries, and a mild earthy grain. In the taste was lots of smoke and coffee, some dark chocolate. Carbonation was pretty high, serving to heighten the smoky character. Pretty big on the palate as well...not quite syrupy, but still a big beer. Alcohol was also well hidden, but with the extreme flavors going on in this brew, I suppose it would be. I felt that one bomber of it was more than enough for me.

Aroma is rich and sugary, a nice rich pruney bw-old ale aroma. Alcohol is evident in the aroma as well, also a hint of smokiness and some coconut sweetness. Taste is at first rich sweet malts, a nice pruniness typical of a bw. This slowly fades to a good size hop presence of bitter and big dryness. A little roastiness and chocolate in the taste as well, a warming alcohol in the finish. Very good beer with some interesting characteristics, I like the murkiness of it and while there are the rich bw-old ale qualities, there is also a decent amount of stout like qualities, esp in the taste.

Flavor a hybridization of sweet currant malts, heavy cold sweet cream, with a big estery pear, almond and toasted date and walnut bread, with edges of molasses and melted raw sugar. Starts with the dark intro of an imperial stout, but with a full of dark bourbon notes, before hitting balance with an edge of dryness, then falling into a mellow refined fruit of barleywine type character. Nice oaky char, crispy barbeque crust and fading edges of light hop cones bring balance. Expressive all around. Really amazingly delicious with a rich deep sugar content in the malt.

4.69,13,4,5,5,4.5,4,"As deep and thick a black as I've ever seen on any Imperial Stout with a thin, dense burnt orange head. Big aromas of black and roasted malts, with coffee, molassess, and prune notes. Some alcohol vapors are present, too. Damn, I just can't stop sniffing this one! The nose is truly amazing in its complexity. Okay, finally, a taste: dark fruits of unending variety (black cherry, dried Black Mission figs, raisins, and many more), scorched coffee, composted earth, and a gigantic -- and I mean big -- alcohol flavor. The booziness is kind of jarring at first, but with each sip it becomes more and more integrated to the entire flavor profile, without, however, getting lost in the shuffle. Spruce essence in the burps. Chewy barley malt and piney coffee-ground sandwich. Dense, slick, and utterly full in the mouth. Increasingly milder but ever-present alcohol burn. One of the most amazing things about this beer is the way this alcohol characteristic is always obvious but never harsh or distracting. It's actually pretty mind-boggling. A very difficult beer to pigeonhole: in my estimation, it's by almost all observations an enormous Russian Imperial Stout, but the ostentatious alcohol presence takes it a step or eight beyond that more or less traditional style. It's also a little bit chewier and less vinous than most big stouts... Ridiculously fascinating, all told. It's so huge, I can't say I'd crave one of these more than once a month, but its sheer complexity, originality, and straight-up tastiness makes me wish I had much easier access to this than I do. This one's staying on the "Want" list. Thanks again for the opportunity, Ken!","orfeu","Nov 15, 2006"
4.65,12,4.5,4.5,5,5,4,"This beer is so amazingly complex that it's hard to explain. Drinkability is lower because it is what it says - extremely viscous! Really heavy - should be saved for colder weather.","clickpush","Nov 13, 2006"
4.48,8,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"One of the best beers I've had this year. My first Pizza Port, or whatever this is is not disappointing at all. Awesome!!!!","FLAbeergutinMASS","Nov 09, 2006"
4.37,5.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Very complex and unusual beer. Worth trying, and worth buying more than one to be able to try at a second sitting to re-evaluate all the taste hitting the palate. My second sitting (a month later) found this beer to be simply excellent, and I am ordering more.","dogfooddog","Nov 07, 2006"
3.73,-10.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, quite a ride. I would happily drink again, but I think there are better barleywines/strong ales out there such as Old Ruffian and Arrogant Bastard.","","Nov 06, 2006"
4.6,10.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"The body is very thick, as one would imagine from the name of this brew. Coats the mouth with residual sugars. This is quite a treat. I hope to age the other bottle untill next winter ('07).","neonbrown82","Nov 05, 2006"

4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Quite viscous on the mouth and chewy. While there was no head, the carbonation was present and overall warmth is the feeling i get. You'll want to be sipping this one in front of a fire place during hurricane big fuck... it's not for the everyday quaff. I'm going to cellar a few bottles of this. Hell, maybe i wont. It's too good.","SwillinBrew","Oct 24, 2006"
4.15,0,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a pretty fine brew- I'll have to post an update as I think this will greatly benefit from some age.","fartingdog","Oct 23, 2006"
4.35,4.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,3.5,"Simply fantastic no matter which style this will get pigeonholed into...","IceAce","Oct 21, 2006"
3.9,-6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"AL-co-hol! Damn this smelled powerful of sweet booze but not much else on the pour. Good looking like an imperial stout should look. Damn this is serious stuff. Big alcohol with rum cake, chocolate and molasses on the aftertaste. This is one that will spark much debate about the style and whether to drink now or later. I would wait another six months before I drink it again. Serious big boy beer here.","lou91","Oct 20, 2006"
4.61,11.1,3.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"D: This is one of the most aggresive dark beers on the market. Thick, bitter, sweet, rich...this is the real deal. Pulled off with out being cloying as well. The only thing that could have made this beer better would be a head like on the Speedway or Rasputin. Great beer none the less.","Westsidethreat","Oct 12, 2006"
3.95,-4.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D- Way prefered the 2nd batch I got to have a taster of. I think it made it a bit more complex and gave it almost a new feel to it.","BlindPig","Oct 09, 2006"
4.1,-1.2,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Initially this brew comes across as an American Double Stout. I can see how this could be classified in lots of different category but my take is double stout.","DogFood11","Oct 08, 2006"

4.27,2.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability was very good, dangerously so. At 10%, it is easy to let this beer get the best of you. Highly recommended","bradford","Sep 26, 2006"
4.43,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Drinkability  Are you kidding me? This is one of the best ASAs on the market and certainly one of the most drinkable big beers that Ive ever had.","RoyalT","Sep 15, 2006"
4.44,7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: Lots of potential to be a Classic..but what style is it??..I love the dilemma created by not listing one on the label, interesting to see how the style geeks struggle with that..Russian Imperial Stout, American Double Stout, American Barleywine or an American Strong Dark Ale..well thinking for myself Ill settle with a..aaarghh who cares what I think, just get some!!!","TheLongBeachBum","Sep 13, 2006"
4.7,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Very dark beer upon pouring. 2-3cm light brown head. Smells delicious; carmels abound. Tastes fantastic, more carmel. Barely any trace of alcohol in the taste, I would not have guessed it a 10% beer unless I had seen it on the bottles they sell. Since I am new to reviewing (as well as beeradvocacy), I don't know what else to say. I do know that I typically enjoy darker beers, and I absolutely adore this beer. It is listed as a "RIS" on BA, but on the bottle I have, it just says "ale." But either way it's really a great beer. If you are ever in a Port Brewing location, i highly recommend at least getting a taster. Fabulous fabulous beer.","AWolfAtTheDoor","Aug 26, 2006"
4.85,16.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Big body with big ABV and a smoother than silk mouthfeel, I can't recommend this one enough...Cheers!","scottoale","Aug 10, 2006"
3.97,-4.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is of a really dark stout like barleywine with some of the roasted figgy flavors of an imperial stout, but softer on the roast and with more of the caramel hop approach of an American barleywine.","drewbage","Aug 11, 2004"
