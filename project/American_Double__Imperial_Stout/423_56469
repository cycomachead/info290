Aromas of dark malt, delicious dark fruits (raisins, figs) and spicy yeast. Definitely opens up as the glass warms. Unique flavors (like all Boulevard I have tried), and wasn't expecting the Belgian influence. Had to do a double take at the bottle label. Roasty goodness, bitter chocolate notes, and a nice hint of smokiness. More chocolate/smokiness on the end of the taste. Dark fruits and spicy yeast emerged as the experience continued. Chewy mouthfeel, but not overly so. Definitely hearty. Nice lingering, with hints of the last sip carrying over to the next. Smokestack series is amazing.","Mikus","Mar 28, 2015"

3.78,-5,4,4,3.5,4.25,3.75,"Overall, the nose, once settled into the glass, came freakishly close to that of Chimay Red, but with a touch more sweetness.  Not surprisingly, the taste followed suit, but again, with a much richer and smokier finish.  We think the real “dark truth” here is that this is a starkly Belgian beer masquerading as an American imperial stout.  The yeast is just so characteristic of your hearty Belgian dubbels or strong dark ales.  Those fruity components are so pervasive that they even act to lighten up the malts rather significantly, despite all the soy sauce and smoke they can throw at it.  All of this makes for a surprising beer when you’re expecting something stouty.  They do, however, do a great job of describing the beer on the label, so you aren’t broadsided.  This review marks our last one completed in Missouri for this trip.  It’ll be a few weeks until we’re back in the state, and we’ll continue to look forward to trying many more unconventional beers such as this one.","TheBrewo","Nov 03, 2014"

I don't find it very deep either, though as stated on the label it does finish with a slight smokey feel and flavor. To me, it hits me with so much VERY sweet raisin/black currant that I can't enjoy this. It's very sugary and rich and I feel like if I dropped a bit on my computer desk it'd be sticky within 20 minutes. Something about this beer is very viscous.

Couldn't ask for a nicer looking beer. The smell is also very good with a lovely smell of roasted malts. This beer is very complex on the flavor for me it tastes similar to chocolate malts but they aren't listed in the description. I do pick the slight sweetness up with nice toasty malt finish. Leaves kind of a sweet dark after taste on the palate. Not to heavy but super complex on the flavor and a really neat bottle to boot. :) For sure will buy this one again!","MIchelle","May 21, 2014"

Spot on mouthfeel for an aged imperial stout. Overall, it’s worth picking up a single for your mix six. Though where it’s at now I’d say drink this one fresh over aged.

Mostly a roasted, coffee malt aroma although the chocolate is pretty noticeable and hints of dark fruits (mostly figs). Taste is the same as a good balance between chocolate and roasted, coffee-esque malts come into play and there are some figs/toffee tastes that come through as well (other dark fruits that people notice like raisins/plums/black cherries I am not getting). Can't say anything spectacular about this beer but it's slightly sticky, smooth, fuller bodied and just really hit the spot for me and had a nice little sweetness in the aftertaste.","clayrock81","Dec 07, 2013"

4,0.5,4.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Overall (4.0): This is an interesting stout, that’s for sure. It’s quite good, but a bit of an oddball, what with the roasted malt character colliding with the estery Belgian yeast and subtle, spicy hops character. But, as mentioned above, it’s all blended surprisingly well. In the end, its strength lies in the subtlety of its layered character: it’s easy to miss some of what’s going on here if you don’t pay attention, because at first it just seems like an oddly fruity imperial stout, but eventually it all melds quite well.

4.02,1,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Pours jet black with a creamy one finger beige head that left a broken sheet of lace as it settled very slowly.Aromas are a mix of plum and raisin along with chocolate and some nuttiness.Flavors are roasted with alot of fruity tones,the raisin flavors are really magnified with a hint of char in the finish,the alcohol comes into play more as it warms.This is one of the fruitier impy stouts I have come across,it's not a big roasted dry earthy bomb,a nice change of pace for an American version of the style in my opinion.","oberon","Jun 05, 2013"

4.16,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"A very unique take on a classic style. The Belgian yeast that is used in conjunction with the dark, roast malts, really kicks out a lot of sweet, juicy plum and fig characteristics, but the roasted malts really help balanced everything out. Really interesting stuff, but I am left wishing that there was a bit more of that classic stout roasted character in the back end of the beer. I'd definitely recommend this for some one who digs both stouts and Trappist style Belgian beers.","flayedandskinned","May 19, 2013"

Obligatory pitch black liquid, opaque yet near the surface you can just make out a strong presence of bubble beads, little to no hue change to orange or yellow. Powerful nose of bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee, caramel, flowers, licorice and plum to cherry fruit, there’s cereal grains and oats in there plus some pine sap and more leafy herbaceousness, has a good deal of discernible hops for the category and in no way overly sweet. Full-bodied, while generally creamy in texture it is on the dry side and can stiffen up on you. Again lots of chocolate, here the licorice to anise almost outmatches the coffee, molasses, caramel, certainly plays into enlivening the flowers and white citrus. Fewer grains but more pine and garden herb notes. At times smoky, does a great job of shifting on you so you can’t really peg it down. Takes awhile for you to more consistently register the plum, date, golden raisin, cherry fruit. Long lasting without being pushy, you taste it some time after you have swallowed. An achievement of complexity without excessive makeup.","farrago","Apr 14, 2013"

Head retention is alright, an a respectable amount of lacing is left clinging to the glass. The nose is on the subtle side, but there are some solid aromas of chocolate and plums present. The flavor is starts off very nicely, calling back to what was present in the aroma. The front half of each sip tastes like plums and raisins covered in dark chocolate. A bit of roasty smoke comes in on the back end. It provides a nice contrast with what came before it, but the almost ashy quality cuts off the chocolate and esters a bit too early for my taste. Were there a style for Belgian stouts, his beer would probably be a textbook example. As is though, the mouthfeel has a bit too much of a Belgian lean t it. The body is a little too dried out and the carbonation a little too bubbly for a near 10% imperial stout. I really enjoyed Boulevard's Dark Truth, one of the finer examples I've had of trying to fuse together a stout and a Belgian ale.","axeman9182","Sep 12, 2012"

Initial flavor is of dark roasted coffee and then the Belgian yeast kicks in with some sweet fig and plum and a bit of funk. Finishes with a dark chocolate and smoky roasted malt finish. Body is full and silky smooth. Sweet finish with a bit of bitterness and alcohol burn. I really like the addition of the fruit to the stout. It adds another dimension and blends perfectly. Another excellent beer from the Smokestack series....which is one of the best series of beers in the US.","Kromes","Aug 23, 2012"

I think it still fits just fine in this broad style, but maybe doesn't need to be cellared as much as I did.","ebrauser","Aug 21, 2012"

Light roasty malts and moderate dark fruits and malt. Dark fruit and malt middle with a mild hop finish. An unusual stout transition with more fruit than malt. Moderate body.

3.88,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Thanks Bruce! Pours black with a small, light-brown head that takes some time to go down. Scent has some smoke to it with a bit of burnt malt and lots of milk chocolate. Chocolate helps balance the bunt malt...making it not overly bittering. Subtle vanilla with a hoppy finish. Taste is almost like it smells, but a bit hoppier and more bitter than expected. Not a citrusy bitter though (like the imperial stout from Victory), which is very off-putting for me. This one works well with the hoppy bitterness. A lot more dark fruit flavors than the nose implied. Drinkability is high. Mouthfeel is dry for an imperial stout. Overall, this is definitely different for the style, but it's great!","DovaliHops","Jul 21, 2012"

The head retention is ridiculous...looks very tasty. Aromas of oak and char, with a subtle smokiness. Smells rich. Flavors are chocolate and apple sweet, with an oaky and earthy presence that keeps it balanced and avoids the cloying feels. Dark, roasted coffee is consistent throughout the palate. Rich, slick feel in the mouth with a slight smoke and nut aftertaste. The finish is crisp and bitter, with some of the coffee characteristics imparted for a while on the palate.","GarthDanielson","Jul 18, 2012"

Taste started off a burnt bitter, and changed to a slightly sticky sweet, akin to a thick barleywine. Felt dead on. Coated very well with just a touch of carbonation.

While I think a thicker mouthfeel would improve the beer, I have to say I'm impressed at how smoothly this drinks at 9.7% and with this much flavor. Every now and then, a beer reminds of how powerful simplicity can be, when the trappings of bourbon barrel this and brett-fermented that are shunned for just doing it the old-fashioned way.

It’s like this beer has two personalities…The first is at the pour, when you first bring it out of the cellar or fridge or whatever. The second emerges as the beer warms and the head cools off. Let this guy warm up before you serve or consume it, and it is much better than if it is too cold. When, and not if, I drink another bottle, I’m gonna let the head settle completely out before I even touch it. With a close to 10% ABV, you knock back a gang of these and end up in jail in no time. Excellent beer, kudos to Boulevard.","TheCondor","Feb 24, 2012"

Some very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, burnt malts, and licorice. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, burnt malt, coffee, caramel, smoke and some spiciness on the finish.

Lots of dark fruit, caramel, and chocolate mixed with a quad like fruity and yeasty Belgian character. Medium to thick body, moderate level of carbonation, sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel.

4.08,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall - This is another outstanding example of what separates the Smokestack series from Boulevard’s other staple sessions and seasonals. Boulevard Dry Stout, for instance, is a fine stout - an equally fine stout to get in a six pack. Dark Truth, however, is like an upgrade worth spending time with. It’s characteristically dry, full, sharp. But the sweetness isn’t just a hint of sugar or cream, it’s an entire separate profile of ripe fruit, chocolate, and yeast. Dark Truth is a one-and-done sort of beer, a complex imperial to sip on.","paperbackfoster","Nov 03, 2011"
4.03,1.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall it's a solid beer. Although I've strayed from bigger stouts in recent years, I am finding myself enjoying this beer quite a bit. The appearance is almost ideal to me. The flavor profile is basically what you would come to expect in a beer of this type, but it is just becoming common place. I love that for almost 10% ABV it's not boozey.

Belgian yeast provides a plum-like fruitiness, noble German hops reveal spicy, herbal notes, while the rich, velvety mouthfeel mellows to a dry, smoky finish.

3.98,0,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"12oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Best by 7/27/13 printed on the bottle neck. Pours the color of cola with a dense, two inch, khaki-colored head. Copious tiny bubbles adhere to the bowl of the glass as the head sizzle and pops and gradually recedes into a frothy cap. Thin swaths of lacing and cascading droplets adhere to the sides of the bowl during the tasting. Nose expresses dark malts, brown sugar, a trace of vanilla, a suggestion of oxidation and a slightly sour vinous/dark fruit character. Taste expresses coffee, ashy char, a slight metallic quality, burnt sugar and a suggestion of acidity towards the back - all of this on a roasty, dark malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium), with a carbonation that is just a bit too assertive for the style (actually a bit prickly) with some residual burn at the back of the throat. Overall, it's a pretty solid IS. I think it could use some time to perhaps diminish the carbonation and even out the body, but I think this beer has very good potential. It's very malty, without being a malt bomb, and it has a slightly different flavor profile (less sweet and more earthy/roasty) than many examples of the style. Definitely worth a try, but I would suggest giving it a year or two of cellaring to allow it to grow into its potential.","Jwale73","Oct 10, 2011"

Also the flavors follow the nose with dark fruits, smoke, coffee, molasses and bitter chocolate. The booze is hardly noticeable (thumbs up). The aftertaste tastes like eating a piece of chicken covered with char. But interestingly, not in a bad way as one might think. At first the mouthfeel is incredible - creamy and thick with just enough carbonation to keep the beer going; however, it turns a bit syrupy near the end. Overall, all I can say is it works.

I could sip on this all night. Wonderfully made beer. Definitely recommend this for stout lovers. One of the better beers I've tried in a while.","travis224","Sep 18, 2011"
3.23,-18.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Sometimes you pick up a bottle in the store and the shape fits in your hand so nicely, you can't put it down. Before you know it, the bottle is in your car and headed to your house and THEN, a few hours later, it's open and its contents are in a glass. Dark Truth comes in such a bottle, but the anticipation I felt while cooling down (but not too much) the beer was somewhat deflated once I actually removed the cap. The overwhelming flavor here is... sugar. Way, way, waaay too much sugar. It hides the smoke; it clobbers the hops; it makes the teeth ache as if you've eaten too much fudge. Reduce the sugar in this beer and you'd have a decent, smokey stout. Otherwise, it's just a boozy, sugary beer. Not bad, but bring your toothbrush.","gfreed","Sep 16, 2011"

4.87,22.4,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Now for the best part. The taste is astounding. Better than I expected from the smell, even. As anyone who’s read most of my ratings knows, I’m not a fan of hops. I think that in many beers, they’re overused. Now, the hops in this beer hit first. They play a noticeable role and they are definitely astringent, however they are present in jus the right amount. It is the perfect mix of hops, malt, and sweetness. It provides some astringency that allows the beer to be thick and dark without becoming cloyingly sweet. These are hops used right. As for the rest of it, it’s thick, malty and sweet just like a stout should be. It’s a bit thicker, stickier and sweeter than many stouts, almost like a cream stout, but it’s also pretty high in alcohol for a stout, so that’s not surprising. Man, what a great beer. I always thought that a stout high in alcohol would be a good idea. I was right. This stuff is absolutely delicious. Plus, I can’t even taste the high alcohol content. I almost find that disappointing, but this brew tastes so good, I can’t complain. Good job, Boulevard.

Fabulous flavor is rather sweet but not cloying, like mocha made from excellent coffee and fine chocolate. A woody overtone provides a little hoppy bitterness to offset the sweet flavor, and hints of caramel, molasses and licorice round out the lip-smacking flavor.

Smooth, creamy and full bodied it started to grow on me as the session wore on. Bitter, dark German chocolate, coffee, hints of something else, fruit, maybe but probably not.

I mean, this is a tough style to make anything that really stands out, and this one really doesn't blend on my palate like I feel that it should. I guess that has to do with the roast being a bit high compared to the alcohol, so the residual mouthfeel is where it is lacking IMO. If you really love Imperial Stouts, by all means give this a shot as it may be YOUR beer. There are no fermentation flaws or anything, but the blend just isn't my cup of tea.","SkeeterHawk","Apr 14, 2011"

Surprisingly, a strong bitter hop smell was present, not surprising that it was there, just surprised about how strong it was. Taste was good, roastiness, sweet malts, a touch of dark fruit and that hop bitterness found in the nose. This is a mid to heavy mouthfeel but was thinner than expected, a little let down. Decent drinkability. I was a little let down on this one as I love most of the other smokestacks as it was just okay.","OakedCanuck","Dec 06, 2010"

The malt bill is interesting: barley, wheat, rye, and oat. While the wheat isn't as apparent to me, but the mouthfeel from the oats and the spiciness from the rye is apaprent, and welcome additions. While not necessarily the beer I would reach for, I like this a lot, more than many of the Belgian RIS's that this most resembles.","yeahnatenelson","Nov 21, 2010"

Smells kind of sour but with lots of coffee and chocolate like you'de expect in a big stout like this. Don't know if I necessarily care for the smell. The first sip is all dark chocolate (think bakers chocolate) with a bit of dark, dark coffee. Once the palate gets used to it a bit (and it warms a bit) more some of the sour notes poke through but in a good way, but still with a late light finish of dark chocolate. I don't know if it's the marketing but I can almost taste a dubble or quad trying to fight it's way out of the dense chocolate and coffee notes. Some might not like the slightly sour note but this is very interesting and very tasty. I don't taste a bit of alcohol but I can feel it. The mouthfeel is nice, not too light.

The nose comprises maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, toasted oats, chocolate powder, and what seems like a bit of figs. The taste follows pretty closely, with some late additions to the squad: bitter dark chocolate, burnt biscuits, coffee, rye spice, plums, and a dash of floral hops. The body is a very light heavy, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat dry feel and finish. Overall, this stout is all over the dark-beer map, but still manages to maintain its composure, allowing for an enjoyable drinking experience.","TMoney2591","Aug 23, 2010"

Nice dark fruit smell with a hint of roastiness that borders on ash. The dark fruit and roasted malts really come out in the taste, bit of marshmellow as well but it has a rather average mouthfeel and the ash flavor i detected in the smell just lingers a bit too much.

Pours a very deep, dense black color, with a nice cocoa colored head. Aromas of espresso beans, cocoa powder and Skor bars. On the palate, I get rich, chocolate fudge, more freshly ground espresso, tobacco and dark brown sugar. Alcohol here is well-hidden, especially compared to some of the alcohol bomb imperial stouts being released these days. Another good one from the smokestack series.","emmasdad","Jun 03, 2010"

Nevertheless, it was enjoyable in the whole and I'm glad that I got the chance to give it a try but I doubt I will seek it out again. This really isn't my favorite style of beer but hell I'll never turn a beer down especially ones that I will never have a chance to try again.

Burnt caramel and a little smoke are present, there's also a distinct spiciness - is there rye in there? Finishing a touch sweet with a distinct bitterness, this beer is medium-full in body and has a delicious, creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is a touch high as well, but the palate is excellent.

Roasted malt is what I mainly get from the taste, along with some bitter dark chocolate, and a slight metallic twang. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy. It certainly does not feel like a big beer when considering its strength. Drinkability is about average for me....not hating it, but not loving it either.

This one could be sharpened up a little and could become a Belgian-ified version of their RIS, which was absolutely phenomenal.

4.08,2.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall, another solid beer from the smokestack series. A lot of good flavors blend together well to produce a quality beer. I am glad that this one is available in the area. I recommend it.","mothman","Apr 18, 2010"

I liked the first imperial stout better, though I wasn't totally crazy about it either.","JEdmund","Apr 18, 2010"
3.91,-1.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: Not a hoppy stout but close to some of those offerings. Lacks the think and creamy sense of others but offers a nice flavor and feel balance. A good, unfortunately not excellent, but very likable offering from the Smokestack series.","Daniellobo","Apr 14, 2010"
3.98,0,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Flavors of charred black malts, robust dark roast coffee, trace bitterness of bakers chocolate. Some green hops in there buried under the roast. Chocolate note becomes more noticeable as it warms. Medium bodied, a trace of alcohol, sort of astringent. I'll do my best to finish the 750, but it's probably best shared, and served on the warmer side of cool.","emerge077","Apr 11, 2010"

4.04,1.5,5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"It's not my absolute favorite of the Smokestack releases, but it's not my least favorite either. All of the Smokestacks are great though. For my palate, Boulevard is finally making some truly great beers. Please keep it up!","coldmeat23","Apr 05, 2010"
4.06,2,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Very creamy with more carbonation than I was expecting - very smooth going down. Really, really enjoyed this beer - makes me sad that the weather is getting warmer and the heavier beers will be nothing but great memories....","maltlikker","Apr 02, 2010"
3.49,-12.3,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a dark brown beer that has a big, thick rolling head off a slow pour. Retention is excellent. After it slowly breaks apart a thick web of sticky lace is left. Smells oddly tangy at first with an undercurrent of malts. A little shake opens things up a bit and some dark chocolates reveal themselves. Otherwise not a lot going on at the nose. Tastes sweet and malty up front and soon followed by a quick hop bite and some alcohol heat. There's also a bit of a sweet candy middle with a very faint woodiness. Goes down mostly creamy with a lingering alcohol heat in the back of the throat. Kind of a nondescript outing for Boulevard here, but you can't knock a home run every time at bat.","stephens101","Apr 02, 2010"

4.28,7.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours dark brown to black with a large tan head. The aroma is coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and dark fruit.

Roasted barley/black patent in the aroma with some dark fruit and some hops. Big, full bodied and smooth. Roasty with lots of malt. More fruit. Complex maltiness. Long lingering finish of roasted/chocolate malt. Another winner in the Smokestack series.","homebrewhawk","Mar 15, 2010"

3.98,0,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"A solid DIS that reminds me a little of their limited edition version - lots of the same attributes. The major knock I have against it, and also against the previous stout, is its abundance of carbonation - I'd like to see it dialed back a little.","katan","Mar 11, 2010"

4.11,3.3,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a New Belgium chalice black with a very thick tan head. Great retention and lacing. The scent has strong oak notes and alcohol.

4.5,13.1,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: Because of the abv, not very drinkable. but what imperial stout is? I may just have to buy all of the smokestack series beers and try to age them for a year to see what happens.","ikenney87","Mar 09, 2010"
4.38,10.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a corked and caged 750 into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a India ink black with a solid 3 inch dark beige head that leaves seriously sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. Good way to start out. The aroma is complex. Dark fruits lead off with dates, figs and plums melting into a over ripe red apple. Up next comes a subtle graininess, chocolate malts, and just a hint of espresso. Very little hop presence in the nose. The flavor is just as complex. Starting of with a base chocolate, following through with ripe apples, dates and figs, and just a subtle citrus hop at the very tail of the flavor profile. A faint roasted espresso coats the mouth with just a slight bitterness. The mouthfeel is light and creamy. I'm surprised at how light the mouthfeel is. Really great stuff. Overall all I think this is a great beer. Boulevard has been putting out some absolutely fantastic stuff as of late.","hwwty4","Mar 07, 2010"
4.31,8.3,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Similar to what I wrote a few years ago, but it may have smoothed out some since - just velvety now. Every bit as enjoyable.","mdcrouser","Mar 06, 2010"

4.7,18.1,5,5,4.5,4,5,"I had massive expectations for this beer, perhaps unfairly so. See, I LOVED last January's limited-release Imperial Stout from Boulevard. This is nearly the same beer; the major differences being that spelt is no long part of the multigrain grain bill and Imperial Stout had blended into it bourbon barrel aged version of the beer (Dark Truth contains no such bourbon barrel aging). I don't miss either aspect. Dark Truth absolutely meets my expectations. I bought ten bottles and I'm going to seek out more. People -- trade for this beer, I'm telling you! It isn't going to out-flavor the barrel-aged big'uns like Black Tuesday or Dark Lord but this is a refined, surprising, off-the-charts good imperial stout that deserves to be recognized and celebrated.","Reaper16","Mar 03, 2010"
3.36,-15.6,4,3,3,4,4,"750ml bottle $9 I will start off by saying I was let down by this beer but I can;t expect to love every single Boulevard beer. Dark black color as a stout should be with a head that was super foamy and actually delayed my drinking. The smell was weird, a little like a stout but not much, none of the promised aromas from the label. The taste was decent but average and again not really like a stout if you ask me more like a black strong ale.","ArrogantB","Mar 03, 2010"
4.75,19.3,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Mouthfeel is a little light for an Imperial Stout, but the complexity of flavors makes it an after thought. Carbonation is strong and keeps the flavors agitated. There are tons of layers here. It's easy enough to drink through, but slow down and really explore. Eye popping.","bort11","Mar 01, 2010"
4.13,3.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Make that the 14th superb offering in the series. Guys, you're bating a 1000.","BradLikesBrew","Feb 27, 2010"
