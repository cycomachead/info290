It's there up front at the start and remains present throughout.  But there is also a strong alcohol presence in both the smell and taste that overrides the nice chocolate.  At 10% ABV the booze overpowers the chocolate and anything else.  Not sure what to pair this with other than dessert.  I would much rather have the fantastic Organic Chocolate Samuel Smith at half the alcohol and exponentially more flavorful and enjoyable.","marieli","Mar 11, 2015"

Very dark brown with lighter edges. Unsurprisingly, the aroma is dominated by chocolate both sweet and dark. There’s also some malt, vanilla, and leafy hop aromas. The taste is again dominated by chocolate: milk chocolate sweetness, some bitter bakers chocolate, cocoa powder, and fudge. An enjoyable earthy leaf bitterness cuts through and marries up to vanilla, roasted malt, and espresso. Medium body, thick velvety slick texture, low to moderate carbonation (more than the appearance indicates), slightly drying on the finish with a bit of alcohol burn.","SierraFlight","Mar 01, 2015"

Light carbonation and boozy up front, carbonation fades to dark chocolate syrup, dark roasted malts and smooth mouth feel. Slight coffee notes, medium/heavy body, slight bitter spice from hops. Overall a great beer.","GregJ","Jan 11, 2015"

Stout characteristics are more prominent at colder temps, but the chocolate increased as it approached room temperature. Didn't bother to cool it at all for my second tasting, chocolate flavor perfectly balanced. Great for a cold day to sip on. Will buy again next year!","LordofthePings","Jan 11, 2015"

Very rich nose of milk chocolate with chocolate malt notes underneath.  Full bodied with a rich creamy texture.  Slightly above average carbonation with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a reasonable burst for this viscosity on the finish.  The very rich taste profile is intense, not very complex but well balanced.  It begins with a sweet milk chocolate explosion that slowly fades into a mild bitterness in the middle.  The bitterness is a blend of roast and hops.  As it begins, the chocolate malt notes of the nose are evident.  The finish leaves a nice moderate alcohol burn at the back of the throat.  As the chocolate and bitterness fade, a light grain alcohol flavor emerges.","tillmac62","Nov 27, 2014"

Heavy and thick in the mouth.  The bitter chocolate predominates.  Roasted barley is very strong.  The dark chocolate and roasted barley fight in your mouth.  Definitely a double imperial stout.  Little burn on the way down.  Finishes with that traditional kick back of hops and roasted barley with an almost chocolate burp.  While I like it, it is no Founders Breakfast Stout.  There are other imperial stouts I would prefer.  Definitely good though.","uvachief","Nov 03, 2014"

4.68,9.9,4,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"O: 10% ABV are you kidding?  This is so supremely drinkable because the alcohol is hidden behind waves of indulgent chocolate.  I know it’s there at the end of the day, with that slight warming feeling from within, but it never rises on the palate.  Phenomenal.  A beer disguised as dessert, or the other way around; surely this is the pick of the bunch from Southern Tier’s Blackwater Series, and that's saying something because there aren’t any slouches in that seasonal lineup of bold stouts.  For my money, this is hands-down THE best chocolate-themed stout on the market, and well deserving of a place near the top of the list of the best stouts I’ve ever tasted.  It is relatively easy to find in season and you won't have to break the bank to get your hands on it.  Try it - you won’t be disappointed.","Buschyfor3","Sep 24, 2014"

Sweet milk chocolate flavors over top dark  roasted malt. Earthy hop bitterness is slowly introduced and adds some balance to the chocolatey sweetness through the middle to the end. Finished with a touch of sweet chocolate followed by dark roasted malt and a touch of boozy heat. A truly phenomenal stout.","IronLover","Sep 18, 2014"

The high ABV does make it a little less pleasant drinking than Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate Stout at first, and ST Choklat is more expensive, but it is undeniably good stuff and quickly becomes really delicious (even before the alcohol kicks in LOL)","scotorum","Sep 12, 2014"

Choklat is a fantastic dessert beer but what makes it great (the chocolate flavor) is also its main downfall because the sweetness can be cloying after only half a glass or so. I would recommend it to imperial stout fans and those with a sweet tooth. Would I drink it again? Sure, but I wouldn’t seek it out to enjoy by myself. (4.00)","JamesMN","0"

The chocolate is ever present in this viscous concoction, and lingers long after the last sip. Wonderful beer from a brewery that doesn't seem to make anything but amazing beer. Definitely pick some up and try it for yourself.","Mantooth","Jun 25, 2014"

Smells and tastes like liquid chocolate to me, which isn't a bad thing at all, but I expected more complexity in a stout. Could the year of age have mellowed out the malts which brought out more chocolate? Id pick up a BBCS or a Founders IS before this any day, and theyre cheaper too. I definitely prefer more of a roasted malt presence, but this is quite the dessert beer. Good job Southern Tier!","Bone53","Jun 21, 2014"

Aroma is an incredibly pungent chocolate smell, some vanilla and sweet caramel but barely distinguishable due to the chcolate. Taste is similar and fairly, except it has a strange taste towards the end due to the fake chocolate flavoring. This beer could be much better if they used real chocolate and not some nasty fake chemical flavoring.","hops202","Apr 11, 2014"

In terms of the spectrum of stout flavours it's definitely at the chocolate, malt and vanilla end rather than that of smoke, peat, char and ash. I'll be picking up a couple of bottles in the not too distant future for sure.","abeeronthebeach","Apr 07, 2014"

I was expecting the usual non sweet taste but this has a great chocolate sweetness. Let me say that this is the best chocolate beer I have ever had. Even better than Samuel Smiths organic. Nice little 10% alcohol burn at the finish. The alcohol is deceptive and quickly gave me a nice buzz. Fantastic beer that hits it's intentions right on the spot.","Richardbeerlover","Apr 04, 2014"

Not sure if the age helped it or hurt it, as the booze is long gone but so are any of the other subtle flavors, and a hint of oxidation, but still quite nice, I think I remember this being a bit boozy and sweet and that's gone so nice and drinkable now.","jlindros","Mar 29, 2014"

Incredible aroma of luscious milk chocolate greets my nose. The flavor is initially very rich milk chocolate that is quickly followed by a bit of bitter roasted malt and bittering hops. The mouth is silky smooth and creamy. This is dessert in a glass.","Franziskaner","Mar 28, 2014"

From the nose to the taste, there was just so much chocolate. Like a stout should have, there was some malt bitterness and warming burnt character with the alcohol. But seriously all that could really come out was the cocoa powder flavor. Seems a little too put on, if I can add.","cambabeer","Feb 22, 2014"

Aroma is one of my favorites I have ever smelled. Deep and rich dark milk chocolate. Taste is amazing. This is one of those beers where you sit and wonder how they do it. They called it Choklat for a reason. Milk chocolate punches you in the face. Expresso comes through after the initial punch. Finishes with a perfect amount of warmth. This stout sits up there with the best. This brew is a must try for all beer lovers.","bryangb","Feb 18, 2014"

4.07,-4.5,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,4.25,"Sampled from a 22 oz. bomber. Color is black at night with a creme brûlée colored head. Smell is a cross between Hershey's original syrup and Smucker's chocolate candy shell. There is also a slight Mexican spicy hot chocolate undertone. Definitely feel the bitter chocolate upfront that surrenders to the sweet and finishes to a cream on the tongue with a almost numbing zestiness on the gums. As far as tast goes this is where my only complaint comes in an it's not really a complaint. After a few sips it builds with sweetness. I would have to drink this as a desert beer and don't think I could have more than one. With its high alcohol content I would definitely need a ride home if out. For its style it's spot on but I wish it were a hair more relaxed with the sweetness and the Abv so that I could enjoy more than one in a sitting.","Hab11","Feb 08, 2014"

4.32,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/26/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, fudge, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, light coffee, toast, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark chocolate and dark/roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, fudge, toffee, roasted malt, light coffee, toast, light vanilla, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, fudge, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, light coffee, light vanilla, light herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance, robustness, and complexity of chocolate and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a great sweetness/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding chocolate imperial stout. All around awesome balance and complexity of chocolate and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

A bit more carbonation would be appreciated, especially for the pleasant aromatic qualities. Ethanol is well-felt in the nostrils and back of throat with each sip, difficult to hide with an 11% beer, but this succeeds relatively well.

Chocolate fudge, dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso, mocha, and toffee. The taste is even more chocolate forward than the nose. Huge cocoa and milk chocolate along with hints of chocolate fudge, vanilla, bitter dark chocolate, and espresso. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, velvety and creamy, with a subtle bitter finish.

Within a few seconds of opening this bottle, the smell of sweet milk chocolate and alcohol filled the air. It poured deep dark brown with a thick tan head that dissipated within 2-3 minutes. The first sip was decent, big milk chocolate flavor and little alcohol presence, but I'm not a milk chocolate fan and I knew it was going to be too sweet for my liking. As the beer got warmer it became horrible. The taste and smell of alcohol became overwhelming and the chocolate flavor became super strong. I would liken the flavor of this beer to someone melting a Hershey bar in a glass of rubbing alcohol. Back to my Founders breakfast stout now...","StoutAsian","0"

Fades into velvety smooth milk chocolate, vanilla and Hersheys syrup in the middle. The finish pulls the sweetness back a bit and brings out some unsweetened baking chocolate, char, roasted malt and earthy hop resin. Texture is silky smooth and complements the sweetness really well.","notchucknorris","Aug 08, 2013"

Aroma is loaded with chocolate and roasted malt. Heavy on chocolate smells here. Taste is equally loaded. This bottle I have no clue how old it is, but it's very smooth with absolutely zero hint of the 10%abv. This one is probably one of the best chocolate stouts i've had. Milk chocolate heavy throughout with a nice bitter dark chocolate in the finish to bring it all together. really quite fantastic.","myersk27","Aug 06, 2013"

The taste was a semi sweet chocolate mixed with a slight roasty malt and enough bittering hops to cleanse the pallet. The mouthfeel was a full bodied ale with smooth carbonation.

Smooth and creamy in mouth, and the bitterness cuts through to clean everything up. Roasty and bitter aftertaste, with a slick, smooth finish and moderate linger.

The strong aroma of dark, dark chocolate hits your nose immediately, like liquid chocolate mousse; sweet coffee overtones; outstanding. Roasted walnuts, caramel, plum, slight bitterness fades to sweet malty after taste, warm alcohol. Heavy and sticky, low carbonation. This one has it all; a complex blend of flavors and aromas. I expected the chocolate to dominate the taste like the aroma, but I was pleasantly surprised when the other flavors came to the forefront. An amazing beer.","Steamer","Mar 01, 2013"

4.21,-1.2,3.75,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,"Aggressive pour yields a thin head of very dark brown, that’s gone quickly too, any lacing is incidental to tilting the glass side to side. De rigueur impenetrably black liquid, razor thin touch of orange rust to the edges, impossible to gauge carbonation visually. The nose is pure chocolate through and through, like chocolate cut with chocolate and a dash of chocolate on top, after that you might discern malted milk balls, vanilla, banana and a smidgeon of black licorice but really this is one repeat bass note of thudding chocolate. Full-bodied, layers itself on the palate until you have to make a concerted effort to move your tongue, creamy and soft, however, the carbonation actually manages to give it a needed nudge forward now and then. Not sure where it comes from but there’s a vanilla, caramel whiskey oak barrel thing going on. Minor plum and blackberry fruit accents. Not much roast nor clearly present hops. Yet, it is not without a bitter, more dark chocolate aspect. No alcoholic burn. This is about as close to pure chocolate flavored a beer can get retaining a soul and without it becoming a laboratory malt beverage.","farrago","Feb 26, 2013"

4.16,-2.3,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours a nice thick and chocolaty black with a nice khaki head, almost like the foam from chocolate milk. The beer’s body is opaque and impenetrable, and leaves a lacing of thin and slippery curtain bubbles on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells thickly of sweet roasted chocolate with a touch of milk chocolate. Light cocoa powder lingers on the nose, and all in all this beer provides exactly what you think it would have from a chocolate beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and bitter roasted, with beautiful chocolate and roasted malt flavors with a touch of char in the finish. The beer begins with cocoa powder, moving into Hershey’s chocolate syrup, and then traveling towards more bittersweet dark chocolate, slowing closing into the finish of roasted malts, char, and faint lingering milk chocolate. On the mouth, this beer feels medium to thick in body and velvety smooth. The mouth is left dry and slightly charred from the roasted malt. Overall, this beer is deliciously chocolaty with a nice bitter balance from the bitter roast of the malts. The big chocolate flavors upfront fully deliver what I wanted from this beer and leave me very happy. This is a big flavorful chocolate beer with some very nice chocolate flavors. It is definitely a sipper as the flavors are big and the beer is thick in the stomach. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Beers"

The beer is called Choklat and if that's what you want, that's what you'll get with this beer. Many beers state that they are chocolate flavored, but they taste more like coffee than chocolate. This beer has both. You taste the dark chocolate and the milk chocolate/ coffee. Once again, solid brew and Southern Tier did a great job with this one.","RichD","Jan 06, 2013"
4.48,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a 34oz mug. Solid oily black that lets no light through. Smell is pure chocolate, with some hints of roasted and coffee and malt. After drinking, some hops are detectable in the smell as well. Taste is bitter and roasted at first, but smooths out to chocolatey deliciousness afterwards. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Overall, this is exactly what a great stout, especially an imperial stout, should be. Awesome beer.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jan 06, 2013"

The smell is heavy on real chocolate, backed by a little booze. It is reminiscent of great Belgian chocolates. The taste is initially a creamy, complex chocolate and malt flavor. A serious, high octane bitterness comes out in the mid-taste. The finish is bitter, chocolatey, and full of charcoal, roasted, and mildly smokey flavors that, curiously, doesn't show up in the front. Full, creamy, and thick mouthfeel. The alcohol stays hidden, only showing up in my feeling after half a glass. Great beer.","Suds","Jan 04, 2013"

The hops are noticeable but surprisingly well-masked. It's rich, creamy, smooth in the mouthfeel and incredibly drinkable. Points off for being a bit too bitter on the finish - and that's coming from someone who has never met a dark chocolate that was too bitter. I would have liked to see a more gentle, let-'em-off-the-hook finish - I could see this as a nightcap beer and that's about it. A solid effort for the style - definitely worth checking out.","brewsclues","Sep 17, 2012"

It is candy forward and not complex in the way that, say, Rogue's Chocolate and Double Chocolate stouts have other complementary layers going on. I hear people talk about beer ice cream floats and usually am turned off by the idea, but this would absolutely work for that. A scoop of vanilla or even mint chocolate chip in this would be a treat for any beer/dessert lover. I'm glad I tried it but won't get it again unless a fitting novelty situation presents itself.

There are mild suggestions of highly roasted and chocolate malts, coffee, and cream, but the main attraction here is big time chocolate flavor.

The flavors do not disappoint, and the alcohol isn't overwhelming despite a double digit ABV. Balanced and improves as it warms. An amazing imperial stout that is very readily available (in season) and reasonably priced (6.99/bomber).","NoLeafClover44","Feb 27, 2012"

4.38,2.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark, dark brown w/ an milkshake like 2 finger chocolate head. Not quite a black hole, but you can't see into it at all. Good lacing on the side of my CBS snifter. The nose is mainly chocolate and malt. Sweet smelling, and really smells like a milkshake more than a beer- thus the markdown from a 4.5. I like it though, just not as a beer- more as a dessert. The taste however, takes things up a notch. You get hops added to the mix, and that makes it just complex enough to get the 4.5 score. None of the 10% abv is evident at all. Not sure where they hid it, but it's non-existant in the taste. I really like this- yes, it's a dessert, it's sweet, but ultimately- it's very tasty. Feel is super smooth, velvety- but the hops still manage to pop through the malt. Overall, this might be a little over the top... but I still like it. A lot. I'll definitely pick this up again.

This is what every stout should strive to acheive in its appearance. Smell is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. One dimensional? Yeah. But it nails chocolate in the aroma more than any other chocolate beer I have tried to date. Taste follows suite with lots of rich milk chcoloates that dominate everything. A touch of dark chocolate comes in at the very end, but this is nothing but liquid chocolate. It is almost like a rich chocolate milk. The mouth is a little thinner than anticipated, but still solid. Overall this is the epitome of a dessert beer. I feel pairing this with anything chocolate would do this beer injustice - this doesn't need anything to accompany it to wrap up your meal.","birchstick","Jan 08, 2012"

4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"When I poured it out it had very little foam to it for a stout but there were no issues with carbonation when I took the first drink. It is definitely a step above just having a "chocolate flavor" and instead reminds me of when my mother would melt dark chocolate in a bowl for brownies and I took a sneaky fingerful. Those looking for a chocolate stout would have a hard time looking elsewhere for a better beer, but it does lack a a bit of variety in flavor that other beers (like KBS, or a Belgian quad, could bring.) After all it is chocolate stout and it lives up to that designation perfectly. I'm gonna go drink another bottle..","frankypoo351","Jan 01, 2012"
4.57,7.3,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. This one has been chilling for a bit in the fridge waiting for a football night. Jet black pour with a nice 2 finger mocca head. Solid lacing and retention. The aroma is amazing with huge chocolate and coffee. Like melted down Hersey bars- Outstanding. Taste follows the nose, but with more coffee and some molasses. Chocolate bomb is an adequate description. Has the typical IS feel with a good bit of carbonation. Silk and creamy on the tongue. Overall- If you like chocolate beer, and I do, this is the ticket. Huge bitter sweet taste that keeps you coming back for another sip. Great balance of chocolate and coffee. Hides the 10+% well and good mix of hops and carbonation. A must try- Very tasty!","TheDinger","Jan 01, 2012"

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is not a traditional Imperial Stout, and can really only be for those that love a rich chocolaty flavor in their beverage. Not for everyone, but I will have another, thank you!","peacebone116","Oct 16, 2011"
4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: All three of the stouts’ look, smell and mouthfeel are very similar; the main difference is in the taste. This beer has more of the chocolate and no coffee flavors, but not quite the balance as the Mokah which is a blend of the other two. Not enough difference in these three beers to warrant a drastic difference in rating, so all three fall out as the same base rating. Any difference is due to personal taste preferences.","heysuz","Oct 15, 2011"

3.47,-18.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"OVERALL: Southern Tier is phenomenal at making their beers taste like exactly what the label says. Creme Brulee, Jahva, Pumpkin, etc., all taste as advertised. This one is no exception. This is basically a chocolate beer with a relatively hot imperial stout as a base. While I enjoyed a full bomber to myself, I do prefer a little more complexity in imperial stouts like this, which is perhaps why I like their blend Mokah a little more. Moreover, this one is a little lacking in flavor up front and could be a little bolder overall. A fun beer that I will eventually drink again, but not one I will be inclined to seek out. Thanks again for the bottles guys!","Jeffo","Aug 21, 2011"
4.41,3.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The body is incredibly smooth, creamy, and bold. While the over zealous chocolate is clearly part of the taste; it hits you with a dry hoppy zing at the end. This one I will remember.","puboflyons","Aug 17, 2011"
3.92,-8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: Good chocolate flavors, flavors that I've only ever had in whiskey barrel aged stouts before. Intense graham crackers and roast marshmallows. Definitely heavily suggestive of girl scout graham cookies and campfire roast desserts. A lot of nostalgic american smore flavors that takes me back to the world of pop tarts and camping. It's pretty good, but I can't help but associate these flavors with cheaply wrapped desserts you can buy at a gas station. Though the beer does an excellent job of capturing that american chocolate experience.","Cavery","Aug 17, 2011"
3.83,-10.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O/D-If I were to rate this beer on the basis of its approximation of tasting like chocolate I would give it a perfect 5. But in terms of how much I enjoy drinking this beer, its rating is far from a 5. I understand why this beer is highly regarded, and I did enjoy trying it. But I think trying this once will be enough. It is sweet to the point of sickness. I would actually prefer a 12 oz. of this to a 22 oz. Hey, if you want chocolate then it'll give you chocolate.","VelvetExtract","Aug 15, 2011"
4.7,10.3,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall, I believe this is as close to a perfect score as I've ever given to a beer, but its warranted. If you fancy stouts, this is a must try for you. It'll change your life. I do have some Founder's Breakfast Stout that I'm aging now for the winter months, so it will be interesting to see if it can live up to its enormous hype and top this Southern Tier offering.","BeerFiend2002","Aug 14, 2011"

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, and though I'm usually reticent to try beers with added flavors (chocolate, hazelnut, vanilla, etc.), I think this is a marvelous drink. Yes, the Belgian chocolate taste is rather strong, but it's nicely counterpointed and catalyzed by the malts and hops, and there are far more nuanced flavors in here than would be expected. Definitely worth a try.","jondeelee","Aug 08, 2011"
4.89,14.8,4,5,5,4.5,5,"O - Delicious chocolate beer, it is very rich which will make it a chore for many to get through the bomber. It is a sipper for sure, but very well done.","jman892","Aug 06, 2011"
4.19,-1.6,4,5,4,3.5,4,"Overall- A very interesting beer. Look, no doubt it delivers on the name. I'm kind of conflicted. It will be a challenge to finish. This is some kind of beer, that's for sure. The ladyfriend really liked it as well, but she can't imagine drinking a whole bottle. I agree. I think it's pretty easy to like, but it's both a dessert sipper, as well as one to share.","callmescraps","Aug 06, 2011"
4.15,-2.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D - Very strong chocolatey sweetness makes for a great dessert beer, but I found myself distracted by the sour bitter chocolate notes and the heat.","Sky2625","Aug 04, 2011"
5,17.4,5,5,5,5,5,"One of my favorite things i like about this brew is the ABV. The alcohol ALWAYS shines through when putting it in food. I'll be the first to admit that $9.00 for a 22 in my area is a bit much. But it's worth it.","Kaie","Jul 31, 2011"

4.17,-2.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O - This is an excellent chocolate beer, in fact, one of the best uses of chocolate in beer I have tasted. There is no hint of staleness of the chocolate that can sometimes come in if the bottle has sat too long, and the chocolate flavor really balances the alcohol well. High quality ingredients were clearly used. This is not an overly complex beer, as chocolate and roasted malt are the two main flavors I could pick out, but an easy drinking, tasty concoction nonetheless.","sdmvd6","0"
4.18,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Did I just drink a beer or a glass of Hershey's Syrup? Seriously, chocolate lovers will flip over this beer.

4.56,7,3,4.5,5,4,4.5,"O- Someone at the bar tried to tell me chocolate extract was used in this recipe but I believe it is just the most skillful addition of chocolate to a stout of all the beers I have tried thus far. I love that I can get growler fills right down the street.","GrindFatherBob","Jul 11, 2011"

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Appearance is black with a thin head. The smell of Choklat, has well, some chocolate, hazlenut, coffee, very inviting. Its` taste certainly has more of that chocolate, sweet malt, dark fruit. MF is pretty rich, small amount of bitterness in the end. I was kind of skeptical with how this was going to be, but it exceeded my expectations and my friends enjoyed it as well. Pairing this with a dessert or some chocolate at the end of an evening works well.","mltobin","Jul 08, 2011"
4.59,7.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: An exceptional beer. Maybe to much chocolate for some people. I'm not big on super sweet beers but this is balanced enough that the sweetness doesn't overpower. An awesome sipper. Probably shouldn't drink a whole bomber to yourself. Like Mommy used to say "If you eat(drink) to much chocolate you'll get a stomach ache!"","doughanson78","Jul 08, 2011"
4.47,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall a delicious beer, and the best chocolate stout I have ever had. Its hard to compare it to a none flavor infused beer, so I won’t even try. I’ll just say it’s fantastic at what it claims to be, but lacks complexity and depth.","zac16125","Jul 07, 2011"
3.93,-7.7,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall. A great desert beer if you are sharing with friends. OR, a beer that will get you liquored up quickly if that is the goal.","righthereisay","Jul 07, 2011"

4.12,-3.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Well it lives up to its name and that is what you should expect from Southern Tier. If I’m in the mood for something sweet and savory, this would be a great beer for desert, but I don’t know if I could drink a whole bottle on my own.","jamescain","Jun 20, 2011"
4.37,2.6,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was how the chocolate finds a nice gradation, moving from sweet to bitter through the progression of the flavor profile. Of note otherwise is the mouthfeel, which has extraordinary character, while remaining so light. This is an exemplary chocolate stout, and is a force to be reckoned with.","TheBrewo","Jun 20, 2011"
4.32,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"T - This is a nice and unique beer. Complex flavors. Interesting flavors. It’s gonna’ take work to get through this bomber by myself. I have time, but the richness really slows things down. Actually drank more easily than I expected. Went well with “A few dollars more”. I think the aging may have softened it some. It may have been too intense for me fresh (at least to drink the whole bottle alone). (4)","garymuchow","Jun 15, 2011"
4.17,-2.1,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Very attractive beer. Poured thick, opaque brown-black with a nice cream-colored head that receded rather fast. Beer left a syrupy film on the glass. Smell was of rich, dark chocolate. Taste was of dark and milk chocolate (makes sense), with some cocoa bitterness. Some alcohol bite (11%ABV). Rich, warming mouthfeel. Easy drinkability; the strength and bitterness outdid the smoothness. I think this beer has definitely improved over the years. My original 3.83 rating is now 4.17.","Rifugium","Jun 11, 2011"
4.08,-4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall this has to be classified as a desert stout. There is no balance, it is overwhelming sweet. It is an enjoyable stout, very difficult to drink more than a glass.","dtivp","Jun 10, 2011"

4.22,-0.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Deep brown, near black, one finger tan head that dissipates to the edges, light lacing left behind. Smell is chocolate in a big way, roasted malt, milkshake like, bittersweet and milk chocolate notes play off of each other wrapped up with subtle hints of alcohol. Taste is chocolatey, roast malt and coffee notes follow, hops in the aftertaste, bittersweet notes throughout, chocolate dominates here. Silky and rich mouthfeel, full body and thick at pointsgood use of carbonation, nice feel. Really good stuff here, nice slow sipper good as desert or just on its own.","peensteen","Jun 04, 2011"

Chocolate milk, chocolate syrup, and milk chocolate candy bars. There is also a vanilla and malted milk quality. I am also getting a hint of banana. Taste is almost exactly like the smell with some dark roasted malt and cocoa powder flavors. There is a high level of carbonation on this one which makes this beer very lively and crisp. A bit of an alcohol burn in the throat too. Overall, this is a very good beer with an unbelievable chocolate smell and taste.

3.73,-12.4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"From a 22 oz. bottle with the older silk-screened label. Brewed to 27P with two-row, crystal 60, flaked barley, chocolate malt and Belgian bittersweet chocolate; hopped with Chinook and Willamette. Pours fairly black, with a thin tan collar that doesn't lace, but never dissipates. Chocolate dominates the aroma, but there are also notes of light roast coffee, black and blueberries, amaretto and vanilla. Kinda gives the impression of chocolate milkshake. On the palate it it smooth and very cleanly-fermented, lightly sweet, with mildly-bitter roasted malt, licorice, dark and milk chocolate, and a light herbal/piney hop flavor that contributes a rough bitterness. The body is full and almost chewy, with low carbonation and a dry finish. Not terribly complex, but it is well-made and the chocolate dovetails nicely. A good pick for aging.","mmmbeer","May 19, 2011"

The taste is chocolate upfront to finish; probably the most chocolate in a brew I have ever had to date. The usual flavor of an imperial stout are in there as well. The brew has a mild carbonation with a full body. The chocolate coats your mouth along with hops bitterness. A great brew, but I can't do more than a bomber a night.

In terms of nose, both are very close in comparison but Choklat smells more delicious and inviting. Flavors wise, it goes down to personal preference for chocolate or coffee; I will say both are just as good in their own ways.

The 11% is hidden well with the huge taste profile. Pretty good tasting chocolate stout. Mouthfeel is full bodied and oily. Drinkability is hard with this one.

The flavor is slightly bitter chocolate and the artificial aroma that I detected is lost in the aroma. This is thick and full with good low carbonation.

It's almost chocolate fudge like, as if you should put it over ice cream. The booze is pretty harsh. Like most of ST's beers, they didn't try to hide this. It really takes away from the appealing chocolatey aromas. The flavor has moderate roastiness to it but probably not as much as you'd expect. The chocolate comes in layers, like you're eating a layered chocolate cake. Some are insanely sweet and other sips are a little on the burnt, bitter chocolate end. I'd definitely call it a dessert beer. This beer drinks medium to heavy in body but is exceptionally smooth. There isn't much carbonation so this one goes down with ease. This is a very tasty beer but it's a little sweet for my liking. The alcohol can also be overbearing at times. The mixture of insane sweetness paired with the alcohol content make this a beer to share with another person.","aasher","0"

The taste isn't nearly as awesome as the aroma, in fact after time it gets really hard to drink. The flavor is chocolate and intensely so. There are hints of booze behind the chocolate that does slightly affect the palate that would otherwise be a wonderful velvet swirl. It is truly a sipper in every sense of the word.

Yes the bittering balances the intense sweetness artfully while keeping you focused on the malt and chocolate core of the beer but c'mon, it's all about the sweets here. Feel is full and thick. Smooth carbonation is spot on and keeps your tongue from being smothered by the almost syrupy consistency of this wonderfully over the top beer. Like heavy velvet your tongue is enveloped in comfort. For something so strong it goes down like a shake at your favorite diner. Love it out of a bottle this just takes it to the next level.","scootny","Dec 30, 2010"

Aroma of 100% cacao...that's all. Taste of rich bitter chocolate, possibly some slightly roasted malts, but so masked by dark flavors of chocolate, it is difficult to identify everything else. Alcohol is not very hot. Rich burnt chocolate left on the palate. Excellent sipping beer. Happy New Year!","ToAzwethinkweizm","Dec 30, 2010"

The taste did confirm the one-dimensional aspect of the beer...tasting like dark chocolate M&M's...HOWEVER, it worked. I mean, with a name like 'Choklat', I didn't exactly expect a potpourri of flavors, and the intensity of the chocolate flavor worked. Just a little too sweet, though, and the finish was revealed the alcohol content in its entirety, with only modest dryness. Furthermore, the feel was thick and slick.

The chocolate is dark and bitter, which is great for this type of beer. Not too sweet, like some milk chocolate stouts are. Nice smooth mouthfeel, a little too much on the carbonated side though.

Has a nice big light tan head that slowly retreats but sticks around for most of the entire drink. Leaves little to no lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell is mainly chocolate. Kind of a sweet chocolate smell mixed with a hint of dark chocolate. Great smell overall especially if you if you like chocolate. The taste is pretty predictable...chocolate. Sweet, dark, milk chocolate...it's all there. Chocolate dominates this brew and it's pretty well expected. There is a hint of alcohol in the taste but it doesn't take away from anything. I think there is also a small hint of dark fruits in the taste as well. The chocolate also becomes more and more apparent in the aftertaste and leaves with a really sweet taste. Overall it's really drinkable. High ABV but it doesn't matter. A couple of these no problem but it's more of a dessert beer but I could have it whenever. Overall I was a bit let down because of the hype of the amount of chocolate....I was expecting it to be way more chocolately. It still is however and I enjoy it a lot.

The hoppy bitterness made the sweet elements more like bakers chocolate. Highly enjoyable and as chocolaty as any beer I've ever had.

Creamy tan head forms on top of this beer less than a finger strong and receeds to just a thin film with a fair amount of lacing. Nose does not disappoint and fully lives up to the name. Aroma is all chocolate... it is like a sweet milk chocolate that is reminiscent of Hershey's chocolate syrup. Taste is a mildly sweet chocolate upfront that turns to bitter chocolate with a bit of a burnt grain character through the body blended with hop bitterness and alcohol in the finish. Lingering taste of bitter chocolate is left in the mouth from a combination of the dark grain and hops. Moderately high carbonation with a medium to heavy feel.

It was thick with some carbonation, and had a sweet aftertaste. Overall this was a super sweet and chocolaty beer. There wasn't any complexity outside of that, and the sweetness was almost overwhelming and seemed somewhat artificial. So this definitely isn't for everyone. However, I still enjoyed it thoroughly.

The haymaker comes in the taste, which consists of cocoa, oats, dark malts, and a finishing rabbit-punch of hoppy bitterness. The fight choreography at this point has been complex, mixed, generally effective, but not a complete knockout; we're left dizzied, anxiou for what may come next. Luckily, the body is nicely in the medium range, allowing the refs to call the fight before everything goes south.

Can't see any smell though really without the malt (from maltballs) being thrown in. Very chocolaty beer, the chocolatiest. I've read in the threads where people were overwhelmed by this "desert" beer. Not so with me, I could drink this often.

Loads of bittersweet chocolate cascade down upon my taste buds. Also, chalky English style yeast, malt sweetness and a touch of roastyness. Alcohol is pretty much completely hidden by the other flavors. I find the aftertaste to be a little bit unpleasant, and the finish is quite sticky. Fairly full bodied and not the most drinkable beer to be certain. I would have to say that while it is tasty, I find the chocolate a bit much, and really wish it came in smaller bottles.

Sweet malty milk chocolate, dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, reminiscent of hot cocoa and candy bars. Medium bodied with ample carbonation, which in conjunction with the flavors makes this beer way way way too drinkable for the style and ABV. This beer is amazing.

The flavor featured a lot of (unsurprisingly) chocolate, but a slight smokiness in the finish provided some balance. Suggestions of molasses, vanilla, and toffee lingered in the background. The 11% booziness has definitely died down in two years, but the brew is still very warming on its way down.

This was not the best stout I have ever had but it was one of the top 5. Its dark color was expected and the smell, well it smells like chocolate. Now for the taste. At first I was hoping for a hint of choco, nope but it is just right and just amount to mask the booziness of the 11% brew.

The head that forms is dense, deep-espresso in color and dissipates to a fine layer of head on the top of the beer. The smell is all over the place. I get some nice milk chocolate notes, with the glass sitting on the desk next to me, coupled with a light roasted character. Putting my nose up to the glass releases a chocolate aroma reminiscent of a nice sipping chocolate, sweet milk, and the faintest hint of some kind of roasted malt. This thing isn't messing around when it says it's "a stout brewed with chocolate." The first sip carries a bit more roasted malt to it than the smell, but a dark chocolate flavor quickly overpowers most of the roasted character. A milky sweetness coats the tongue, despite the slightly less than smooth mouthfeel of the beer. The roasted character sticks around after the sweetness has departed; a nice compliment to the milky sweetness at the start of the sip. There's still some stout characteristics buried under the sweetness, as evidenced by the nice roasted character. Truly a well-balanced approach to a dessert beer, as this would most certainly be if given the opportunity. Some spiciness sneaks through on the back of the taste, livening the overall flavor of the beer slightly. Warming only enhances these characteristics, taking it from a good beer, to a damn fine beer.

A sticky-smooth dark brown & copper pour to a full light brown with yellow 3-finger head soon dissipates to a thin-to nothing head, but with nice lacing. A porter-like aroma with strong port wine hints and nice dark chocolate-black coffee & toffee scents. My wife's response "oooo...candy, pure Hershey's" although more to the darker end, than the milk-chocolate end. Upon tasting, a nice subtly-smoked malt with lemon hop edging was present. Smooth to the tongue with a rauchbier twist, but not too much! A bit of alcohol sits in your nose, warming it.

I noticed hints of bitter/roasted chocolate, oat, coffee malts and the rare hop but this beer is all about chocolate. Not like a chocolate milkshake or a liquid candybar, but I'd say if you ever had Hershey's Chocolate syrup before mixing it/pouring on top of ice cream then you'd recognize this taste. Since I have a sweet tooth I was really pleased with this beer and couldn't put my glass down (there was no alkie burn b/c they hid the ABV well) so my ratings reflect that somewhat (I couldn't session this regardless b/c more than a couple of these and I'd be sick).

It is solid with little variations in the taste but the intricate balance with hops and malty malaises is intriguing so I wouldn't call it 'one dimensional'. I can't believe they use chinooks in this- what a precise brew. Henry calls southern tier the jelly bean or jolly rancher of breweries which I think is a perfect description.

Wow, this is a big brew, had the color of dull black color with some brownish highlights. The head was a deep tan color that was a little on the smallish size, had minimal legs but did leave light lacing lines. The aroma really highlights the chocolate as that is the scent that really comes out, bittersweet. I have had other brews where I say it had chocolate aromas but nothing like this. Also there is a light burnt aroma from black malts. The flavor has a lot going on, the main flavor to me seems chocolate, at least more than in other beers where I notice chocolate. Has a bitter flavor and I would imagine that would be from a mix of the burnt malt, chocolate and hops. Some slight fruit flavors seem to come out but it really is chocolaty. For a 11% brew it hides the alcohol even as it warms. The only way I know it has some punch is that I feel a bit of a buzz off it. For me the chocolate got a little old after a while.

You gotta hand it to Southern Tier, when they go after a specific aroma and flavor, they usually nail it. (See Pumpking and Creme Brulee.) There is a nuance of a stout backing to this, but who's kidding who? You buy this to taste liquid chocolate and that's what you get. Molten, viscous, decadent chocolate.

4.62,8.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"At first glance this beer doesn't really look all the remarkable. It pours a deep black with only the merest hints of dark brown at the edges. Head is dark khaki, not quite a half finger at its zenith, and dissipates rather rapidly. Aroma is very good, bordering on excellent. At first it seems a bit subdued, I think to myself "ok, they used chocolate in this brew. nothing special". i didn't realize how wrong I was. I got distracted and walked away for just a few minutes and when i came back I found an entirely different beer. After this brew had a bit of time to warm up the aroma went from one-dimensional and average at best to damn near perfect. I picked up the glass, give it a little swirl and before the glass was a foot from my nose I was greeted with a most heavenly aroma. Good bittersweet chocolate, I mean really good bittersweet chocolate, REALLY good bittersweet chocolate. There are also some nice sweet caramel undertones present but this one is all about the chocolate. So at this point its fair to say that I'm impressed, however I've yet to even taste the brew and frankly thats the part that really counts. So I finally get to this and I am greeted with a flavor to match that delectable aroma. The focus of this beer is obviously the chocolate but there are subtleties here that make this all the more enjoyable. The chocolate is bittersweet, at first more sweet and later more bitter. The malt character is simply there to support the chocolate but very complimentary and by no means uninteresting. There is a slight caramel character, a bit of chocolate malt character (not the 'chocolate' flavor you usually get out of chocolate malt, thats covered by the real deal in this brew) and a building bitterness that can only be from the hops. There really isn't any detectable hop flavor here but the late bitterness is far too strong to be from the chocolate so the hops are the only possible culprit. The bitterness lingers only briefly, the sweetness a bit longer and the chocolate flavor longest of all. Call me crazy but in the aftertaste i detect a touch (no more) of black coffee and tobacco. Mouthfeel is quite good, medium-full bodied with low-medium carbonation. This brew manages to get the mouthfeel spot on. It is neither too heavy nor too light, it is simply perfect, it lingers on the plate with just the right weight for just the right amount of time. As for alcohol, I read the bottle an found out that this brew is not to be taken lightly at 11% ABV and I would never have guessed it. For a time I forgot that I was even drinking a beer. This seems more like homemade cocoa made with some really, really good chocolate. Drinkability is exceptional, I find myself suddenly finished with the a glass that I thought I started just a minute ago. This brew is by far the best chocolate stout I've had. I find myself contemplating the purchase of as much as I can carry despite these trying economic times and my usual frugal ways. Overall this is excellent, try it. Seriously. Do it. Do it now. Or do it later. Just try it.","mnj21655","Jan 02, 2009"

Aroma is strong of light fruit and chocolate. I've had Belgian chocolate beers that sort of smell like this- it has the milk chocolate characteristic but with a little exotic twang. Taste is like a chocolate milkshake at first but after a few sips the more beer like characteristics come out. The alcohol is very subdued by the chocolate, like you find in liquor filled chocolates. Dull hop bitterness brings out some of the bitterness of the chocolate while highlighting the sweet parts. Some more spicy hop flavor comes out on the lips and in the front of the tongue. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel without too much of a silky body, but enough to give credit to the chocolate. You can definitely tell this is a Belgian inspired stout from the flavor of the chocolate and it's well done. The intense alcohol almost seems unnecessary. This could have had all the same great characteristics without the hangover-inducing level of ethanol. Nonetheless, it takes a lot of skill to bring this smooth and flavorful of a beer to fruition and maintain that high ABV. I can see why people are buyng up cases of this.","wiseguy142","Dec 23, 2008"

4.17,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"It doesn't taste quite as sweet as it smells, though. The chocolate characteristic here (definitely the pre-eminent characteristic, as suggested by the name) is bitter, more like a semi-sweet baking chocolate than something you would normally consume. The roastiness of the malts emphasizes this characteristic. Little bit of hop bite at the end helps balance that out. Some alcoholic burn, but it's all up front instead of really lingering at the end (it does at the end, just a bit though.) Compared to Weyerbacher XIII, that beer had much more of an alcoholic burn, but for me, that was something that affected the whole duration of the sipping, and actually came out more in the aftertaste, making it tough to drink. In this case, the end clears up nicely. If anything, I would want this to be a little sweeter, taking away a bit from the bitterness. That detracts a bit from the drinkibility, but for what it is, the drinkibility isn't bad. It's still a nice sipper, though. Mouthfeel is chewy and full, coating but not cloying to the point of oppressiveness.","damienblack","Dec 17, 2008"

The aroma is of dark and milk chocolate with a backbone of roasted malt. The taste is a little roastier than the aroma, but it is still dominated by chocolate. Bitter dark chocolate is followed by fine roasted malts which lead into a finish of creamy milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is full bodied with low, fine carbonation which does a good job of staying out of the way of the chocolate. Overall, this is a very fine beer, and, perhaps, the best chocolate beer I have yet tasted. I will certainly drink this again.","KarlHungus","Dec 17, 2008"

There are faint whiffs of dried fruit and a touch of alcohol, but mainly chocolate. I'm a little undecided on this one. I like chocolate stouts, don't get me wrong, but this one is SO chocolate filled that it's almost monotone. The other usual suspects in a good stout (the roasted coffee notes, the deep malts, toffee, etc) are simply overpowered by the chocolate. Also, what starts as a nice head, disappears, and there is little to no lacing. I richer head would be nice. The taste is also almost predominately chocolate. If I were blindfolded and someone told me this was a homemade chocolate soda, I wouldn't argue with them.

I like this better than the smell because it adds a hint of roast to the mix along with a faint green hop bitterness. Still, though...the chocolate, it's lovely. Just too much chocolate, not enough beer. Close to a full bodied brew with a good feel for sure. Good level of carbonation. I wish this were more drinkable but unfortunately for me, it's not. Takes quite a while to consume. I'd prefer splitting this with three people, even. One of those brews that is on the brink of being brilliant but it's just slightly held back. Add a touch more roast, a little more depth, and this is one amazing brew. As is, it's quite one-dimensional and reminds me of Mike Tyson.

I waffle back and forth between thinking the aggressive, almost harsh bitterness is too much with thinking that it is absolutely needed to help balance the thick, viscous, over-the-top chocolate character. I suppose it does distract me from a chocolate character that might be too much other wise, so in that sense it is good.

As the flavore develop you get waves of toasted waffles, maple syrup and even a dry hop profile that adds nicely to the lenghy bitter feel at the end of the palate.

Absolute chocolate explosion, with tons of drying hops at the back. Chocolate is tootsie-roll up front, then shifting into bittersweet chocolate that mixes nicely with the hops in the after-taste. After that, the flavor is fairly consistent throughout, which might be its one failing - lack of complexity (however the beer tastes so damn good I'm not going to fault it much). A lot like an extreme version of Rogue's Chocolate Stout. Maybe a touch of citrus in the hops as well, and a very slight hint of alcohol bit at the end (but at 11%, this is pretty mild and doesn't hurt the beer). Body is crazy thick and creamy with perfect carbonation. Excellent on the tongue. Overall, an excellent beer, another winner from ST.","soupyman10","Mar 05, 2008"

The taste buds know that something special is coming their way (and it is indeed). This imperial stout pours from the bottle a dark brown color (I was expecting something pitch-black). There is a nice foamy head which lasts a reasonable period of time. The taste is a delight, with a fine balance of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, and a very faint bitter spark at the end (and again no hints of the relatively high ABV within). Very smooth.

The rich, thick, creamy chocolate flavor absolutely dominates this beer to the greatest extent possible... Front of the bottle states "A Stout brewed with chocolate"... that seems like somewhat of an understatement because this beer is completely loaded with chocolate... Nice, dark, jet-black ebony appearance with minimal reddish-tan head... smell is likewise dominated by a strong dark, burnt-chocolate essence along with cocoa and espresso nuances... The flavor is dominated by rich, roasted malts, dark-latte, and sugared flavors... Southern Tier did exceptionally well with this one...

Semisweet chocolate flavour dominates, bitterness is well balanced and there's light alcohol that appears towards the finish. Light roasty notes were present, along with a bit of malty caramel. There was a hint of earthy hops in the finish. Full bodied with fine carbonation, definitely on the low side. Mild warmth, nice texture, very smooth. This stuff goes down so easy it's ridiculous.

From a brewery I have always been excited about trying beers from, I haven't had a single one I would ever get again, from them and this was no different... Pours a rich black, with only slight shades of ruby coming through, and next to no head which didn't last even from a vigorous pour. Smell is very light alcohol and cheap chocolate and an artificial chemical component. Reminds me of the Shenandoah Chocolate Donut Beer in a bad way... Taste is somewhat rich, fake chocolate again and little else. Moderately balanced bittersweetness with a nice mouthfeel and light carbonation, but when its coming from something that smells like cheap melted hersheys, wax and preservatives, who cares? If you're going to add this much of some outside ingredient aside from the actual brewing process, you ought to make it fresh, or high quality, and I don't get the impression they did that at all here.

Quarter-inch mocha colored head dissipated immediately into an oily film. Virtually no lacing adherence with the exception of a narrow ring around them rim. Scent - Belgian dark chocolate (duh), almost overpoweringly so, with the scent remaining in the nostrils between sips. Taste similar to nose with the presence of malt now detectable. Alcohol was surprisingly well-hidden considering the 11% abv. Silky mouthfeel with a little effervescence making it less chewy than anticipated. Finish left a lingering bitterness in the mouth (hops?) that didn't subside until the next sip. An enjoyable imperial for the most part; however, not being a fan of dark chocolate, I found the experience a little too overwhelming and actually prefer Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout over Southern Tier's Choklat.","Jwale73","Jan 19, 2008"

A taste revealed an unbelievable sweet chocolate flavor, followed by roasted malt undertones, a signficant hop bitterness, and considerable alcoholic warmness. The brewers must have added the chocolate after the fermentation was complete, otherwise I don't know how you could retain that Hershey-chocolate sweetness in the flavor.

It's extremely smooth and flavorful, while hiding much of the 11% abv. . It boasts of black malts and imported dark chocolate. This is a real treat of a beer. It does go the road of the low alcohol sweet chocolate stout. It chooses the high powered attack instead with lots of alcohol and a dark chocolate taste. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect.

Taste follows with the same chocolate milk, mint and fudgsicle flavors mixing into a burnt roasted malt with a bitter coffee finish. Medium to heavy body, sweet thickness is cut by the roasty flavors and a slight dance of hops on the tongue. Alcohol is very well hidden for its strength, just a quick warmth.

The smell is incredible; like sticking your nose into a partially full can of Hershey's chocolate topping (not the same sensation as the plastic squeeze bottle packaging). Let it warm up some...like the slightly roasted crust of fresh baked gooey brownies. The mouth feel is full bodied and lightly carbonated. The flavor has very little of that suggested sweetness. The taste is more of about the dark precooked semi-sweet morsels used in baking. That raw dark chocolate flavor is intense and adds a slight oily bitterness to the mouth feel that lingers significantly. There is a thickness to the mouth but the 'coating' factor isn't there as much as it is in my favorite Double Stouts. I'm also experiencing the 11% ABV less in the mouth than I am in the chest on the way down. A whole lot of complexity worth considering. Drinkability (this one not being 'how many of these could o put down) - I'm having a lot of fun with this one, but a little hard to relax with.

It has just the right amount of sweetness and is delicious. My wife and I have enjoyed it for breakfast. You can drink it any time. Its taste can stand alone or stand up to many different foods.

There is little carbonation coming out of solution and the dark color makes it impossible to assess clarity. The color is exactly where I would want it for a chocolate stout. Just enough brown to give the impression of chocolate. The aroma on this brew is beyond words. The best I can come is tootsie rolls. The chocolate is certainly the dominant smell. Taking a big sniff, I get a hint of alcohol, giving a little creme de caco influence, but there is little in the way of roast or other aromas that I would associate with the stout portion of this brew. The flavor is interesting. The tootsie roll chocolate is apparent immediately, but it is not overbearing as I have found in other chocolate stouts. It moves quickly to a nice solid roasted maltyness with a mild pine hop. All those flavors blend well together on the finish to bring the beer into harmony with itself. This one is tasty. Mouthfeel is thick with a light carbonation. It has a nice creamyness to it, letting me know that there are some dextrins in there. Overall, this one is a winner. It really sells the chocolate in the nose without coming across too dominant in the flavor. I like the slight bitter that comes on the finish, as it gives me a little more of a dark chocolate hint, which is enjoyable to me. I think the hype-machine got this one right.

3.58,-16,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: Too sweet and high in alcohol to make it a continuous drinker. It would make an OK after dinner beer.","Biscuit033","Dec 29, 2007"
4.97,16.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Great beer. No other stout like it. Finally a "chocolate beer" that delivers. Just an incredible chocolate bomb dropped on the palate, with deceptive complexity.","Lupe","Dec 29, 2007"
4.78,12.2,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"At $6.49 a bomber, Southern Tier is both producing world-class beer while doing it at a price that allows everyone to savor excellence on a regular basis. There are simply no beers at this price range that compare.","Blanchette","Dec 29, 2007"
3.53,-17.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall impression: A big, bold chocolate stout. I was suprised at the hop presence on this one. I didn't expect it to be so forward given the style and chocolate addition. All sorts of great things going on here (hops, chocolate, good recipe) but they just didn't seem to "knit" together well. Good beer? Yes. Worth they hype? Probably not.","mattcrill","Dec 28, 2007"
4.52,6.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: The amazing thing about Choklat is how well-hidden the 11% ABV is. Honestly, I really don't taste it at allm, thought the warmth from the alcohol is felt a little bit on the way down. . . . In the end this is a fantastic beer, perfect for a cold winter night near the fire. . . . Forget pairing this with food, this is a meal -- dessert -- in and of itself. Yummy stuff, even if it may be more like a chocolate licquor (sp?) rather than a beer. . . .","Kendo","Dec 28, 2007"
4.4,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Wow, I guess you could say that one's enjoyment of this would probably hinge directly on if they like chocolate or not. I happen to love it, so count me in as a big fan of this new Double Stout. It is WAY over the top with it's primary flavor but luckily the sturdy supporting cast and hefty ABV actually help keep it from becoming too much. Me thinks that Southern Tier has a winner on their hands with this one folks.","Kegatron","Dec 28, 2007"
4.97,16.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"22 ounce (650 ml) bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Once you smell this beer it's pretty obvious this is a chocolate (I mean choklat) stout. It smells like bittersweet/dark and milk chocolate, with a little bit of coffee too. But this is definitely a chocolate bomb, which is a good thing. The taste is similar to the aroma, and I can also taste a bit of vanilla. There's a great mix of sweet and bitter in this beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full. It's extremely smooth, creamy, and a little slick/coating, but also a little bit thinner than I expected it to be but it still has a lot of substance to it. The low carbonation helps make this very, very easy to drink. I didn't notice any alcohol in the aroma or the taste, but you know it's there after drinking it. In my opinion this is easily one of the best beers I've had this year, or ever for that matter. This is the 2nd bottle I've had of this, and it's just as good as the first. Southern Tier has a winner with this beer, hopefully they'll make more of this soon!","bluejacket74","Dec 28, 2007"
4.82,13.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a chilled 650mL bottle into a 20oz. Imperial Pint glass. Pours rich dark brown, like baking chocolate with the smell to match. Its completely opaque. The smell of the Belgian chocolate is instant and takes your breath away. There is no mistaking what you are about to taste. The smell is rich dark chocolate and coffee and its amazing. As the beer settles, there is moderate lacing from the rich coco like head. The 1st taste is exactly what you're smelling....chocolate and coffee with modest carbonation. Simply amazing. Southern Tier, you've done it again. Can't wait for my trip to the brewery.","RocPorterFanatic","Dec 27, 2007"
4.59,7.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and exceptionally creamy. This is one tasty stout. After having it both on-tap and from a growler, I can't wait to crack open a bottle and compare them all. Find it, drink it, enjoy it.","Imstillthegman","Dec 27, 2007"
3.85,-9.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours black, with some caramel highlights, and an espresso-foam head that fades to a dusting. The nose is nicely complex, with dry cocoa and milk chocolate, nuts (almonds?) and yeast. On the palate, creamy bitter chocolate flavors with green hop bitterness in the background. Sweet in the middle, and drying chocolate at the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, with a bit too much raw alcohol bite. Overall, this is a very good result for mixing two things (chocolate and beer) that often don't play very well together. The chocolate flavors are relaxed and well integrated, the bitterness is prominent but not overpowering. Rich and pretty satisfying.","geexploitation","Dec 26, 2007"
4.47,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Shared with family at Christmas dinner. The perfect desert beer. Drinkability score reflects a desert beer not a session beer. Best chocolate brew I've tasted from a bottle.","beerphan","Dec 26, 2007"
3.83,-10.1,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,3,"D: This is a great beer but is a touch too chocolaty. I understand it's a chocolate stout, but the chocolate is a touch too strong overall and it's a bit too sweet. I actually had a bit of a hard time finishing the entire bottle.","drseamus","Dec 26, 2007"
4.35,2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability is very high...provided you like chocolate. (Did I mention it tastes like chocolate?) ABV is evidence is the start of a buzz but does not interfere with the other flavors. Despite the dominant chocolate, there is enough else going on to make this a beer that is definitely worth drinking. This is my first beer by Southern Tier, and if they are at all like this, I can't wait to try more.","tkarsies","Dec 25, 2007"
4.25,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours jet black, with a brown-ish tan head. In the aroma, sweet cocoa and a small hop, yet very small. In the taste, chocolate and cocoa, and a small hop in the very end. A smooth cocoa mouthfeel and a semi dry chocolate aftertaste. Hides the alcohol completly, chocolate is HUGE in this. Almost like chocolate milk or cocoa, but better.","OWSLEY069","Dec 25, 2007"
4.17,-2.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours an obviously pitch black color with a not so dark head, just white of tan, good tracing and it closes to just a cover of bubbles. Aroma is just incredible: tons of Tootsie Roll, vanilla, slight citrus notes, cream soda/malt like flavors. Overall, it smells like a Chocolate beer with a capital C. On the palate, the chocolate flavor is just overwhelming. It is on par with Rogues' Choc. Stout, but certainly the alcohol kicks things up a notch. This is simply dessert in a glass. I'm a little dissapointed with a thinner than expected body, but overall it's a wonderful beer. Finishes with a slight tannic like chocolate flavor. Also, there isn't too much coming from hops or malt, but that is okay in a chocolate beer. Recommended pairing with any sort of chocolate dessert, or as dessert by itself.","dreadnatty08","Dec 25, 2007"
4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Reminded me of a Rogue Chocolate Stout & Rogue Imperial Stout combo. Simply a great beer that is complex and smooth with an 11% ABV that is quite well hidden. A perfect companion to a ripping fire and holiday vibe.","Hibernator","Dec 24, 2007"
4.37,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"It's starts out both sweet and biting...super dense roasty malts and a bittersweet chocolate followed by the warming ethanol.Some of the bite may be from hops , but I can't tell...could just as likely be the chocolate. The chocolate flavor dominates...and it's Good Chocolate, too! There is some coffee...Kaluha-type , black Russian thing going on which becomes more evident with warm up.It finishes dry even with the almost syrupy mouthfeel. The body is about as dense as it gets...low carbonation, but enough. A really enjoyable after dinner sipping brew. I'm glad that I had two people to share this with, so I didn't get stupid drinking the whole thing... 1/3 of a bomber is just right. A treat !","Hautacam","Beers"

4.97,16.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Profoundly dark. Soot black with an obsidian glistening. Topped by a short-lived light khaki-sand head of foam. Sticky, dense sheets of lacing remain on the glass. Fabulous chocolate Twizzler aroma: big, round, soft cocoa with a luscious milky background, like a snifter full of devil's food cake batter. Assertive and chewy cocoa flavors up front, followed by a muscular black-roasted bitter char bite. The finish smooths out into a slightly earthy hop whimper with a lingering pine-needle acridity. Here, at the end, a bit of alcohol heat shows itself, but only as a reminder. A bit of rugged Chinook flavor emerges in the aftertaste, along with the doughy, sweet chocolate flavor that predominates throughout this beer. Thick, ponderous mouthfeel throughout, but never syrupy or overly heavy. Very dry at the finish, all things considered. An amazing creation -- sort of like Young's Double Chocolate Stout with gigantic balls and a snarlingly bitter attitude. I'll buy up all I can to get me through the winter.","orfeu","Dec 23, 2007"
5,17.4,5,5,5,5,5,"Southern Tier knocked this one out of the park. This feels like a breakthrough beer to me. I don't know what their distribution area looks like, but I think this is one people are going to be clamoring for everywhere. It is a perfectly made beer that everyone deserves to have cross their taste buds.","JAramini","Dec 23, 2007"
4.34,1.9,4,5,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured as pitch black with no light getting through that black depth. It formed a huge dark tan foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. The aroma kind of hits you over the head with malt, chocolate aroma almost like cocoa, and a hint of coffee/toffee. Almost feels more like I am settling down to drink some hot cocoa on this very windy cold night. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate with a slight burnt quality to it. The body was medium with a sweet, yet burnt aspect to the finish. The warming effect of the alcohol present is in the background. A very nice sipping beer for a cold night.","Wildman","Dec 23, 2007"
4.55,6.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Served at cellar temperature, into a Stone snifter, from a twenty-two ounce brown bottle. Poured a thick, spent motor oil black, that not a single ray of light could pass through. You could see the thickness in the pour. Just about two fingers of thick, creamy, coffee brown head formed right up to the top of the glass. Head settled a bit on the quick side, into a pillowy gob in the center of the glass. Some thin soapy lace was left behind. Smell was almost that of a mug of hot cocoa. Nice thick, rich, chocolate chip cookie aromas, with again more thick chocolate. Taste was much the same. Tons of thick, creamy, Belgian chocolate, roasted/toasted malts, and a tiny bit of hop bitterness in the background. Finishes a bit warm with yet another blast of chocolate. Mouthfeel was thick, very chewey, velvety, and full bodied. Very little carbonation made this rather easy drinking despite the 11% ABV. Southern Tier does it again!","jaxon53","Dec 22, 2007"
5,17.4,5,5,5,5,5,"The sweetness/stregth of the imperial stout works perfectly and seemlessly with the chocolate. Smooth -- neither alcoholly nor thin -- but full flavored chocolate. yum.

4.43,4,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Rich black color with a good sized tan colored head. Chocolate/malt aroma. Taste is incredibly rich; roasted malt flavor, with chocolate and a little bit of alcohol. Great warming experience with each sip. The mouthfeel is smooth, and relatively thick in a comforting way. A great sipping drink on a cold December night. My first time trying a Southern Tier offering; I can't wait to sample the rest of the line.","medic25","Dec 21, 2007"
4.97,16.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Southern Tier has done it again, but even better. The black water series is a completely amazing line-up. This stout pours black with a very minimal brown head. The smell is simply amazing I don't want to take my nose away. Tootsie rolls, tootsie rolls, tootsie rolls. What else can I say. Taste is amazing as well, sweet chocotate bomb, as it warms, you can taste a nice earthy chicory bitterness at the front of your tongue, and a pleasant mild hop twitch at the back ofyour tongue. The mouthfeel is great as well, little carbonation with a nice thickness. Drinkability is amazing if you count how easy this is to drink, and disregard the fact that it's an 11 abv.

4.67,9.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a complete midnight black which yields a one finger tan colored head that quickly dies down to a few big bubbles. Stickiness is mediocre, some spotty lacing. Smell is of Hershey's Milk Chocolate with almonds and a nice malty backbone. Tootsie Roll sweetness as with a caramel presence in the nose as well. I just can't get enough of the aroma with this one. Definitely a better scent than the Oat. The minimal alcohol warmth prevents this from a 5 in smell. Taste is like no other. Big Chocolate Tootsie Pop flavor up front with a roasted barley presence. Sweet caramel coffee flavor makes itself known as well. How is this 11%? No alcohol flavor on the tongue. Medium to full body with a heavy rich texture. Carbonation is very subtle but enjoyable. Scary how good this beer is. Southern Tier is becoming a big player in the Extreme Beer revolution, keep up the good work guys. Definitely going to see what some age does to this one.","BeerTruth","Dec 20, 2007"

4.58,7.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a dark black color that looks so deep and rich, not thick, but a little runny. A thick foamy tan layer of head sits at first pour, then slowly decides to die down, and only leave a trace of lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is of roasted malt with a hint of licorice and milky sweet chocolate. Taste is rich with toffee, creamy chocolate, and a slim dried fruit taste. This one is really rich with a creamy mouthfeeling.","genog","Dec 14, 2007"
4.46,4.7,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Southern Tier must like their stouts, as this is their third large one in a relatively short period of time. Pours a viscous black color, with very little heading. Aroma is downright intoxicating. It smells just like a tootsie roll, with rich chocolate throughout. Taste, as expected has more chocolate, however it takes on more of a dry milk chocolate, with a slight bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick, as it coats the palate completely. There is also a lingering aftertaste that one is not soon to forget. As for drinkability, this is a beer to sip and savor. Perfect for pairing with dessert, or for that matter having it for dessert. Simply put, Southern Tier are brewing on a different level than many others. This is the best chocolate stout I have ever tasted.","jamie2dope","Dec 14, 2007"
