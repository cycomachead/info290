4.61,3.1,4.75,5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours beautiful. Nice creamed coffee color head that stays around for a good while before dissipating to a nice sticky lace. Initial smell and you can really pick up the aromas that the quality of the Elijah Craig barrel gives. At first glance it appears as it would be thicker on the mouthful than it is but that said, the non-syrupy feel actually works perfectly with the quality of the bourbon as it allows the flavors to come through without the viscosity getting in the way. There's a great balance between the slight sweetness of a barrel aged stout and the dark, toasty flavors of dark chocolate, coffee and oak tannins from the barrel.  Very smooth. Overall this is very well done and worthy of the praise they receive. Definitely worth the price to try at least once.","mj81","Dec 25, 2014"

I actually preferred the four roses to this one. My problem is that it just has way too much of a caramel note to it from the whiskey barrel. Too sweet, and to cloying- like caramel corn. That just makes the beer too heavy and one dimensional for me. I'm still enjoying it, but I wouldn't buy it again.","Georgiabeer","Jun 23, 2014"

Body is full with nice oily and creamy texture with good carbonation with alcohol not that apparent in this version.","Phyl21ca","Feb 14, 2014"
4.18,-6.5,5,4.5,4,4,4,"O - How this sells is beyond me. Such a ripoff. I was hoping this highly rated version would be good. Incorrect. BCBS destroys this on every level at half the cost (if your store marks it up) or 1/3 the cost at reasonable prices. Drinking this makes no sense. It's a decent tick, but that's it.

Maybe it's just the mystery of what a 30 dollar beer really tastes like, but I had to get this out of my system to be satisfied. And in addition, I could probably never get an elijah craig barrel to age an imperial stout in, and that's assuming I could make an imperial stout this good in the first place, which I haven't had the patience to do yet. I wouldn't buy it again, but I'm glad I got it to try just once.","ISmith87","Feb 09, 2014"

Leaves tremendous lacing after each sip. Nose is subtle at first but then breathe in once more and oh my! Chocolate and the slightest back hints of bourbon. Other stouty flavors abound as well. Nice! Taste is superb. Not heavy chocolate in the finish but just thin malty sweet goodness that lasts on the tongue. The bourbon flavor creeps in the back end quite nicely as well.

I heard the EC 12 year was one of the best eclipses so I dropped an unseemly amount of money for a bomber ($24). I had this feeling all along it wasn't going to be worth the money since Parabola is only $15 and I was proven right. Dark black beer, super healthy head. Aroma is mild bourbon, and then I get notes of honey, not bad. Flavor was mostly bourbon, wood, more booze, touch of honey. I was really hoping for some chocolate or vanilla or coconut flavors but I got none. I suspected this beer was overpriced and now I feel vindicated. Caveat emptor. I sort of wish I had just bought two bottles of older viscosity instead. :(","ArrogantB","May 21, 2013"

Scent is heavy with the barrel characteristics...vanilla and oak. Some dark fruit aromas...plum and subtle fig. The bourbon is just so smooth in the aroma. Nose is VERY inviting. Taste is boozier than expected. I don't remember the 20-year being this boozy...but delicious nonetheless. Sweet bourbon booze with vanilla and toffee flavors. A bit of coconut as well. Some plum and raisin flavors with a ton of oak and chocolate...dark chocolate. Even though this is one of the "hotter" variants, it is up there for most complex of the Eclipses. Great flavors in this one. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and warming. Drinkability is surprisingly high. Overall, I love this beer.

The aroma coming out of my glass is roasty, chocolate, caramel and coffee wrapped in a subtle but evident barrel treatment of vanilla, and sweet bourbon whiskey. The flavor starts off sweet and malty with lots of roast, brown sugar, and chocolate. The barrel notes rush in with vanilla, whiskey, light wood to remind us that this is no ordinary stout. Lingering roasty whiskey with a touch of ethanol burn lasts long after every sip. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy creamy mouthfeel. Nice stout, the bourbon adds a nice sweetness that really compliments this version.","johnnnniee","Jan 20, 2013"

Had you never had a beer with honey as an ingredient you wouldn't know, but if you have then it is clear honey is present here and a truly brilliant addition to a stout.

The taste of this beer was very good, the flavors of some chocolate and vanilla with the warmth of the bourbon. The sweetness of the honey and the roasted malts balance out nicely along with the bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side but still not as heavy as some imperial stouts. There is a subtle creaminess to the beer also which is really nice. The carbonation is low but has just enough to liven up the brew.

4.12,-7.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This one was a part of cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by cmrillo at his own party! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a dark reddish brown with a half finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, wood, vanilla, caramel, and sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. After having the 18 year old version right before this one it was quite easy to pick out the differences. This one had a caramel note hinting around in it which was nice but not awesome. It did have quite an excellent smell going on with it that was rather inviting. Whether you are trying the 12 or the 18, you really can’t go wrong.","thagr81us","Jul 10, 2012"

The recapped bottle sat in the fridge overnight, but I still got a decent wispy mocha head from an aggressive pour. Nose of bourbon, cherry vanilla ice cream, and rich chocolate. Taste confirmed that this beer was still fine even after being open for hours. Dark roasty malts, big taste of barrel wood, boozy bourbon kick, notes of mingling vanilla and chocolate coming in mid-palate, roasty bitterness in the finish. Any dark fruit notes that may exist are distant and overpowered by the bourbon. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, smooth, full body, some alcohol heat, if there was much carbonation, at least it mellowed out by the time I drank it. Very nice overall.

Lots of barrel flavors and a good showing by the base beer lead to a very tasty brew in the end.

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, wood, and a strong bourbon aroma. Taste is pretty much the same. The bourbon from the 12 year Elijah Craig is very nice and still packs a punch. There is a slight roasty bitterness and a somewhat strong alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barrel aged stout with a more in your face bourbon presence versus the 18 year Elijah Craig version. On of my favorites for the night.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 17, 2011"
4.78,6.9,3,5,5,5,4.5,"This was taster number 2. The appearance is nothing special, dark black, no head to speak of, but looks a bit syrupy. The smell really jumps out at you. It smells very sweet, boozy, bourbon and vanilla. The smell is great but it did make me a bit concerned that the beer would be oversweet. Not a problem though. The beer is sweet, but not overly so, and a lot of the booze in the nose is gone in the taste. Vanilla, coffee, bourbon and chocolate dominate the flavor. Very little roastyness, which I really like in a stout. The feel is outstanding. Low carbonation, and very smooth and syrupy. Coats the mouth and the flavor lasts. Finish lingers but is not dry. Although it's a sipper, the glass was gone before I even realized it. And the alcohol is surprisingly low considering the flavor...this is practically sessionable as imperial stouts go. Really really good stuff, by far the best of the four Eclipses I had last night.","rxdrewthejew","Dec 17, 2011"

Big, sweet aromas of dark roasted malt, brownie batter, and caramel, vanilla, and oak from the Bourbon barrels. Taste is similar to the nose, tons of dark chocolate, malt, and high-quality Bourbon character. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, the Bourbon has none of that "fiery" quality and is so nicely integrated into the beer.

The taste of this beer, however, is a huge winner. Honey, cocoa, chocolate, fudge, roast, bourbon, vanilla, oak, char all combine seemlessly to provide a decadent and yet somehow light and easy drinking (for the style), perfectly balanced barrel aged imperial stout. Once again, the base beer is a ridiculous palette to paint barrel aging on and this is the best one that I have had to date (have not had PvW yet). Mouthfeel is very good - reasonable carbonation and a good body, especially considering the low ABV. This is just fantastic and worth seeking out. The only ding for me is a less than spectacular nose.","seeswo","May 15, 2011"

3.95,-11.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"'09 Elijah Craig - 1yr old. jet black, thin large-bubbled head is coaxed with a vigorous pour but remains. Nose at first shows a dusty, oxidized malt, some unsweet bourbon, and a light soy. Reminds of aged 7000 without as much of the robust malt. Flavor is hotter up front, a thin but delicate body reminds of a nice rum-candy with warmth on the mid-palate, with some wood and cocoa through the lengthy finish, dry finish. Body and malt profile are a bit washed out but also chewy and overly sweet, some unfermented sugars remaining amidst near-balance. Still, I personally find the light body and lack of strong malt to be a trend growing too common from stout experimenters like CCB, Bruery, and now 50-50. And yet there is a ton of bourbon in this, which I've hardly mentioned, and I think this is because the bourbon blends so well with the base beer flavors.","MrChopin","Dec 28, 2010"

4.62,3.4,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"My only complaint is that they supposedly didn't blend the barrels, so you could potentially have massive bottle variation in this beer. That's very disappointing to hear. However, I've had 6 bottles of this so far, and each one has been amazing (yet slightly different)...","Arbitrator","Apr 06, 2010"
4.05,-9.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"It smelled pretty similar to the Heaven Hill Rye with a little bit more roasted flavors and a light bourbon nose. It tasted a bit more roasted, more bitter with espresso & toffee notes. It has a nice carbonation to it- stronger than the heaven Hill but you can taste and feel the alcohol more in this one.","femALEist","Mar 25, 2010"
4.5,0.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The mouthfeel is silky and creamy, with a really nice upper low level of carbonation. There's a little astringency and there's a drying woody quality. Overall, this is a top notch bourbon Imperial Stout.","HopHead84","Mar 22, 2010"
4.55,1.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"The palate opens with just a beautiful bourbon barrel character; there's caramel, vanilla and of course, a moderately boozy bourbon bite. Behind this is milk chocolate, a moderate coffee character and a very pleasant roast character. A little licorice is appears before the finish that's an excellent balance of roasty bitterness, sweet caramel and vanilla and booze. The mouthfeel is quite mindblowing, medium to full in body with a soft and gentle carbonation, and the finish is just exceptional.The balance between the barrel sweetness and the roasted bitterness character of the base beer makes this one of the better imperial stouts I've had in recent memory, this is immensely drinkable.","DefenCorps","Mar 20, 2010"
4.87,8.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"What an awesome beer! The bourbon just adds complexity and warmth to a great backbone. Tons of malty sweetness, chocolate, roasted barley...just totally sweet, but not overkill or overwhelming. Full body, creamy, and semi-thick, yet excelent drinkability. Carbonation is perfect for this beer. Overall...and again, what an awesome beer!","ShadesOfGray","Mar 13, 2010"
4.42,-1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a pitch black color with a 1/4" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a very nice Imperial stout aroma; warm, bitter black malts, soft chocolate character, excellent oak contribution. It seems pretty earthy up front with loads of oak. I can't get enough of this aroma; quite intoxicating. The taste is great as well. It has a very smooth chocolate malt flavor with a mild black malt earthiness and oak character. The aroma indicated otherwise, but this is a nice surprise. It goes down sweet with a very nice chocolate character and finishes with some subtle black malt notes and a mild oak feel. It's not overly oaky. In fact, it's noticeable, but it's just another element in a very complex and highly drinkable beer . The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a killer IS. I'd like to kick back and sip on this one for a while, but I guess I'll just enjoy the four ounce pour in my glass.","WesWes","Mar 04, 2010"

4.7,5.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"It's equally bourbon-forward on the tongue, opening with flavors of maple syrup, dark fruit, vanilla and honey. The mid-palate brings out a balancing roastiness, hints of licorice and burnt toast. The body is medium-full and creamy, though not especially viscous or oily. The finish is bittersweet and hot, like a liqueur-filled chocolate.","largadeer","Jan 25, 2010"
