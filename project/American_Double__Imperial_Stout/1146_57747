The odor is powerful, with notes of coffee, sweet chocolate, toffee, vanilla, dried fruits, plum, raisin, bourbon, rich, whiskey, woods, slight resin, earthy.  The taste is velvety, chocolate, bourbon, woods up front.  Then very fruity, fig, dates, raisin.  Very coffee towards the back as well as dry woods.  Barely any bitterness at all, very easy drinking.","Sandalwood","Feb 19, 2015"

Poured thick, with an excellent aroma of coffee and a hint of chocolate and fruit. Great taste, and loved the carbonated feel, the strength of the taste and alcohol. Strong, but easy to drink. Not as bitter as the standard stout, I will definitely seek out this version, and I look forward to trying others in this great line of beers! Well done Goose Island!!!","dukeandduke","Feb 15, 2015"

The Coffee Stout lives up to all the hype for me. It has a better balance overall than the regular BCBS (which I like as well). I like that the coffee taste does not overpower, it seems to offset some of the sweetness of the regular BCBS. Highly recommend!","tjcapture","0"

I do feel as if the coffee flavor had faded a bit but the taste was still a very smooth, sweet malt, dark fruit,toffee,molasses, and a hint of milk chocolate. No heat and a little oily but very enjoyable. The taste of this was very similar to Parabola. Love this and need to find more.","dutesanch","Jan 17, 2015"

I had this alongside Abraxas and Berserker, as part of their Strong Ale Fest, and it was interesting to compare these three Imperial Stouts.  At first taste, the BCBCS seemed a little in the shadow of the other two beers, both of which have quite a few more strong flavors competing for your attention.  But over a forty-five minute time drinking all three beers, BCBCS really came to the fore.  It's so smooth, so perfectly balanced.  It's just the right combination of an incredible stout, with coffee, vanilla, and whisky flavors all blended together harmoniously.   It's got a quiet intensity and great depth.  At the end, my wife and I both agreed that it was our favorite among these three exceptional stouts.","VashonGuy","Jan 15, 2015"

This beer takes the extremes of the beer world and mashes them together. Imagine a cross between the sweetness and creaminess of a really good milk stout with the viscosity and complexity of a Russian imperial stout. That is BCBCS. Flavor was deep, sweet, rich, oaky bourbon, tons of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Perhaps there was a hint of amaretto too. Incredibly complex. The texture was oily, thick, and barely carbonated. I split a 12oz bottle with 3 friends and it was incredibly satisfying. I could have drank a little more, but the full bottle would have been too much for me. I need more of this stuff.","yannimou","Jan 09, 2015"

The Bourbon is big in this, without getting too boozy at any point, while producing a pleasant, oaken warmth with vanilla notes in it, complimenting to the slightly bitter coffee, as well as the scorched, earthy malts and sweet milk chocolate. The coffee becomes visible on the palate, paired with slick caramel and cocoa nibs, while a wooden earthiness adds to the subtle coffee sting, resulting from the harmonious, convenient integrated Bourbon. Finishes with sweeter toffee, as well as molasses and hints of coffee, while smooth, slightly sweeter milk chocolate represents the foundation of this beer.","aleigator","0"

Aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, bourbon, chocolate and light coffee. Flavor is well melded lightly sweet toasted malt, dark chocolate, bourbon and latte coffee. Finish is coffee, chocolate and a bit of bourbon burn. Heavy bodied with a pleasant creaminess. My first of the many variants of the original BCBS, which has always been a favorite. The coffee is blended well with the other flavors and adds a surprisingly smooth new dimension. Like the base version, a world class imerial stout. I'd buy this again, but will never spend the time or gas required to get a single bottle of this. Delicious but too hard to find.","LiquidAmber","Beers"

Cocoa and mild caramel undertones. Taste is coffee, tobacco, cocoa but evena little vanilla on the back end. Boozy heat gives the viscose nature of the coffee a break.. Ultimately I'd say it's all its hyped up to be flavor wise, although I feel like this shouldnt be so hard to get..","fgmiele","Beers"

4.7,0.2,,,,,,"Almost black in color with a dark tan head that quickly disappears to leave just a small amount of lacing.  Big coffee and roasted malt with sweet bourbon and chocolate in the smell.  Taste matches the smell, roasted malt and espresso and chocolate with a bourbon finish.  Full body, silky smooth, medium carbonation.  Excellent beer, so smooth for such a high ABV.","ksimons","Sep 14, 2014"

4.25,-9.4,,,,,,"Overall:  I liked the brew.  In the class of high-alcohol Imperial Stouts (well, I guess there really aren't any low-alcohol Imperial Stouts), it is certainly a stand-out.  Nice complex flavor and the coffee notes were just about right.  Good finish; the product is well-rounded.  Definitely a beer to sip for special occasions, and not something I'd put on a "go to" list, even if it was easier to find.  Despite this site's notes about smoking and tasting, I fired up a "1990 Vintage" Rocky Patel for the last third of my glass.  The beer holds up well to a good cigar, which in my experience is unusual.","Veeblefetzer","Aug 30, 2014"

The heft and the heat play so well with all of these flavors, and the bourbon and oak seems to accentuate it all. Pick up a bottle if you come across one, you will not be disappointed.

4.85,3.4,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"2013 Edition: It poured a deep brown to black with a slight to no tan head. The aroma hit me straight out of the bottle of coffee, heavy stout and bourbon. The taste was otherworldly. A perfect blend of the base stout that exuded bittersweet chocolate and a deep roasty flavor with the coffee and the bourbon barrel characteristics. As it warmed the bourbon booziness came out as well as a stronger coffee tone that was akin to espresso. Hints of vanilla and charred oak emerged and really capped off a world class beer.","brurevu","Jun 26, 2014"

4.97,6,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Bottle date 11/15/13. Pours pitch black with a 1/2 finger caramel-colored head that dissipates quickly. Nose is coffee spiciness/bitterness combined with sweetness from the base beer. Just a phenomenal nose that evokes the finest coffee liqueur imaginable. Taste is sweetness & coffee beany up front. Spiciness all around, particularly toward the back of the mouth. Oak in the mix too, of course. The finish alone has more complexity than the entire experience of most beers: coffee spice, bitterness, sweetness reminiscent of maple and molasses, oak. So many flavors that fit together so well. Mouthfeel is a thick, almost syrupy consistency. Well-carbonated. Overall it's a phenomenal beer that never fails to impress, year after year. Regular Bourbon County Stout is awesome, and it's hard to believe anything could improve upon it. But that's exactly what coffee does: substantially improves upon a near perfect beer.","foobula","Jun 02, 2014"

While none of the Bourbon County beers would be noted for their subtlety, I was surprised at how much the coffee flavors were beaten into submission by the other huge flavors here. NOTE: Had the '13 version a few days later from the 12 oz. bottle. While substantially the same experience, the coffee was more noticeable from the beginning, the bourbon was more integrated, and was on the whole a better drink.

Slight brown head with very little retention. Intense coffee in the aroma. You can easily pickup the strength of the alcohol in the aroma, strong bourbon, hints of vanilla, and tobacco. The coffee is up front as I was hoping for. Still very sweet but a bit toned down from BCBS, which is a huge positive for my taste, just the right amount to round out the flavors of anise, vanilla, oak, and raisin that dance and marry very poignantly.  Serious viscosity here with very little carbonation, you can almost chew on this beer. Was not disappointed in my first BCBS variant!","Phigg1102","Apr 20, 2014"

The nose is strong and mouthwatering and is dominated both by rich malt and boozy bourbon with notes of chocolate, espresso, vanilla, toffee and nutty oak. On the palate is big bourbon and malty toffee/caramel sweetness, dark chocolate and loads of coffee/espresso. The mouthfeel is very round, smooth, velvety and huge on the palate.

A bit foamy at first, but the head is gone, never to be seen again, after about 5 minutes. Looks oily and viscous. The nose is incredible: roasted espresso beans that have been soaked in bourbon. Heavy amounts of roast, espresso, and sweet bourbon vanilla. My god. Taste follows the nose, then hammers it out of the park: equal parts iced espresso and bourbon. Both flavors are there, and neither overpowers the other: complementary. Am I drinking a bourbon-spiked espresso, or a bourbon with a shot of espresso in it? It's both of those things, and something else entirely. The booze is definitely there, warming me up but not knocking me out. Lovely vanilla marshmallows round out each sip. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and smooth. So luscious and decadent. Simply astonishing: the balance between the roast coffee, the heavy bourbon, and the luscious mouthfeel is out of this world. The finest beer I've ever had. I've got one BCBCS left, and I'll be enjoying it on my wedding night. It's that kind of beer. Cheers!","blankenhoney","Mar 30, 2014"

5,6.6,5,5,5,5,5,"12 oz bottle. I'd just missed this beer so many times that I couldn't contain myself when I got it. Anyway, this pours a pitch black color, barely any head or carbonation. The smell is strong with chocolate, coffee, and a good amount of booze. The taste brings all of the flavors together - starts with coffee and chocolate and finishes with vanilla and oak. No flavor really dominates, which makes this really smooth and drinkable. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers ever. It's a truly magnificent creation","mc4z","Mar 10, 2014"

4.32,-7.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"2100th review! 12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/15/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense dark tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BA imperial coffee stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 07, 2014"
4.58,-2.3,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Edit: had 2014 and 2013 back to back in a snifter on 1/3/15.. Both poured black as night, with limited head and light lacing. Smell was dominated by dark fruit, vanilla, coffee, and dark chocolate. Taste followed suit. 2014 had more raisans, plums, and dark chocolate, while 2013 was silmilar, but had more coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Definitely a great beer. I liked the fresh version a little more though both were great.","OneEye78","Mar 07, 2014"

I'm not hating on this beer.. It's probably the best Bourbon beer I had.. But I'm an IPA, Double IPA, Double Pilsner type of guy.. Again great beer BUT come on..

Nevertheless, while it contains a little less heat and barrel sweetness overall, I daresay that's the main reason that I enjoy BCBS to begin with. Still, any self-respecting beer geek would be crazy to not seek this out - it's by far one of the most memorable coffee infused stouts I've ever had. This vintage would not benefit with age, in my view. It will get progressively earthy and lose its coffee profile. Without any of the spiciness, it won't be as thrilling. I'm absolutely curious how the 2012 vintage is drinking right now - will post an update as soon as I get around to trying it!","magictacosinus","Feb 09, 2014"

4.68,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of a strong barrel aged Stout, the coffee had a really nice flavor to it and it for sure lived up to the name of Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout and I feel that the Coffee was showcased in the beer, it helped the beer in some ways, but it also hurt it in other ways. This beer had nice drinkability, it's a sipper, but not as much BCBS, it's fairly smooth, rich, a little sticky, a little filling, lightly boozy and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I might contemplate drinking two of these, but just like BCBS one might be the perfect amount for me, and it males for a great beer to a sip on a cold winter morning. What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, I think the coffee caused it to not be as sticky as BCBS and I really liked that. What I liked the least about this beer was that the coffee was just a little too dominating in the taste, if it was dialed back a notch or two I think it would allow some more of those chocolate and bourbon flavors to come through while enhancing the pretty light coffee flavors that BCBS has, I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I haven't seen BCBS around here so I doubt I will see the variants, my friend had to get this one shipped to him from North Dakota. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Coffee Stouts, especially if your a big fan of KBS. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, i do think it could be balanced just a little better,but other than that I think it's pretty close to being world class and I might even like it a little more than KBS, I would have to have the two side by side to figure it out. BCBS is still my favorite of the series so far, but this one came fairly close. Great job guys, this was another great beer and I'll be on the look out for the other variants, keep up the kick ass work.","StoutHunter","Feb 03, 2014"

The aroma is stellar, the taste is what you would expect and more from a world class coffee stout; full, rich, coffee/cocoa flavors mixed with vanilla and leaving the taster wanting more.
