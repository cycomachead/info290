Price is a little steep but this will not disappoint.","Catracho5","Mar 29, 2015"

4.26,-2.1,5,4.5,4.25,3.25,4.25,"Guest tap at FFF poured into snifter. Appearance is deep brown with no translucent edges. A small tan head forms, then collapses to a thin remnant that lasts the session - which took a while. This was a textbook sipper. The aroma is barrel-forward: coconut, charred oak, vanilla, brown sugar, and booze. Below that are coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and ripe plum. Taste is lead by toasted coconut and the barrel notes - all washed in alcohol. Moderate sweetness comes next in the form of vanilla, molasses, and chocolate. Some bitter licorice and oak flavors come late. Full bodied, thick, oily, and chewy texture, minimal carbonation, long sweet boozy finish.","SierraFlight","Beers"

4.2,-3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"375 ml bottle into snifter, vintage 2013A bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing fairly quickly. Some slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, raisin, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and roast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, raisin, prune, and roast/oak earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness/spicy alcohol on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged imperial stout. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 07, 2014"

The usual roasted malts, with vanilla, coffee, sweet bread, and chocolate. The taste was heavy and had a cloying sweetness. I didn't taste much bourbon, I wish there was more...For me there was a good amount of prune and raisin taste near the backend of each drink. The mouthfeel was not memorable, not bad, just nothing special. I will say this stout was viscous and syrupy. This was nice to try. I likely would not seek it out again, but would give it another go if it was immediately available.","mabermud","Jun 30, 2014"

It dials back the crazy, super-high alcohol, noticeable oak/barrel/spirit elements of beers like BCBS and BT, but still provides a load of flavor and complexity. It has a bit of an "iron fist in a velvet glove" character. Plenty of concentration and flavor, but not the borderline syrup/high viscosity apparent in other stouts.

Really the biggest difference that I could see was the amount of bourbon character. The newer vintage was much more bourbon-forward, bordering on hot, while the older version was much smoother and more balanced. Getting some age also added some complexity and allowed the malt characteristics to develop into something special. Overall, I liked both of the vintages for what they were and I’m so glad that I got to try them both! Thanks, Jason!","BlackBelt5112203","Jul 25, 2013"

Angel's Share gets beat up by its bigger and stronger and cooler older brother Older Viscosity. It goes down like water with a perfect explosion of bourbon in your mouth balanced out by a smooth and seductive chocolate and cherry flavor that makes you forget your even drinking a beer. Almost none of the alcohol flavor that the nose would suggest. It was truly brewed by masters of their craft. A real accomplishment of brewing. Brew on Port, and don't take any guff from those swine at Lost Abbey. You will always be the cooler older brother","BrotherDylan","Jul 23, 2013"

Some remnants of a stout, with roasty and sweet malt but the barrels come through as soon as it hits your tongue and stays with you into the finish. But the finish is nice in that it has others flavors such as a sweet dark chocolate and woody/earthy qualities. I really enjoy the bourbon barrel notes because they contribute a true depth of flavor without overpowering or being too boozy. The base beer and its flavors are discernable as the beer warms up so I love that you can taste the difference and enjoy the improvements. Super complex when its given time to warm... to cold out of the tap. I wish all bourbon tasted like this. It's a phenomenal beer but an even better barrel-aged stout.","Gatch","May 09, 2013"

The care and passion that has gone into this beer is palpable, and the skill required to so excellently barrel-age an already fine stout is commendable. As a whole the flavors are well developed, finely nuanced, nicely balanced between ash and sugar, bourbon and bread, vanilla and caramel, with only a slightly heavy alcoholic vapor and a strangely average mouthfeel marring the experience. Well worth the price.","jondeelee","Oct 23, 2012"

I enjoyed it more and it got more interesting as it warmed up. I prefer a little sweeter stouts but I must say this is a great, great beer. This is one that should be cellared for some years. I can't believe how much it changed with some time. A must try for BA stout lovers, but I must say it still had that Barley Wine taste in it.","Altenor","Beers"

Boy am I glad I did. I might even pick up more if I still can. This beer is wonderful fresh and I think it will age wonderfully as well. Some people, especially those who don't like Bourbon, might be turned off by this when it's relatively fresh. If you do like Bourbon and you like Stouts, this one is definitely worth a try. If you don't like Bourbon but you can still appreciate Barrel aging, this one might be worth your time also. Very nice slow sipper.","matttttYCE","Aug 13, 2012"

Flavors are rich and oaky, with a warming, boozey undertone and earthy blending with date fruitiness. Licorice and smokey undertones, with a smooth richness and umami.

I'm not sure what vintage this is because the printing on the label is smudged, but I think it looks like it's either a 2010 or 2011 bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a small tan head that fizzled away quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and boozy, it smells like dark fruit, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, and some chocolate. I think the taste is the same as the aroma, and all the flavors mesh well and none of them overpower the other ones. This beer is definitely one of the sweeter ones I've had lately. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's oily and coating with a moderate level of carbonation. At $16.99 a bottle I wouldn't buy it very often, but I think it's a very good brew.","bluejacket74","Nov 23, 2011"

Smells quite strong, but more along the lines of warm and inviting vs. straight boozy. Modest carbonation seems a perfect match for the slippery, coating body. The barrel-aging has coaxed out pleasant buttery and vanilla flavors and the bourbon is ever present but never overpowering. Roasted malt again seems to be an afterthought, and it's pretty sweet stuff; I reckon half a bottle would be plenty. Lots of complex dark fruit and multilayered chocolate, though.

4.25,-2.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours like an engine oil (and that's a very beautiful sight). No head. Very dark brown in color - almost completely black. Smells a lot like bourbon, but not too overpowering. A bit of burned caramel in the smell. "Viscosity" is a very fitting name. I find this ale to be quite thick. First sip was very powerful. It hit me with everything it had and for a moment I thought I was done. But the more I sip it, the more I come around. Alcohol is not apparent, but it still feels like a very strong beer. Bourbon up front, but what I find absolutely enjoyable is the sweet, chocolatey aftertaste. That is a fine note that after all makes it for a nice, smooth mouthfeel. Generally, this is not my style (not a huge fan of stouts and barleywines and even less of a fan of bourbon), but once in a while it just hits the spot. By the way, I'm tasting the 2009 vintage.","ikats","Sep 07, 2011"

3.59,-17.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: So here's the thing, I can drink this, and would say it's a decent beer. I would argue it is overpriced compared to similar beers. The barrels really come through stronger than I prefer, but they are exactly that - barrels previously having held alcohol. Would I drink again? Absolutely. Will I purchase another bottle?

By God, this beer has taught me not only enjoyability without the pang of the pop, but beer can still be simply world class. Lost Abbey may be the forerunner in a new breed of beer.

Offering bourbon as a detail on the edifice not the foundation, it is perhaps the most refined such beer I've come across. Worth every penny.","biegaman","Jul 09, 2011"

The flavors all blend together so well. Vanilla is lingering on the tongue after each sip. Mouthfeel is thick and engine-oliy. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is fantastic, to say the lease.

Honestly, seems like another drop in the bucket of barrel aged stouts-- booziness, dark fruits, spices, chocolate, coffee; as much as I love them I feel myself getting bored. Looking at it without the boredom, it has pour mouthfeel, seems too hot and doesn't mask the alcohol very well, and while aging might mellow it I can only see it becoming a BCBS at best, which alone isn't that high of a bar.

I damn near love Old Viscosity, but it was hard to find any of it in the nose or the taste. The bourbon was too powerful to allow that to occur. Tomme should be ashamed of himself for releasing this to the public, especially given the gaudy price. I should also note that I absolutely loved Triple Bock.

It's odd, but it works for me, this one came out with a beautifully balanced and complex flavor--showcasing molasses, lightly roasted malt, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Chocolate notes make a strong play too, which I'm not sure I expected. Velvety mouthfeel--pillowy and creamy. This one went away far too quickly, I loved every bit of it.

The taste is more straight-forwardly beer, with notes of roasted malts (lighter than in the smell), chocolate, oak, whiskey, vanilla, and a drop or two of what seems to be honey. The body is pretty hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout, though I am unsure whether or not it really lives up to the hype. Either way, it's pretty damn tasty, but a bit much for a regular sipper.","TMoney2591","Oct 20, 2010"
4.15,-4.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I went to actually try this beer on tap, for not nearly as much as I would be paying for it in a bottle. This pours the absence of light with a light brown finger of foam on the surface. The aroma is strong. It resembles a port wine, there is bourbon, plum, cherry, chocolate and lots of oak on the nose. The taste is mainly of oak juice, if that even exists, at the end there is a bit of red grape to give it more of a deep red wine taste. There are the traditional coffee, chocolate notes as well as the over powering bourbon flavor. This is a viscous liquid as the title would have given it, but due to the astringency of the liquor I must say it's only rated as good not great. It is a sipper, but still one fine drinking beer. I say get it if the price is right.","Vdubb86","Beers"

This beer explodes upon the palate. Lots of levels here - initially the bourbon and oak, vanilla, rich and full, and a delicious array of roasty malt goodness. I've had this beer several times now and I always get a phantom flavor of blueberry pie. Dunno what it is but I love it.

Smell is mostly a bit of the average roasted malt you'd expect of a stout, a bit of vanilla and bourbon coming through as well. Taste is huge and complex. Has a big bourbon/cocoa element that is great especially in the aftertaste. Roasted malts, milk chocolate also apparent. A bit of dark fruit and sweetness in there somewhat as well. My palate was a little weary at this point I think. A little boozy but not too bad considering the alcohol content. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Drinkability is decent for 12%, but a big price tag here that I'm not sure is worth the quality and the booze taste is a bit much. 1 glass was definitely enough. Worth trying just for the great bourbon/cocoa element. Definitely the highlight of Port's catalog for me so far.","Chico1985","Mar 28, 2010"

The smell is mostly a bourbony alcohol with some hints of maltiness and chocolate powder. The taste is about the same, I actually find it pretty bland. It's a slightly complex but dull stout covered in oak barrel. Mouthfeel is not as thick as the bottle's copy would have you believe, in fact it was nothing compared to say, Souther Tier's Choklat.

This time, I got a glass to settle my stomach from a night of sours at Toronado's RR -tion night (a 16 oz pour for $6 - bless that bar). This beer pulls off thick and rich better than any other beer that I've tried. The bourbon note is big and strong, but it doesn't get in the way of the underlying stout. In fact, I find the oaky bourbon flavor balances the beer quite nicely. The beer is rich with coffee, cocoa, prunes and brown sugar, yet it's not sticky or cloying. It's definitely a slow sipper.

Poured one shade shy of black with just a cluster of clear bubbles that gathered around the edges, with a soapy swirl cutting a swath down the middle. No lacing on this one. Nose is malty, bourbon, vanilla, mocha and booze - smells a little hot. Taste consistent with nose; however, bourbon quality is slightly diminished and a coffee character comes out, culminating in a boozy, almost ethanol-like finish. Well, as suggested by the cork pop (or lack thereof), carbonation is pretty much non-existent. Consistency is medium-bodied and a bit silky; however, the lack of carbonation makes it all feel pretty thin. Decent, but a bit of a let down. The mouthfeel really kills this for me.

And then, this one falls short of the finish line. And not, like, stumbles, but more like, trips and breaks both of its ankles on its way to a career-ending injury before losing all of its endorsement contracts. The carbonation on this one shoots about half of its glory straight to hell, and more than being upset with Lost Abbey/Port about releasing the product like this, I'm upset at the world for allowing such an otherwise great beer to not reach its full potential.","CrellMoset","Dec 15, 2009"

4.7,8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Enjoyed this one at The Armsby Abbey in Worcester earlier tonight, very awesome place with really good food. Poured into a smaller snifter, as black as oil as one would expect and a half finger dark coffee ice cream colored head. The retention of the head was good but little to no lacing is left behind by it (not sure if it's because of the beer or the glass used). The head is creamy but also has some large bubbles in it. After it dies down it becomes a ring around the top of the beer with some clouds scattered over the whole beer. Smell is what one would expect from a beer like this. Tons of bourbon up front, vanilla in the whiskey, malts and some dark chocolate. A good balance of elements that work well. The taste beats the smell out. A very good blend of many flavors. The two biggest elements in the taste for me were the bourbon and dark chocolate. The whiskey seemed to dominate at first but as I got into the beer more the chocolate took over first place and the whiskey surrounded it. Along with these two I picked up roasted malts, coffee, vanilla and a good dose of alcohol. The alcohol does not take away from the taste but adds an interesting element, which I like in these big stouts. The beer started to taste a lot like Speedway Stout but with bourbon aging added to it as I neared the end of my glass. The mouthfeel is thick but not overly creamy, more of an oily feeling to it which suits this beer pretty well. The very low carbonation here also helps the beer out by allowing the complexity of flavors to blend and not be masked by a carb bite. This beer is hot on the tongue from the alcohol but this is expected with any beer that is 12%, it adds a nice element as well. Drinkability is good. It is not perfect because of the price, the beer was worth it but the prices I hear for bottles is pretty crazy and it was $9 on-tap. I would definitely get this one again to remind me of how bourbon aging can really make a good beer and not just hype one. The other thing about drinkability is the alcohol and bourbon overtaking the beer, this seems inevitable but I don't think I would be sessioning this anyways. I can only hope to try some more of Port's limited stuff in the future.","cbutova","Nov 05, 2009"

I even shook the bottle before opening to see what might happen, and a few bubbles appeared on the surface. But despite that the cork pulled out slow and there was no "pop" sound. I poured vigorously into the glass but only achieved a few bubbles at the glass line. The beer is dark brown/black and opaque as expected, and had no head at all (unfortunately also expected). Despite its appearance this beer smells pretty damn good. The bourbon aroma is STRONG, it smells like a beer/liquor hybrid. Also some chocolate, really good. The taste is just as good, lots of bourbon and mocha and some alcohol flavor too. This seems >12.1% ABV by taste alone... The mouthfeel is poor with almost no carbonation, I'd hoped it would seem cask-like or something.

Pretty nice for a 12% abv beer. Nice melange of bourbon and barrel aromas with enough malt in the background to hold its own. This isn't a hit you over the head beer- the aromas and flavors are remarkably well integrated, and it is remarkably well mannered for the high abv. Lovely balance of barrel notes of vanilla, whiskey, tannic oak; stout notes of some roasty bitterness, a touch of espresso, and nice stiff malt. The bourbon is clean and sweet and goes beatifully with this soft but strong beer. Very smooth with barrel and whisky notes most predominant up front where a nice creaminess manifests.

4.62,6.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste & mouthfeel: It's striking how unlike Old Viscosity this is. The abrasive bitterness and resiny hop attack have been softened by the months in bourbon barrels, replaced with sweet vanilla and caramel flavors. There's still a firm roasty bitterness in the finish, like a piece of charred bread sweetened with blackberry jam, but it never overtakes the bourbon and malt. The mouthfeel is full, almost syrupy, and the low level of carbonation only further contributes to that.

The alcohol, at 12%, is quite apparent, and I think it is drinking a bit hot and would likely get even better with a few years on it.

I actually prefer this to fresh B county, i find it smoother. my god the bourbon and wood are prominent here. The bourbon especially. Vanilla, chocolate vanilla comes to mind. Some slight nutty dark fruitishness in the middle. This is very much an after dinner treat. mouthfeel is...well...viscous. not too thick, not too thin. great. The finish has just the right amount of alcohol heat for a good bourbony stout IMO. Im trying to drink this as slow as possible but it is hard, as it is quite tasty. The bourbon wood has done wonders to change and increase the complexities of this beer. Old viscoz is one of my favorite beers, and this is wildly different and just as if not more enjoyable.

A lot of dark fruits in the nose; raisins, dates, plums, and fig. A fair amount of brownie batter in the nose. A woody scent and sweet vanilla extract as well. Very complex brew to stick your nose into. Wow, coffee ice cream flavor up front that I wasn't expecting at all from the smell. Smokey wood flavor with a lighter than anticipated bourbon sting, but that's fine by me. Smooth alcohol flavor as it goes down that really warms the body. Aftertaste is sweet caramel malt with freshly ground french roast, I love it. Thick and creamy medium to full bodied mouthfeel with a very enjoyable carbonation.

Taste is more dark fruits with some nice bouron oak and dark stroh's 140 rum notes. Hops again, are muted, and the finish is all smooth bourbon/oak with some nice roast and bready deep malt to finish it off.

Carbonation is a little restrained, but will come with time. Bright refined caramel corn flavor, along with toasted marshmallow and hazlenut creams. A very syrupy and rich presentation, but gentrified with the older oaky tones and a vinous quality that lends sophisiticatin to the sometimes brash leading edges.
