Served in a chilled glass, this beer is a bit too sweet for me, I can taste the agave in this. I would bump up the hop profile on this beer. I like blue agave tequila so this beer works for me, and it's pretty cool a big mass production brewer is trying out craft style beers. This beer pairs well with sweet barbecue ribs or Chinese food. This beer also has to be served very cold or it is like a wine cooler. Coors must have reconfigured their canning/bottling production line, I notice no oxidation in any their beers anymore.","Brewsome","Aug 15, 2014"

Light medium body with a not quite smooth texture. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is rather nice in a subtle fashion and well balanced. It begins with biscuit then flows into a subtle agave sweetness. The finish is smooth.","tillmac62","May 01, 2014"

APPEARANCE: copper-gold body with uneven effervescence; thin, off-white head presents no immediate thickness; no tracing = not inviting... AROMA: pungent,, malty; tougher to pick out thee agave--comes across more as a candied apple...PALATE: a bit dry; slight, oily mouthfeel--drinkable but indistinguishable...TASTE: tangy, metallic aftertaste; malty, syrupy sweet; some fruity, lemony wheatgrass too; rather bland, however, like an original Blue Moon that got itself confused at the factory... OVERALL: I feared this review--not interested in slamming tonight--and yet the beer did not repulse as its first summer sampling had--only wet my lips and slightly refreshed my thirst...did the delayed rating weaken its taste? ...","dacrza1","Feb 27, 2014"

Im sure someone out there loves this beer but that someone isn't me. Its appearance, ability to go down easily, and slightly higher abv are its redeeming qualities.

Full body, rich cereal grains, finishes clean with a faint lingering agave sweetness. Pretty bland, drinkable. Slightly tart possibly from the agave, gains a little bit of Pucker like flavor as you keep drinking. I was hoping for more agave flavor, if that's what your looking for you'll be severely let down with a mediocre grainy beer.","jtierney89","Sep 05, 2013"

It tastes nothing like any other Blue Moon product, in fact I can't think of any other beer that it tastes like. It's sweet, too sweet, and not even a good tasting sweet. Leaves an awful aftertaste. I love a good tequila now and then, and others have said it's similar. I didn't get that from this beer at all. It was just not an enjoyable drink. It wasn't awful, I did finish the bottle. In fact, my husband didn't like his, so I finished his too. I usually don't mind a beer a little warm. This was NOT good. Much better cold. I wouldn't buy this again and really don't recommend it unless someone is really into sweet beers.","llevise","Aug 04, 2013"

If there was a more pronounced wheat presence offering some more husk and straw notes, then the sweetness would be a bit more balanced. As it stands it's a bit bland offering only faint notes of agave which are masked by an intense, sugary sweetness. This was nice to try and tick, but I won't be having it again.","tdm168","Jun 25, 2013"

I didn't mind it so much, as long as I got it down when it was ice cold, the warm version of this is brutal. the pour is a pretty clear golden color for a blue moon, copper hues and a short lived half inch of white bubbles. the agave gives it a sweeter smell, unfermented sugars, with that familiar tequila vibe. malts are bigger than they need to be here, too much caramel in the context of the agave sweetness, its one or the other here, not both. still, its only in the finish that the sweetness hits, and its a malty summery sort of brew beforehand, which when ice cold, really isn't too bad. more carbonation would help, or better carbonation retention, and a slightly lighter body would make it a better hot weather beer. I really didn't mind this one though, I think its creative and reasonably well put together for a blue moon.","StonedTrippin","Jun 23, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, and some sweet aromas. Taste is much the same with sugary, grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but is very one dimensional with sweet grain aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 11, 2013"

Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Across the room, I saw Midas and Croesus rubbing their hands together but this was all mine. Nose had more of a lager-like honey sweetness along with a lime-like citrusiness. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium with a very honey-wheat sweet flavor on the tongue. I was reminded of my late Pops' traditional breakfast of Wheaties in drinking this. I think that I will recommend a change since "Fruit/Vegetable Beer" is supposed to go away anyway. Finish was pleasantly dry and refreshing and I could easily see quaffing a few of these during the summer.","woodychandler","Apr 05, 2013"

2.71,-9.7,4.5,3.5,2.5,2,2,"Brilliant clear golden body with a massive white head, forms a thick band of lacing with each sip. Not bad smelling initially some biscuit malts, sharp wheat, and earthy quality. Pretty muted at first, but after a few sips and I let it warm there's the agave nectar, slightly syrupy notes arising. Flavor has more cereal grain, sharp wheat notes, and lingering sweetness that comes off as a simple syrup. I can see how this stuff could get fermented into Tequila, sharp sweet character from the agave additions. I'm not sure that it helps the flavor any. It's actually tooth numbingly sweet, and it doesn't help the overall beer any. I could definitely pass on this the next time, bad idea. I could see that if it was inspired by trips across Mexico. Mouthfeel is pretty cloying the sweetness is just too much ferment and distill this out into a new hybrid Tequila before drinking it. Light to medium boy linger residual sugars are the part I'm having a hard time with, carbonation no complaints in that department. Overall, hard to consume just not an enjoyable flavor profile, that's as constructive as I can be.","WVbeergeek","Jun 05, 2012"

3.28,9.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Gotta give it up to the Blue Moon crew within Coors for continuing to trot out the new and different recipes in their seasonal packs this year. This one pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises light artificial lime (I'm gonna assume this is from the agave nectar), corn syrup, and a touch of what certainly seems like dry wheat. The taste holds notes of sweet and artificial lemon-lime (think almost Sprite-style) drizzled over peppery wheat. However that may sound to you, it tastes a lot better than I would expect. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda syrupy feel. Overall, this concoction turned out to be much less objectionable than I imagined, but it still fails to "pop", to elicit much love. At least it's not out-and-out bad, though...","TMoney2591","0"
