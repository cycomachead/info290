It doesn't leave a whole lot of lacing though. The smell is lemon, banana, and honey. Taste is fairly mild and mostly follows the nose. Mouthfeel is okay with some nice carbonation.

Aromas of lemon, banana, and berries mix with some minty and herbal highlights. Flavors are more malty than you would expect, with a buttery and slightly toffee backbone. The herbs come forward again, this time as a slightly strong highlight. Overall, the flavors are a bit all over the place...they stumble into a lemony, sharp, muddled aftertaste. Slick, slightly oily finish. This was not a good brew, no matter how you look at it.","GarthDanielson","Aug 31, 2012"

Odd for a wheat beer, it seems. The aroma is flour, cereal, and lemon drop. Medium bodied. The malts are cereal and wheaty. Herbal hops. Not that much like claimed hefeweisen as claimed.

2.77,-11.8,3.25,3,2.5,3,2.75,"Pours a hazy golden from the bottle with a small white head. Aroma is hay, wheat, some honey, and very very mild citrus, a bit of yeast. The flavor follows suit with plenty of hay and yeast, but only a brief influence from the citrus. A bit light on the palate in a watered down way, rather than a light carbonated way. This comes off as a little stale in the finish as many wheat beers do. Overall, I'd drink it again if around but would not buy it off a shelf with all the other options.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

It's mildly sweet and has a slight acidic zing. Quite frankly it was better than I was expecting.","MoreThanWine","Feb 14, 2012"

The smell is pretty non-existent and could use more power, but I actually quite liked the taste--it's not very strong as far as wheat goes, but the lemon is obviously natural, it blends nicely with the wheat and there is some exciting spice which I believe they've added to the brew. Hops are earthy and offer a good contrast to the lemon. I was surprised by how winter-y it felt once I was drinking it--a spicy muted summer, exactly what I want when there's a blizzard outside.","lstokes","Jan 20, 2012"

It’s topped off with a nice thick white head, and is very bubbly and frothy but doesn’t last long: there is some mild lacing too. Strong citrus aromas like oranges and lemons come through, but I also pick up some apple and mild wheat. His beer is light bodied and slightly bitter overall, but it is crisp and goes down smooth. Citrus flavors are very present but not much else, there is a slight tart aftertaste when you swallow this beer.

Mouthfeel was relatively full, approaching creamy, with a definite citrus presence, but not a tart one. It was like a Creamsicle, reinforcing my earlier stance on orange, vice lemon. Finish was so much like a Creamsicle that I now wanted one for the first time in years! Yay, summer!","woodychandler","Jul 03, 2011"

The body is on the lighter side, but it is has a decent mouthfeel and is fairly drinkable. The taste of the beer is what you expect from a pale wheat ale- The lemons add an amount of character to it, but it doesn't really do it for me. I think there is almost to much of a lemon flavor for this beer.

Regardless, this stuff pours a clear golden straw topped by a short-lived finger of white foam. The nose comprises chalky wheat, light lemon peel, very light coriander, and a firm touch of banana. Something seems vaguely off, though. Can't quite put my finger on it, but it's not entirely either pleasant or un-. The taste follows kinda closely, replacing the lemon peel with some orange zest and replacing the banana with some rater iron-y hard water. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel.

It does smell like subtle lemons mixed with wheat. Its not like disgusting hit you in the face artificial mikes hard lemonade type of a beer no not at all. This is definitely a beer because that lemon taste and smell mixes in with the hops they use very well.

It finishes with a bread and grassy fragrance. A strong bread and wheat flavor at the front of each taste. A citrus tang, that is not bitter or sour, more like a good lemonade. The taste finishes with a mild grassy bitterness, nothing to overbearing. The carbonation is strong at the front along with a thin, but not watery feel. The carbonation does linger at the backend as the beeralso gains weight, making it quenchable. I am not partial to wheat beers, but this is very easy to drink.

The flavor is tart and citric but it doesn't come across as a very natural flavor. Somewhat spicy and almost medicinal with no actual wheat noticeable. Eh.

The aroma was pale and wheat malts with a mellow but pronounced lemon scent, again seems to be a perfect warm weather beer. The flavor is delicate but does have a slight spiciness/tang, quite good and refreshing. The pale malts lead to an easy drinking brew and the accompanying lemon and hop flavors are nice.

Not much happening in the nose - a hint of citrus, perhaps lemonzest, and a grainy quality. Taste consistent with nose; however a bit more citrus comes out, and a subtle wheat character reveals itself - finish is fairly clean with perhaps some residual lemony flavor and a little bit of sweetness (a la artificial sweetener).

The flavors seems to clash and the lemon was added to cover up some of the odd flavors. Leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. The lemon flavor is actually nice but the rest doesn't do it for me.

I'm not sure that makes sense, but it's hard to describe. It kind of has an acidic drying effect, and as it warms it takes on a surprisingly buttery characteristic.

I agree with some of the other views that it's a bit surprising to find this in a winter mix pack. This is something I'd enjoy by the pool on a hot summer day.

3.25,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"I would have preferred to see a Kölsch style or Blonde Ale, filtered with more of a sweet/sour lemon edge ... not too far off from other beers they brew; they brew a wit, beery-wits, the summer ale and now a lemon version. Is this reactionary to the cloudy beers that have come from the bigger breweries?","Jason","Nov 02, 2009"
2.88,-8.3,3,2.5,3,3,3,"The feel this beer is pretty light. A beer that does not weight your mouth down with too much makes for a pretty good session beer and a good summer beer as well. This is pretty drinkable and is nice on a hot day.","Duhast500","Nov 01, 2009"

2.16,-31.2,4,3,1.5,2,2,"The beer pours an opaque colored haze, nice looking beer and has a good full head that leaves lacing. In the sam adam's tradition, it is a good looking beer. That is where it ends, however! Extremely hard to finish, has oft-kilter flavours, tastes as if lemons were added instead of malted, very unbalanced. Sam Adams cannot make a good Hefe, and I don't know why. Need to fill the holiday classics packs with more Fezzelwig and Holiday Porter, cause those are outstanding. This one is not a good one.","bigdeuce","Oct 31, 2009"

But this is one Sam Adams than can easily be skipped. This stuff makes Leinenkugel's Shandy look good. Take some ordinary beer and add lemon juice and I think you could obtain better results. This was truly shocking, and not in a good way.","thebeerdoctor","Oct 31, 2009"

It has a crisp, pale and wheat malt scent along with a mild lemony zest. The taste is decent. It has a highly drinkable pale wheat flavor with a dry, lemony finish. It has a moderate hefe yeast character. It's light with a nice citrus touch. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey beer. I don't know why it's in the winter collection, but I'd buy this one again.","WesWes","Oct 29, 2009"

3.78,20.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Extremely drinkable, but what's the motive behind this beer? It's rather reminiscent of the brewery's Summer Ale, or a touched-up Sam Adams Hefeweizen. Nothing outstanding or very distinctive, and certainly not really deserving of being inserted into the Winter Classics pack. It's understandable why this wasn't heavily marketed: There's nothing especially "new" about it. A solid beer, no doubt, but a bit boring and released in a less-than-opportune season.","superdedooperboy","Oct 29, 2009"

Why not do a real German style hefeweizen to join the party of Cherry Wheat, Double White, White Ale, DunkelWeizen and Summer. That's alot of wheat beer. Maybe it's time to do a different style, how about an IPA. Pale hazed golden orange hue with a bright white head, leaves behind speckled lacing. Aroma has a biscuit malt character a lot of yeast nuttiness with citrus peels apparent. Not much sweetness or hops going on here. Pretty abrasive with lemon peel zest bitterrness and tart wheat blended with that nasty dry nutty yeast notes. Mouthfeel overall is pretty harsh with the carbonation levels just an unpleasant experience with the lemonpeel left on the palate after each sip. Drinkability is poor this is one that should be skipped and I enjoy most of the Sam Adams brews out there.","WVbeergeek","Oct 23, 2009"
