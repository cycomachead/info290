3.43,-1.7,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Hazy orange, HIGHLY carbonated coming out of the 12 oz bottle but the foam dies off, minimal lacing on the glass. It has a very mild aroma, hints of citrus, honey, coriander which are evident in the taste as well.  The taste is mild, smooth, but the flavor is easily overwhelmed by food.  To me, this is best for refreshment, not to pair with a meal.  Interesting and worth trying as a six pack before going in for a case.","dogma33","Mar 08, 2015"

3.03,-13.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought that it was a pretty average example of an American Pale Wheat Ale, the heavy honey aspect that makes this beer lack the balance that comes with a good American Pale Wheat Ale. This beer had ok drinkability it went down smooth, but the flavor couldn't hold my attention so one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked nice and I thought the color was really good looking. What I liked least about this beer was the heavy honey aspect that seemed out of place in this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have an Oberon, I would tell someone to drink an Oberon instead of this beer, it's a much better example of the style. This was another underwhelming beer for Arcadia, it seems like they can make some pretty good dark beers but I haven't been impressed with most of their lighter beers. I had this beer side by side with Oberon, and Oberon was pretty much better in every aspect, it is much more fitting to drink on a warm summer afternoon in Michigan. I think I may have liked this better before the recipe change, the honey is too dominant, this beer needs another recipe change and they can start with cutting out a lot of that honey, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Apr 24, 2012"

Pours to instant head after a loud release of carbonation upon opening(no gusher though). Eventually turns out to be a hazy and cloudy deep orange color with a dense and fluffy 2-3 finger off white head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some slight bits of lacing cling to the glass. The yeast seems to have clumped up and is floating around in the glass like bits of ground pepper. Aromas of orange peel, lemon, coriander, light pepper, bread, and not much else. Pretty weak aromas without much complexity; but not offensive. Taste of orange peel, pepper, coriander, wheat, spicy yeast, and breadiness. Some lingering notes of bread, wheat, orange, and spiciness on the finish for a bit. Medium body and carbonation; with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel that drinks very smoothly. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Other than the grainy appearance and weak aromas; this was pretty solid stuff. Good balance of flavors and easy drinking.","superspak","Jan 24, 2012"

The head doesn't have the best retention, and it leaves behind just a little bit of scattered lace on the glass. The nose has a good amount of wheat and lemony city aromas. There are also some scents of oranges, spice, and a tiny bit of hop presence. The taste pretty much follows the nose. It starts off with some grainy malt and wheat. There are some bright fruit flavors and just a little bit of hop flavor. There is quite a bit of lemony citrus, mostly on the back end. The finish leaves some lingering wheat, spice, and citrus on the palate. This beer has a medium body and decent carbonation. It goes down easy and has a smooth feel to it. It has a refreshing quality to it, and there is some graininess as well. This has decent drinkability. It goes down easy, but it just doesn't stand up to a lot of the witbiers that I've had.

The effect was like drinking cold herbal tea in a glass that was unwashed since someone drank beer out of it. When I first poured it into a glass, I had high expectations. It's colorful in a glass. I normally have a high opinion of Arcadia Ales due to Sky High Rye, and I suppose I can give them credit for trying to be experimental with an offering such as Whitsun. I understand they may have wanted to give the center stage to coriander and orange peel, but I would preferred that stage to be shared with some bold hops.","NotMyRealName","Sep 23, 2011"

Taste- there is that orange juice concentrate flavor, but it is at the back of the throat. Just a little astringent. On the front of the mouth, it is nice and refreshing, light and airy flavors, it doesn't remind me of any wit I have ever had- I would have expected more citrus, more spice, more coriander, etc. But, there is some individuality going on here that I can really appreciate.

The color was a very cloudy orangish-amber. The nose was definitely orange peel/zest, but underlain by the spiciness of the coriander and the unmistakable lightness of ... no, not being, that is unbearable, but instead, wheat. Mouthfeel was slightly thin, which is not unusual in wheat beers and the immediate flavors were of the coriander's spiciness and the zestiness of the orange peel, followed by the sharp tartness of the wheat. This was a beer whose principal ingredients really worked well together and were exactly as advertised. Finish was light, dry, refreshing and perfect for yet another slow summer day.

It has an almost melon-like aroma, perhaps cantaloupe, and bits of citrus including orange. In the mouth it's light-medium bodied and crisp with a very fine bubbled effervescent carbonation that leaves a zing on the tongue. The flavor is initially a bit tart, adding to the impression of fruit flavors (early-picked apple, pear, white grape), and it appears very citrusy. Orange flavors seem to appear across the middle along and into the finish, and it lingers in the mouth with some sweet orange marmalade and honey.

The taste starts out sweet with the honey and pale malts coming to the forefront, maybe a hint of citrus, followed quickly by a hoppy bitterness and a slight alcohol finish.

It has a very dry honey flavor that is wrapped around a base of pale and wheat malts. It's fruity and warming in the finish. The mouthfeel is average also.

Tons of carbonation bubbles flowing to the top. None of the floaties that others have mentioned. Really a nice looking beer. Smell is sweet citrus - apricots specifically. Taste also gives a blast of citrus, this is really the most noticable apricot flavor i've ever had in a beer. Finishes with a definate sour note to it. Nice feel in the mouth. Overall I was pleasantly suprised based on the other reviews i saw, maybe buying brewery fresh is the way to go with this one. The sourness starts to get old about half way through the glass but not enough to ruin an overall good impression. A very one dimensional beer and not world class by any means but one I would certainly try again on a hot summer day. Overall is has a somewhat refreshing taste to it.","beermanbrian","Jul 23, 2006"

There are enough character here for me to think that they were intending to create a Witbier, but fell short. But, they didn't fall too short. It's tasty beer; just out of style. There are nice orange and lemon flavors, but poorly balanced with creamy malts and body building proteins (low wheat additions). The estery qualities are low other than the citrus. The yeasty / bready flavors and feel are less than desired. The mouthfeel is a bit fizzy and numbing because of the light body and increased alcohol. the alcohols also taste phenolic and medicinal, but not to offend. I like the aggression in the 'American' interpretation of this beer, a better body would make all the difference.","BEERchitect","Jun 19, 2006"

On the palate, a significant acidity rises up first, followed by some fruits and then a very odd (for a wheat beer) nutty malt note. The overall impression is of a slightly weird German wheat beer, with less clove and bubblegum esters and a bit more malt.

Its way too sweet, but the tart taste at the end of the sip is nice. It leaves a syrupy feel in my mouth after the drink. I dont really notice much flavor similar to a wheat ale.

Smell is lightly sweet, with bread dough, light citrus, and some floral hops. Taste is plenty hoppy, but this is missing some of the essential flavors that a APWA must have. Not much of a banana flavor, not a lot of cloves, tastes more like an amber ale. Mouthfeel is too thick and muddied for the style, needs to be lighter and more crisp. Not a bad beer in any sense of the word just didn't find the style.","TastyTaste","Jul 11, 2005"

Odd aromas, slightly citric as in citrons (candied fruit) with medicinal qualities. Mouthfeel has decent fine carbonation but is overly thick for style and verging on gloppy. Flavor starts fruity but too sweetened, some spice but is also lactic and almost like a mayonaise with tang and eggy notes. Still holds on to phenolic senses to the aftertaste.

A light dose of hop bitterness rounds out the picture. It's by no means an American-style hefe, but it's also not Bavarian. It's an interesting change of pace.

But oddly enough I don't really taste the banana and clove like most wheats have. Coriander and peach seem to be apparent with other obscure flavors following.

Carbonation is moderately strong. Aroma is of lemony hops, mildly toasted pale malts, no detectable orange, coriander, banana or clove, and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is rather soft and watery with a wet finish, despite it's strength. Taste begins with rather earthy hops with a lemon pith character and moderately strong intensity. Toasty grains have a pronounced tannic bitterness in the middle, followed by more earthy bitterness and a hint of peach. A hint of sulfur and corn is noticeable in aroma and taste towards the end. Bready and yeasty to an extent, but not pleasurable. Alcohol becomes astringent as it warms. Not very balanced, and not very drinkable either.

Nice dose of hops, but still has that creamy, bready yeast note and good fruitiness. A good touch of banana in the flavor, but not much in the nose.
