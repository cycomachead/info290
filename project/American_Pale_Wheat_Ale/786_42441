3.5,1.7,,,,,,"Pours to a nice creamy white head that has some lacing and retention. Color is hazy orange-yellow. Aroma is fruity, candy-like and floral with some wheaty notes as well. Flavor suggests a hint of coriander, acacia or some other flavoring added (says on the label "ale with natural flavor added") and the soft, clean , crisp taste of red wheat and hops barely detectable. Dry, spicy crisp finish. Mouthfeel is correct for style, no anomalies. Overall, this beer hits the spot for summer sessioning.","EagleTalon","Aug 16, 2014"

Yes it has the wheat taste, but is very light and the afterfeel melts way quickly. Aftertaste is gone quickly.

The taste is of sweet wheat with a touch of honey and caramel. Reminds me a little of the "Paradise Beach Ale" that is ONLY served at "Cheeseburger in Paradise". Very smooth with a very slight dry finish on the end. Overall really like this one.","BeerWithMike","Aug 08, 2013"

Big citrus and wheat up front, tasting of orange and lemon, the citrus sticks throughout the rest with the wheat and subtle hops in the aftertaste. This beer is dominated by the citrus though. The mouthfeel is medium light with larger feel of carbonation. It could be a little more crisp to add to the flavor, but still a very refreshing beer, has a nice amount of flavor but isn't overpowering.

Nude Beach has been my go to beer this summer. It reminds me of German Weissbiers and is very drinkable. It's a bit cloudy with a good head and smells very fresh. Not bitter with a nice full mouth experience. Can't say enough good about this beer. Just hope they keep making it and don't change a thing.","eskybassplr","Aug 29, 2012"

The aroma is pleasant with an array of wheat, yeast, and citrus zest on the nose. The body is light as a summer ale should be but my particular can had a slight acidity to it. The can did have a dent but it was the last one left when I bought it.

Aromas of toasted bread, bananas, and light clove spicing highlighted by an overall roasting fill the nose. Flavors are slightly muddled, with a creamy texture giving rise to a slightly roasted banana bread and clove blending that is balanced and easy to drink. Light, fruity and slightly spiced aftertaste with a smooth, light finish. The beer is a little too light at points in mouth to support the flavors, but an easy enough beer to drink overall. Good warm weather brew.","GarthDanielson","0"

2.93,-14.8,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,"A bit off-season, perhaps, but not by very much, and I just had to try this beer. It pours a clear straw topped by a short-lived finger or so of fizzy dirty white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, lighter grass, very light biscuit, and light acetone. The taste holds notes of cracked wheat, light white bread, sweetgrass, and a twinge of alcoholic fruit (that may sound vague, but not as vague as it tasted...). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly watery feel. Overall, a pretty tepid beer. Not much going on at all, and what is there I'm not the biggest fan of, though it's in no real way offensive. Just boring, in a shabby kind o' way.","TMoney2591","Jul 30, 2011"

Poured a cloudy yellow w/ good head on top of a grainy yet smell of hops and a touch of yeast. Wouldn't have thought this was a pale wheat as it seemed more to me as a crappy fruit beer - the yeast is overpowered by just bitter hops and this cloying, fruity sweetness that I couldn't stomach for an entire glass. It was alright to try but not my pick for a beer.","clayrock81","Jul 10, 2011"

It has a good mix of pale and wheat malt scents along with a crisp, dry fruitiness. There are a decent amount of esters present. The banana/ clove aromas are mild, but well perceived. The taste is decent. It has a smooth pale and wheat malt flavor. It goes down easy with some prickly carbonation in the finish. It seems a bit watery and lacking in yeast character. Also, it's a bit heavier than most summer beers. It is a medium bodied beer with good/too much carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but not the best wheat beer on the market. The AB wheat beers are better.","WesWes","Jul 29, 2010"

There is lots of lemon, lots of wheat, and again a hint of clove. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with fairly high carbonation which is alright for the style.

A nice cloudy golden orange hue with a bright white head, lacing forms nicely in fine even layers. Aromatics bring out some nice citric an sharp wheat qualities, if you don't like wheat beers pass on this. However from all of the Stevens Point brews I've tried thus far this is my favorite most drinkabe offering I've come across. Orange peel no spice additions tangy sharp wheat profile, creamy edges slightly acidic nature this is a nice little summer sipper. Nothing too offensive especialy compared to most of these summer American pale wheats. No off flavors a nice light bodied evenly carbonated smooth experience on the palate.

The color was a cloudy orangish-amber, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. The nose was soft and gently fruity, slightly citrus, like tangerines or oranges. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild banana-tangerine sweetness on the tongue. It was more fruity than I have come to expect from the style, but it was still pleasant because the banana esters did not dominate. Finish was tangy, slightly citrusy, approaching dry. Not bad and certainly worthy of being in the cooler that also appears on the CAN.","woodychandler","May 25, 2010"
