3.68,10.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 11/2014. Pours hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, orange, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal herbal spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, light honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is a nice spiced pale wheat ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 15, 2015"

Not gonna go into lacing or anything of the sort as i don't really know how to review in that way. I drank this ale straight from the bottle. Has some hoppy and citrusy flavor. medium/ light body. Great for what its meant to be. A beer for the summer. All i know is when i worked unloading trucks, on the weekend, and going to the lake, having these was so refreshing and its just a great easy drinking ale. I rate it a  5 out of 5. Considering this was my first  beer, it will always be special to me.","Alestorm4069","Dec 08, 2014"

3.53,6,,,,,,"Single bottle poured into a weizen glass. A honey yellow amber with a small amount of fizzy white effervescence that does retain its form fairly well. Smells like sweet boiled grains, lemon zest, maybe a little candied ginger, dried apple pomace and musty, hay-like noble hops. Actually a rather nice vessel for that dry wheat spice that many of us have been trained to appreciate in the summer months, quenching and a little tart. Someone at this brewery has an infatuation with grains of paradise and these do work here, adding a dusty, almost leathery spice note to the zesty lemon and orange (vitamin C tablet?) citrus rind. More dried grass and white pepper notes in the crisp finish. There is a yeasty sweetness in the background that I am not wild about.  Although I prefer this to certain local wheat beer offerings, the classic Sam Adams noble hop flavor does not come off as well here as is typically the case and the background sweetness clashes with the tart spice elements. The grains are a tad coarse and the finish leaves a vaguely metallic aftereffect in its wake.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 21, 2014"

3.76,12.9,4,3,4,4,4,"Samuel Adams Summer Ale brewed by Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams), with an ABV of 5.3% This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a thick white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see thought it . The smell is fruity with a hit of grains. Summer Ale has a different smell to it. It's not bad it is just different . The taste is light and crisp you pick on some fruits in the taste. The mouthfeel is light and clean. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. Samuel Adams did a nice job with this one. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jul 27, 2014"

The flavor is quite refreshing but this beer could use a little more dryness and carbonation on the finish to up the summer time drinkability.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 03, 2014"

Tastes of lemon with a touch of malt. Light mouth that's cool and crisp. It's not bad, but fairly unremarkable. There are much better wheat beers to be had.","MartzMimic","Jun 02, 2014"

The scent was appealing though, definite smell of oranges and coriander. The mouthfeel is what u remember the most - crisp, refreshing and very smooth. It just felt like a sessionable beer. It's taste was nothing out of the ordinary. But the simple flavor mixed well with the hops. Overall, it was another great offering from SA.","jjamadorphd","May 31, 2014"

Still, I do have that feeling that the bottle may be too old. It is a possibility. Over time the lemon peel and spice can serriouly degrade the beer, but still, It seemed like a bad idea from the start. An American wheat ale should not be spiced and flavored like a wit...if this was instead a hoppy flavored (not bittered) wheat ale I feel like it could had worked. The beer itself looks great, its just a fact that it went very downhill very quickly. 2\5, and FYI I poured this one down the drain.","jucifer1818","Jan 01, 2014"

Subtle flavor of biscuity malt, Ron and butter notes, faint offsetting bitterness. Full mouthfeel. Overall an okay beer. Not overly flavorful, but not offensive, and I'm not much of a fan of pale wheats.","far333","Sep 12, 2013"

I enjoyed the flavors of the beer, but nothing knocked my socks off, or made me remember it after it was finished. It does its job of being refreshing on a hot summer day. According to the label, this ale is a wheat beer, but it doesn’t have any of the typical bubblegum, clove and banana flavors that most, if not all wheat beers have, which I guess would make this a poor example of a wheat beer, but because I don’t typically like wheat beers, specifically, because I don’t like those flavors, I found this beer to be, while not very memorable or exciting, drinkable. While I won’t go looking for this beer specifically, if offered it, I won’t turn up my nose at it.","Jeffreysan","Jul 01, 2013"

So it is with this fine Summer beer. Smells of wheat grass, lemons, and orange citrus. Bright cloudy yellow body reminiscent of a Heffenweizen or a thick fruit beer. Low lacing and small head on aggressive pour. Good mouth feel for warmer weather. Light. Crisp. Smooth and not too dry. Refreshing to say the least. Skunked hops lager like front taste. Hints of coriander, limes, and lemons throughout. Mid-palate it goes fruity and there is a mild spice. Almost cinnamon though they claim pepper from Grains of Paradise. I can see that. But it's not a hot pepper, it's a gentle bite transitioning the last taste where everything goes all copper hoppy as any true ale should thus revealing its real origin. Slight lemon and orange after taste. A little ale and alcohol. Very full and complex. Yet so drinkable despite all those flavors and transitions. The citrus and slow roll off of the hops to a mild malt works well. Creates a real Saison session feel to it. Good with poultry or on its own to refresh. Nice job Sam's. Definitely moved up a notch on my list-- no longer overbearing of citrus to the point of turning my stomach after more than 2 in an evening. I remember hating this beer a year ago. Clearly I was not alone and someone noticed; progress is sometimes a good thing! Cheers. 3.5 out of 5. Very good.","digitalflood","Jun 12, 2013"

3.1,-6.9,3,3,3.25,3,3,"Overal, the wheat and the lemon citrus seem to make up the majority of smell and taste that this brew has to offer. Yet, both are certainly underwhelming. I would not get this again (but probably will if it comes in next year's summer sampler, which I'm sure it will). It's not a bad drink; probably best enjoyed colder on a hot day.","TeamMathis","Apr 11, 2013"

In fact, it looks, smells, and tastes like they removed 50% of the flavor from Alpine Spring and re-branded it as Summer Ale. I've tried it on tap from two different establishments this week, and the experience was the same. It makes a nice accompaniment with a meal, and it's better than standard macro fare, but not much.","Roguer","Apr 11, 2013"

Aroma is suprisingly heavy on the malt with a bread dough aroma add in some orange and lemon peel. Kind of taste like a flavorful unsweet tea, heavy on the lemon, with a spice kick. I can't quite figure out what the spice is. I'm guessing "Grains of Paradise" because that's what it says on the bottle. Thin mouthfeel that's perfect for Summertime sessions. Overall not a bad summer beer. Not great but not bad either. Good beach beer.","wcudwight","Aug 23, 2012"

3.48,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"The beer pours a piss yellow with some orange flame towards the middle of the glass and thin frothy Styrofoam white that bubbles like nothing, and dissipates pretty quickly leaving edged up light lacing that really doesn’t last either and fades away to a clean glass edge. The smell is light and wheat-like with some nice spicy notes that almost remind of oregano, but must be the grains of paradise. The citrus layers-in throughout the smell as well. The beer tastes similar to the smell. It’s a little thicker with its wheat taste, but the spices play nicely on the sides of the tongue, again drawing to mind the grains of a paradise flavor and some citrusy sides. There are definitely some other spicy notes present that suggest that the yeast did some nice things to the flavor, but they are faint beside the citrus, wheat, and grains of paradise. This beer is very smooth on the tongue, but a little thin and watery over all. Carbonation is a little coarse and bubbly on the tongue, but overall quite nice. There is also a slight jelly-like feel that is left on the tongue after the beer washes through. The after feel of the mouth is actually quite nicely refreshed and wetted, which is very nice. Overall this is a decent summer wheat ale. I definitely like it more than Smuttynose’s Summer Weizen, which is the only other summer wheat ale I have really had this summer. Not my favorite beer, but not terrible either. I would have it again. A great cheaper price for decent beer.","Maxwell","Jul 08, 2012"

The smell is of banana and wheat, With a little bit of odd skunk. The taste was of stale lemons and perhaps some stale wheat and oranges?. Sounds appealing but keep in mind that they all tasted like fruits long passed their due date. The mouthfeel was heavily carbonated with almost none of the flavors coming through except for some extreme bitterness from sitting it in the mouth for more than a few seconds at a time. Overall this beer was NOT worth the money whatsoever. It's too bad, I wanted this beer to be good but I just couldn't get passed the lemon dish soap mouthfeel.

Aroma is sharp wheat malt and muted lemon, grass and pepper. Flavor is a strong wheat graininess and tartness with a grassy dry finish. Mouthfeel is light but rough and a bit parching.

This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth, and a little refreshing, but the flavors don't hold my interest and one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't that bad and had most of the aspects that I look for in this style. What I like least about this beer was the flavor, it was a little lighter then it should be and the flavors didn't come together as well as some of the better beers in the style. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, I would much rather have Oberon for a similar price, Oberon is much better all the way around, this is worth a try but don't expect it to be the new summer staple. This beer was ok as far as summer ales go, but Oberon is still my favorite of the style, this beer doesn't come close to being as good, and is pretty average all the way around, this is pretty much the perfect example if what an average APWA is like, this beer is going to need some work if they want it to be a great example of the style, but it is what is.","StoutHunter","Jun 11, 2012"

I had a feeling this was going to be similar to the way people described Summer Shandy to me, and that didn’t sound like my bag, and this beer certainly is not my type. The artificial fruit flavoring, just like that in almost any beer, really ruins any flavoring or drinkability. Maybe this is beer is right up some’s alley, but not mine. I have done my best to write an objective review, but I couldn’t help but for a little bit of opinion to seep in.","TheCondor","May 31, 2012"

To me it has a pleasant lemony smell, but the taste isn't quite there. It has too much of a watery taste, that doesn't quite taste right. I tried the Dogfish Namaste right before this to compare and it was significantly better. That beer had much more flavor, something Sam's Summer should definitely try to strive for.

There isn't much spice in the smell if it is detectable at all. The citrus flavor melds well with the flavors of the wheat. The peppery nature of the grains of paradise cuts in nicely to help balance the flavors of this beer. The mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. It's very refreshing now that temperatures have reached the 80's here in Louisiana. It will only become more refreshing as the temperatures climb. Overall, this is a good beer that is crisp and refreshing. It serves its purpose in many ways and I feel it does it well.","acevenom","Mar 30, 2012"

Creamy mouthfeel with lower than average carbonation. Sweet fruitiness of citrus and orange. A bit grainy, some detectable wheatiness. Almost clove like finish with a very modest spicy hop profile on the back end. Big but slightly bland as well. I don't mind the taste it is unique but heavy for a summer seasonal.

The grains of paradise produce a funky aroma that I really like: sort of like a cross between cracked peppercorns, nutmeg, cinnamon, and anise. Almost like a chinese five spice blend on top of a fragrant lemon peel and wheat malt. Flavor is spiced similarly to the nose but at a slightly more muted level, texture is kind of thick but not syrupy, finish is also kind of strange because all the spicing drops away leaving the orange peel all by its lonesome in the end.","WastingFreetime","Feb 16, 2012"

The flavors are nice--though I found the pepper profile slightly overpowering--and leave a clean citrus feeling in the mouth.

Nose was initially lemon citrusy, but then I got a real whiff of those Grains of Paradise and I felt like I had inhaled black pepper. Zounds! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. This tasted really good, especially after those last two Summer losers, with an initial lemon citrusiness that quickly got out of the way for those Grains of Paradise, which filled my sinuses like there was room or I wanted them there. I kid you not, I was so close to a sneezing fit that it was not funny!

The smell of the beer is bright and fresh, it's got some lemon in there and perhaps a few spices on the nose. The taste is a citrusy and grainy blast of freshness. It's a little sweet and it's got a good balance of fruit and beer. The mouthfeel is very easy going. lightly carbonated and soft.

Flavors are similar to the aroma but its got a real astrigent flavor that puckers the palate. The lemon is much more predominant this year and the flavor profile has been watered down from what i can remember. Mouthfeel is astrignent and light, but very refreshing.

What I do smell however are citrus smells of lemon and orange zest as well as a pepper note to follow. The initial sip hits the tongue and oddly reminds of a dreamsicle which is pleasant but definitely unexpected. This is due to the creaminess of the body of the beer along with the strong citrus flavor. The more I drink it the more I realize how intense the flavors are, and there are a lot of flavors in here. The wheat flavor is almost lost to it. It almost seems like I'm drinking a beer that has had an entire fruit salad steeped in it.

Sorta boring and not overly impressive in any way, but it sure is refreshing. A situational beer for sure--perfect on the beach or with the right dinner. Loved it with my chicken dish.

The lemon hides any flavor of the beer, you can catch a little hop bitterness in the after taste, but I think they need to dial the lemon back, a lot. Maybe I am being too harsh, but that is what I am tasting at this moment. I will come back for a re-review if I feel differently at another time, but right now I am not feeling this beer. Good beer for parties and cookouts though because alot of people like it. Along the lines of bud light.","Pittsburgh","Jul 08, 2010"

The flavor is very similar with a very grainy malt base that also carries some wheat notes. Citrus zest and some spicy pepperyness are also present, but everything is pretty subdued. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and has a nice smoothness to it and a clean finish. Not overly carbonated and very refreshing, this beer goes down easily.

Very bright in places, the grains of paradise add a nice element overall. Taste is not quite as impressive, with a lot of that wheat and fruit flavor getting lost in the carbonation. That being said, the finish is really pleasing: very well rounded and showcasing the sweetness of the wheat. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and perfect for a hot day like today.

The lemon and orange citrus more pronounced, the same for the grassiness, hence has more bitterness and bite. The spice is more diffused and has less impact. The grain and cereal keep coming at you, if without clear purpose. There's little here that others in the category don't do better, pretty sure the units move due to brand clout.","farrago","Sep 12, 2009"

Taste is somewhat consistent with nose, but also buttery and biscuity, with a slight citrus astringency at the finish.

3.82,14.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy straw yellow. Smells fairly "bright." Citrus (dunno if its from actual citrus or the yeast) is dominant on the nose. I can also smell some floral hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, I feel like it should be a bit more carbonated for a wheat. A little sweet, and bready. Spices run throughout it, I taste a lot of coriander. It certainly isn't as boring as a lot of other American Wheats are.","drunkboxer1","Jun 11, 2009"
3.5,5.1,4,4,3.5,3,3,"When poured into the glass, it carried a small amount of foam, very light wheat in color, almost white and dissapated quickly. The color was a rich, hazy golden honey. The smell had a lemony/orange zest with an equal balance of hops and wheat and a hint of honey. The taste was an exact mirror of the smell. Drinkability - easy on the palate and easy going down witha dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel - light to medium bodied with a very subtle graininess.","Monsteruss","Jun 10, 2009"

This beer isn't nearly that bad, but it does remind me a bit of ACC football--hovering somewhere around mediocrity, never really breaking out of it, but not quite sinking below it either. The beer pours a fairly light golden color with a heat about the size of Ally McBeal, and retains nothing while the bubbles lethargically fondle themselves in the corner. The beer tastes to me like a lager with some wheat and lemon thrown in, and I'm pretty sure that's about all there is. You can quaff it on a summer day, sure, but any wheat beer in hot temperatures probably isn't the best idea in the first place, and I would rather spend less money on Coronas and lime. Still, its not a disaster if you've already grabbed a sixer, just surreptitiously pawn it off to your peripheral friends and hope to get something better from them at a later time.","andrewm190","Aug 03, 2008"

Nice head that stood up for a few minutes before dissipating. Took a big sniff. Very pleasant fruitiness. Lemon. Big expectations for a beer that will fight off this oppressive heat. No bitterness at all, but wasn't expecting any and true to style. Very refreshing. Despite the very light quality to it, there is a discernable maltiness. Well balanced for its type.

The beer poured a strange orange-peach color with minimal head. It just looked fake in the glass, not offensive just odd to put it best. As I sipped on this beer I was able to detect the wheat influence. There is a spicy taste that compliments the wheat, but I'm not sure if I like it. Other than those two aspects the overall flavor was borderline bland. Mouthfeel is somewhat pleasant and the finish is relatively smooth. Overall I'm hoping this beer is better than what was poured from the tap. Revisit (as promised) Well it's July and my friend brought over a 12 pack of this for dinner the other night. Having this fresh from the bottle and drunk from a nice clean glass my opinion has slightly changed for the better. Looks better, feels better, and tastes much better. Still a tad weak in my opinion but it is more crisp and inviting this time around. The flavor needs a boost to really let this one soar. Decent summer time beer.","kinger","Aug 01, 2008"

The lemon smell really came through with this beer and it was exceptional. It felt wonderful around the mouth and went down extremely smooth.

It has a very nice sweet wheat base that is pretty easy to detect from underneath a mix of lemony and orangy flavors but finishes with a clean citrisy hop bitterness that is not overwhelming but very complementing.

Just like the smell a slight hops kick to it and the citrus is definitely present in the taste, almost slightly sour with a sweet aftertaste if thats possible.

The taste is of tangy wheat, with the lemon and sweet grass coming in for the aftertaste, and sticking around for a while. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation.

There is a lingering lemon zest flavor on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pleasantly carbonated, at a good level for a summer beer. Spice brings drinkability down some. Not a bad brew, and one of my gateway beers into the craft world. Still I would rather other American Wheat beers.","hckyfn9999","Mar 31, 2007"

Smell reminds me of a fainter Boston Lager but with citrus and spicing in the way far background. Flavors are of pale malt, some graininess, wheat like cracker flavors, grains of paradise, and mild citrus. Finishes dry, with a little bitterness and herbal hoppiness. I think it tastes great, but it's all very understated. I wanted for more present flavors. Carbonation is very soft in the mouth and fluffy. However, this is a bit too light bodied. I'm not blown away by this beer, but it is really drinkable.","goochpunch","Mar 30, 2007"

Not too much for a summer ale, but noticeably present. Solid mouthfeel. This is a great summer brew. Good for hot days after working in the yard, and just as comforting after a long day at the office.

This beer has an added citrus (lemons) with a mild peppery, spicy flavor. A mild haze illudes to a very pale wheat addition that helps with a breadiness and sweetness that disquise the grain flavors. Still, the body fades into a watery brew fairly quickly, but adds to the drinkability. A mild grain, citrus, and hop character persists into the finish.

The initial smell was just the faintest of hops, but when I swirled it around the hops were still there but with just a hint of fruits in the background. The taste was very crisp with a nice balance of malts and hops and with just a slight taste of juicy fruits at the very end. I enjoyed the mouthfeel because it was so crisp, smooth, creamy, and with an aftertaste of malts and fruits. This would make a nice choice for a summer beer because it was so crisp and refreshing.

It is a very light body with notable flavors that do not over power you but definitely show themselves. This is a great summer beer because it is light and very tasty when it is cold. The mouthfeel is normal with a bit of carbonation which doesn't take away from the overall balance of the beer. This is a great beer for a warm summer day, fits most occasions.

As far as the drinkability goes, this beer can be sessioned as easily as anything. I started and finished a session off with this beer and really enjoyed it at both ends. For what this beer is, it's quite refreshing and does the job as good as any.","rtratzlaff","Jun 15, 2006"

Taste was bland, and a definite let down; malt and weak peppery notes of citrus die quickly, and touches of hops and grain are noted in the mix. Way too weak on the flavors.

The flavor is very sharp and to the point, and the incredible zestiness is quite an eye-opener. The mouthfeel of this beer is great.

Bottle claims this was brewed with wheat malt, lemon zest, and grains of paradise, but all Im really getting from it is the lemon zest.

Taste is that of a weak wheat beer that has been watered down. The spiciness was about as minimal as I have ever had in a wit beer. Mouthfeel was thin and watered down a bit.

Let me state up front that I LOVE Sam Adams beers. But this one, not so much. It was very disappointing and is indeed, as Mitchster so ably pointed out in his review, it leaves a cardboard taste in one's mouth. Boring! Watery! The only thing that can be said is it may be refreshing, but is not much better than most Lite beers. Appearance is unfiltered golden orange, good head and lacing, light carbonation, aroma contains corn, lemon and faint spice ('paradise' is the spice, according to the bottle). Smooth mouthfeel, taste of wheat, honey and bitter herbal with a dry unpleasant finish.","palliko","Jul 16, 2004"

There was some citrus but very, very light. Wheat and malt set up the backbone of this brew. Some lemon mixes in the middle.

This is a thinner, lighter beer for spring / summer enjoyment...not a beer that feels like eating as sandwhich... like you'd want in November or February. It is very drinkable, but not something I plan on stocking in the fridge as a regular drink. Good thing, since its only available for a few months of the year.

The flavors were slightly more pronounced then the aroma, tastes of light spices, lemon zest, bread, spices and malt were all present. It produced an aftertaste of mostly bread and wheat grains.

I got a very bland beer without much flavor at all. The mouthfeel was disappointing. It was overly carbonated. This combined with the dry flavor to not be very refreshing at all.

The aroma is full of the lemon zest aroma that is nice but the beer shouldn't just have the bitter taste of lemon zest. It cancels out the pleasure of the smell when you taste the bitter offness of the lemon zest. Overall not very drinkable or enjoyable for me.

And fortunately, a lot of non-beer geek people have this on hand in the summer.  That's not such a bad thing.","pbrian","May 28, 2002"
3.97,19.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Cloudy, golden colored beer with a thick, white head.  Perceptible citrus aroma and taste.  Also has perceptible light hopping and wheat character.  Very pleasant on a sunny spring day.","Suds","May 28, 2002"
3.95,18.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I was pretty excited to see a Sam Adams Belgian Wit style brew.  As other reviewers have noted this just doesn't get the job done for that.  I really have no idea what 'grains of paradise' are and I don't really detect any spice in this beer to speak of.  Nevertheless, it's a very enjoyable easy-drinker.  Enough hoppiness to give it a good dry finish.  There is a certain amount of  sweetness from the wheat and a soft, persistent head and lace to the bottom of the glass.  I found it quite tasty, probably great with barbecue or mexican food.... it's just not really what I was hoping for in a Belgian Wit style.","ebraun","May 23, 2002"
2.54,-23.7,2,3,2.5,3,2,"i must have gotten a bad bottle of this because the pour gave no head like a date with a nun. the taste was nothing to write home about either. another example on why i stockpile my favorite winter seasonals for when this time a year roles around.","MrNuggets","May 22, 2002"
4.1,23.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours hazy light golden with a sticky white head.  Nice aroma of malted wheat and vanilla.  Nice malty wheat backbone.  Tangy taste.  A bit of lemon.  I do get somewhat of a bite in this one too.  Similar to the nice hop bite you'll find in properly brewed European Pilseners, but not as harsh.  A case of these would be a nice way to fill up the poolside cooler.","Bighuge","May 20, 2002"

3.03,-9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Is this actually supposed to be a wit???  Pours a perfectly clear? straw color with a nice whit head that sticks around nicely.  Smell is very weak and almost completely of lemon, faint wheat and yeast aromas.  There is so much lemon in this brew that it almost makes my mouth pucker when I drink it.  There are some vague wheat flavors in the brew and no discernable yeast or spice flavors.  Somewhat creamy but not nearly as it should be for the style.  Somewhat drinkable.  When Coors can make a better wit (Blue Moon) than Sam Adams something is very wrong.  I more than likely won't purchase this again.","Murph","May 17, 2002"
3.05,-8.4,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours an off-white cloudy color. On the nose there is aromas of wheat malt and lemon zest. The same two things lemon and wheat malt on the palate too. Im not a big on wheats, but 2 or 3 on a nice warm day served ice cold, does the trick. Nice summer quencher, I actually prefer to be eating something while drinking these types of beers, but overall not to shabby for a wheat brew","WilliamPhilaPa","May 08, 2002"
3.5,5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a cloudy golden color with a decent and rather sticky white head and moderate lace.  Strong aromas of wheat, lemon and spices.  Upon tasting, malt notes assert themselves very briefly, followed by lemon and spices and a hoppy finish.  A refreshing summer beer.","Pegasus","May 03, 2002"
2.83,-15,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Attractive and dense white head. Cloudy light orange in hue. Grainy, lemony, slightly phenolic aroma. Subtle coriander is present as well. Definitely more mild in aroma that most Wits. Surprisingly bland in flavor-- complexity added by the yeast is sorely lacking in this brew. Spice flavor is quite minimal, but a touch of bitter orange peel is there. The mouthfeel is fairly silky and the medium body is perhaps due to the use of oats. Finishes w/ wheat tartness w/ not much else. A bit dissapointing. It's a dumbened down version of a Wit. Hand me a Vuuve now!","marc77","Apr 23, 2002"
3.2,-3.9,3,3,3.5,3,3,"A decent offering from the Boston Beer Co.  I'll pick up a sixer of this from time to time during the summer.  There is just a touch too much lemon-taste on the finish, but it is a crisp, easy to drink brew.","proc","Apr 14, 2002"
3.4,2.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"The lemon and wheat work well against each other. This is a refreshing, thirst-quenching beer. Doesn't do much to advance the wit style, in fact I don't think it has much in common. Still a pleasant brew, not one that bears much scrutiny, but fine for simple quaffing. Doesn't stand up to much in the way of flavorful food, but could be enjoyed with very light fare like a salad or something.","Thrasher","Apr 14, 2002"
4.04,21.3,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Sam Adams Summer Ale for 2002.  Considering that we are about 10 days into spring around here, seems a little early to have this seasonal released.  This is a wheat beer based on a Belgian White Ale (according to the label).  Compared to last years, seems significantly darker, and I seem to recall that last years had more of a weiss haze.  White, dense head. Very pronounced lemon aroma and taste.  I'll enjoy this beer all Summer long.","jackndan","Mar 29, 2002"
