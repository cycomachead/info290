I'll be researching the possibilities of establishing a keg in my livingroom now tha the air conditioner has crapped out.

3.68,7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 9/5/2014. Pours hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, chamomile, wheat, cracker, bread, clove, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale/bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, chamomile, wheat, cracker, bread, clove, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, chamomile, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale/bready malt sweetness; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice pale wheat ale. Good robustness, complexity, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 24, 2014"

Smell is of malt, grain, wheat, and some skunk aromas. Taste is much the same with wheat, earth, and floral flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an average smell and very grain forward flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 25, 2014"

Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. OK to drink on this 90 degree and humid day, but not something I think I would ever want again.

It’s a calm nose with good yeast. Taste is very complex. Bread, cracker and full, but smooth and mild. Ample carbonation but thin body. Drinks a little heavy but clean and crisp. The chamomile is just lightly on top, combining with the faintly floral hops and meets the malt right where it would get sweet but doesn’t. The lemon and the wheat come together so closely that you are tempted to think that you can’t taste the lemon but your mouth does water. Finishes dry with a touch of bitter and the malt lingers too in the finish. I liked it.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

A finger thick head quickly accumulates and recedes slowly leaving behind a thin lacing around the sides of my glass. This thing looks the way a good wheat beer should look. The smell is interesting and leads with spicy cloves, mild banana, and husky wheats and grains. The beer's flavor follows suit. It's light, fruity, and well-balanced all the while with a solid underlying wheat-iness. Hints of banana, some light grassy hops, and yeasty malts throughout. It's light-bodied and refreshing, a perfect summer consistency. Overall a nice wheat beer that gives a nice balance between an American wheat ale and a hefeweizen.","mattsdenney","Dec 26, 2012"

Aromas of lemon, green herbs, and roasted wood come through on the nose. Flavors are a bit more roasted than the style normally produces, but not unwelcomed. Lemon zest and a slight peppery hopping bring some levity to the backbone, with a grainy main character powering through. The aftertaste is more of the toasted grains, with only a slight hint of hops bitterness. Tangy, somewhat drying finish, and this beer quickly leaves the palate, never really establishing itself prominently while you drink. Not bad, but Smutty has much better offerings.","GarthDanielson","Aug 31, 2012"

Aroma is sweet malt, wheat, and some light honey and citrus. It tastes like wheat malt, light citrus, chamomile and some peppery spice. Both the aroma and flavor seem to be subtle to me. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and easy to drink. Nothing really impressive about this brew, I was expecting it to be better.

2.05,-40.2,3.5,1,2.5,3,1.5,"Appearance is a light hazy golden color with a pale white head and some light lacing on the glass. Upon opening the bottle, the floral scents were pleasant, but as I drank it, the smell seemed to become more medicinal and unpleasant, almost vomit-like. The taste was different from other wheat beers - a vague floral/herbal flavor comes through, maybe a slight lemon taste, with some piney bitterness in the finish. The smell became so offensive that I couldn't finish it. This one ended in a drain pour. Bell's Oberon Ale is a much better beer of this style.","DeltaGolfSierra","Jul 07, 2011"
3.53,2.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had on tap recently with my wife out for dinner, much more enjoyable so far than this bottle has been. This one pours a clouded bright yellow golden hue with a nice thicket of bright white head. Lacing forms bands of uneven lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma has a touch of honey biscuit malt character to it with very nice floral/herbal notes, minimal banana or clove, and somewhat of a graininess. The label says it's brewed with chamommile flowers which would make sense for what I'm getting. Flavors provide some balanced bready/grain husk sweetness with a touch of honey, harsh bitterness from herbal/floral notes almost something perfume like in nature, probably the chamommile flower additions. I like my summer weizens to have a bit more banana and clove from the German yeast additions, this seems to be running on house Smuttynose yeast or at least an American Pale Wheat yeast addition. Mouthfeel is actually medium bodied with a bit of oily textures going across my palate, finishes rather dry, not sure of the hopping rate or IBUs on this but I'd venture to say higher than your average hefeweizen. Carbonation isn't an issue but overall enjoyment level was lacking a bit, first off better on draft, and flavor wise the herbal/graininess was a bit off putting for me. Still an enjoyable summer sipper just not what I was looking for in a Weizen.","WVbeergeek","Jul 06, 2011"
3.53,2.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: A crisp and refreshing beer without an overpowering flavor profile; this is one that you can easily drink without focusing too much on, perhaps at a cookout or over a game of horseshoes.","ToasterChef","Jul 04, 2011"
3.08,-10.2,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"I filled my growler with this summer brew within an hour of it being tapped. Sudsy pour. The wheat gives the ale a really nice flavor, with yeast in the aftertaste.

3.5,2,3,3,4,3,3.5,"O: Not my favorite beer genre though I did purchase 6 different breweries' versions to try and compare. This one isn't too bad.

3.3,-3.8,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Standard looking american wheat. Pretty clear, pale yellow with a bubbly white head. Smells a little musty and a bit grainy. Palate is refreshing and pleasant.

3.52,2.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Full bodied with lots of bready yeast and banana. Again, this is surprisinlgy hoppy with an earthy, grassy presence that adds faint dry bitterness. The hops aren't overwhelming however and the wheat beer characteristics are still prominent. Zesty spice with hints of clove and pepper countered by the yeast and sweet citrus notes. Lots of lemon flavor toward the end of the palate with a dry finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, especially in this hot, humid weather.","corby112","Jun 23, 2011"

There is slow-moving but regular carbonation. The aroma is of wheat, some yeast, and chamomile spices. Interesting but not jaw-dropping. The body is around medium and quite easy on the palate.

Some hop aromas in the finish. The taste is not impressive in the slightest. Taste is dominated by the yeast character, needs more malty body or hop aroma or something. Floral/herbal presence is unbalanced and offputting for my liking. I have definitely smelled/tasted much "better" weizen yeast combinations.

Nice and refreshing on a hot summer night, but overall a very run of the mill and forgettable beer.","axeman9182","Jun 22, 2010"

Light-bodied, the carbonation comes at you steadily with a fair degree of churn. More orange and lemon citrus than grapefruit, again more sweet than sour. Slightly less honey but more floral. The rye, wheat breadiness comes close to pumpernickel. Dry enough to create some light tacky residue on the tongue after a few sips.

The color and body looks like a summer, but the head formed is like a hefe. Other than that, I'd have to lean towards just calling this one a summer ale.

Some West Coast hoppiness is noted (cascade like) and leaves a little bit of a lingering bitterness. Yeasty character is pretty subdued unfortunately. Otherwise, just a bit of wheat tang.

Good mouthfeel, moderate body with nice crisp carbonation. Drinkability is good as well. IMO this is slightly muddled and not quite as good as it could be.

The flavor consists of this and a nice dose of medicinal phenols, orange peel, light lemon and coriander, light piney hops and a medium bitterness from both the hops and the phenols.

4.23,23.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Packaged in the new Summer Weizen Ale bottle with yet another "vintage" photograph on the label that looks like it was taken at a pool party over at my grandparents house 20 years ago. The name says it all "Summer Weizen Ale", because it starts off with fruit notes such as macintosh apple and orange peel but has a rich frothy head with classic wheat notes throughout. It also has a strong, clean, pronounced finish. At 5%, it goes down smooth and easy and is a great addition to the Smutty line.","MattBrooks","May 20, 2006"

3.45,0.6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Smuttynose's Summer Weizen appears to have undergone a packaging change since the picture here was taken... Pours pale yellow with a decent head with staying power. Except for the head, it looks a bit like a Budweiser. It has a pretty nice wheat beer smell -- clean wheat, with spices (cloves), minor fruits and just a touch of bubblegum. On the palate, this opens up with sharp acidity some yeasty wheats, before a huge bready finish and aftertaste take over. The last half of this is not really that pleasant. Overall, this is drinkable, but the last half of the palate and the aftertaste detract quite a bit.","geexploitation","May 13, 2006"
3.68,7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The flavor is very much as the nose suggests it will be, with the addition of a bit of spicy hops and some balancing bitterness.","NeroFiddled","Apr 02, 2006"
3.77,9.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4" white head over the ultra-clear light golden brew. What head there is lasts pretty well, with average lacing. Aroma is a nice balance between wheat and clove, nice for the style. Taste is wheat malt upfront, heads into a menagerie of clove, and citrus flavors, amongst others. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both nice for this flavorful pale wheat, three words that don't always go together.","ppoitras","Oct 24, 2005"
3.82,11.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I'm a big fan of hefeweizens and Smuttynose's beers, so I was excited to track this one down. While it's not a bad beer, Weizenheimer lacks any special qualities to merit choosing it over stronger offerings like the Brooklyn hefeweizen. A fairly standard offering, good but not amazing.","jed","Oct 16, 2005"
4.03,17.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a traditional Weisse glass, a golden straw color with a nice white head, kept alive for a good long time by large cascading bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Bready wheat aroma with an herbal hop punch and a smattering of malty spice. Crisp and quite refreshing, with hints of sweet citrus to balance the grassy dry malt and mild bitterness. Just a slight tingle is left on the tip of the tongue from the carbonation. American wheats usually are openly lacking in some way, but this is quite a nice, flavorful example. Certainly worth a try.","IrishRedRock","Aug 16, 2005"
4,16.6,4,4,4,4,4,"What a great beer. Bready and juicy mouthfeel. Smuttynose nails that foreign yeast flavor. Very clean, yet spicy and fruity on the palate. A very easy drinking beverage. This is a solid American hefeweizen and an excellent summertime offering.","Hibernator","Aug 07, 2005"
3.02,-12,3,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Taste is spicy and bitter. Lemony. That's it. Bitter finish, crisp mouth. Only OK. Another relatively dull American wheat.","ViveLaChouffe","Aug 01, 2005"
3.5,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a bright hazy yellow with a finger of dense white head and decent retention. Smell is lemon, cloves, and grassy hops. Taste was very assertive clove spiciness uipfront giving way to a lemony slightly metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium/thin and a little fizzy. Decent beer, but I won't go out of my way to drink again.","cubedbee","Jul 19, 2005"

2.85,-16.9,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Overall: For a summer wheat beer, I think this one is pretty weak. Thirst-quenching, I suppose, but the flavor just isn't there. Not necessarily a terrible beer, but in most places you can buy this, there are probably a half-dozen beers of the same style that are much better.","whartontallboy","Jul 07, 2005"
2.63,-23.3,2.5,2,3,3,2.5,"Not very drinkable. Really couldn't hold its own up to the other two weisse we enjoyed over the long weekend. I won't be buying this one again.","Dithyramb","Jul 01, 2005"

2.36,-31.2,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Unfortunately that abrasiveness also dominates the palate. Some fruit is there as well as the more pleasant phenols. But there is also a tannic astringency and an over-abundance of bitterness. It is really difficult to get past these negative qualities and into the heart of the beer, but something really went wrong here. Whether that something was in the concept or the execution is hard to say, but something is out of whack, at least in the two bottles I sampled. The fact that the label is incorrect and the freshness date of May is suspect doesn't help. I'd pass on another.","TongoRad","Jun 21, 2005"

4,16.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer from the smuttynose family is delicious, it pours a clear rich gold color. The head is a thin white lace that sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is of lemon and grass. The taste is smooth most prominate flavors on you palate are honey, lemon rinds, and bitter. This beer is something you would crack open on a hot day. It would pair well with a nice grilled shrimp or chicken salad.","Franchise","Jun 05, 2005"
