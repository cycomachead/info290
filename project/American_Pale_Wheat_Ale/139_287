Just 'blah' and a bit harsh and metallic on the palate.  Picked up a 12-pack on sale (about a buck a bottle) and still can't say I'd buy more even at that price.","Carolvs","Oct 25, 2014"

3,-2.9,,,,,,"an extremely plain and almost flavorless summer beer, which is odd because it has more body than it needs to with this little flavor. brassy color, a little dull looking from the bottle but holding a decent white head and leaving some patchy froth lacing as I drink it down (very quickly). the best feature is the feel, great carbonation and a clean finish, but that's expected because there isnt much flavor to clean up. a really mild two row malt base is basically irrelevant, and the hops are for balance only, no real flavor to them. the thing I taste the most is the yeast, which is a clean and very basic ale yeast. I think more grain profile (not body) on this beer would make it a little better, but its good for mindless summer drinking. I much prefer it with spicy food, can cleanse the palate pretty will without getting too filling. nothing special though overall from shipyard. they save their magic for the signature series.","StonedTrippin","Aug 17, 2014"

Nose had a distinct wheat tang and a lemon-citrus bite. No, I did not squeeze a slice of lemon. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was very tangy from the wheat. I can understand why the uninitiated might want to cut the flavor, but it also speaks to the refreshing nature of the beer. Finish was quite dry, not gasping like some AIPAs, but more like applying alum to the tongue. Literally drying. Not bad at all.","woodychandler","May 26, 2013"

3.15,1.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"I'm sure this American Pale Wheat goes way better with a lobster roll eating in Portland, ME but here it goes. Crystal clear golden straw color with a slightly off white head formed thick with fine bubbles carbonation levels seem kicked up a bit by the amount of head I'm getting in this glass but the fine speckled lacing is patterned around my wheat beer glass evenly. Aromatics I'm getting a light sharp wheat character a hint of lemon citrus peel, and some grain maybe even a light biscuit malt expression pretty muted so far. Flavor has a whirl wind of yeast characteristics I'm guessing this is their house yeast fermentation set up with one of the Alan Pugsley systems, I'm getting earthiness a bit of oak with a mild light bodied summer ale as the backbone base beer. A touch of citrus, and bitterness that comes of as grassy but overall a really lackluster beer experience on flavor, and if you don't care for their house yeast watch out it has a bite. Mouthfeel is light bodied even lively carbonation flow with a lingering bitterness mainly from the yeast pitch here. Overall not my cup of tea but it's quite refreshing, and like I stated before I'm sure I would be guzzling a couple of these on tap when in Rome, aka chowing one some fresh seafood in Maine.","WVbeergeek","May 17, 2013"

Light wheat and lemon are in the nose with a hint of banana. It smells grainy and perhaps corny. It has a smooth, light body with a dry, crunchy finish. It makes my teeth feel dirty. Along with the lemony twang of wheat, there is a rumbling, green bitterness. It gets herbal and a little minty toward the finish. It leaves a phenolic taste in the mouth. It's a little ragged, but not that hard to drink.","yesyouam","Sep 25, 2012"

This beer pours a fairly clear, highly carbonated pale yellow color with a finger of head that quickly goes away. The aroma is highly sweet and buttery, probably partially owing to the Ringwood yeast. The taste is pretty good, it's sweet and grainy, with that little hint of butter in the background, which actually works quite well with a slight hop bitterness that comes in for the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice, it's very crisp and thirst-quenching, and the drinkability is quite good. Overall, an enjoyable brew, if unexceptional. I found it fairly interesting to drink a beer where the buttery taste was actually intentional and worked well with the flavor profile, but YMMV.","shand","Jul 18, 2011"

The head quickly settles to a thin layer of off-white head that is filmy. Tons of bubbles throughout this brew. Looks very watery. Aromas are smokey and roasted, with a banana fruit sweetness and buttery character to it. Reminds me of banana bread a bit, but lighter. Flavors are slightly sour and bitter on the edges, but overly sweet and cloying throughout. The roasted cereal flavor is underlying on the midtongue, but the fruity and sweet backbone is muddled, making the beer poorly balanced throughout. Aftertaste is mostly roast and semisweet caramel, with a lingering, slightly bitter and tangy finish. There are worse things you could drink out there this summer, but not many.","GarthDanielson","Jul 13, 2011"

It's very citrusy and tastes kind of like cloves or coriander. I'm not sure which. But that's pretty much what comprises the spicy notes. Nothing special, really. It's very light in flavour and body as a summer ale should be. So, that's right on. It's refreshing, I'll give it that. I'm not a big fan of that coriander/clove taste, though.

It really say's Maine (not including Allagash and all the other great ones in ME)as it is in the style I often find here.

Completely transparent apricot-copper colored beer with dozens of stream of fine bubbles rising briskly to the surface. Interesing mix of butterscotch and apricot in the flavor. The finish is just barely bitter and alcoholic. Mouthfeel is light and fairly soft. This beer wasn't that cold when I pulled it from the fridge, and barely cool by the time I drank. I think the temperature brought out a lot of flavor and aroma that I hadn't noticed in previous colder bottles. Light and fruity when cold, but becomes more interesting as it warms.","HappyHourHero","Jul 13, 2005"
3.94,27.5,4,2.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This looked like a Pale Ale, with a nice golden hue, almost an orange color. Served with a lemon, though I took that right out. It had little to no head and had a cloudy presence to it. Could not get the aroma of this beer, although I had the Carrabassett Pale Ale before it. But the only thing that I was even close to was a fruity aroma. This seems to be a wheat based ale with a hint of citrus, maybe lemon or grapefruit, kind of a sour feel when first trying it. Smooth and easy after taste. I have always liked this beer during the summer when it is released.","HoorayBeer","Jul 08, 2005"

As Summer Ales go this one has a nice full profile with the aroma of lemony hops and dry wheat along with a similar flavor.

The taste carried a citric spicey hop to crisp things up while balanced softly by a buttered toast grain. That buttery feel lingers on the mouth abit.

3.06,-1,4,3,3,3,3,"Picked up a 6 pack of this stuff not really knowing what to expect from this beer. Poured out a nice gold color with a big amount of carbonation that settled down somewhat. Smell consisted of spicy hops, lemon, and some malts in there as well. Taste was about the same as the nose. Spicy hops that lasted a good while combined with some malts and citrus notes. But with those spicy hops in the aftertaste came the buttery aftertaste. Seemed to last forever in this brew. This almost crosses the lines with a pils somewhat, but man, that buttery aftertaste is sometimes too much. Can we say ringwood? All in all, this could be a good alternative during the summer months. But I wouldn't go crazy for it.","necoadam","Jul 03, 2004"

Taste is if pale malts with a slight hops bite at the end. Kind of non-descript, but nothing bad going on. Mouthfeel good and I'm torn on drinkability, because one could drink it all day, but not sure what would be the impetus to do so, except for a lawn-mowing type application. An acceptable brew as summers go.","ppoitras","Jun 27, 2004"

Drinken cold, this beer has a very good, smooth mouthfeel, with a pleasant amount of carbonation gracing the tongue.

In comparison with the Summer Ales from Geary and Casco Bay, it doesn't begin to compete in taste or overall appeal. Hard to say what its flavor profile may be other than it's relatively bland with no special malt or hop overtones - maybe a light fruity taste would be my best description. It's not a bad product and certainly quite drinkable - it's just not a product I'm willing to pay a premium micro price to obtain. Maybe they're hoping to appeal to a broader market than micro fans.","Greenlabel","May 31, 2003"
