It has a high enough ABV and is cheap enough that it will do its job without tasting like Keystone or god forbid Natural Light. So it's good for what it is, but if you actually want to drink beer for beers sake it really isn't worth it.","Hurricane_Harry","Sep 09, 2014"

Obviously a top seller across this country although never as big as a few other brands in my neck of the woods, this probably does not deserve to be the standard-bearer for John Molson's rich brewing legacy but nevertheless does manage to deliver more flavor than many of its contemporaries in macro-lager land. Thin and super fizzy as expected but does have an almost buttery rounded grain sweetness that comes off better than in many other takes on this style, less DMS (albeit this is still present), and even a very faint fruitiness that recalls apple and grape hard candy. Dryish metallic grainy finish. You have to focus to taste much but what's there is less rancid than expected. Workmanlike lawn mower beer and has a place at pizza parties post-moving. Not recommended for tasting except as an example of a decent Canadian macro-brew for comparison purposes.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 23, 2014"

Mild hoppy taste that is grainy with a sweet aftertaste but it is more watery than anything else. A good beer to get on draft and to session with. The more you drink this the more tolerable it is. A good beer to have while at the bar eating wings and spending the night splitting a pitcher with friends. A perfect example of how marketing can sell a beer, despite what the commercials say, enjoying this beer does not make you Canadian.","RyanPollock","Feb 18, 2014"

When comparing Molson to other beers of the style, it is definitely centrefield in my mind. If you are in the mood for a refreshing lager or a satisfying "lawnmower" beer, I recommend that you give Molson Canadian a try. If you happen to pay $20.99 plus tax for a 20 pack like I did, all the better! Cheers Bros.","PorterPro125","Feb 18, 2014"

3.68,31,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Ok this is my go-to beer...even when I worked in the head-office of arch-enemy Labatt's...nothing to blow you away just one of the worlds very best Macrobrew lagers. I drink my beer lukewarm which is the real test of flavour. Canadian doesn't ever disappoint. It is THE exemplar of generic Canadian beer. Hoppier and punchier than any American offering but not bitter like a European brew. It's a crowd pleaser...not one to blow the socks off of an afficianado. But really if you are out in North America it is a safe call for a decent beer that is readily commercially available. Funny enough it is actually a premium brand in Canada with a premium pricetag. American beer is cheap as dirt here with a flavour to match. I still don't mind paying a little bit more for quality. Simple fact is there isn't much of a nose to any Canadian beer, I mean really if your wife has complained about how you smell so much like beer that she wants some then she is a special lady. Canadian beer has a certain standard amount of malty sweetness that is uncharacteristic of other beers worldwide, but it really adds to the drinkability factor. I am just more of a mass-appeal beer drinker than a niche-market microbrew kinda guy. But for the most part I notice that my everyday beers are still rated "good for a macro brew" by even the educated drinkers amongst us. I drink Canadian warm for christsake and would still reccommend it to anyone who will listen. I have had beers from all over the civilized world, it's comes down to personal taste. I personally like Canadian, Belgian, and Danish beer, in that order. That is just me though...","Philoveritas","Feb 02, 2014"

Funny, in US this seems to be the most popular variant, while in Canada i feel Molson Export or even Molson Dry is the big money maker in recent years at least. At any rate this is a solid and pretty well selling beer anywhere in North America. Pours a solid golden color, smell is pretty unobtrusive if not entirely mindblowing. Tastes very crisp, with a kind of sweet finish rather than the dry stickiness I find with budweiser and its ilk. Not the best beer in the world, in regards to the style I prefer Sleeman's, but now that I no longer live in Canada I'll take what I can get. The definitive "B+" brew, Molson is a damn fine beer year round.","bullwinkle88","Sep 12, 2013"

Admittedly a decent looking lager. Smell was absent. Taste was mostly just a jumble of adjunct product flavors. Mouthfeel was on the crisp side, and it was fairly smooth. It's not a bad beer, and it goes down fairly easily. The only reason I ordered it was that I hadn't had a Molson in years. So, now I have, and I probably won't again anytime soon.

Sitting here trying to enjoy something with flavor and aroma is a failure. It does however fit the bill of an adjunct brew and it is for the most part without fault. This isn't something that I would purchase if given options. However, I will admit that in my years between the age of 16 and 20 I consumed a metric shit ton of this as well as Yuengling.

Doesn't taste bad. Mouthfeel/body is light, with moderate carbonation. Overall, I think it's an average beer. For the style, it's not bad. It certainly wasn't hard to drink, I've had worse brews.

The mouthfeel is a bit watered down but not intolerable while the taste is a mish-mosh of grains, malts, and adjunts with little in the way of hops. However they are not entirely absent.

It's got flavor, and many dimensions of it...whether its a slightly bitter hop, a nice toasted corn, or a really malty fizzy gulp...it's all in there. The mouthfeel is very "alive", the drinkability is "all night long, every weekend" for many Canadians, and the smell is very attractive, no skunkiness, nothing offensive in this beer whatsoever.

Again, for the style, this is not all that bad. At least there is flavor. The beer is light in my mouth, but not as watery as others. The carbonation is not over-done, making it nice in my mouth. This beer is easy to sit down and have a session with. The generic pilsner is not my favorite style by a long stretch, but this is one of the better I have had, so If you want something cheap and available, this is not a bad choice.","kmpitz2","Aug 04, 2004"

3,6.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Pretty much Canadian "Bud". A decent lager, tastes ok, not too hoppy. Goes good with the Bruins, only if they are playing in Canada and you are there. Also good on St. Catherine Street.","bewareOFpenguin","Oct 18, 2002"
3.31,17.8,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Better than Bud, Miller or Coors. Nothing spectacular though it is an all around good lager that quenches the thirst. A definite brew to pair with pepperoni pizza.","Jason","Oct 11, 2002"
2.6,-7.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"I really do not care for this beer or any molson beer, it gives me really bad gas.  Light color and body with no hops or malt just a bunch of corn and rice.  My mother in law comes and she brings the crap, so i have to drink it and my wife puts up with the gas.","kunzbrew","Sep 26, 2002"
2.33,-17.1,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"This Molson Canadian lager is so unique for its style I just am almost at a loss for words. I am picking up some tart (sour) and sweet with hints of a toasted something or another. Major unorchestrated eclectic stuff going on here.","BeerBob","Aug 27, 2002"
1.88,-33.1,2,1.5,2,2,2,"For me, this was just one of those beers I didn't want to try because it just looks like it's going to be bad. Maybe it's the pseudo-generic labeling, who knows. Either way this was not very good. Crispness was about all it had going for it.","Dogbrick","Aug 01, 2002"
2.65,-5.7,2,2,3,2.5,3,"This beer poured a light yellow color and formed a small bubbly white head that left little lace as it quickly subsided. An aroma of hops and grain. A flavor of hops and bread/dough. A very light body and clean finish. Of the macrobrews available to us in the U.S. from Canada, I find this one to be the most drinkable. It may be a poor rendition of what the Canadians have available to them, until the laws change, our choices are limited.","Wildman","May 22, 2002"
2.48,-11.7,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,3,"Lits of rice and corn in thiss one.. not much malt or hops.  Not undrinkable.. just not impressive in any way.  The beer is quite plain tasting and needs malt badly.  As a result there is no real body to the beer.","frank4sail","May 02, 2002"
3.05,8.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,4,"Reminds me of watching many nights of "Hockey Night in Canada" on CBC. Pale in color, slightly sweet, light twang of hops on the finish, somewhat grainy. A highly drinkable and decent lager and one I pick up from time to time. Not a flavor powerhouse, but a sentimental favorite as its my beer of choice at Red Wing's hockey games.","proc","Apr 09, 2002"
3.66,30.2,4,3,4,3,4,"Before the craft beer movement, this brew was a regular purchase on beer runs to Canada. Much fresher and tastier than the US import version.","John","Oct 18, 2001"
3.4,21,3,3,4,3,3,"Smooth and well balanced.  Consistent from start to finish.  This is the beer that comes to mind when I think of the typical Canadian lager.","Brent","Aug 20, 2001"
