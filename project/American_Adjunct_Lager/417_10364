It's a corny lager, not my favourite, but probably my second favourite. It's sort of sweet, which is my only complaint, but it's a nice sweetness. We like sweet here. Give me a Jucy Lucy and a Premo and some fries and I'm in fucking heaven. GBP is liquid history, a regional brand that somehow didn't get sucked into the multinational brewing conglomeration, a fucking time capsule. Your grandfather drank this beer. And so do his grand kids. I'm grateful for that and I'm proud that Pennsylvania and Minnesota somehow managed to keep the wolves at bay and retain their regional brewers (Schells in Mn's case, who keep the GB torch alight). A far from useful, but from the heart drunken review. You are welcome.","mjryan","Jun 13, 2014"

The initial flavor is sweeter and somewhat fruitier than most American Lagers. But the after taste is a bit malty and grain-filled. I like that. It also has a fullness to the mouthful that I enjoy. The coloring is a beautiful gold, and although the smell is faint, it is inviting (especially on warm days).","Ilafan","Feb 10, 2013"

The taste is really nice for the style, drinks crisp with just the tinniest hint of blueberry, which really works for me. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, leaving just a bit of sweetness in the mouth.

Nose was the standard for the style - a slight lager sweetness upstaged by odd scents, in this case including a grapiness. Mouthfeel was medium and it was not as bad in the mouth as I was girding myself for. It was a typical AAL with the usual lager sweetness accompanied by cereal flavors.

However despite this beers failure to be unique and different it does go down as an enjoyable beer that is quite drinkable with a sweeter plate of food or desert.","ryantupy","Aug 07, 2005"
3.63,11.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Grain Belt has two strikes against it right off the bat: the name and the clear glass bottle. Ultimately, though, they matter not. I do like the label and the cap; they ooze old school cool. This is one of the better (microbrewed) macro lagers in existence. Like anything else, it has its time and its place. I could see myself buying at least a few sixers every summer if it ever makes its way this far south.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 03, 2005"

3.25,-0.3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Wow! I've heard so much about this from old timers. Here's my chance. Pours a one-finger white (mildly yellow) head of large bubbles over a crystal clear faint golden liquid. Smells of noble hops and faintly of malt sweet. My guess would be Hallertauer hops or maybe Saaz. Not tinny enough to be Saaz, IMO. Tastes clean and malty. Some hop floral is present, but almost no hop bitter. Yeah, thin malt with mild hop floral, and that's about it. Perhaps a hint of munich malt in the form of the chalky dry I associate with munich. Pretty easy drinking. I can see why this was such a hit many years ago before craft beers came out. Doesn't hold a candle to craft beer, but it's a touch better than macro-swill. Light body (not super light, just light) and moderate, but sharp carbonation.","mentor","Apr 25, 2005"
2.97,-8.9,2.5,3,3,2,3.5,"Pours a clear and crisp golden color. Quick fading foamy white head. Smells of corn and grains, very sweet. Taste is sweet, pretty much all sweet grains, no noticable hops. This is a smooth drinking macro, not bad at all. The sweetness can get to you. And unfortunately a night of grain belts leaves me feeling like crap the next morning.","bnuttz","Feb 17, 2005"

4.28,31.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"One of my all-time favorite beers. Granted, a lot of my love for this beer comes from the fact that it is what my Dad drank when I was younger and I distinctly remember fetching these beers for him and sometimes getting a sip. In addition, this was my staple session/party beer in college. I was and still am proud to drink this and I am very happy that Schell's revived it (smart profit move on their part too!). Anyway, pours a very clear, light yellow straw with a cottony fluff of cloud-white head that sticks around and even laces the glass. Aroma is mild, but nice; lightly sweet, crisp, honeyish malts, and some lemony hop notes. Smells refreshing! Crisp, light malty sweetness up front with whiffs of corn--good corn (fine, I'm obviously biased about this beer, but I don't care). Light hop bitterness has a hint of citrus in it and takes it into the finish. Light bodied and refreshing. A great summer party beer. Takes me back to my college days everytime! Thank you Grainbelt!","alexgash","Feb 13, 2005"

3,-8,3,3,3,3,3,"Taste is light and sweet, not corn but elements of apple and pear. No off-flavors but quite sweet with a faint maltiness. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy, not much substance.

4.16,27.6,3,4.5,5,4,2.5,"Grain Belt Premium has a lot of history in the twin cities, too bad it is not made here anymore. Schell's took over but they still do a good job. The old Premium had one of the most distinctive tastes ever, very very sweet. It was great out of a bottle but when out of a can it tasted like the can. I've only had the new premium out of a bottle and it is much more watered down. Even with the new watered down taste, this beer is not a mass consumption beer even though countless of us students at the U of M think it will be. Take my advice don't get plowed off it or you will spend the night in the bathroom.","TeamSeinfeld","Apr 03, 2004"
3,-8,3,3,3,3,3,"This brew is a pale gold color, small white head on top. The scent is sweet malt. The taste of this brew is on the malty side, sweet taste, corny. Not a great brew by any means, but if youre going for a macro style beer with some decent flavor, this could be a good one to try. Comprable to high life.","Tballz420","Feb 23, 2004"
1.93,-40.8,2,1.5,2,2.5,2,"Clear light gold color, small head, terrible old corn aroma, very light corn taste, just a touch of malt sweetness. I guess you can tell its not a light, but I would take any Miller product over this. The third worst beer I've ever tasted. From the past reviews I'll assume its better when its fresher.","grynder33","Jan 19, 2004"
3.3,1.2,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Well, this is a beer that certainly has some history in the twin cities. I'm glad that Schell's was able to purchase the brand, keeping it in the state. I also beleive they have improved the quality of Premium. It seems much more consistent, and while it remains an adjunct beer I beleive the former brewer was using even more than the classic recipie called for. Schell's commitment to excellence certainly shows. All in all, this isn't a beer that would win a lot of fans on this site, but it stands up favorably to similar american pale lagers. If you beleive in supporting a local brewery this is a fine choice. It is what it is.","JeffreyG","Dec 19, 2003"
2.55,-21.8,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Clear yellow hue, sad in color really, there was no animation, the head was white, the height never reached a fourth of a finger before it faded to a soapy collar before disappearing entirely. No subsequent lace either. The nose had minimal potency, slightly sweet, not so much from malt but from adjuncts. It is not really worth smelling. I was surprised at how bad the palate was, awfully sweet, like cream corn, slightly grainy, like cereal and as a whole it is borderline unpleasant. Id say the sweetness is almost cloying. This has the taste of a cheap American industrial lager and it makes no point to pretend otherwise. There is no malt influence, no hops bitterness or flavor either. In fact some hops would have been a welcomed addition to cut the sweetness. But that is not what this beer is about. There are minimal flavors that are favorable. Medium-light body, firm carbonation, overall it has a good mouthfeel, but I had a difficult time getting past the taste. One (clear) bottle was enough for me, Im glad I tried it, Im glad I reviewed it, Im glad I didnt buy a six-pack to do so. Otherwise there would have been five beers poured down the drain. Not recommended, as this is a poor example of the style.","bditty187","Dec 09, 2003"
2.63,-19.3,2.5,2,3,2,3,"I actually liked this much better when I had it out of a can (or maybe that was the "old" grainbelt?) It also seemed to work better in the summertime. In any case it's OK for the price.","jwilli7122","Dec 07, 2003"
4.13,26.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The Minnesota Brewing Company version was a beer that i drank gallons of, so when that stock ran out, I got this. (You can tell the difference by the bottle caps, the MBC had an "M" surounded by stylized hops and grain, the new one is the classic Grain Belt Logo). The beer has definitely changed since I last had it. It is more balanced, and less sweet than it's predecessor. It still has it's crystal clear gold color, and small white head. My favorite beer of the low cost, American lager sub-category.","TastyTaste","Oct 02, 2003"
2.9,-11,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Crystal clear like apple juice is the color of this brew. A thick white head did meet the top of my glad but it rapidly faded away to nothing. A sweet aroma to this brew. Malt comes to mind, maybe corn and wheat? The taste is a dead match. Nothing to overpowering but nothing to rave about. It is a decent brew that works well with food. Good to clean the palate but leave the taste buds for the desert beer.","Stubbie1","Aug 04, 2003"
2,-38.7,2,2,2,2,2,"Comes in a clear bottle that showcases its extremely pale staw color. In fact, I can see right through the darn thing! More like an Italian chardonnay in color than a beer. Sports a modest white head throughout-to its one credit I guess?! Aromas hint straight off of adjunct-lots of corn here folks! The beer actually tastes like a can of "light" cream corn-if there is such a thing. The mouth feel is redolent of water, and as the beer warms in the glass it loses its carbonation with the quickness of a cat, and actually, almost passes for water! Grain belt finishes with a lingering "frito corn chip" flavor! If you like em corny and flat this one is for you brave drinker!!","moulefrite","Jul 24, 2003"
1.88,-42.3,2.5,2,1.5,1.5,2.5,"Draft, Minneapolis. Had this after washing the taste of a Labatt's Blue out of my mouth, but it was only a slight improvement. Since this really is my father's beer (that and Hamm's), and because it has such a generic name, it's a little hard to approach without preconceptions. What I find is the usual pale American Standard color, not much head. I did get a hint of lager yeast taste, but not too much else. When we had to leave, I didn't really want to stay and finish this. Schell's keeps this going because of nostalgia and name recognition as this area's standard cheap beer, but they'd really do well to push more of their own brand.","DrunkMcDermott","Jul 04, 2003"
2.68,-17.8,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Clear pale straw, decent head of short duration, but a left over ring laces the glass. Slighly metallic but sweet aroma, light corn syrup malt indications. The taste is similar, fairly corn husk in nature. Decent body, sturdier than Pig's Eye, but with flavor demonstrating less fruit. Slighly less carbonated late in the profile than the Minnesota Brewing version to my tongue. Hops are a little disappointing and sort of Miller High Life typical. A decent macro for those who like to support local economies but won't stray from American Lager. Thanks to Schell for preserving the brand, it meets a need...","ADR","Beers"
