4,60.6,4,4,4,4,4,"I have to qualify my feelings about IC beer. I do NOT like heavy hops IPA beers. A lot of mentions of ICB tasting like piss. I've never drunk piss, but I imagine the piss of an old drunk would taste like an IPA. I drink beer because I'm thirsty and I like a little buzz when I'm home on the weekends. ICB is refreshing, and doesn't make me want to go gargle to get rid of the obnoxious taste in my throat. Somebody mentioned PBR in their comparison with ICB. I really don't care for the the taste of PBR, or a heavy IPA when I'm thirsty, and that's the only time I drink beer. I don't give a crap about the head and how long it lasts - could we be a little more pretentious? Lacing? JC Almighty - it's BEER. I like a beer without a sour aftertaste, like most IPA's I've tried. I like Iron City Beer. I don't know what's wrong with your noses, I have never smelled any of the odors others have described. Maybe they should pick there noses and blow them before they drink. I wish ICB was distributed in VA, but it isn't. When my MIL was still alive, and we'd go visit her, I'd bring back 6 cases of IC Light, and a couple of regular IC. Beer drinkers that try to act like wine connoisseurs are a little over the top for me. It's beer, enjoy it when you're thirsty. If you want to get drunk drink Jack. I find is tastes and, smells very good, and it is refreshing.","QinVA","Oct 18, 2013"

Right then and there I decided not to bother pouring it into a glass, I didn't want to dirty another dish for nothing. The taste screams "malt liquor" only it doesn't have all the alcohol percentage to make up for the bad taste. The flavor I can only describe as if someone cooled a molten rod of steel into some watered down horse piss. It had a carbonation sting at the tip of my tongue and coats the back of my throat like phlegm from a mild cold. And then, after only one beer comes the headache. It was 9.50 for a 12 pack, I could have made a better choice but I wanted to try something new. I probably wont drink it again unless a tribal chief of headhunters gave it to me as a gift and I was afraid of insulting them by not drinking it therefore having my head wind up on a pike.","Charles_Basch","Sep 08, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strange twinge of lemon-like fruit that just seems out of place and enhances a heretofore low-lying metallic quality.

It tastes mostly of fermented bread dough and apple cider with some musty grain and a hint of lemon in the finish and slight bitterness in the aftertatse. It soon becomes rather bland and the feel is soft. It's not bad, is quite drinkable, and better than many but also far from very good.

The aroma is very faint with some sweet corn notes hidden in there. The taste reminds me of the Wilkinsburg-Penn Joint water used to brew this beer. The sweetness of corn and rice adjuncts is the backbone with some mild hop bitterness here to form one great summertime lawnmower beer. Not an all grain beer but much better than the adjunct ridden garbage Anhueser Busch throws at us. I will definitely "drink locally and think globally" in this situation.

It receded away very nicly leaving behind plenty of white lace. I felt that the aroma was non-offensive by having an aroma of swwet grains and maybe a pinch of sweet malt in the background. I thought the taste was complex, but not the complex taste you would look for in a beer. The taste was complex in grains like corn and rice and ended with a slight taste of sweet malt.

The head was white in color but surprisingly frothy even though it was only a half finger in height at its highest point. Head retention was fair; it faded quickly to a soapy cap, more naked spots then foam. There was no subsequent lacing. The appearance is average. My first sniff said, corn. It is cold enough that I smell little else. The aroma is, obviously simplistic but not offensive at its present state. Still it is hardly inviting. Once warmer it smells like husk and dog food. That isnt good! I guess that is why they make the bottle so snazzy; if you drink it straight from the aluminum chamber you cant smell it! And as such you cant taste it! That might be the goal of most beer drinkers, not me though. Well, the palate is not awful. It is sweet and corny like a Busch; I cant see much of a difference actually. Hop bitterness is minimal. Hop flavor is none. Maltiness? Youre joking right? I cant taste any. It is tolerable when cold. However, as it warms it turns sloppy, like wet grain, husk, and stale water with a sweet, empty finish. Ive heard horror stories about this beer from swill drinkers but I didnt find it to be *that* bad. Could I set down and drink a six-pack? I wouldnt want too, and since I only have one bottle I dont have too. Medium in body, modest carbonation, the mouthfeel is very solid and it saves this beer from being too watery or too sweet. There is an odd lemony aftertaste. On the whole, this beer (for an Adjunct Lager) is okay. Should Pittsburgh be proud of this beer? No. Ashamed? Well, its not much cup of beer.

Smells mildly sweet (honey-like) with faint hop (Saaz? or perhaps that's just metal from the 'bottle) and maybe a bit of orange. Tastes weakly malt sweet with hop bitter--a bit to strong for the limited sweetness. A metalic flavor, I'm hoping is from the hops, is present from start to finish. Fruity flavors consist of cantelope (which I think is correctly called muskmelon) and a bit of peach. A sour carbonation fizz persists on my tongue after the swallow. Thin mouthfeel.

2.03,-18.5,2.5,2,2,2,2,"Pale golden hue, tiny strings of carbonation; your macro-typical nose offerings in the way of husky grain and the much desired cooked veggies. Up front, rather weak bodied, some light hop detection, corn and husky flavorings. Watery and metallic in the body, worsens as it warms; don't hurt yourself searching for this one.","GeoffRizzo","Dec 24, 2003"
2.43,-2.4,2.5,2,2.5,2,3,"i figured since i was in pittsburgh (well, west virginia really), i'd drink what the locals drank. i've had thuse brew before and been underwhelmed and was once again, though less so than before. pours a light golden color with virtually no head. typical macro smells and tastes here: low on hop, malt and grain characteristics, high on corn and watery ones. not as bad as a macro but not much better. would i get it again? sure, because unless your in the city of pittsburgh, i've found that it's hard to come across anything else but the macros and maybe a heineken here and there in that area of the country.","SixpointJMH","Oct 16, 2003"

2.48,-0.4,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,3,"This is simply cheap beer that is drinkable. That is all. The beer is pretty much water and filler-alot of that corn flavor thing going on. If I was a broke factory worker in need of some decent refreshment after a long hard day, I could find some semblance of comfort in an Iron City. A decent mass produced softie that will whet your whistle, and leave your wallet be. That is all.","moulefrite","Aug 11, 2003"
2.21,-11.2,3,2,2,2.5,2.5,"This beer poured a pale yellow in color with little aroma. It's typical for a light beer such as bud light, but had a little more color to it. It went down rather smooth much like water. I drank this beer because it was the only option at a church picnic in PA. Probably would not have had it otherwise and probably won't have it again.","yosh","Jul 21, 2003"
2.6,4.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Iron City: this beer, apparently bought on a lark was not as big a disappointment as I had expected. It poured a pale yellow, although it had a lot more color than a Bud. The aroma was fairly weak, and predominately adjuncts. The beer, as is absolutely typical for the style, was perfectly clear. The taste was surprising smooth for an American style macro, on the other hand, the corn taste overwhelmed everything else in the brew. The beer did taste fresh, however, and the aftertaste was not unpleasant. Above average for the style, below average overall.","jackndan","May 31, 2003"

3.09,24.1,3.5,2,3.5,2,4,"Forty of Iron City, this was and continues to be a staple of my hometown. I have found myself low on cash as of lately, and I figured what better times to go back to my roots. Pours a true golden tone with a highly carbonated thick white head that could be compared to the billowing smoke clouds that that left the steel mills of Pittsburgh's past. Everything about this beer says it's classic, you have to love the old school label. The aroma is a very faint bitterness with some sweet tones hidden in there. The taste however is the true reason to throw back this beer, it is a crisp American lager not too watered down, definitey packs some flavor. The sweetness of corn and rice adjuncts is the backbone with some mild hop bitterness here to form one great summertime lawnmower beer. Not an all grain beer but much better than the adjunct ridden garbage Anhueser Busch throws at us. I will definitely "drink local and think globally" in this situation. A light to medium body that is true to it's American lager profile. I will always keep a place in my heart for this historic beer of the city I was born in.","WVbeergeek","Mar 29, 2003"
2.57,3.2,4,2,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Pours a medium gold color topped by a slightly off-white head. This beer maintains a thin layer of foam atop the beer, but not quite as well as IC Light. The fairly light aroma is very grassy with a slight sweet grain note. The taste has a noticeable sweetness followed by a bit of bitterness. There is a slight harshness in the mid-taste. The aftertaste is a lingering sweetness. The mouthfeel is solid, especially for a macro. Carbonation mixes well with the body of the beer, so you actually can tell there is something in your mouth. And it feels good. The drinkability is pretty much average. You can drink a few of these, and you might want to if you're in the right mood. Between this and IC light, the IC light would be in my glass. But what can be better than drinking a cold "Arn" on a rainy day while the Pirates are on TV? Obviously, I couldn't think of anything, because that's my afternoon. If you see Iron City, give it a try.","aaronh","Mar 29, 2003"

2.05,-17.7,2,2,2,1.5,2.5,"It was pale yellow with no sustainable head. It kind of smelled like corn and grain to me. On tasting, there was only a tiny bit of malt and hops, but mainly grain and a little vegetable. It was quite light in body. I wouldn't say this is a good beer, but I do love that it a regional brew deeply connected with the city.","yen157","Sep 23, 2002"
2.63,5.6,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Crystal clear straw hue topped by a typically meager head indicative of ample adjunct use.  The relatively clean, but unenticing aroma is comprised of sweet corn, a touch of DMS, and a barely perceptible floral hop nose.  The bland flavor is dominated by corn, but corn sweetness and cooked cabbage thankfully aren't as overbearing as other American lagers.  Husky 6 - row notes are assertive, but aren't astringent & provide the only noteable malt character of this brew.  The hop bitterness is above the norm compared to the mundane American lager, & when coupled with the sharp carbonation, this beer is almost biting in mouthfeel.  Finishes bittersweet from corny sweetness and light hop bitterness.  Iron City is bland and expectedly adjunct - laden, but is perhaps a notch above other domestics.","marc77","Jul 10, 2002"
2.2,-11.6,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Notes: Not very clean at all, better off just sticking with a Bud, Miller or Coors than tangling with this brew. A sub-premium American Lager that is not worth my time.","Jason","Jun 11, 2002"
2.6,4.4,2,2,3,3,2.5,"This beer poured a verly pale yellow color and formed no head and no lace. An aroma of hops and grain. A flavor of grain and some dough aspects. Finish was extremely light and some bite present. I am not a big fan of this beer, but have had a chance to try it on many occasions. I find it to be no better than the other smaller macrobrews like Rolling Rock. But the cult following of this is amazing. I went to a party in college and all the people who lived there were Iron City drinkers. We were all drinking the usual keg swill and they were walking around with bottles of Iron City. Went upstairs and they had filled the bathtub with ice and filled it with Iron City.","Wildman","May 22, 2002"
1.4,-43.8,1.5,1.5,1,1.5,2,"This beer  focuses on marketing and promotions but should instead change their recipe. First glimpse is of a pale, sickly yellow brew. What little head there is is weak and artificial.  Smell is weak and not fresh, and is reminiscent of cooked corn.  Slight sweet malty overtones with too little hops. Corn and rice adjuncts are almost overpowering and get worse as the brew warms up. Tastes chemical like.  Must almost be drunk at near freezing temperatures to remain palatable.","psugrad98","May 22, 2002"
2.23,-10.4,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Hmmm, seems like fdoosey has a point, as our sample of Iron City wasn't particularly metallic.  Pours with a small white head.  Has a clear bright yellow color.  Smells faintly salty, sour, but not much.  Tastes watery malty, slightly salty.  Sour aftertaste.  Surprisingly medium-light body.  Might be a good lawnmower beer, but not much else.","htomsirveaux","Mar 14, 2002"
2.55,2.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Light to medium yellow. Mildly grainy nose. Almost discernible hop bitterness. A slightly sweet underlying flavor makes what would be a typical american lager actually taste like something other than carbonated water.","inebrius","Mar 08, 2002"

1.83,-26.5,2.5,2,1.5,2,2,"VERY metallic to the point of distracting the assessment of what little flavor the lager would have anyway...color clear straw, smells lightly of pine...bars that tend to have this on tap also tend to maintain their tap system very poorly, not adding to the beer's appeal...and Pittsburgh Brewing contract brews Samual Adams...historically, I think Iron City was one of the first canned beers (I think with pull-off tabs?)...","ADR","Feb 27, 2002"
