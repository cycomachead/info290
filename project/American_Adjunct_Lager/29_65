When that was finished, I chased it all down with the host's Budweiser. Honestly, it's not a bad beer considering the fancy stuff I've grown accustomed to. On the surface it looks terrible. It pours a bland straw colored color with little head. Not the most attractive looking beer for sure. The aroma for me is off putting. A non fresh graininess followed by a piss like odor. The taste is nice though; smooth, clean and a simple grainy flavor. Pretty watery and non complex but not terrible. The feel is my favorite; crisp, refreshing, light and drinkable. A good session beer and not a bad choice to watch football with. I won't start buying it but I won't turn down if offered to me.","Gajo74","Jan 11, 2015"

Overall I guess it's good for what it was meant for which is drinking fast and without much thought.","Blueapollo420","Nov 18, 2014"

But would I buy this for myself…No I’m sorry I wouldn’t.

Overall even though this isn't the worst or best beer, it's something that everyone has had or will have at some point.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 26, 2014"

My rating would be much lower had this not been the serving style. When that's not available, settle for it in cans. Glass bottled Bud can be downright nasty. To this day I still don't know why there's such a difference. One of my favorite macro lagers. There's a lot of hate for this beer but for what it is, it's better than most. You owe it to yourself to try it if you haven't yet.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 15, 2014"

2.89,23,3.75,2.75,2.75,3,3,"Pours a very pale straw gold with perfect clarity and a loose white head that fell quickly. There is almost no nose on this beer except for a bit of sweetness and as it warms it does start to smell a bit like rice. The taste is also more than subtle with a very neutral rice character that you can begin to taste once you learn that the adjunct in this one is rice not corn. It does have a strange sweetness that could be from the yeast ro could be from the malt, it's hard to define. When I first tasted it I assumed corn, and that's how I found out there is no corn in this. It has a good carbonation but without much flavor that can seem a bit sharp. It actually finishes pretty well. Most corny adjuncts finish with a big sweet bite and a drying out but this one finishes balanced, and completely albeit dry. It does have a bit of an aftertaste like overcooked rice.","utopiajane","Mar 20, 2014"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and slight vegetal aromas. Taste is much the same with watery grain, rice, and slight vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is somewhat drinkable but just boring and watery all around.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 17, 2014"

It is not much different than many of the retro brews that have gain popularity. I have done a few blind taste test against some of the other more favorable adjunct lagers and I found Budweiser actually taste better. The beer has a soft water feel in the mouth. It finishes with a crisp aftertaste. I guess if I had a choice of adjuncts, rice would be my choice over corn. The slight dimethyl sulfide finish makes it appealing.","nota","Mar 11, 2014"

Its where I, and I'm sure much of you, started way back when we didn't know any better. I'd say this is my "back-up" while exploring the world of brews. An "if all else fails" beer, so to say.

But for whatever reason, Budweiser is a completely different beer on tap. Now granted almost every beer is a little bit better on draft, but very few taste as noticeably different (and far better at that) than Budweiser does on tap. It's almost staggering, because the draft Budweiser is very smooth, but not bland to even the slightest, and has a sweet, yet malty taste with an after taste you'd expect from a beer aged in wooden barrels. I often like ordering it and asking Bud haters (beer Hipsters) to try it, playing it off as something else, and they end up liking it a lot, shocked to find out that it's Budweiser. My guess is that they water down their canned and bottled counter parts to save money, because It's awful. But Budweiser is a damn good beer on tap.","OogieBoogie3","Feb 01, 2014"

2.35,0,2.25,2.25,2.5,2.25,2.25,"Sooner or later a beer ticker will get around to reviewing this classic icon of American macrobrewery homogenous mediocrity, and my opportunity as such arrived about an hour before midnight this New Years eve, wondering what the hell to have from a really limited tap selection. Why not watch the Flames continue to stink while drinking the flagship offering of the huge brewing empire that basically now owns the 'Dome? As expected, this one is ghostly pale, although maybe a tiny bit darker than some of its competitors, a light golden straw color speckled with white foam and full of bubbly geysers from top to bottom. Looks like someone dropped an Alka-Seltzer tablet into diluted apple juice. Smells of doughy old malt, corn sugar, a middling green apple ting, and wasted youth. Tastes like fizzy water, perhaps one of the least flavorful beers I've tried, although if you scrunch up your brow and focus you will get a little sweet white bread, the aforementioned green apple fruitiness, a stale earthy hop bitterness, some other sweet flavor that tastes decidedly artificial. To be fair, this tastes better than some of its competitors, the off-flavors are muted and clearly someone wanted this to taste palatable (or perhaps taste like as little as possible) ... I get a little plaster or starchy glue but no clear metal or plastic. The finish is remarkable in a way, you get a bit of that artificial sweetness for a moment, followed by a clean bitterness and then nothing at all, like a drop of water instantly evaporating: The aftertaste is there and then its gone. Poof. The massive carbonation scrubs the palate clean. Apparently the distinctive Czech pilsener this is (very) loosely based on, Budvar, includes a hint of vanilla flavor from the malt-hops combination used and lo and behold, I did notice this here although perhaps this is just the power of suggestion. There it is. Moving right along.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 01, 2014"

Taste follows nose with a sweet, sour, tangy sharpness with some slight bitterness at the end. Grain husk, slightly grassy and vegetal. Extremely crisp due to high carbonation, and mouthfeel is on the thin end of medium. American Budweiser isn't nearly as bad as the pretentious beer snobs want to think it is, especially fresh on draft. Look at any of the reviews with low marks, how many people actually took the time out to review the beer and state why it "sucks"? It doesn't. At all. Budweiser isn't a microbrew, but it does take craft to brew something so ubiquitous yet satisfying. This beer will still be selling when the IPA fad goes the way of the dodo.","Aaron_Ramson","Nov 21, 2013"

Aromas of light coarse grain light green apple and a moderate spicy floral hop. The flavor is a light sweet honey like bready maltiness. Just enough spicy hop to counter the sweetness and light hop bitterness. Light body with moderate level of carbonation and a slick sharp mouthfeel. Quite a contrast from the PBR. This is lighter and less sweet but still falls well into the style guide.","johnnnniee","Sep 29, 2013"

It doesn't even have the normal refreshing mouthfeel of a lager, really the only thing keeping it from having 1s across the board is that while bland, it's not completely disgusting.

It's like drinking ... it's like when you used to brush your teeth with baking soda as a kid. In short...you would have to be looking for a very cheap buzz to drink this stuff.

Nothing much came through in the aroma, the mouthfeel was crisp and clean with a refreshing finish. Taste was simple as you should expect from a adjunct Lager, the fact that you can find this all over the World should hint at the respect it deserves from the standpoint of the Brewmasters who started this brand on its path. That being said beers such as Grain Belt have more flavor "sweet corn" to speak of but aren't found in almost every store in the United States, people can afford it, find it and pound it....that's what makes it The King of Beers...not the best beer by any means...neither were most Kings if you think about it...but a beer that is one of the best at being what it was brewed to be...a popular beer for the people.","Bear1964","Aug 28, 2013"

It gets worse towards the end once the beer begins to warm up. Normally, good quality beers get better as they warm up since you get more flavors but with this one all you get is more diluted flavors and a stronger alcohol taste. It does have some flavor but it's weak and not memorable. It's actually kind of sad since I know that Anheuser Busch has the capabilities to make this a better beer but they never will. American Macro beers don't have to be this bland. It is what it is and unfortunately this is what Americans are now used to. I would give this beer a below average rating. It is still better than a Bud Light or a Coors Light.","Weston19","Aug 20, 2013"

This and probably either Samuel Adams, Pabst Blue Ribbon or Lone Star are my other favorite adjunct beers. But back to Bud; I love this beer. It is the most accessible beer at a fair price. It has a wonderful taste that makes up for its faint aroma. The taste is Mostly consistent of corn and grain. It's got a nice slick mouth feel that has a little creaminess to it but not a lot. I do love this beer; it's drinkable, smooth, tasty, and it's refreshing. A lot of beer geeks (snobs) slam it and think it's beneath them. But you gotta have a good go-to beer when you're not in the mood for a more experimental type beer. Maybe I'm a tad biased since I'm from St. Louis but still I highly recommend this beer to anyone if they're willing to actually try it without having a pre-conception of distaste.

To me it tastes watered down, I know it not, the flavors just don't do anything for me. Only reason I am reviewing is because it was left in my fridge.","screamking","May 26, 2013"

2.84,20.9,2.75,2.5,3,2.75,3,"this beer has an undue bad name. all their other products are garbage, from shock top to black crown, to bud light and on and on, but, this particular brew, the original, ive always preferred to its competitors, and it does have a useful part to play I think. it pours a yellow straw colored watery soda fizz mess with an average white head. the nose is a lot like the can, even when its from a bottle or on tap. an odd metallic smell, but there is some grain in here, and I can get hops if I focus on it. the flavor has a refreshing mellowness to it, and while this may be all cut up with corn and rice and whatever else, it does retain some nice malt flavors, light as they are, and the hopping is crisp. I mean, im never going to go out and buy this, but in a tiny foreign airport, a concert at some beer wasteland, or a ballpark with no better options, I actually really enjoy a Budweiser. it is also the first beer I ever legally bought in the united states when I was 21 returning from overseas, so it has some sentimental function as well. to me its the classic American working mans beer, nothing special, but far from repulsive too. say what you will about it, but it aint half as bad as a miller or coors, although black crown is unforgivable.","StonedTrippin","Feb 24, 2013"

There's also a reason it's the number one selling import, non-European beer in Europe, and the fastest growing beer in the world by volume. Despite what beer snobs may think, the vast majority of beer drinkers like a light, American-style lager beer. Bud is the quintessential model of that style. Their quality control is absolutely second to none. I've met with the management a number of times and their penchant for quality is amazing. So, Bud? It delivers exactly what it promises, a light, refreshing beer that is right down the middle of the road; not hoppy and not malty. If you want a smooth, easy-going beer, Bud is, well,... the king of beers.","OregonDuckinTexas","Aug 06, 2012"

Far too much carbonation. Appearance is what it should be. Its a go to beer and easily accessible.

The fact that an adjunct retained a head at all gives it a slightly above average score on the appearance. The smell of of strong adjunct and corn, With some wet bread. Actually smelled a little bit better than the standard for the style, Which is usually adjunct and water. It tasted of cooked corn with a slight hint of some sweetness and absolutely NO water. Worked wonderfully considering the fact that the temperature today is 105 degrees. The mouthfeel is this beers biggest attribute. The smoothest adjunct that I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Even stronger cooked corn flavor comes through, And there is quite a bit of carbonation but the mouthfeel makes this a beer that I could drink all day.

The aroma has faint malt character with a musty corn sweetness. I have never taken the time to concentrate on the aroma of this on the past, but damn... this is pretty bad! The taste isn't much better. The little amount of taste that comes through the prickly carbonation is corn, bread, and a bit of a twang. No hops to speak of. The mouthfeel is atrocious, light as a feather and carbonated to the max. Overall, I think this 12 pack is going to be difficult to get rid of.","homebrew311","Mar 22, 2012"

I never understood why so many flock to Bud Light. It's worth sacrificing a few calories to enjoy a more robust flavor and receive a mild kick from the 5.0% abv. At least this tastes like a beer. Certainly nothing spectacular, but it also doesn't deserve all the hate. If I'm at a sporting event or at a party, I won't shy away from bud.

Can it hold a candle to your local brews and IPA's or a Sam Adams Utopia? NO!! But its not trying to. It is a good refreshing after work beer. Im a chef and after 12 hrs on the line I want a refreshing easy drinker not a punch you in the face complex drink. I have a friend who is a beer sommelier..and he drinks Bud on the regular. If its good enough for a professional, its good enough for me. There is a time and place for everything, and at a bbq, tailgate or a few after work...Bud never fails.","LT23","Mar 06, 2012"

I was somewhat surprised at the bit of lacing, and also the head that lasted the whole time. Taste and smell - we all know it's not a highlight here. Mouthfeel was on the smooth side, and it went down fairly easily while it's cold. Not as watery as I remember. Not a great beer, but it's a staple at all sporting venues. And I guess it's better than Bud Light.","morebeergood","Feb 04, 2012"

Aroma is light and inoffensive. Mildly grainy, not much hop presence, it is not bad, just not especially good. Flavor is similar, mildly sweet, light and unassuming. Mouthfeel is light, good carbonation, dry, refreshing, exactly what this beer should be. I do understand why people give this lower grades, and I expected to give it lower marks, but it is an adjunct lager and it is so inoffensive and unassuming without any significant off flavors that I cant.

It's certainly not a style that I'm a fan of but I'd say it's pretty average for an American Adjunct Lager. Has a grainy taste with maybe some rice, nothing about it is strong though, like the smell it tastes a little cheap, I wouldn't say they exactly use high quality ingredients. The moutnhfeel isn't that great, feels a bit watered down, not that drinkable either. No matter how hard they try, I can never consider this the "King of Beers" it's just too weak.

3.22,37,4,2,3,3,5,"I have been to a couple Budweiser promos and I have to say that they do a good job in presenting their beer. Compared to some typical heavy micro/craft ales (which I do love, btw), Budweiser is a flavorless beer. But compared to other lagers in its class, it is actually an exceptional example of craftsmanship. The quality and consistency is excellent, and when you pour it "right down teh middle", the head retention is surprising. They served this side by side with Yuengling Lager and I was amazed by the difference. Bud doesn't have any corn in it, which gives Yuengling, and most other macros, their typical frathouse stink. What I also noticed is that Bud uses a very clean tasting yeast that leaves no hint of character. Yuengling on the other hand, had a surprisingly perceptible spicy bavarian note that I usually get from a traditional Bock (and I will admit I only managed to notice in the bland environment of a budweiser tasting). Head to head, the Yuengling actually came off as offensive, a shrewd tactic on AB's part. Cleanliness was a good thing for what I expect from Budweiser, though. Amidst the "subtelty" of the light malt and rice and barely perceptible hops, a flavorful yeast would just not fit in. If you view Budweiser as the delicate beer that it is, the result is actually a well-balanced, refreshing light lager. I wouldn't pair it with food, since it wouldn't even support a sauteed white fish, but I do enjoy it on a hot summer day, when thirst quenching is the chief concern. It is what it is.","edstirling","Jul 22, 2009"

I actually have some fond memories of the flavor from back in my younger days before an oatmeal stout or even an IPA ever touched my lips. So...yes, extremely pale gold, very piss-like as so many have suggested over the years. However, the head actually is pretty fair as it settles to an even thin white fluff with decent lacing even! I think the aroma is quite passable, a light citrus and wheat, maybe a slight lemon, weak but not horrible at all. OK, now the taste. Watery blah, even in my depleted state of thirst, it just didn't happen for me. Very week flavored, thin bread-like, wheat a bit, even undercarbonated which surprised me. This may not have been the freshest bottle but nothing lasts too long in my fridge. As always, it's drinkable. Has a slight peppery finish, sort of tangy at the tip of your tongue. It beats light beer but compared to a real brew, this is light beer. Aftertaste is sour and unpleasant to me, which is consistent with my memories of the old all American standby. In all fairness, I have had plenty worse beers among the micro offerings and it does go down quick when you want to beat back a thirst.

Not much flavor at all, and not much aftertaste either. The only flavor I could really tell was the grainy/adjunct flavor of most macro-beers. I guess that's not completely a bad thing, because it is pretty non-offensive and easy to drink. The Budweiser was dated about 3 months since the born-on date, but it tasted the same as fresher Bud I've had. It's OK for a macro-lager.

It obscures the incredibly pale piss colored beer that it is in a sexy daark shroud with a 5 star logo in good ole red white and blue.

1.18,-49.8,2,1.5,1,1,1,"To date, Budwieser is consistently the worst beer I have ever had. Aside from one or two badly skunked Heinekens I've had, there hasn't even been any competition. If I had to drink either a cold Budwieser, or even a warm "Beast" (Milwalkee's Best if you've never been to a party paid for by college students who don't work) I'd take the Beast. The fact that anyone who's not a raving alcoholic voluntarily pays money to drink this crap (let alone that its far and away the best selling beer in the world) boggles my mind. First the color: It's a bright yellow that lends it self well to the use of the word "piss" as an adjective. Really, I don't find the color objectionable for its own sake. But the taste I've been conditioned to associate with that color is so bad it makes the color like a warning flag: if your beer is this color, don't drink it! And I will say that light, bright yellow has got to be the least beerlike color I've ever seen from a drink that we call beer. The smell is also objectionable because it hints at what to come. Fans would probably use words like "crisp" or "clean". Detractors like to use the word "piss" again. Me, I think it smells like alcohol that someone's spilled some not too strong but not pleasant household cleaners into. The taste is what kills me. That bitter gall combined with the disgusting chemical background and the cheap corn-rice-whatever adding just the tiniest bit of sweetness is what makes Bud so horrible. If I really try I can choke one down, but its hard to think of a realistic reason why I'd want to. Unlike a lot of people, I find the taste very strong, and it accumulates. Eventually it produces an almost physical reaction, and getting that last bit of sludge and foam down is especially hard. That's why I rated the mouthfeel and drinkability so low. The awful taste crowds out the light body and ruins the drinkability. How bad is Bud? Even if I have a dozen or more drinks and get competely hammered, I can still tell how completely awful it is. At this point I would not drink Budwieser at all. I think I would rather drink water or go entirely thirsty if my only alternative was Bud.","casualbeerman","Dec 29, 2005"

Most of the flavor is in the form of sweetness that I doubt really comes from a whole lot of malt. Tastes like all adjunct. But no flavor is better than bad flavor, as I've said before. The mouthfeel is a little heavier than water with very little carbonation hit. Good if you aren't looking for any sensation at all.

A very gentle hint of malt sweet after the beer had warmed. The pull tastes like water but this quickly turns to a dark malty with a carbonation burn/release. Then comes a malty sweet with some honey and melon charatecteristics. This late rising sweet fades as a very gentle hop floral rises. Tastes like a mix of 'plunky' hallertauer with a gritty 'spalt'.

I regrettably am about to take my first sip ever. The palate is bland, sweet, and clean. There really isnt much flavor and thus Buds popularity. Some graininess and husk is found way behind the vast nothingness. The finish is clean, empty.

To rate this, I had it in a taste test with three of the highest rated American lagers - Yeungling, Miller High Life, and Pabst Blue Ribbon. The Bud was (by far) the worst looking beer of the group, as pale as any beer I've ever seen. Small head, disappeared almost immediately. No lacing. Smell was nuetral. Taste is not bad (in this company). I am not a fan of American lagers, and this tasting did not make me want to go back to the "old days". This being said, there is nothing off-putting about Bud, and it was as good as the Miller or Pabst (the Yuengling, as expected, was the best of the bunch). Bud is a refreshing, drinkable beer, good for barbecues, fairs, and the beach. But for my tastes, I could find something (if available) that I would prefer, even in those circumstances.
