In the bottle it is an outstanding cheap drinker, but they must buy the left over cans from steel city, the taste coming out of a can is of licking the aluminum shavings off the brewery floor. And stay away from the light version too, the regular pilsner is light enough. So if you need a cheap bottle that goes down easy and will please most on a hot day. Drink up my friend... Bonus the mind teasers under the caps can keep a group of local drunks amused for hours of cheap fun!","Deerslayer210","Sep 17, 2013"

2.1,-27.1,4,1.5,2,2,2.5,"This is my first beer review ever, so I thought I'd start with a simple beer like Lionshead. I was first introduced to Lionshead my sophomore year at Penn State. Being from PA, I often see this beer at parties. It's cheap and decent tasting (considering it's inexpensiveness and sessioning ability). Most importantly, it's a crowd-pleaser! Each cap has a riddle on it with pictures, and you try to decide what phrase the pictures mean. This beer does not smell good (nor do I think it was even meant to be smelled). What does it smell like? Well, the only good descriptor I can give is that it smells like beer. It smells like a frat house the day after they had a big party and spilled a lot of Natty on the floor. It pours an orangeish-gold, very clear, no head. Its taste is very watery with mild carbonation. It has more beer taste than other session beers like Miller lite, Coors lite and Bud lite, but less than a regular Yuengling. Also, its mouthfeel is very light too. This beer is a good choice IF it's used what it's meant for - buying, serving, and drinking in bulk. One of the better session beers out there. People at your party will think "Thank god, not another party with only Bud Light... Oooh a puzzle!"","psusarahkate","Oct 18, 2012"

I'd love to find a great unsung American beer but this one doesn't do it...if you are in the PA vicinity best to go with Yuengling or even the better Penn offerings.

Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. Yow, but this was brighter than bright! Nose was pretty standard for the style - a lager sweetness overlain by all of the adjuncts that they could throw into the kettle. Move along folks, nothing new here. Mouthfeel was medium with a fairly pleasant sweetness on the tongue. Frankly, this was MUCH better than what I had in a bottle. I have noted this in a number of previous clinkers, reinforcing my preference for CANned beer. Finish was also pleasant, slightly refreshing, not too bad. Now, would I take up cooler space with this? It would really depend on pricing. If it was as competitively priced as it is in bottles, then "Yes!", but if it is comparable to other CANned AALs, I would probably let it sit.

But it goes down surprisingly well. It maintains a repectable head, but the cynic in me says that even the most sadistic of soldiers can afford a snazzy uniform. Forget the lemon smell and the Coors dressage, this beer was made for chuggage when its cooler older brothers Yuengling and Sam Adams are MIA, hot-rodding with hot chicks in fancy convertibles.

3.13,8.7,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Drinkability really isn't too bad considering this is on the low end of products made in PA. I used to buy this for about $13 a case when I was in college. Cheap beer but it's cheap tasting. It won't hold it's own with the greater pilsners out there but the drinkability is much better than many macros out there.","weeare138","Jun 16, 2005"
1.96,-31.9,3,2,1,3,3,"This beer poured with no incident and came out a straw yellow and very clear. Very much in line with a commercial pilsner. A slight head formed and stayed thin throughout, but did not vanish. Very little lacing with this beer. I was disappointed at the smell of this beer; not much hop aroma and I could detect the corn in this beer before it ever hit my lips. The taste unfortunately followed the smell. This beer tasted like it had more corn in it than malt; the taste was without character and left a slightly bitter aftertaste, the only sign of hops in this beer. An average mouthfeel for a pilsner, crisp and clean. While drinkable, I do not know why you would waste valuable drinking time on this; except for one thing, it is $11 a case in PA.","DevilDogBeer","May 02, 2004"
3.13,8.7,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Poured a very pale perfectly clear amber color with a nice white head that was long-lasting and dissipated to slight lacing. Smell is very light and not unpleasant. Taste is very light with only a moderate crispness and little mouthfeel except wetness. Easy to drink and cheap","tgbljb","Apr 14, 2004"
3.13,8.7,3,2.5,3,3.5,4,"11 dollars for a case of this stuff! eleven bucks! i almost wanna cheat on scoring it and give it all fives just for that. this is the beer my crew always gets when we're going to concerts and sporting events (we're poor). it has a light gold color to it, kinda weak on the head but relatively decent. smell isnt really there at all. crisp taste. great for hot summer days....but its kinda watery. if you want alot of flavor to your beer this one would bore you to tears. no hops to speak....very little in the taste department. but its refreshing nature saves it from a below average score. lionshead is a primetime session beer.","maek228","Nov 18, 2003"

3.3,14.6,3,3,3,4,4,"For 8 dollars a case, well, I'll probably return to this when I'm poor again. Still, not a "bad" beer, and certainly better than pretty much anything I've had from BMC. In the end, it's good to drink local, and support local businesses, right? That means Lion too.","ithacabaron","Beers"
3.5,21.5,2.5,2.5,4,3.5,4,"Lionshead is also a very drinkable brew. It does leave a noticable after-taste, but the remainder left on your tongue just makes you want another mouthful of beer. Moreover, it slides down the throat very easily, and it does not sit heavy in the stomach (no suprise for a pilsner).","theozag","0"
3,4.2,3,3,3,3,3,"One day a few fine years ago a couple of friends and i threw a few bucks together the buy a case of beer (and by few bucks i mean ten total). When we got to the beer store we asked for some natural ice, when I cought a glimpse of the case for lions head with a sign that read 8.99. Could this be? a bottled beer for less than ten a case, even the rancid natty ice was 12 bucks for bottles, so we grabbed the lions head. Upon opening the case I noticed the labels on the bottles looked as though they had been made on my computer, and the caps had no printing at all. At first pour it comes out a golden yellow, slightly darker than budweiser, and the aroma leads one to believe that its going to taste the same. The first taste is light with bubbles dancing no real descernable flavors perhaps some corn and a little hops at the end but otherwise nothing. I did notice despite the lack of flavor, it was as good or better than say a miller lite, and very very drinkable. Bottom line with this beer is if your broke its positively the way to go.","Ianhockey91","Feb 12, 2003"
3.07,6.6,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours to a soapy head that fades to a tiny ring around the glass. Strraw-gold in color. Generous carbonation. Weak nose of faint sweet malt reminicent of traditional German-made light lagers, with an anemic whiff of finishing hops. Taste is leaning to caramel (or corn syrup?) sweetness somewhat offset by the hops. Finishes with sweet residue on tongue. For the lower price it is not bad. It tasted like, uh...I dunno...a watered-down Lowenbrau?","EagleTalon","Oct 31, 2002"
3.05,5.9,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"This beer really suprised me. The case was priced a measily $9.99. These are the same folks that brew Stegmaier Porter, a nice selection, so I thought it worth a shot. The head is pretty thick and foamy but dies down quite a bit. There is a faint hops aroma and a bit of caramel in the nose. The beer has a very clean taste, almost like a blond ale but not a lot of flavor. There is a slight buttery taste that has only a small amount of hops to balance it out. For a pilsner, this is extremely unique. I am not sure what they are going for with this beer, but it a decent choice.","Maestro","Beers"
3.02,4.9,2.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Definately made with quality hops, malt, yeast and water, but not enough of anything to make it taste like anything. Though this beer is very thirst quenching and a good introduction beer to introduce people to new styles.","psugrad98","0"
