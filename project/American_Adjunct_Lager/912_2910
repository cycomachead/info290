I hold Dominican cuisine near and dear to my heart, so when I saw a Dominican brewed beer in the cooler, I had to pick it up to see what it was all about. While it's very much along the lines of a BMC offering, Presidente offers more flavor, a lot more character in the mouth, and serves as a refreshing beverage alongside some summer food. Will definitely be keeping this in mind for my next family BBQ.","ThePaintedGrey","Apr 26, 2014"

I've rated it relatively highly because it is, in my opinion and experience, exactly what I expected from a lager exported from a tropical country. It gets lots of points for being true to the style, but loses points subjectively, because as true to style as it is, it's not a style that I'm in love with by any means.

A chunky, frothy white head sits atop the surface and clings to the glass. Aromas are toasted grain and a hint of roasted corn, with a tangy floral highlight throughout. Flavors are very watered down, with a sharpness to them that makes this a tough drink. Toasted grains and a tangy, musty, bread-like character make up most of the palate. Part of this reaches a point where you don't want to know what else it is you are tasting. Bleh. The aftertaste is astringent and corn sweet, almost becoming syrupy.

It was the one aspect of the style that I truly CANsistently enjoy - it looked like liquid sunshine in the glass, brightening otherwise dull winter days. I know Stone's stance - "Fizzy yellow beer is for wussies" and so "[I am] not worthy" of some (all?) of their flagship beers, but so be it. This looked like what I think of when I think of "beer". The nose was still heavy on Saaz, but not skunky, so it must have been a pent-up whiff that escaped when I prised it open. Opening a green bottle = Forrest Gump's box o'chocolates = Russian roulette. You just never know what you are going to get. The head had fallen, leaving a little bit of sticky lacing in its wake. Mouthfeel was watery and it still tasted more of Saaz hops than of adjuncts in the mouth. It was more like a watery Czech Pils than an AAL. Finish was slightly husky, towards (but not heavy on) silage. Frankly, it was not too bad for the style and I wonder if it might be any better from a CAN.","woodychandler","Feb 20, 2011"

The aroma was about the malted cereal grains with a spatter of green olives and apple juice. It sounds worse than what it actually was. The taste was all about the cheap malted cereal grains. No hops or apple juice, just malted grains. I could actually taste the grains get maltier as the taste went on. That was until the end of the taste when they just faded away into oblivion. As you tell already, this was a light bodied beer with a ton of carbonation to it. The aftertaste was just a quick flash of malted grains. Despite my low score, this wasn't a totally bad beer.

3.26,21.2,3,2,3.5,4,4,"In Santiago, Dominican Republic this is the best beer. Forget Coors, this is the coldest tasting beer ever :) They serve it everywhere and it is 80% of all beer sales and you can see why. It has a light lager smell and no hop presence. It is served at very cold temperatures with ice forming on the bottles as is all beer actually. It is golden and gives some head but who cares. This is bottle drinking beer and can be slung back all day while sweating away in the Dominican heat.","Higravity","Feb 18, 2005"
3.35,24.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall-while the wonderful Carribean surroundings that I drank this beer in have to be mentioned, for a foreign lager this stuff wasn't so bad. It was smooth and had a nice alcohol bite at the end, not a beer to change the world and certantly not complex, but for the style and the surroundings it does its job just fine.","TheDeuce","Jan 02, 2005"

2.83,5.2,2.5,2,3,3,3.5,"The appearance was fine, very Pilsner/Lager like, clear golden maize color. The smell was a little lame, a little old maybe, a little oxigenated, don't know. As far as the taste goes the beer was "nice". It tasted similar to a domestic version of the same beer, but slighly better. The mouthfeel was interesting in the sense that all sides of my tongue had a chance to enjoy it, almost a tickle. Quite drinkable. I wouldn't choose it over other styles, but as far as availability they can go down all day and all night if you understand!","FoolCircle","Oct 26, 2004"

2.43,-9.7,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"The mouthfeel is thin and weak.Starts of with some crispness but ends quietly. Drinakbility is unimpressive as I could not finish the lone bottle I purchased and the flavors are lacking.","Gavage","Jul 24, 2004"
2.23,-17.1,2.5,2,2.5,2,2,"This didn't suck. It is mostly unimpressive but the taste is just a little above that. The funny thing is that I used to think this was a great beer, so I had to try one a new Mexican establishment in Wildwood, NJ. The place is great; the beer is not so great. This one looked okay and tasted better than a Bud.","rdrummer","Jun 21, 2004"

3.07,14.1,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a white lace head. The aroma is skunky and weak. It has the feel of a Czech lager. It also has a nice mild hop aroma to it. There is the scent of pale malts and lager yeast. The taste is weak and watery, but not that bad. It lacks any malt character and has that Mexican zing to it although it's from the Dominican. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with way too much carbonation. It drinks well despite it's flaws.","WesWes","Jan 07, 2004"
2.58,-4.1,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,3.5,"This is surprisingly a pretty easy to drink beer. Definitely made for hotter climates. It isn't at all that exciting of a beer, but it serves its purpose as a decent thirst-quencher.","Beastdog75","Nov 13, 2003"
2.71,0.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"The nose is light and grassy, along with some husky notes. The taste is sweet with some trailing and unpleasant bitterness in the back. Slightly unpleasant aftertaste. The feel is medium with a fair level of carbonation. Drinkable hot waether beer for a strong thirst - not a fine sipping ale.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 10, 2003"
2.48,-7.8,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,3,"Appears a light golden tone with a vibrant white head that leaves a nice evenly laced ring of foam. The aroma is a mild hop aroma with sweet lemongrass tones along with the corn and rice adjuncts to make this beer at a cheaper price. Well, I did pick up a sixer at around 2.50 at Chicken Charlie's in Little Washington, PA so it was a deal no matter what the beer is like. Sweet refreshingly crisp perfect for a Caribbean island. This beer was a staple during my trip to Key West, FL where it was a common ground to find in any local grrocery store. Corona doesn't even stand up to this beer so if you see it at a reasonable price pick it up. Light body with high carbonation that tickles the tongue. On a a hot day this would be perfect for chilling in the sun.","WVbeergeek","May 02, 2003"

2.83,5.2,2.5,2,2.5,4,4,"Who let the skunk out? Very uncomplicated tinny hop smellfollows initial explosion highway crossing skunk. Lively continuous light carbonation, but no evidence on the surface. Flavor hints at a dust malt, and metalic hop, with a slightly dry finish. I've seen this beer hiding in television show and movie scenes. Go figure.","Delirium","Feb 01, 2003"
2.98,10.8,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"With little to choose from but Coors Light and Budweiser, I usually opted for Presidente on a recent trip to Puerto Rico. It beats the US macros, but not by a wide margin. The color is a bit nicer, a slightly orange gold with a decent head. Corn is quite noticeable in the smell and flavor. Once accustomed to them, they do go down quite well on a warm day at the beach. I've never seen it on the mainland, but I wouldn't buy it if I found it anyhow.","mickeymac","Nov 27, 2002"
3.28,21.9,3,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Clear. Golden in color with a bright white head that thins but holds surprisingly well. Even fresh from a case just delivered to the distributor, it's lightly skunked. Damned green bottles! The remainder of the aroma is lightly malty. The body is light with a very fine and effervescent carbonation giving it a zesty mouthfeel. The flavor is well balanced, starting with a clean, sweet malt and finishing with some very light hop flavor and drying bitterness. Surprisingly well made. With the exception of the skunkiness in the aroma, this beer could stand side by side with some of the best made American macro-lagers. Refreshing and enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Sep 25, 2002"
2.35,-12.6,2.5,2.5,2,2,3,"Presidente:  from the Dominican Republic.  Very light bodied beer from South of the Border.  I expected a knock off of Corona, but this was not a Corona.  A fairly highly carbonated beer, with tastes dominated by adjuncts.  Very clean in the finish, with some alcohol tastes.  $1.99 for 24 ounces, in a cheap green bottle, not worth it.","jackndan","Aug 25, 2002"
2.35,-12.6,2,2,2,3.5,3,"Notes: Bland yet bothersome, not a very well put together brew. If it was a bit cleaner and had a touch more malt flavour it would not be half bad. I don’t recommend this beer.","Jason","Jun 24, 2002"
