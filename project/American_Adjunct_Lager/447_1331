I would buy PBR almost exclusively in college, because I believed (and still believe) that it was the best beer I could buy for the price. I could get a 12er for $7.99. Unfortunately PBR has seen an increase in demand, resulting in a higher price in my area. Now I think a 12er of Sam Adams or New Belgium is a better deal. PBR pours a nice golden yellow and is very refreshing. Always puts off those who like to rid beer of all of its taste. It is a little skunky but something about it tastes great. I recommend getting in cans, as the bottles seem to add some off-putting skunkiness.","CIBoy10","Dec 21, 2014"

5,70.6,,,,,,"Reviewed for what it is, this is perfect. It's the best American adjunct by far in my opinion; far beyond Bud and its ilk. It's nothing when compared to craft beers, of course, but at $3.19 per 4-pack of 16 oz. tall boys, this is my go-to when I want to get messed up for cheap (cough cough I mean it's a great session beer). Perceptible hops, an okay malt body, and no gross aftertaste make this an excellent offering for the price, considering otherwise you'd be looking at Steel Reserve or something like that.","SkullFission","Aug 26, 2014"

It pours a nice clear straw color with a foamy head and has good lacing. It tastes better than most AALs. But. It's a tad on the light side for me. If it had a richer flavor, I would have bolstered my rating.","joe12pk","Aug 20, 2014"

That being said, it's dang tasty when it's hot out, has a little more ABV than your run of the mill 3.2, and I love that when I bust one out, very few people swarm around to get their hands on one, making it an even better value! Pale yellow in color, It's got enough malty body to separate it from the miller/coors/bud barley pop, while still being easy to drink in quantity. No real discernible hoppiness, especially compared to my standard IPA/DIPA fare. Refreshing, but not a light beer. Taken for what it is, I believe it to be a great beer, when limited to class-comparison. I'm drinking one right now, as it's 85, sunny, and I'm grilling. Boom.","MikeI","Jul 26, 2014"

Beware, the sound of a PBR cracking summons hipsters from miles around, but will also earn you the respect of any man over 60 who has ever worked in a steel factory. And Clint Eastwoood. So grab yourself a PBR, and don’t look back. You may be listening to vinyl records on your portable turntable at a Starbucks in a few months, but then again, you might just be taking in a part of American history.

Drank plenty of pbrs back in the day and im not afraid to admit that ill still crack open one of these from time to time still. In my opinion this is the best cheap beer i've ever tried, if you're on a budget this is the one to choose as it actually resembles a beer and not grain flavored seltzer water as i think some of the other cheap beers do. The taste in pretty decent, it's malty and has a pretty good traditional lager taste and feel. It's got a lot of carbonation, which i like.

PBR looks like every other American style lager on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. Pabst blue ribbon has a nice smell. You pick up on grains and malts. There is also some sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The taste is smooth and rich. There is nothing bad about this brew. Pabst Blue Ribbon has flavor and smoothness. All around Pabst Blue Ribbon is an american classic beer. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.5 out of 5. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","May 22, 2014"

Not a bad looking beer, great head with a light golden color. Smell reminded me of college, immediately had me remembering all the good times. Taste was not bad at all, smooth and even with at least a little flavor. Overall I was surprised, I enjoyed it. I think I will put the rest of them in the fridge and drink on another day sitting outside.","JamieDuncan","May 19, 2014"

I purchased it as a 6 pack of 16oz Cans and I know for some, this is a mistake over purchasing the bottles. Granted, with this in consideration, I find that the taste of this beer is too watered down and very bitter tasting, but I do like the kick from the higher alcohol content it has. If this is all that it has going for it, I would rather just go with a cheaper better tasting beer (ie Pearl Beer or Lone Star), add a little vodka to it and Whaaa laa! A beer that tastes better and has plenty of kick to it!","lynx50","May 05, 2014"

Carbonation streaming up the side of the glass lends a champagne look to the beer. When first poured, there's a nice banana smell from a few inches away, but as you get closer, notes of creamed corn and wet cardboard come out, along with clean pale malt. At the front of the tongue it's pretty sweet with malt flavor, then it goes down watery without much flavor at all. There's a bit of corn on the back end but it's inoffensive compared to some other adjunct lagers. This isn't the worst choice you can make when on a tight budget. I still prefer to grab a Yuengling, which is in the same price range but isn't available everywhere.","itsscience","Apr 06, 2014"

2.59,-11.6,3,2.75,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Sampled on tap at a Calgary pub. Another "big name" adjunct lager in the US, brewed by Sleeman's here in Canada. Slightly darker in color than many of its contemporaries, the color of well-cured hay with a lot of white foam. Smells of boiled grains with a corn sweetness, and tastes much the same ... Bland breakfast cereal, perhaps a hint of apple or other sour fruit. Less corny than many other adjunct lagers though, tilted towards a grain husk astringency and highly carbonated. The bubbles provide a crisp and dry finish that actually gathers steam as one proceeds through a pint. Standard macro-lager watery body; overall effect is that of a bitter and slightly sour grainy soda. Flavors are mellow but the carbonation is not. Fewer off-flavors than many of its peers (e.g., little DMS that I could taste) but some metal does emerge as the beer warms. Drink it quickly, if at all. In all honesty its not terrible and should probably be deemed a decent example of the style. I actually like more corn sweetness when I drink this style. This one gets astringent after a while, as is the case when more rice is used.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 15, 2013"

It's not the best looking brew, pale yellow with a thick white head. It smells like a typical macro lager with corn and bread in abundance. The taste is also similar to the other macros, however I feel PBR is the bitterest up front.

I can not say if they changed the brewing method but the taste or my taste buds have changed. The appearance is medium gold. Smell is slightly sweet. Taste is now lightly bitter ending with a mild sweetness. Overall, I would say a clean mild lager but lacking robustness of a full bodied lager say like a Foster's Lager. However, in my opinion surprisingly the best mass produced American beer. Bottoms up!","chuckwagonrocks","Jul 06, 2013"

3.06,4.4,4,3,3,3,3,"Poured a clear yellow with a finger and a half white head that stuck around quite well for an AAL. Really, the appearance was quite nice, I can't really fault the beer there, especially rating to style. Scents of lager yeast, some slight malt and a lot of maize adjuncts. Standard to the style, nothing special, but nothing terrible like Corona or Coors. The taste followed the scent. Lager yeast, a slight hint of malt and a lot of maize. But it also had a decent amount of hop character for an AAL which kept it from being the sweet mess that many examples of the style gravitate towards. The mouthfeel was light bodied with high carbonation. A classic AAL, like the rest. Overall, despite the fact that it is indeed a swill AAL, and a cheap one at that, it tastes better than the more expensive Budweiser, Coors and Miller and beats it's price competition Rolling Rock by a wide margin. It's not a good beer, but it's also not terrible. I can see why the hipsters drink it like water.","Auraan","Jul 03, 2013"

3.81,30,3,3.75,4,3.25,4,"I had this in both a bottle and a can, and I must say, I was very impressed, its appearance is very fine looking, like you would expect a beer to be, smells like beer, good amount of hops present, taste is very good, especially for the price you would imagine this to taste like water, but it really doesn't, Pabst uses alot of hops, and very exotic ones at that, not like its an exotic beer, its taste like beer, but it is rather quirky tasting, damn good though. and mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, overall I think this is a good beer, and a beer's beer at that, they use alot of good ingredients in making it and I think it runs circles around its more expensive rivals like Budweiser, or Corona. I also believe if you dont like this you probably dont like beer, Everyone needs to try this beer, at least once in there life's","Goat2Hunter","Apr 25, 2013"

PBR is a refreshing and cheap way to enjoy a macro beer that has a little bit more going than the bmc's when you need a break from kickass craft beers. above average ratings in nearly all categories for this style of beer.","drmystery","Apr 17, 2013"

These reports are coming not only from brewers and others who help make the beer, but also from employees outside of the brewing part of the business who report that weakening the brew is actually a part of Anheuser- Busch InBev’s corporate policy.

The beer’s body is water clear with a torrent of bubbles working to the top of the glass. In truth, the beer looks a little like ginger ale in the glass. The beer’s head leaves a lacing of medium sized and tightly packed bubbles on the sides of the glass in sparse scraggly lines. On the nose, the beer smells weakly of sweet grassy malts with a touch of caramel. That stale grain smell that is found in most cheap lagers is also present here. It actually smells better than some of the other cheap lagers I’ve reviewed. It’s not amazing, but it doesn’t turn my stomach either, and it doesn’t have a completely bland character. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweetly bready with a touch of acid and the faintest touch of salt. The beer’s flavors begin with water, slowly opening into stale bread and grassy hops that turn hay-like. The finish is clean and quick, giving that slightly vegetal chemical sweet taste that all cheap lagers have. On the mouth, the beer feels thin, with a medium light carbonation that does fluff the tongue. The mouth is left wet after the beer passes. This beer is supremely drinkable, which is why it still exists today. It also leaves the mouth in flavor soon after it travels down your throat. Overall, this is PBR. It is cheap beer, but it is not offensive. It’s just pretty flavorless. To PBR’s credit, I find more flavor in it than in other comparable cheap lagers that I’ve reviewed (i.e. Red Stripe…). Buy a thirty if you want to cheaply drink yourself stupid. It is not the worst thing you could drink.","Maxwell","Feb 25, 2013"

2.75,-6.1,3,2.25,3,2.25,3,"Shotgunned from a 16 ounce Tallboy. Appearance is lacking due to method of consumption. A light, egg shell, off white head builds in my mouth, runs down my shirt and all over my face, lingering on my beard. Very pleasing. Aroma contains hints of aluminum, tap water, and sugar. Also vomit and pizza, but that may be due to the setting. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and frigid all around. Very hard to swallow due to sheer volume and flowing pressure. The taste is surprisingly non existent. Hints of light caramel malt are muted by the loud chanting of "Chug" in a vicious circle around me. The palate is frozen. The belly is full. Overall a solid lager, I will enjoy another in a few seconds.","CascadianDarkAle1","Jan 30, 2013"

It is a true lager, just as much as a Samuel Adams, darker, fizzy and just All-American. I'm glad its a hipster beer, I'm glad its its on the same level as bud-light but quite not. I drank a Hamm's, as cheap as a Hamm's is, it's great. It 's just like PBR, survived most of contemporary American history. Its supremely average and weirdly watery. It's not a stout, it's not a pilsner, it's not a porter...It's an American-styled lager, whatever that may be. PBR Reminds me of the 4th of July, it reminds me of Senior year, it reminds me of an alternative crowd, its reminds me of every beer game I ever played. I'll stay loyal PBR as a case and nothing else.","GorrestFump","Jan 28, 2013"

Poured from the can, it has a light, sunny yellow color and a thick but light, whipped-cream-like white head. The aroma has a light, dry sweetness underneath, but it is predominated by a dull mustiness that is expected but doesn't veer towards unpleasant like many in the style. The mild cereal sweetness is more pronounced in the flavor and melds with a wheat-like, almost lemony tanginess. Unfortunately, the fine, prickly carbonation in this beer is often my least favorite part of American lagers of this style. Overall, though, it has more and better flavor than the mass-produced light lagers, making it a fine option to have for nights when you just want a light-tasting beer.","devilben02","Jan 18, 2013"

No evidence of mineral or skunk from the aroma. Flavor is light to moderate and well balanced for its style. Light bodied, as expected. A pleasant surprise for an adjunct lager.

Red, white and blue through and through. Truly an American icon, and a classic taste among blue collar men everywhere. This is your grandpa's beer. Before the hipster craze set in, drinking this beer meant you were a working man, and you liked a simple beer. Simple beer for simple folks. But I don't find it so simple. I taste a very light, yet flavorful brew. A slight hops note from the get go, super bubbly mouthfeel that masks most of the flavor initially, but it follows through with that cold, crisp and refreshing yeastiness that we all know from American Adjunct Lagers toward the finish. Love it though I do, I will make one thing very clear. Don't ever drink this beer any warmer than ice cold, or it tastes like canned hay juice. I can tell you those of you who have not tried it how to best enjoy it. Bust your ass on a hot summer day doing some yard work, car work, or helping a friend move. Nothing beats an ice-cold Pabst at the end of a hard day's work. Pabst is an American classic, good for a budget beer, and perfect for any fourth of July barbecue. Great summer beer, and it never changes. It's not the best, not the worst. But hey, it's cheap, pretty tasty, and it's something everyone can enjoy. Great for parties, poker night, Cookouts...any occasion with friends and family fits the bill.","Schneidermeister","Sep 14, 2012"

PBR compares more to Blatz (which is more sweet), and less so to Shlitz (less consistent/often stale tasting), in the coupling of hyperconscious simplicity and standard beerishness. It's position as a sort of cult classic in certain cities/subcultures seems to maintain it's consistent, albeit low, standards. It is not produced and sourced to the degree that many similar beers are, but it is certainly widely known and accessible.

Beck's now may be owned by InBev & brewed in St. Louis, MO. But I recently called Beck's brewmaster & he assured me that they were still brewing to the German Purity Law, which means they're only using water, barley malt, hops & yeast. I'm sure Pabst isn't doing the same. I know why all of you are rating Pabst higher than Beck's. It has nothing to do with PBR's quality. Rather, it's the "pseudo-hipster's" rating, i.e. "PBR is 'cooler' than Beck's because it doesn't advertise & has the patriotic U.S. colors of red, white & blue." C'mon everyone - get real. No way is PBR better tasting than Beck's. And no, I don't work for Beck's & I'm not German. However, I've brewed my own beers & know a bit of what I'm talking about.","Polecat41","Jul 28, 2012"

I will admit, I have not sampled many adjunct American Lagers, whatever an adjunct lager may be. Beer Advocate rates the PBR highly, so here goes. Light golden color, clear as a bell with a thin snow white head, this beer is light on aroma and flavor. Slightly malty with no hops to speak of, this drink goes down easily and hits the spot on a hot day when you need a cold one. I usually drink wheat beers during the summer, but now will add PBR to the mix. Refreshing and a nice change of pace. Who would think it would take a journey from my standard Odell 90 Shilling through a long list of ultra hoppy IPA’s, big Stouts, varied Belgian beers to finally come around to trying a PBR, probably one of the most popular beers out there.

The finish is very clean and a crisp experience if every I had one. This is very good for the style and the overall value is high since this is the 2nd cheapest beer available at this location yet still is worth drinking.","Slatetank","Jun 08, 2012"

And at less than $18 for a 30 pack, You really cannot go wrong with it unless you're an uptight Aristocratic beer reviewer, In which case you should probably avoid it.

I like to drink pabst from time to time usually in tall boy form straight from the can. Flavor seem weaker than I remember 20 years ago. The hipsters drove prices of pabst steadily up as the brand has rebounded over the last decade so stopped buying it for awhile.

There is a lot of visible carbonation with about two finger of quickly dissipating, white foam. The smell is quite sweet with the faintest note of hops, the faintest. The taste is actually not bad, it tastes clean, refreshing. There are no discernible flavors other than the sweetness of the malt. Not much mouthfeel, besides high carbonation.

I hate pretty much every other cheap domestic or Canadian beer. I respect PBR for being what it is - a decent tasting, cheap grain lager. It tastes crisp and clean, with a slightly bitter (not skanky) aftertaste. I wish I knew all the fancy words to properly explain myself on Beer Advocate, but I haven't studied up. That's why I haven't reviewed my favorite double ipas yet. A couple years ago when I was in Brooklyn, it really upset me to discover this beer had become "cool" with the hipster crowd.

But after a while I wanted a beer so bad. So at the grocery store there was a deal on two fourpack tallboy cans for $6. Pretty nice. The beers to choose from were Miller High Life, Icehouse, and PBR. The first time, they were out of PBR and I got High Life and Icehouse. I didn't even like High Life in high school when I was a devotee of such fine brews as Miller Genuine Draft and Bud Light. It was worse than I remember. That's a crappy beer. The Icehouse was fine for that sort of thing. Not great, but ballpark quality. So the next time I was happy to see they had PBR. All of my friends had been drinking it during the hipster revival and they liked it so I thought I was in luck. Ohhh no. Oh no. Bad. Bad beer. It was worse than High Life. I don't know what people are thinking saying they love this beer. This is a gross tasting beer. It's on a level with Natural Light or Keystone or something else awful. Big disappointment. Won't drink it again.","BrownNut","Jan 29, 2012"

Little bit of sweet malt on the nose but other than that, metallic and acidic. Taste is typical for the style but the feel is surprisingly slick and smooth without an overload of carbonation. Not too bad, not surprising that It's been so long since i've had it though.","J23hc","Jan 29, 2012"

Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, and nutty. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, nutty, and very slight fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This has been my guilty pleasure for quite some time if I am honest. There just seems to be something about it that keeps me coming back. This was my first return to all-you-can-eat wings and 32 oz specials so I figured what better fitting brew to go with... I know this isn't a popular style, but there is something about this brew that puts it just a rung or two above all the rest from this style. However, this one still falls very short of just about any other style out there, but what can you do when you are in a style that is destined to fail among the craft beer community. Worth trying even if you aren't playing beer pong. It might just surprise you...","thagr81us","Jan 25, 2012"

This pours a straw yellow with a slight foamy head. No lacing on the glass. Smell is grainy, hints of corn and barley. Carbonation is just right to make this a really drinkable beer to have when washing down wings or a burger. Never really gave much thought to this beer prior to just a few weeks ago, but now glad I have a new "basic" beer to get when I'm getting a little burned out on deciding among different craft beers.","oldirtycaffrey","Jan 17, 2012"

The aroma has a slight hint of sweet malted grain and some grassy hops. Light in body, this lager is smooth and easy to drink. There is some slight flavor of malted grain and a suggestion that hops were used in the brewing process. At the end of the day, this is an adjunct lager- no better, no worse.

Enjoyed many, many times over the years and formally reviewed here for the first time as it is my king of the cheapy's IMO and I've been going back and reviewing some of my favorite old man brews of yore that I've put off while reviewing craft and import beers. Poured from 12oz can into pilsner glass for the purposes of this formal review for an informal brew. Pale straw yellow color pours a fluffy head of about and inch or so if you let it and you enjoy that sort of thing. Usual suspects smell wise for an american adjunct lager, corn mostly and mild sourness of yeast and bread. Taste is sweeter then most and goes down easy and finishes clean though their is that bit of aal funk to it as well. An obvious choice for a session beer, good and cheap no matter if it's can, bottle or draft and IMO creates a better buzz then High Life over the course of a session/night out. This was the standard american adjunct lager I came to enjoy over the usual BMC stuff thanks to dive bars, rock clubs and using it as the main ingredient in flaming Dr. Pepper shots at parties and not wanting to throw away the rest of the can when no one else would volunteer to finish the remains not used in the shot. Also great for making up beer bread and beer can chicken. I prefer the can to the bottle or the draft, both of which seem a bit more watery and rather tasteless where the can seems to have a bit more and the metallic taste IMO adds something as crazy as that sounds. Snobs and hipster's be damned, I enjoy this blue ribbon devil of cheapness.","Blueribbon666","Oct 02, 2011"

The beer is very carbonated , as can be expected. All in all, this is a VERY drinkable beer, and one even someone as choosy as me, would go out and buy. A nice , drinkable, summer beer.

More taste than Miller or Bud in my opinion. A nice cereal type grain taste and slightly sweet malt followed by a subtle but present hop finish. Nicely carbonated and refreshing.

Smell is light buscuit malt some hint of sweet malt and a tiny wiff of hops. Taste is similar not much to talk about a buiscut malt with a tight carbonation that brings the small amount of hops out.

Overall, if you're going to drink a cheap beer, this should be it.

Actually smells a bit alcoholic in the nose, for second it almost smelled faintly of Jim Beam, but couldn't be, or was it from all the corn adjuncts? Let's put it this way, doesn't smell like much of anything, but what it does smell like, isn't necessarily great, more like stale grains if anything. The taste is mildly bitter from the sodium of the carbonation of the beer, in a club soda sort of way, not really like beer. I wouldn't ever call it awful cause it is far from offensive, just, not there. I would dare to say Budweiser is actually a notch above this, cause at least I can taste some green snap from a fresh Bud, from the hop profile, that cleans the tongue whereas this just does nothing! However, in all of its marginality, it is a good compromise between the overly stale breadiness of a MGD, and the annoying green apple snap of a Bud, it does neither. It's kinda like a dull friend who is willing to join ya! My beer does have some sort of date code, I've been seeing around town, NOV 10. So, I *guess* it is fresh, but I would never know. Mouthfeel is thin and watery of course, yet the drinkability is there. Hey, at $1.40 a 24 ounce can, you could make worse choices.

Lots of fun tiny bubbles showing a delightful carbonation. Not much to smell here except grains and alcohol. Neat. Smells like a dirty bottle redemption center. The taste is the arguably the best thing about this beer. Grains and hop bitterness. It's pretty one dimensional but it isn't bad by any means. This really is the best of the big guys and something I never mind having at a campfire or any outdoor outing where beer isn't the main focus. Good mouth feel. I love how crisp an refreshing this is and I love all those crazy bubbles!

Pale malt, a little bright citrus, grains, lots of acidity and a crisp finish. Clean and refreshing; definitely a step above its comparable cohorts.

Still not much in the department of hops bitterness or floral citrus-like flavors.

Does not possess the smell of a stale tin car like other Macs, a tad yeasty and sweet like sweet grain bread. Mild malty taste, maybe a little sourdough bread, white corn, sunflower seeds, nothing overwhelming just hints of these flavors. Mouthfeel is great, smooth, mild aftertaste, does not have the pasty roof of your mouthfeel like other shitty macros.

I can get a little hops in there...barely... the grains and the sweetness from them kinda remind me of a higher ranked german dort style but only more subdued. A nice earthyness between the corn-sweet and alcohol finish. Decent balance and some good qualities here... Quite crisp and drinkable, however, this beer is like HighLife in that it has to be cold and in the bottles to really be enjoyed. Less distinctive than some but still tastes fine. The alcohol here may be 4.7 but this seems to me to feel and taste like a 5.5 or so lager....if it wasn't for the watery mouthfeel I'd insist it was stronger...but I guess they have no reason to lie.

It's mouthfeel is less viscous than water, the over-carbonation stings the tongue, and the skunkiness is UNREAL. It was a cross between rancid gone-off cocktail olives and the aftertaste of oral surgery. I found a sort of bitter aftertaste that left me far thirstier than a beer should. This beer has only served any purpose after many rounds of scotch and Guinness Extra Cold when one is still thirsty but broke, going at $3 a pitcher.

PBR is beer that brings back nostalgia as I drank it regularly in college. It has more flavor and body than most macros and is very easy drinking.

You can get this in pretty much any liquor store around here, but no way I'm cluttering up my fridge with 6 bottles of something that's not supposed to be good, and bars just don't have this on tap in my experience. Anyway, there's a bowling alley near me that does and I tried this on a whim not too long ago. I have to say this is definately decent. Everything about it is pretty macro-standard but not in a bad way. The appearance is a sort of gold-yellow. Macro standard, but the better kind of macro standard at least. Head is thin, but I found it creamy, while it lasted at least. No lacing was visible, but then again this was in a plastic cup (that's what you get in a bowling alley). Taste was fine. I found it quite sweet up front with some very mild bitterness in the finish. There was some adjunct grain but at least it was corn and not rice. Mouthfeel was like any other macro, but its not overcarbonated. Drinkability is fine so far as I know. But I only had one and when you're going with a beer with the sort of rep this one has, I think several would be a good idea before you pronounce the drinkability great. But anyway for now this has replaced Highlife as my reccomended cheap beer. Granted I also don't know how this tastes in a can or a bottle which would be interesting. But unless I'm hosting a whole bunch of friends on a budget(or visiting someone else who is) I won't be finding out right away. Anyway this is a decent beer for its category. Better than MGD, less likely to produce comments about skunk or paint than Rolling Rock (I've never had that problem, but I know lots of other people complain about it), and way cheaper than Labatt Blue or Stella.","casualbeerman","Jan 08, 2006"

The liquid is light straw-orange with a couple streamed of bubbles feeding the half-layer of head left on the beer. Smells dark hops, wet cardboard and fresh dark mushrooms. Malt sweet is way beneath, as is a little bit of sting, which I think is from carbonation release. Tastes sweet to start with a noticable hop oil on the tongue. The aftertastes sees a burst of hop floral in the back of the mouth. Yes, I do not exaggerate, 'burst'. Some grain in the malt character early, but this vanishes upon the swallow to leave and empty space in the flavor. Despite this, this beer is actually tasty. A bit more carbonated than I'd like, so I will swirl to release some of the CO2. The smell is now more of a wet hay than cardboard & mushroom. With the carbonation decreased, the beer is quite a bit more flavorful. I just don't understand why macro lagers are so overcarbonated that they make carb sting a main component of the flavor profile. The hops are still quite noticable, perhaps a touch stronger than the weak malt dictates. Md thin body. Drinkable, yeah, very nice. Judged to style, not to my flavor preferences.","mentor","Sep 30, 2005"

It has a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel with an above average degree of carbonation. Grain dominates the flavor but the hops are noticeable, although more would be nice.

The taste is very decent with nice malty flavor. It has an aroma of corn and not much else. It has a smooth mouthfeel that goes down very easy. I barely enjoyed this beer but found it to be drinkable but there are still many other brews that I would put in my list above this one.

The only aftertaste to speak of is that of alcohol and wood. No malt flavor. Neither too bubbly nor thin, though. Not a particularly good beer, but not a bad beer either.

It definetly beats any macro hog wash for alot less money.  Yea man i know what you mean by cringing when people make jokes about it when they actually think Heinekein is a good beer; it bothers me too.  The mouthfeel is a lil watery but the carbonation evens it out so that it is not a detriment to enjoying it.  The taste is balanced, a slight hoppy grain and lightly malted.

While I found the Schlitz to possess both more hop flavors (grassy)than any other common macro I can think of, the PBR was much less bitter. The Schlitz was also metallic tasting (the grassy hops meshing with another flavor perhaps?) and the PBR lacked this. The PBR is a bit sweeter than the Schlitz, but still remains crisp. It doesn't even become undrinkable cold. Too bad typical beer swillers think this beer is below them. It really is a good cheap beer.
