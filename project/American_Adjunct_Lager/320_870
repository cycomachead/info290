Lots of small streaming bubbles are seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Good carbonation. Some very light spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of sweet grass/grains with a hint of floral and hay even. The taste is pretty close to the aroma with some corn sweetness in the mix as well. A little light-bodied but decent. Goes down easy and is really cent for the price as you can buy a 30-pack for $14.98 or a 6 of 'Tall Boys' for just $4.98. Overall not a bad brew.","BeerWithMike","Aug 07, 2014"

Taste - Bready with a corn tinge, hops are definitely apparent but very light - very clean flavor profile - crisp and refreshing. Overall, just a touch better than many of its more famous competitors - given that this is one of the cheapest beers out there ,it is not bad for what it is. would choose over Coors, Bud, or Pabst.","evanackerman","Jan 11, 2014"

I'm on number three and I have to say I'm digging this beer. Looks like an old time lager should. Very clear and very pale. Aroma sort of leaps out you, for an adjunct lager that is. First of all it doesn't smell like corn, that's something right there. Second, I can smell hops, honest to goodness hops. Not like really powerful hops, but they are there in all their floral, grassy ahem, glory. Tastes alright. Again, doesn't taste like corn. It's not an overly sweet, corn flavored beer. It's light and wheaty, with a touch of grassy hops. Off dry finish. Nice full carbed up mouth. This beer is solid and mostly stands out for what it doesn't have. That is its lack of sweet, corny flavour. Clean and basic with a touch of hops.","mjryan","Oct 29, 2013"

The look is right. The aroma is of grains, corn, and a bit of hops. The body is light to medium and creamy. The taste is also grainy, corny, but the hops finish it surprisingly crisp and clean. I stumbled across this in a beverage store in Southern New Hampshire and I have not seen Hamm's in New Hampshire since the 1980's.

But one of our local stores had a 30-case for $17, so I thought it was time to sock some away for casual summer sipping. Then I broke out one and stuck it in the freezer for a half hour, and then poured it into a pint glass (I don't like the aluminum smell drinking from a can). The smell wasn't like a brewery, but just a pleasant non-specific fragrance. The head starts off OK, and drops off to near nothing after a couple of minutes. The color is standard for American beer. The taste is pretty much bitter malt with a slightly sweet touch, and the flavor fades away pleasantly. I think that if you keep this beer cool, you could continue drinking cans of it all day. Half a can provides a pleasant buzz, and this beer will make a sunny day very enjoyable.","sabinelr","May 23, 2012"

There is a lot of carbonation, and surprisingly, the beer looks like it is leaving good lacing, I'm in awe. Even though I can here the head fizzing away, the appearance actually isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I mean the body is atrocious, but the head has some good qualities. Unlike Coors and Coors light, you can smell a little hops on the nose, very very small, but still there. Other than that there is a malt sweetness and a sour adjunct smell. Not horrible again on the smell, but for sure not up to par with any "good" beer. The taste is pretty crappy, there is mostly just sweet, almost stale malt taste here. There is the smallest hop taste, but nothing really there. Very watery, I mostly just get that gross cheap malt taste. On one hand, it has more of a flavor than Coors and Coors light, but it's not a good flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty bad, but not as bad as the Coors light. It has some girth to it, but for the most part it is just watery. The drinkability is the one great thing about this beer, it just goes down like no other, it is super light, and now that I drink it more, that flavor that I thought it had has kinda gone, and it's all subdued, so I makes it easier to drink.

3.63,36.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Hamms is a solid beer and great for drinking when PBR and Schlitz arent available. Its very bitter for the style, putting BMC brews to shame. The best part about drinking Hamms is that when you drink it, people watching all think, Wow, now thats a MAN!well, either that or, Wow, now thats a drunk! Hamms appearance is very similar to its cousins PBR, Old Style, Schlitz, and Blatz. When you poor Hamms into a glass (which should always be frosted because Hamms in a frosted glass has no negative flavors what-so-ever) you will see that it has a two inch thick, frothy white head for nearly 1.3 seconds. After that the froth becomes a thin, glass clinging lace. The body is hydrated urine with tons of carbonation. Hamms has a great lightly hopped metallic aroma and really tells you that the slightest amount of malt just might be involved someplace in the beer. The taste is even better and makes it obvious that Hamms is only made with sky blue waters. There is even a little bit of grain in Hamms. The Mouthfeel is light and as aforementioned, bitter. It goes down really well. The only bad thing about Hamms is that its proudly made by Unions, which means that for every $8 you spend on a case, a penny or so is going to eliminate American jobs and ruin our economy. Thats just sad but overall, the strong points of Hamms more then make up for that one small down side.","DaPeculierDane","Aug 11, 2006"
2.65,-0.4,2,2,2.5,2.5,4,"Pours a pale straw color topped by a small, fizzy white head. Aroma is pretty much nonexistent. Not good, not bad, just not much of anything. Palate is lightly sweet, with very light adjunct malt and just a touch of fruity hops. Finish is clean and slightly bitter. Body is light, a tad fizzy, and a little bit tangy on the finish. I will say this - you can drink the hell out of this beer. Good in the large quantities preferred by non-discriminating types.","ElGordo","Feb 27, 2006"

Hop presence is there, but it's amazingly low. As it warms I get some saaz and maybe hallertauer. Watery mouthfeel and sharp carbonation that's actually part of the taste profile (because there's not much here to taste).","mentor","Jun 25, 2005"

That helps when it's this cheap.","freed","Apr 23, 2005"
1.66,-37.6,3,2,1,2,2,"After checking my records, it has been some ten years since I have had a Hamms. The beer spews from the 12-ounce aluminum can a cloudless gold with a pleasant bright white head that is frothy in texture, with the resultant lace a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is all malt, crisp and the start sweet with the top cadaverous. Finish is caustic in its acidity, the hops bitter and unpleasant, quite dry and the taste sticks to your palate like crazy glue, a once decent beer that has now become a joke.","Gusler","Apr 08, 2005"

A friend of mine told me this was the worst beer he has ever had, and quite frankly he couldn't be wrong. This beer just has a bad carbonated corn taste that turns me off. It is more full than competing beers, but this isn't saying much at all. Each of the cheap macro brews has their own subtle taste after you are hit with the carbonation and watery generic beer flavor, and Hamm's has been the worst to date. I hold this up there with Stroh's. Schlitz still remains my number one go to beer when the funds are low and the need for feed is high. The case was under ten dollars so it is one of the few beers out there that you can still get somewhat of a bargain on.","dren","Nov 16, 2004"

3.13,17.7,2.5,2,3.5,3,4,"Okay, with a beer fridge full of imports, and domestic micro-brews I really feel guilty about this one. I'm "slumming-it" in the greatest sense. But, and as the saying goes it's a BIG but, this stuff ain't bad. Sure, it lacks anything that could be called character, but it is what it is. This cheap macro-swill actually stands up. It's got more taste then you might think, and it's best served very cold in a tall glass. The quicker you drink it, the better, because it does show some negativity near the end. But, it IS refreshing, and the first few sips are pretty good. I've had it on tap, and I must say that adds something. But, at $4.50/12 pack, you can't beat it. It's a quiet beer that has survived. No mattter what part of the bottom shelf it's hiding on, beneath the Boulevards and the Fuller's etc., etc., etc., dig it out. This might surprise you. It's not trying to be great, but it does a pretty good job at being good, better than average, and most of all, refreshing.","Wingman65","Sep 24, 2003"

Today, I believe SABMiller brews this stuff -- and the quality of their operation shows in the product. Definitely worth a try.","44ouncer","Aug 28, 2003"

It pours from the can a panther piss yellow. A vigorous pour stirs up the bubbles, but not long enough to register a head that impresses itself. Thick, gorgeous Belgian lace! (true or false, the last sentence was not sarcastic). Adjuncty, barn yard aroma. The taste ain’t half as bad as it ought to be, mainly because its not got much taste at all. Sweet, corny, light bodied. Hell, I bought it as a lark, yet I’m not wholly dis-satisfied. Two dollars and forty-nine cents for a smoking hot six of Hamm’s, money not totally wasted.","jackndan","Jun 28, 2003"

Good looking pour of clear straw color and a 3/4 inch white head. Malt nose with a faint trace of hops. The flavor moderates with warming and moves from sweet maltiness to a grain sense.

Either way, i can't find it anymore, and Bud has taken it's space on the shelves, which pisses me off. Overall, not bad. If it was there, i'd drink it.","Frozensoul327","Jan 18, 2003"
