A nicely balanced beer, not overbearing, with a lot of subtle flavours. Not much in the aftertaste, but overall this beer was very smooth, and not at all heavy. The crisp and refreshing taste makes this one of the most sessionable lagers you can find in my opinion.  I like Tsingtao Beer, its not going to get you wasted, but you can drink a lot of them without having to worry too much about the night, or indeed not expect a bad hangover.","Thisdrinkinglife","Jan 22, 2015"

A super pale straw yellow brew, maybe just a hair darker than some American examples of the adjunct lager, with the expected foaming white bubbles filling the glass. Beer remains fizzy and effervescent throughout. Smells grainy and slightly tangy, rank waterlogged barley and no trace of corn sweetness ... Rice is king here, astringent, crisp, and clean other than the aforementioned wet grain notes. Palate benefits from a cold temperature, drink up quick. Some tangy lemon rind and grape flavors, vaporous and fleeting, followed by old grain mill or malt liquor, a little like Singha but no where near as flavorful. Some medicinal aspirin and a sour metallic tang throughout. Plastic flavors emerge as the beer warms. Somewhat skunky, another feature that unfortunately gains salience over time. Stripped down. Far less sweet than most American adjunct beers. Finishes dry and with an unexpected American hop currant twang (but this feature is decidedly subtle). Meets expectations. This beer may very well complement Chinese food but that ain't going to bump up my ratings.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 08, 2014"

The taste test revealed initial grainy maltiness that soon gave way a crisper bitterness that has some citrus quality to it. There's some prickliness and a thin watery mouthfeel to it. On overall drinkability, it goes down like a charm but probably because there's not much reason to reflect on this one.

Nose was pretty much standard for the style - a light lager sweetness underlain by a cereal smell. Oh well. Mouthfeel was medium with a light sweetness born of malt and adjuncts on the tongue. I am getting to the point that I do not mind the better ones as much as I used to. This was really not too bad, I know, damning with faint praise, but at least it was not gag-inducing like some I have tried.

The pour is slightly frothy with not much lacing and a quickly dissipating head. The color is light-ish yellow, reasonably carbonated, but not overly so. This is a light bodied beer that is reasonably well balanced hops vs. malt, but you aren't going to get either in spades so the term "well balanced" needs some qualification here. The taste is a bit straw, a bit grassy, and with just enough hop bite to let you know there is some substance to the beer. There is a bit of a yeast fizziness to this beer as well and that is an added plus. Tsingtao goes down easy, leaves very little after taste, has a tinge of sweetness in the middle, and has a very light mouthtaste that does clean the palate when eating your favorite Chinese food.

It pours a dull golden-yellow with a slightly off-white head that's not too thick or lasting. The smell is sweet and fairly generic, without too much of a distinctive character. This beer starts exceptionally smooth - especially for a lager - and then settles on the tongue with even amounts of sugar and cinnamon-like flavors. It is medium-bodied, though almost light-bodied. The finish is the most unusual part of Tsingtao. Once the somewhat weak flavors of the beer are headed to the back of your throat, a practically over-powering alcoholic flavor invades your mouth.

If I try this again I want it ice cold. I recommend this if you want to see what the Chinese drink.","Rifrafboy","Feb 11, 2003"

3.3,19.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"It's pale yellow with a foamy, white head. The smell is par for the course lager. Coming in green bottles, it frequently has just a hint of skunkiness. The taste is not bad, but just a bit on the grainy side. It does pair well with spicy Mongolian barbecue, or at least better than the big ones.","mickeymac","Feb 04, 2003"
3.4,23.2,3,3,3.5,3,4,"This is probably my fav Chinese brew. My grandfather got me hooked on it after he brought it home from a chinese restruant. They wanted $18 for a sixer of it!!!!! Instead, I just went down to the local grocery store and got it for $8. Anyways, it's a nice pale yellow color with a short lived white foamy head. You can definately taste the rice in the brew. It does have a small hint of skunk, but it's really not that bad. It's very smooth and goes down very easily, even quenches your thirst. I guess the only bad thing about it, is that the money goes to the commy government of China. Oh well, it's still a darn good brew.","JISurfer","Feb 02, 2003"
3.57,29.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"this chinese lager pours out a clear golden color, with a thin head and leaves the slightest of lace. aroma of pleasant floral hops, followed by a hint of green bottle skunk, mixed with a grainy goodness. although from china, the taste follows the usual euro lager flavors; providing a slight twist by being a little more grainy and alcoholic in nature, while still seeming light on the palate. overall it seems pretty clean and quite refreshing. i'm guessing that this would be a proper beer to wash down some hot and spicy chinese food, and it would take more than a few to quell the fire, as i like my chinese spicy! would be good with mexican and other tex-mex dishes too.","budgood1","Feb 02, 2003"
3.4,23.2,3,3,3.5,3,4,"A grainy malt aroma, nothing special. Dry grainy palate with deeper flavor than ordinary Macro brews. Highly carbonation but lacking head. No bitterness or floral aroma. Would be a better beer if it came in a darker bottle and had more hops. Decent beer, but no need to go out of your way to try it.","Naerhu","Jan 10, 2003"
2.95,6.9,2,2,3,3.5,4,"Pours without much head and the carbonation is low. Pale colored, this is really a lawn mower beer and not something you want after shovelling snow again. Slightly sweet but with a faint skunky nose. The drinkability is high because it is a smooth brew.","jdhilt","Jan 09, 2003"
3.17,14.9,3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Lemony gold in appearance with some active carbonation but virtually no head aside from delicate lacing along the sides. Smell is reasonably strong with grain and floral notes coming through. Taste is somewhat flat, however, with dry grain flavors ruling the day. Mouthfeel is rather firm and a bit too persistent for my taste. Still, this is a drinkable beer that would be a fine choice at your favorite Chinese restaurant.","BitteBier","Dec 24, 2002"
2.16,-21.7,3,2,2,2,2.5,"Tried this beer in a Chinese restaurant. I wanted to try a Chinese beer and it was the only one on their menu. It pours a golden colour topped by an average white head that disappears quite easily and leaves no lace as you drink the beer. Aroma consists of malt. Taste is quite average with nothing special to offer. It's an average to poor lager.","ipogios","Dec 17, 2002"
3.33,20.7,3.5,3,3,4,4,"Pours a clear pale golden color with a foamy white head with large bubbles that quickly dissipates. Aroma of malt and grains with some floral hop notes. Flavor is a bit unusual. A sweet maltiness is present but it is blended with a bready, grain-like taste, and something else I cant quite identify. Finish is clean and crisp. A good partner with spicy Chinese takeout.","Morris729","Dec 03, 2002"
2.5,-9.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Just an average pilsner knockoff. No great malt taste here, and just the faint presence of hops. Goes good with Chinese or Thai food, mainly because it sets the moodOther than that, just a novelty.","bewareOFpenguin","Nov 25, 2002"
2.41,-12.7,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Poured golden in color with a white foamy head and a lot of carbonation present. Aroma was pungent with a feint hop scent. Mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated.

2.7,-2.2,2,2,3,3,3,"Sharp and peppery up front, then dissipating into a smoother sugar coated malty finish.  Very similar to mainstream Amerikan brews, only maybe a hint of added flair.  Not worth the added tax in my opinion.  If someone offeres me one of these in a kind gesture, I doubt I would object, but I would never spend my money on this again.","Jordan","Sep 19, 2002"
3.66,32.6,4,3,4,3,4,"Clear, tawny yellow in color with a big-bubbled foamy bright-white head that holds well, eventually dropping to a collar but keeping a misty foam across the surface from rising carbonation. Light aroma of grainy malt with some hops way in the background. Medium-light body with a spritzy mouthfeel. The flavor is of a mild bready malt that's well backed by hop bitterness. Very clean, with an interesting character that I can't identify. Finishes crisp with a short-lingering medium-dry maltiness. A very nice beer; free of flaws and with a unique character. Certainly worth trying as it delivers much more than its appearance promises.","NeroFiddled","Sep 01, 2002"
3.7,34.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"This is my mainstay at any Asia (Chinese) restaurant in the Boston area, I know it is quite fresh and clean the palate well with some grain and crisp carbonation. It holds onto a slim sweetness as well.","Jason","Aug 21, 2002"
2.13,-22.8,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,"Very pale and clear color, decent head but with large and even bubbles.  I couldn't smell a thing in this brew, maybe a trace of skunk.  Body is very light, malt is OK in flavor -- not great but in the category of a fresh loaf of white bread with sugar on top.  Watery finish, not crisp.  To me, there's not a lot of hop, what's crisp to others is dying flavor at the finish to me...why spoil Chinese food with this, when a great IPA can clean the palatte?","ADR","Aug 20, 2002"
2.68,-2.9,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pale gold, crystal clear with a flood of CO2 surging its way to the surface.  Good head for the style.  Doesn't last long, but CO2 continually keeps a layer of lace on the brew.  Very little smell or taste.  This however, means there's nothing offensive, but nothing special either.  The taste it does have is a bit sweet and malty.  Not really an enjoyable beer, but a good palate cleanser whilst enjoying a Chinese buffet for dinner!","Viking","Aug 09, 2002"
2.65,-4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"TsingTao: From China. Pours clear, with a slightly dark yellow color, no head to speak of. Malty/sweet aroma. Some skunk. The taste is sweet malt, with toffee flavors as the beer warms up. Dry finish, with a hint of sweetness.

3.23,17,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"The sparkling, clear straw hued brew is covered by a large bubbled head that exhibits better retention than typical American megaswill.  Light grainy notes and a touch of a spicy Saaz hop nose along w/ generic sweetness.  Hop bitterness is above the norm for the insipid style while the mild bready grain notes are fairly pleasant. Corn flavors are thankfully absent, but the body is typically light due to the apparent large percentage of rice in the grist. Tsingtao finishes crisp, clean and cleansing.  Yeah it's bland, but I'll take this over a Bud anyday.","marc77","Jun 30, 2002"

2.21,-19.9,2,1,2.5,2.5,3,"A sickly looking pale yellow colour with a foamy, white head that morphs into a mildly lacey ring.  The smell is a turn off, musty, raw, wet-grains perhaps, but noticable almost two-feet away.  Little taste with weak malts and non-existant hops.  The feel is airy, but a light shade of medium bodied.  Drinks better than I thought, compared to other far-east beers anyhow.  Probably best with a meal, Chinese, eh? I drink in the name of beer.","BillyBrew","Jun 25, 2002"

Yes this is very light but as a light lager style beer it is good. When it is fresh it has a wonderful floral aroma that works perfectly with the slight malty sweetness.
