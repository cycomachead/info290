2.83,-18.4,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Poured light yellow, probably straw colored. White, scanty head that didn't last too long. A touch of corn and light grains with a hint of metallicness, pears, and grass, but all of this is extremely light. Flavor is very hard to distinguish. Rather bland and not much to the beer. Not offensive, but nothing really standing out either.","DmanGTR","0"
2.79,-19.6,2,3,2.5,3.5,3,"I would say this is a good session beer but I don't even think it falls in those parameters. I would just stick to their Big Nose IPA, and Midnight Oil Stout. That is where the flavor is.","Portertime","Jul 03, 2011"

Rather plain cream ale, a little Hallertau hops flavour, a bit of honey.Golden colour, a little white head.A tad meady and drinkable on a hot day, like a light mead. I would rather put some New Zealand honey in hot water and skip the carbonation part.","Sammy","Apr 09, 2011"
3.13,-9.8,3.5,3,3,4,3,"O-swamp head, i've heard much about them but i'm guessing this isn't their top beer. this is a lawn mower beer, but not a great one. there are no negative tastes but nothing to make it stand out either.","AdamBear","Feb 18, 2011"
3.5,0.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On-tap at the tasting room. Amber with a finger of white foam. Smell is pale malt, cereal grains, fairly neutral. Taste is grainy, mild hopping, finishing with a sugary honey sweetness. Very slight rindy hopping. It does a pretty good job of featuring the honey, but unfortunately is otherwise boring. Inoffensive and probably useful as a gateway beer; wouldn't expect a cream ale to be particularly exciting anyway.","babaracas","Jan 02, 2011"

3.98,14.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D and overall impression: Drinkability is super high due to the light character of the brew. Overall, I really enjoyed my sample. This would be a great session brew sitting by the pool or at a baseball game. Can't wait to try more swamphead! Skal.","Gtreid","Beers"
4.03,16.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a rich golden yellow color with a large frothy white head with great retention and lacing all around the glass. The aroma is malt, citrus, honey and a touch of hops. The taste is malt with a faint honey-like sweetness, citrus and a nice touch of hops in the finish balancing out the sweetness very nicely. Glad I finally got to try a beer from this brewery, looking forward to trying more of their lineup.","cjgator3","0"
