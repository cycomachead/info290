3.4,-3.1,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This poured out as a clear looking yellow color. A thin white fizzy head on top that settling into a scattered film on top of the beer. No lacing and minimal retention. The smell of the beer is a little grassy, smells similar to some German Lager's out there. Not typically what I was expecting from a Cream Ale. The taste of the beer was slightly sweet with a decent graininess to it. The finish has a subtle bitterness to it but nothing overwhelming. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, easy to drink and moderately refreshing. Overall it's a decent cream ale, I feel that it should be so grassy though, it should be more sweet on the nose and less Lager-like.","Knapp85","Aug 28, 2012"

3.47,-1.1,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Coon Rock is certainly more viscous and lightly carbed than one might expect from the style. The sugar cookie sweetness is quite modest, though, and the light vanilla presence sets it off nicely. A bit of juicy citrus midswallow, and then a touch tangy, a touch grainy in the finish. A better than average cream ale.","PDXHops","Jul 18, 2012"

Smells of mineral water, light amounts of sweet corn, perhaps a crystal malt??? (not sure about that one) and a nice accent of herbal / grassy hops. Flavor is like the nose, but also contains a medium strength bready element that pleases my palate. Lighter bodied (but not watery, thank goodness), well carbonated. Not as "corny" as Spotted Cow, but somewhat more bare-bones 'minimalist' as well. Very sessionable.","WastingFreetime","Dec 28, 2011"

Drinks well enough, but nothing special.","Thorpe429","Jan 07, 2010"
4.1,16.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass...color was a somewhat lighter golden yellow; smell was good, mouthfeel was good. Unlike my last cream ale, this one had a more distinctive, creamier taste to it. I paired it with a white bean chicken chili, which no doubt enhanced the sweetness of this beer. Still not as enjoyable at the old Blatz Light Cream Ale from a decade or more ago, but I will definitely try this one again...light, creamy taste that is well-suited for warmer days.","dhannes","Dec 21, 2009"

3.48,-0.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured with a nice, white head that pretty much settle down to a light cover and some lace. Color is a crystal clear yellow. Aroma is beery, malty, light hop, a bit of yeast, and some grain. Flavor's the same but more sweet. Body is good and so is carbonation. I'd like it better if it weren't quite as sweet. Slight bitterness in finish. I will say the sweetness is short lived and that helps. Could do worse for a session beer.","drpimento","Dec 11, 2009"

4.4,25.4,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Slightly hazed sun yellow body. It glows yellow. Thin bubbly cap of dirty white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, a little bready...almost like a german pilsner kicked down one notch in the aroma department. Flavor is top notch for the style. A cream ale that has some substance. I like it. Sweet malty tones with no signs of corn or other adjuncts. Slight hay like bitterness lingering after the taste adds another dimension and alludes to a slight dry impression with the aftertaste. Body is medium to medium-full. Very drinkable and enjoyable. This is a nice achievement here with this style. I'd drink it often if it were available around here.","Bighuge","Aug 25, 2009"
4.07,16,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is creamy, soft, but full. Very drinkable, best thing about it, could have several, must be around 4.5% abv I believe. Will be seeking a six pack next time in WI.","robbyc1","Aug 22, 2009"
3.42,-2.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a clear, golden/maize color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of grass, cream, slight hops, yeast, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is crisp and sharp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of cream, yeast, tart malt, sweet malt, slight citrus, and slight hops. Overall, an average cream ale with a mouthfeel hurt by the high carbonation level.","Tone","Jun 19, 2009"

2.3,-34.5,3,3,1.5,3,2.5,"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into almost no lacing. The aroma is of corn, and faint caramel malt. The taste is the corniest of any beer I've ever tried. It is a sharp, lingering flavor that simply doesn't work for me. The mouthfeel is light bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, I can't see myself ever drinking this again.","KarlHungus","Beers"
1.61,-54.1,1,2.5,1.5,1.5,1,"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a lighter-than-light straw color with a thick white head. In fact, this beer had the thickest head I'd ever seen because it was extremely over-carbonated. I didn't even pour a third of it into the glass without the foam reaching the top. Aroma of fruity esters and lime. Light bodied, watery taste with faint malt sweetness, hints of corn and minature hop aftertaste. Once most of the carbonation was gone and I could actually taste this beer instead of the bubbles, it was still not very good.","blackearth","0"
3.08,-12.3,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Decidedly average, and reminiscent of take-your-pick cheap macro lager. Nothing wrong with it, but fairly forgettable. Hopefully Lake Louie has more interesting options.","Strix","Nov 25, 2008"
4.12,17.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: It's not as crisp as some beers in the same style but it's a clean, thirst quencher that has a great mouthfeel that lives up to the name. It also has a great ability to deliver a good flavor consistently until the last drop. Some lower ABV ales of this style can start to taste weak and watery. A fine brew.","sgoodship","Nov 20, 2008"

2.66,-24.2,3,2,2.5,3,3.5,"Pours a hazy pale golden with a tiny filmy white head. Aroma is lightly sweet, peaty, light malt and astringent bitterness.

My first beer from Lake Louie, perhaps not the best intro to their beers.","mawacki","Jan 02, 2008"
3.1,-11.7,3,3,3,3,3.5,"This beer pours slightly hazy (not a big deal because I recommend decanting this beer into a glass due to yeast sediment on the bottom).

2.95,-16,3,3,3,2.5,3,"The beer had a pleasant enough appearance...a pale straw color with a fairly Sprite-like head. Aroma was rather sweet, like candy sugar. And that was the primary component of the flavor as well...not a lot of hoppiness or maltiness and no "add-on" flavors like fruitiness, chocolate, toffee, coffee, etc. Mouthfeel was unremarkable. Not bad - I finished the bottle, but not something I'd be in a rush to have again.","BeerBelcher","Oct 29, 2006"
3.25,-7.4,3,3,3,3.5,4,"D: Easy drinking as it lacks body and is a bit thin. A nice summer brew to suck back. Possibly a great session brew while sweating in the sun.","bjohnson","Oct 21, 2006"
3.43,-2.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D - This one is not bad but does not stand out either. It might be all the Miller and Busch I drank in college but I just do not care for any beer nowadays that has a big corn presence.","brewcrew76","Oct 07, 2006"

2.51,-28.5,4,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3 1/2" white head over the clear golden brew. Gave it some time for things to settle down. Head calms to a meringey inch of froth, with sporadic artful lacing. Aroma is defined by a lightly tart and fruity essence. Flavor is tart and bitter, with little to no pale malts character at all. Mouthfeel is nowhere near as smooth as I look for cream ales to be, with drinkability just not that great in my book. Have to try this one again, maybe I was unlucky with a bottle this time.","ppoitras","Aug 07, 2006"

4.15,18.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle. This one pours a solid testaceous color with a finger of white, compact head. Clarity is almost perfect, and there is an enormous cascade of bubbles in the brew. Taking a sniff, I get very mild aroma in this one. There is a light corn sweetness, very faint lemony kiss, and a mild husky grain. I'm really having to work to get any arom on this one other than some corn sweetness. Flavor is right there with the aroma. Good corn and husky grain flavors, though not offensive and abbrasive huskyness, with a light lemon zest on the finish, with a very mild bitterness coming in the finish as well. This one is very straitforward, but there is nowhere to hide any flaws. Much of what I expect in a cream ale. Mouthfeel is moderate with a very solid moderate carbonation that makes this one very lively. I enjoy the way the bittering hop hits late in the finish, keeping it from being a focus, but letting me know it is there as I go for another sip. This is a fairly simple beer in my mind, but they do it well.","kmpitz2","Jul 22, 2006"
4.13,17.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,5,"A solid cream ale. A summer quencher for sure to be enjoyed when ever, where ever within the dog days of summer. Gone in to time and another is just as easy to down.","tavernjef","Feb 18, 2006"

The closest thing I've seen to it is New Glarus's Totally Naked. Though it looks like very slightly gold-tinted water, it's not unattractive. It has excellent lacing and bubble action. Really doesn't smell like much at all. Taste isn't bold by any means, but subtlely sweet, with a really nice mouthfeel and aftertaste. This is very easy to drink, but is barely there at all. Coon Rapids Cream Ale, the phantom beer.","battlekow","0"
3.63,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"64 ounce growler. This beer pours out a dull yellow color with a white head. Bready aroma. It could be my imagination, but I think I can smell the corn. Alcohol becomes noticable in the nose as the beer warms, though I doubt the abv is very high. Biscuity malt flavor. The flavor is a little too sweet for me. Although this is not a very hoppy style of beer, I think this beer could use some more hops. Mouthfeel is light. Although this beer is sweet, it is still quite drinkable. This beer is pretty good for the style, but just as a beer it's nothing special.","beveragecaptain","Jul 05, 2003"
