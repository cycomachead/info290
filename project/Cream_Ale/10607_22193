3.79,-2.8,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter at the brass tap midotwn tallahassee, Pours a copper orange with tangerine highlights when backlit. Head is comprised of big off white sticky bubbles and tattered sheets of spongey lace. Head deflates quickly in to a sheet of large bubbled foam. Aroma consists of bright grapefruit and citrus hops with some sweet mango mixed in. Aroma is strong though not complex but simple is good with this profile. Taste is hoppy with lemon zest and white grapefruit citrus dominates up front the beer trails off mostly after this as mid pallet is void of anything in particular and the finish comes up with a mineral and chalky dry finish. The hang is bitter and consists of a little pine and citrus. This beer smells tastes and drinks like a pale. Im not exactly sure what puts it into the cream ale category accept for maybe the lack of a malt backbone. That being said it feels intentional while drinking it not like just an under done pale ,but I do like my cream ales with a little lactose or dextrose which this seems to lack. The mouthfeel is light and crisp slightly fizzy but not to a fault. Not really what I was expecting at all from this style , this beer falls into the different but not bad category, A great poolside or beach option when looking for something crisp in a can. Overall not a bad beer by any means. Sixpoint delivers as usual.","Fieldzy27","Jul 28, 2014"

Too sweet to be an APA. More consistent with a light EPA with higher carbonation level that makes it taste crisper. Honey rolls, caramel flavors not pronounced but qualities of both found. Creaminess from the caramel; and, floral sweetness with a bready backbone from honey rolls. I could drink these forever.","orcrist_cleaver","Jul 28, 2014"

3.91,0.3,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight caramel malt, slight earthy malt, hops, slight alcohol, and cream. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of caramel malt, hops, slight alcohol, slight cream, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good aroma, feel, body, and blend for a Cream Ale.","Tone","Jul 07, 2014"

The taste follows the nose but has a wider array of fruit: blood orange, apple, strawberry, apricot, along with that same sweet bread malt. It doesn't taste like any cream ale I've ever had, nor does it fit into any known category, but man is it tasty.

After having this a few times now, though, I find myself liking it. The metallic note and the hop kick perk up the style and make me more interested in having more than one. A fairly pretty beer as well, with a nice copper color and fine head and creamy enough in the mouth to evince the style. An interesting twist on a somewhat boring style.","Georgiabeer","Sep 15, 2013"

It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, grass, light flowers, light orange rind, and a streak of biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with the grass and wheat really strangling out everything else. What results is a mild bitterness that seems a touch out-of-place and detracts from the proceedings for me. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, despite the bitterness, which isn't all that powerful anyway, this is a solid cream ale. It may not be all that indicative of the style, but it's enjoyable enough.","TMoney2591","Nov 19, 2012"

The nose features loads of caramel malts, hints of butterscotch, toffee, and herbal hops which provide a dash of bitterness. The taste is even heavier on the butterscotch and sweetness. Not sure if this is the intended sweetness or if it is some diacetyl. Either way, it provides a nice change of pace from the stouts, IPAs, and sours I've been predominately drinking. The finish has just enough bitterness to keep the taste from being too sweet. The mouth feel has some weight with a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice cream ale.

The mouthfeel on this one is pleasantly creamy, giving a unique ripple to the hops. Amid the flavors is a hint of orange zest as well as some earthy grass notes. In the aftertaste, the orange zest continues to tickle the sides of the tongue with the hops rapidly fading. One obviously would not buy this beer for the hops.

The nose is a gentle blend of light toasted malt, a distinct citrus fruit, with a hint of earthy resin. The flavor is very much the same. Hoppier than I expected, a welcome addition. Blends well with the gentle toasted malt and fruity sweetness. Not overly sweet or bitter, very nice, just right. Finishes creamy and clean. Light bodied and well carbonated.

I get some slightly sweet amber malts, light citrus, light happiness, and it has a certain creaminess to it, indicative of a can.The flavors are light and smooth. I get a lot of smooth malts with citrus accents and a ever so slight hop bitterness. It is incredibly smooth and creamy, obviously made for a can. It's solid, and much different than other cream ales I've had. It has more body and isn't as session able yet has more flavor and more to offer.","aasher","Jan 28, 2012"

There is a slight lemony astringent aspect with the mild tannic flavor as the carbonation relaxes slightly. The flavor verges on tropical fruit and pineapple with the peppery hops holdy on into the last sips with a subtle tanginess of grapefruit and tangerine. The flavor has a woody note, not sure if it is hop or malt derived, but the flavor seems drying with a light yeasty tinge with a moderately astringent flavor as it ends. This is a unique beer, I can't say it is the best of the style but it is interesting and held my interest the whole time with a nice hoppy aspect and mostly dry texture that appeals to me.","Slatetank","Dec 28, 2011"

Hops present themselves in a lemon/lime citrus aroma. Taste- a medicinal flavor blasts my tongue.

Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, bubblegum, and subtle fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, fruity hops, bread, and a subtle earthiness. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. When I saw that this was a Cream Ale out of a can, I was intrigued. When I cracked open the can and poured into into a glass I was amazed. This was a really well made Cream Ale and a great example of the style. The bubblegum in the nose was the dominate note by far, which was quite nice. A well done brew that I would love to enjoy again anytime.","thagr81us","Dec 18, 2011"

Immediate white pepper, with fleshy stone fruits in the flavor and a bready malt character beneath. Citric hop snap rides in off the carbonation and melds into the malts, impart- ing soft floral and herbal notes, followed by ripe melon suggestions with some mild esters, thanks to the Simcoe hops.

It’s a hazy dark gold beer with a decent head and solid lace. Aroma is definitely sweet and malty, although the hops are noticed, and in the tasting the hops are definitely more forward than is typical of this style (by far) but it is a Sixpoint after all. The flavor is sweet and a little spicy, with lots of biscuity malt as well. Mouthfeel is nice enough, creamy as expected, with medium body and good carbonation; overall refreshing and a good session candidate. I would almost always reach for a Righteous or Bengali Tiger before this one though. If you like cream ales I would definitely give this one a shot; a big step up from Genny or what-have-you, although the hoppiness makes this beer a bit untypical of the style.

2.81,-27.9,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a hazy orangey amber, with a 3 finger nice thick creamy white head. Head lasted a few minutes before leaving a thin layer, with some great clinging to the sides. Aroma was a bit strange. A tad of sweetness was offset by a bit of bitterness, but ended up to be a slightly strong sweet cream aroma with an undertone I couldn't place. Flavor was equally tough to place. Seemed to me to be strongly of a rice or corn flavor, not what I would expect for something called "Sweet" or cream. Felt decent, plenty of tickle from the carbonation, and was a decent coating. Overall this didn't do it for me. Not at all impressed, really seemed to be a low end macro almost, not a highly rated craft beer.","mountdew1","Oct 03, 2011"

A bit herbal. Taste is sweet. Good amount of hop flavor with more of that spicy orange peel taste. Slightly bitter at the end with some herbal notes. Really crisp and easy to drink at a quick pace. Creamy mouthfeel. I wasn't in a rush to try this one since it was a Cream Ale, but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. This seems to be a perfect beer for the warm months. Overall, certainly worth having again.","PicoPapa","Sep 27, 2011"

Lots of bitter earthy hops keep this less balanced than the side of the can would lead you to believe. Medium body and carbonation level, slick almost sticky mouthfeel.

Pours a beautiful honey-orange hue with a semi-hazy clarity, and a rocky, 1.5 inch cream-colored head. Head eventually recedes into an 1/8th inch skim with some residual spots of lacing present during the tasting. Not much to the nose - a little grassy with perhaps a kiss of hops. I also get a slightly herbal quality. Taste expresses cereal malts, a light earthy bitterness and a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel is light-medium; however closer to light. Carbonation is lively and evenly distributed from beginning to end. There is also a slight acidity that kisses the salivary glands. As I'm not overly familiar with the style, I'll start with the obvious. This is an easy drinking, simple beer that would be welcome at a barbecue. It has some pilsner-esque qualities with a little something else happening at the same time. That said, I would more likely gravitate towards an APA than a Cream Ale; however, a very respectable beer nonetheless.","Jwale73","Aug 31, 2011"

4.12,5.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a pounder can with a bright amber orange slightly hazed body with a large light khaki head forming thick and rising well above the rim of my glass. Lacing is well banded and even down the sides of my chalice. Aroma has more great smelling cereal grains with a bit of orange peel and marmalade sweetness in the background. It's like hanging out in the grain room it really gives the experience of mashing in freshly cracked malts. Flavor wise it's interesting I was expecting something one dimensionally sweet, because of the cream ale style and the name Sweet Action. However this beer is all about the balance between the malts and hops and even more so in this case it's got a nice solid lingering citrus hop bitterness with each sip. Each sip has a nice malty diverse flavor not just sweet, but a blend of diferent flavors hit the palate. It's actually quite dry even semi spicy with a dry yeast nuttiness going on, it's hard to pick out the hops used here not typical alpha acid hops used in most micros today something earthier. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an even nice flowing carbonation really nothing harsh about it and like I said the dry finish only helps the drinkability. Overall a quality beer out of Brooklyn NYC, I'm glad I got the chance to try it.","WVbeergeek","Aug 28, 2011"

Smell is of nice citrus zest and herbal hops with a slight honey smell as the beer warms. Taste is a nice balance between sweet malt and citrus zest and herbal hops. Mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

3.77,-3.3,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Sweet Action pours a mildly hazy orange, with some definite tangerine highlights shining through with proper lighting. The pour yields about three fingers of white foam that crown the beer. Head retention is solid, and lacing is left in a web-like pattern down the side of the glass. Not a bad looking beer at all, though probably a little dark for a cream ale. The nose isn't particularly loud, but there's a definite grainy sweetness present, with a very lightly spicy hop character making itself known as well. No surprises as the beer travels across my palate, that same grainy, almost lightly cereal sweetness greets me with each sip, followed by just enough bitterness and hop flavor to nicely balance the beer. The body is nice and light, playing into the whole "easy drinking" angle, but the carbonation just falls a little bit dull, making the mouthfeel come across as a bit too slick at times. Sweet Action is a pretty good beer for what it's trying to be style wise, but it's not a beer I'm going to come back to again and again on my own.

My first sense of the nose raised a crisp pilsner note of spice followed quickly by a fruity peach. The mouth is creamy smooth, nicely carbonated, with a substantial presence to the body. Full flavored, nicely balanced spicy peach and sweet malts. Clean crisp finish to the mouth while the taste lingers nicely. The 5.2% ABV really lends to the overall drink-ability. Found these 4pk cans at Premier Gourmet in Kenmore NY...$2.50 ea or $9.50 for the pack. Really nice offering from team Sixpoint.","jjayjaye","Jun 26, 2011"

I had one prior to this review and the prominence of the hops made me think it was skunked, though its short stay in the freezer to cool it down probably numbed some of the malt flavors. The one at proper temperature was much better, however, and was a lot more palatable. I can see this being an excellent after-dinner beer on a summer evening.","Monkey962","Jun 25, 2011"

Biscuity malt taste in the background with flavors of fresh juicy hops up front, peach and orange blossom, sugary, grassy and slightly herbal. Comes off more as an APA than a cream ale. Very smooth and medium-bodied, incredibly drinkable. Fresh, crisp, sweet.","Rifugium","Jun 17, 2011"

Two fingers of dense tawny head with great retention and a deep-orangish amber colored beer with a slight haze says either APA or BUPGOO! Sweet! Not sweet was the nose, which was grassy, minty and floral. Cream Ale just got schooled, yo! Mouthfeel was medium and there was a soft (as opposed to sharp) bitterness in the mouth. Sweet! This is as excited about a CANned beer as I have been in a while! Finish was mildly bitter, enough to sustain a hops junkie like me, but still mild enough not to drive off the uninitiated.

I poured this can at fridge temperature, but didn't find too many additional layers of flavor as it warmed. The mouthfeel is, appropriately, creamy. A very easy beer to drink, though I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as a summer beer.

There was a touch of floral hops with a bit of breadiness. Pretty tame. Really tame, in fact. The taste countered with an explosion of flavor. Perfect balance between light bready/grainy sweetness and floral and herbal hops. Nice and delicate. Very refreshing. Best cream ale, by far. The feel backed that up. It was nice and crisp with a solidly bitter finish. Really well done. Enthusiastic thumbs up, Sixpoint.","Thorpe429","Apr 25, 2011"

Smells very hoppy, like a citrus variety, grapefruit-y, and the taste is there too. It's got an English quality to it in the malt dept, more bread-y with of course, a thick and creamy mouthfeel.

3.67,-5.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a copper color with minimal head, retention and lacing. Scent is of sweet carmel malts, faint orangy sweetness and musty, grassy hops. Taste brings a somewhat candied, fruity sweet backing to the honey and carmel tastes, but lingering is a somewhat stale grain taste. Hops are present but seem to enhance the sweetness. Medium bodied yet oily and chewy, very lightly carbonated. A decent beer that really didnt appeal to my tastes and seems more agressive than its classification.","rfgetz","Jul 26, 2010"

Light hop flavors of citrus, light hop bitterness in the center and finish, floral notes, a dab of honey, and butter. Medium bodied with a solid malt foundation. An exceptionally sessionable ale that hits the sweet (but not too sweet) malts and balances it with hop bitterness better than trapeze artist. Sweet Action! Dude, what does mine say? Sweet Action!","JRed","Dec 31, 2009"
4.47,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a medium gold with light carbonation and a perfect dense foamy head. Aroma of grapefruit and west coast hops emanate from the glass; almost suggesting a sweet taste sensation to follow. But alas, the flavor of this brew is outstanding; moderate to generous bitterness, slightly off dry and ultra smooth in the mouth. This beer reads like a lighthearted IPA without having hopping that is too over-saturated; which would disable the insane drinkability factor of this brew. Fresh and satisfying this is a brew that must be sampled given the opportunity. Bravo!","barknee","Dec 06, 2009"

3.05,-21.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,3,"Poured a golden-orange color, with a very thin head, and spotty lacing. Smell was decidedly sweet...orange & pineapple...with some maltiness and some grassiness. The sweetness was way too overpowering in the flavor, like over-ripe pineapple and orange, with a dry grassy/herbal finish. The flavor was mitigated somewhat by the soft, thin-bodied mouthfeel, but the sweetness was just over the top. Not much balance. Overall, it tasted like a thin-bodied double-ipa, with huge amounts of citrus and no bitter hop balance. Was very surprised to get this result, after reading all of the stellar reviews and awards.

3.6,-7.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a deeper and hazy golden color with an aveeraged sized off white head. Aromas of citrus, caramel, a little bready and lightly earthy. Tastes of the same breadiness, caramel, and lighter citrus. Light lacing left on the glass. Not a bad session ale and quite tasty for a Cream Ale.","hopdog","Feb 02, 2009"

4.21,7.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this great session beer at PJ's in South Jersey. First, it is a great looking beer. Dark amber at the top and it fades towards yellow. Not too much smell, but may be the tap system or my poor sense of smell. Taste had a nice malty taste which finishes with a hop bitterness. Not incredible, but great for a session beer. Actually perfect for a session beer.","GeoffFromSJ","Jan 06, 2009"

Would have guessed a fresh hop or hoppy pale ale of some sort. Wonderful citrus aroma. Taste is citusy, with a candy-like finish. Good hop presence. Crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Could be a perfect session beer.","DrDogbeer","Nov 30, 2008"
4.14,6.2,4,5,4,3,4,"M&D--Sixpoint seems to have developed this beer specifically for sessioning. The bitterness of the hops keeps you wanting plenty more, and it's damn refreshing, if a little basic on the malt--but hey, only so much room in the parlor. The mouthfeel was pretty good although the flavor profile made it a little rocky toward the end of the tasting. Still, I wouldn't refuse another, or another after that another. This brewery makes me proud to live in Brooklyn, and seems to embody the spirit of what the place has become so well.","TheycallmeTim","Nov 10, 2008"

4.05,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Another great offering from Sixpoint, though perhaps not as transcendent as their Righteous Rye. Pours amber with a slight head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is strong and sweet, quite malty. It has a lovely sweet, malty flavor with a subtle hop bite on the end. The mouthfeel is huge and aggressive. This is a wickedly drinkable beer.","Seanibus","Jul 29, 2008"

It has a light pale and carapils malt scent along with a mildly hoppy aroma. The taste is great. It has a refreshingly smooth pale malt flavor with a very citrusy hop finish. It's light and quite bitter; very tastey indeed. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent drinking beer. It's light enough for summer drinking, but hoppy enough for the alpha heads to enjoy.","WesWes","Apr 22, 2008"

3.65,-6.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"On tap at Coles,poured from the tap into a standard pint glass a hazed light golden with a thinner but well retained white head.Mainly toasty in the nose with a bit of citrus and sweet-like vanilla wich was more pronounced on the palate.Flavors start out mildly sweet with some vanilla melding into a leafy hop finish.Not overly complex but it nicely blanced a good drinker.","oberon","Jan 06, 2008"
3.76,-3.6,3.5,3.75,4,3,3.75,"Tried this beer on a recent trip to New York city. I was pleasantly surprised at it's clairity and freshness, and depth of flavor. I was expecting something bland or watered down, but this was not the case at all. It was an orangey color with a small head, and the smell was of fresh grain and fruit. Taste was delicious, and a lot hoppier than I expected. I would definitely have this beer again.. too bad I have never seen it outside of New York.","alysmith4","Jan 04, 2008"
3.63,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Off the tap 5-5-2007. Pours a whirlwind of bubbles. Nose is very sweet hops. Flavor is a slightly subdued hop experience. At least subdued from the hop bomb comparable aspect. It is mildly firm with pine attributes. Subtle citrus tones on the body as a whole. Feel is smooth and slightly thick on the liquid. Overall a good drinker. More subdued than some of Sixpoints hop head creations.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2007"
3.95,1.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"On-tap at Cole's. A creamy IPA. Lots of C-hop aroma and vanilla maltiness. Creamy head on medium golden soapy head,lace fresh. Really good hoppy flavour, a juiciness like a good American Pale Ale. Then this extra level of maltiness that sweetens the finish. Bottom Line:The beer works.","Sammy","Dec 26, 2007"

It's almost a shame that this is a cream, simply because I think it limits the fine subtle flavors this beer would otherwise be capable of. That said, this cream ale rocks.","tempest","Sep 16, 2007"

3.85,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Served to me with almost no head, just a light white lace across the top. Color was amber, transparent. Smell was mostly piney hops, plus a touch of sweetness. Taste was crisp: dominated by piney, earth hops up front that gave the beer a dry, bitter taste. However, that was complimented by citrus flavors and caramel malts. A well-balanced taste. Good mouthfeel, light and well carbonated. I sipped on this beer over the course of an hour and enjoyed every bit.","micahgoldfus","Aug 20, 2007"
3.93,0.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy burnt orange with a nice two finger fluffy white head that slowly dies down to a creamy layer. Smell is a nice buttery scent with a bit of wheat in the nose as well. Very bready notes are detected in the smell too. Taste is so smooth and creamy. Sweet caramel notes flow over the tongue. Tiny subtle hop bite towards the end, very balanced. Mouthfeel is a good full creamy body with minimal carbonation. Drinability is very good, could be a session beer for sure. A style that seems to be overlooked, but Sixpoint does a great job with this one.","BeerTruth","Jul 22, 2007"

3.93,0.8,3.5,3,4,4,5,"I also must note that I really enjoy the fact that the ABV is low. Cream ales were always intended, in my mind, to be highly drinkable.

2.78,-28.7,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Glad that someone finally created a separate listing for this beer, now that it is being advertised as 'Sweet Action Cream Ale' on many of the tap handles across NYC. I had this beer back in April of 2005 when it was still a +7% Belgian/German hybrid - something that I think the brewer described at a local bar as a 'German Heffewiezen and a Belgian strong ale getting together and having a bastard child" - I liked that beer a lot, and I miss it now that it's gone. The beer that was Sweet Action then and the beers that have come and gone using the same name over the almost two years since I first tried it are almost all a far cry from the Cream Ale that is touted as Sweet Action today. The beer pours a light caramel color with a frothy head. Good head retention, nice lacing (both on my glass and my moustache) and strong sweetness in the aroma. The taste is balanced, but has very little hop character at all (I understand that this is a cream ale, but slightly more bitterness would be a nice touch). The sweetness that is present on the nose falls a little flat in the taste; in fact the taste itself is a bit flat, not so much with a lack of carbonation, but just in complexity. Overall this beer is drinkable, just not as flavorful as I would like in a Cream Ale, and just because it's not a Pale Ale doesn't mean hop bitterness or bite should be so subdued. I've shared my feelings on this beer and it's many, many incarnations with friends and we all agree that these last few months have shown a consistent product for the first time in a year. Assuming then that this is the final version of this beer (and maybe it's not) I find it to be an unsuitable replacement to the original beer that bore the name Sweet Action, and a pale comparison to other more notable Craft Brewed Cream Ales. Next time I'm given the choice of a Sixpoint beer, I'll stick with the Brownstone.","miskatonic","Nov 26, 2006"
3.55,-9,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"The Cream Ale lived up to its name..creamy head, amber/red color, a little sweet, not too heavy. I can see this as a good companion to italian foods with tomatoes and sausage.","DocBrass","Oct 03, 2006"
3.75,-3.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a creamy dark caramel body that is foggy leaving a thin lace that is sudsy. The aroma is citrus, hoppy, sweet hard candy, very nice. The taste is slightly watery, but makes up for it with a malty caramel mouthfeel, followed by a massaging of hops to bring the taste to life. This is very drinkable, but overall not much going on in terms of complexity but that is what is meant of this style IMO.","Franchise","Jun 22, 2006"
4.23,8.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: Wow, I think I may have found my ideal session beer, and mere blocks from where I grew up. Makes me eager to try this brewery's other offerings.","bklynbeerbaron","Jun 18, 2006"

But again, this story is about yeast, supposedly from Westvleteren. Smells like yeast. Trying to pinpoint some specific yeast/bread product, but can not. Tastes like yeast, again, cant put my finger on it. A little dry and a little sweet at the same time. Good mouthfeel, pretty light. Drinkabitlity? Was ready to move on when the glass was empty. Did I mention the yeast? Want to know how important yeast is in a brew? Have this beer.","kaimcm","Sep 26, 2005"
3.9,0,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Very interesting. Not sure this is exactly an American Blonde Ale. Thought it was more of an amber. I really liked the mouthfeel on this beer. It had some heft and was thick when rolling on the tongue. Nose was malts and juice. Flavor was some nice sticky malts. Very sweet with some apples and pears in there too. Hops were present but a second thought to the malts. Poured a light amber in color without any head.","MuddyFeet","Sep 21, 2005"
3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Quite an interesting beer. According the the menu at Half it is a cross between a pilsner, hefe, and pale ale and I think that is a dead on description. It started out being poured a nice golden yellow beer with a small white head. The smell was quite fruity and a bit juicey in character with just a faint whiff of hops. I was in no way prepared for the taste. It started off with the cleaness of a pilsner with just a slight hint of crisp hops lying underneath. Then therewas a twin assult of pale ale and hefe vying for my tastebud's attention. The hefe came at me with sweet honey like flavorswith just a slight bit of banana and much more sweet berry fruit flavors. The pale had a malty edge with some hops just adding a bit of bite at the end. Was very easy going down after getting over the initial shock of the flavor. Definitely worth the taste if just to see how different a seemingly simple beer can be.","GreatPondBrewer","Sep 16, 2005"
4.32,10.8,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"a light and clear peachy color with sporadic thin bubblings on the surface. smells oddly like a belgian white despite the classification here (and what are these classifications anyway? restrictions! bah!) aroma reeks of buttery wheat and mild strawberry, perhaps some lemony citrus.. pineapple and alcohol. even comes dangerously close to a belgian tripel. confused, i taste it anyway. wow.. yeasty and wheaty, lots of diacetyl and springy fruit notes. alcohol is no stranger to the mix and erupts with a pronounced presence. belgian influenced thru and thru with lots of flavor.. albeit somewhat muddled and unsure of itself. enjoyable beer and a great treat for summer. drinkability is limited by its potent flavor but one bottle (glass) is just as enjoyable as any of the previously sampled sixpoint offerings","goodbyeohio","Aug 09, 2005"
3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I sampled a pint of this pale brew, from Brooklyn's newest brewery, after work at the Collins bar in the city. It pours a typical yellowish amber , slight haze and lifts a white puffy and loose head. This one leaves better then average, scattered and light lacing. Nice. Malty nose. Medium bodied, dry and crisp ale. I picked up a note of rye in this pleasant sessioner. More quality/quaffable brew from sixpoint.","Billolick","Mar 21, 2005"
4.15,6.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This was my first taste of the newest brewery in Brooklyn. Sweet Action is a hearty blonde ale with a golden maltiness that is full but not overwhelming, along with a sturdy body. The finish leans toward sweetness, but only for a moment, preceeded by shades of fruit and dabs of crispness. This murky gilded ale is as pleasant to look at in the glass as it is to drink.","TheGipper","Mar 04, 2005"
