3.25,-6.3,3,3,3.25,4,3.25,"Overall (3.25): Well, it’s a cream ale. About run of the mill, except for some interesting, mild phenolic character on the apalte and a pretty solid mouthfeel. Fortunately, I like cream ales. It’s not my favorite (that’s probably Sixpoint Sweet Action), but it’s not horrible, and does have a thing or two to set apart from the others. I’ve often thought that you could do some interesting things with a beer that is a cream ale at heart, but using saison yeast and Brett; however, that’s not happening here. Still, in my completely unprofessional opinion, I would say this is just a not-bad Cream Ale, but not a lot more. It is what it is.","fmccormi","Aug 12, 2013"

3.3,-4.9,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.75,3.25,"What a lovely oddball of a beer, brewed with “wheat, corn, American hops and free range yeast.” While none of those ingredients are necessarily new to the Cream Ale style, the addition of wheat in this case overpowers what’s typically a much cleaner style of beer. However, while it’s missing some expected larger-esque nuances it makes up for this with its uniqueness.","BeerAdvocate","Jun 29, 2013"
3.38,-2.6,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,"O: The beer is easy to drink but lacks the smoothness and creaminess exhibited by other beers in the style.","metter98","May 27, 2013"
3.86,11.2,3.5,4.25,4,3.25,3.5,"I am glad that they justified the use of corn, which I have come to realize is El Diablo when it comes to adjuncts in beer. I have had so many silage-like AALs as part of The CANQuest (TM) that I CAN now readily identify it when it rears its ugly smell and taste. Again, stop with the editorializing. The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN, which is like getting a baker's dozen. Previous reviewers mentioned the discernible lack of head, so I employed the inverted Glug for maximum head production. It was still to little avail as I had a brief finger of fizzy, bone-white head with extremely low retention. Bye! Color was lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity and somewhere around Escondido, CA, Greg Koch was scoffing at me. Nose was an interesting melange of scents - light silage; I agree with Cresant on peaches; a peppery spiciness, perhaps from the yeast or the wheat or both. I still like Genny Cream, but it NEVER smelled as good as this! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and I did experience the silage-like flavor of the corn more strongly on the tongue, but I was still getting a fruity spiciness also. Finish was semi-dry, totally refreshing and more appropriate for a hot summer's day. BTW, what happened to Spring this year? It is downright chilly! Okay, no more editorializing for this review.","woodychandler","May 25, 2013"

3.08,-11.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, and skunk. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, slight skunk, and earthy. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but very weak. The earthy aspect I picked up on was kind of nice. But in a Cream Ale? That shouldn't be here... This one is worth trying for a fan of the style or a ticker, but once and done is good enough for me.","thagr81us","Apr 01, 2011"
2.6,-25.1,3,3,2.5,2,2.5,"The nose is fairly crisp and clean, but there's a fair amount of honeyish sweetness to this beer. Mild notes of peach and apple. Tastes decent enough, but lacking in the attenuation department. Definitely could stand to lose some of the residual sweetness, and to gain some carbonation. A little heavy and sweet on the palate for what should be a delicately constructed, refreshing style.","PDXHops","Jan 28, 2011"

3.5,0.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer was billed as a Farmhouse Ale at Asheville Barley's. Seemed fair for the style with a few American twists. Opened with a Wit-like color, but with less haze and more carbonated. Aromas of light malt / grain blend and a healthy dose of estery spices. Tastes of light malt take precedence over the grains, but contributing residual sweetness that lingered a little too long. Hops balance the malts while contributing backgraound spices and earthiness. Finishes a bit on the sweet / tart side. Body is quite light and refreshing. Low alcohols for flavor make it a real thirst quencer.","BEERchitect","Sep 11, 2007"
3.1,-10.7,3,3,3,3,3.5,"This beer would be a good crossover beer for a macro fan. The beer looked like a macro with a thin head. The taste was similar to a light beer.
