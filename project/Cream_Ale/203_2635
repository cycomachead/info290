Reasonably good malt nose and flavor, but definitely not meant to overwhelm anyone's palate...okay, we'll say bland.  Obviously intended to be a pub drink that can be knocked back for a while.  At 5%, this is a little more substantial than some other similar offerings, but it still lacks flavor and mouthfeel.  Disappointing.

Smell is of malt, grain, slight caramel, and a metallic aroma. Taste is much the same with a metallic aftertaste. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat but creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable, but it's best aspect is the appearance in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 16, 2013"
2.9,-13.4,4.25,3.5,2.5,2,3,"Pours a burnt amber color with a handsome crown of rich, delicate, Irish foam. Thick patches of lacing cling gracefully to the glass. Aroma is mild but clean and palatable, smelling of caramel with the slightest balance of floral hops. The flavor is sweet and slightly acidic, reminiscent of apple juice laced with caramel, with absolutely no carbonation whatsoever. It may be possible that I've tasted a flatter beer, but nothing comes to mind off-hand. Mild bitterness can be detected in the finish, but the whole affair is far from what I'd consider balanced. The caramel and apple juice waver back and forth on the palate with little else to wrest one's attention. The presentation of this brew was excellent, but the flat, one-dimensional flavor just doesn't back it up.","MaximalC","Jan 15, 2013"

Taste of toasted grains, corn, sweet malts, light notes of peach and apple skin giving a bitter quality, with a definite earthy hoppiness mid- to end-palate.

You get a moderate amount of sweet, toffee esque malt with an ever so light bitter finish. The watery aspect, nitro can or not, really takes away from the potential flavor. It needs to be fuller in body and perhaps a bit richer. It's very, very light in body and the nitro can actually takes away from the beer. It started off pretty well, then quickly went downhill.

The aroma seems to be slightly muted but I wonder if that thick head is blocking a lot of the scents from reaching my nose. The aroma that is there is pale malt and a slight fruit scent. The taste is good, just also seems to be slightly muted. Malts seem to be the most noticeable with a very slight hop flavor.

Aroma has a subtle hop character and a little bitterness, but also a sweet malty aroma. Taste is alright. There is a malty burst of caramel and maybe some other flavors I can't pinpoint. Not a very complex brew though. Also a slight metalic feel most likely from the can. Mouthfeel is full and thick. It is still and very creamy, but very appropriate for the style.

The joy is in watching the creamy carbonation make its way up to the top. After that, the show is over and what you'll get is a very average beer that really laces it up. The smell is malt, grain, maybe some buttery notes. The consistency of the beer is quite watery and the creaminess dissipates quickly. There isn't much cream after the beer settles. The taste is part tartish hop, part sour malt, bordering on curdled lactose, and part nutty dryness. I won't be trying this beer again anytime soon.

There are no detectable hops in either the aroma or the taste. What the taste does have is more of the what the aroma offers...sweet malty flavors. This beer is actually surprisingly sweet. As I said before, the beer had very light body and a flat taste, but I'm not sure if that was a result of how it was served or not.

Body is hazy honey and caramel. Nose is the achilles heel. At first I can smell only caramel but eventually I also get honey sweetness and a wisp of hops. I wish there was more going on taste wise, but as of now I only get some caramel, hops and a bit of sugar. There's a weird sourness in the aftertaste that I dislike quite a bit.

Aroma of oaky chardonnay which is carried over into the flavor to marry with sweet malts and an ale fruitiness. There is a slight sharpness and sourness to the hops which is typical of many European brews. The beer is pleasantly buttery, and relatively full-flavored for a nitrogen can, but doesn't do much to excite the palate, or other senses for that matter. Perhaps it can be best appreciated as an exercise in restraint. Prolonged exposure to this beer will add to its appeal (i.e. the more you drink, the better it tastes). It may serve well as an accompaniment to a meal of hearty but bland lamb stew, or possibly a very mild cheese, or perhaps it may be best suited to soothe the stomach after a round of Jameson.

Yes, the cascading affect is pleasant to look at but the widget is such an annoying gimmick. Anyway, the head settled at two fingers in height, very sturdy, the retention was fantastic. The subsequent lacing looked liked tattered wallpaper. The nose is uneventful, largely clean; maybe the massive head is filtering the aromas! Or not. There is some sweetness, some buttery hints, and a faint mineral/metal twang at the back. The potency is very poor and there fails to be a request to quaff. The palate is bearable, it is creamy and sweet with a little maltiness in the middle, and buttery after that, in the finish an indistinguishable trace of hops might have blipped the radar, maybe not. The aftertaste is mineraly and a tad muddled. I am not that well versed in Cream Ales, at this point I have had two: Genesee Cream Ale and Little Kings Cream Ale. Thats it, thats the list. Wexford is better but the competition is not much. As a whole, the palate is simplistic (that is polite for boring). The mouthfeel is medium in body, nicely creamy, but it does fall apart at the end, a touch watery too. Typical it would seem for a nitro-can. I cant see myself buying this one again; it is not awful or anything. It is just pointless. I picked up a nitro-can on a whim in Iowa City; it was a dollar at a grocery store.

Blurred light caramel upfront in flavor is lazily ensued by a faint, earthy and herbal hop presence with meager perceived bitterness. Vapid bready basemalt notes along with light bubblegum esters surface mid palate and provide a clement, yet obtrusive grain and flavored flouride treatment impression. The overall flavor profile is virtually static and doesn't change appreciably as the beer breathes. Lean, passably dextrinous in mouthfeel, but stagnant and lacking any vibrancy that would otherwise be present without the nitrogenation. Finishes with a brief metallic surge followed by fading cidery sweetness. This beer tastes flat and lifeless, yet manages to sit heavily on the palate. Even Boddingtons has more overall character.

3.68,9.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Moderate amber color, with a creamy rich beige head from the nitro can. Nice lacing down the glass. Faint sweet malty smells, not much else. Taste is a mild combination of carmel malt sweetness and a thin hop presence, if any. Slightly waterly feel, and thin finish. No earthy undertones to it, like soem other notable Irish-Red Ales. Easy to drink, and good with hearty fall meals. I paired this with a pork chop with carmel apples, mashed potatoes and vegetables. I don't think it stands alone very well.","StevieW","Oct 27, 2002"
4.3,28.4,4,4,4,5,5,"Color is a reddish tan/brown. Aromas are of trading-card bubble gum, honey, warm milk and ripe bananas. Flavors are a sweet blend of cream, tropical fruit, honey and just enough bitterness to give the hedonistic elements a little thrust and shape. Smooth smooth and extremely drinkable.","putnam","Oct 14, 2002"
3.23,-3.6,3.5,3,3,3,4,"Not super-impressed with this ale.I would like to try it on tap to give it a fair shot though.The nitro-cans down here can go through hell sometimes.It wasn't bad,but was lacking in taste,aroma and had a very watery mouthfeel for a Cream Ale.I think I will change glasses also to try and get the head to stay up a little longer and also trap a little nitrogen.I think that may have contributed to the watery feel.","dpend","Sep 13, 2002"
3.54,5.7,4.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Once the nitro-head has settled, there's a clear amber body topped by a firmly creamy textured, and creamy-white colored head that holds extremely well but leaves no lace. Still, very nice to look at throughout the pint. The aroma is of a very light caramel maltiness and some rich, earthy hops. The bodys is light, and the carbonation level is well restricted (<1.9 volumes CO2), giving an amazingly smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is softly malty and fruity throughout the palate, finishing only lightly dry and barely noticeable with a long lingering maltiness and some earthy hops. Although some might argue that there's not enough character here, I feel it makes one nice, sweet & creamy pint; although it may become too sweet with a few in a row as a session beer - hence, a lower drinkablility.","NeroFiddled","Sep 10, 2002"
3.35,0,4,4,3,3.5,3,"Nitro can adds to the appearance and mouthfeel but detracts from taste. A decent dose of bittering hops, but they can't hide a somewhat cloying dry finish. Not a beer to seek out.","inebrius","Aug 26, 2002"
3.41,1.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very similar to Caffrey's in appearance and taste, but I thought this was slightly better. Very creamy with a long-lasting head. Butterscotch color during the pour was nice. Very mild flavor.","Dogbrick","Aug 14, 2002"
3.26,-2.7,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Nitro-can cascade in the glass, head is very creamy and hangs at 1/2 inch.  Clearish amber after settling...smell is just a little of cream cheese.  Very smooth malty flavor, nitro-can pleasant body.  Maybe just a touch more hops than Boddington's but really little to none.  OK, not  a lot of taste, best feature is the creamy mouthfeel.","ADR","Jul 18, 2002"
3.68,9.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Golden-amber color with an off white creamy head with sticky lace.  Both the head and lace lasted to the last drop. Sweet, fruity, caramel and malt aroma.  Very smooth, rich  and creamy. Malt flavor with caramel.  The presents of hops is almost nil.  Could have used better/more hops to better balance the malt sweetness.  Some fruitiness in the mix.  A bit thin and maybe to mellow.  Overall this is a tasty beer lacking in body as for most nito can brews.","ThreePistols","Jun 23, 2002"
2.96,-11.6,4,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Notes: Give me a Caffrey’s in a can any day over this … oh yeah it is not available in the US anymore, I guess I have to go else where for an Irish Red. Not a horrible brew but I ask why even try this processed brew.","Jason","May 29, 2002"
3.11,-7.2,4,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Nitro Can.  Beautiful head(duh). Light copper color.  Sweet malt nose/flavors.  Butterscotch undertones.  Very slight bitter aftertaste.  Extremely thin.  Not bad for a nitro can, better than Caffrey's, but too sweet/thin for my taste.","pbrian","Jan 24, 2002"
