Pours murky brown like a barleywine with a small khaki head. Aroma is a horrendous mix of tequila and vomit, and nothing else. Seriously, smells like I'm about to just drink a straight shot of Jose Quervo. Completely awful. After I build up the courage to take a sip--and let my gag reflex settle--the beer actually surprised me a bit. It drinks extremely smooth, with big vanilla notes from the barrel, light lime but barely noticeable, lots of tequila still, but not offputting as the nose, and some caramelly malts to back this up. Actually pretty thick bodied for a cream ale, and it's needed to hold up to the barrels. I couldn't ever drink more than an ounce of this, and don't ever want to drink it again. Though I can't say it tastes good, per se, I'm actually extremely impressed that CCB was able to meld these flavors in a way that works pretty well. If you're a tequila lover, sure you've gotta try this. If you hate tequila, you won't like it. But it's quite the experience.","BMMillsy","Jan 21, 2015"

Also, there's a bit more of a barrel presence with dry oak and subtle vanilla. Slightly bready with caramel malt but the salt, citrus, cumin and tequila overpower the other flavors. I've only had one other tequila BA beer before(Zapata Bot) which I really enjoyed but this one is a bit heavy handed for my liking.

The aroma was comprised sweet malt, pepper, lime, wood, sweet alcohol, and cumin. The flavor was of sweet malt, cumin, sweet alcohol, pepper, and lime. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Holy cumin Batman! I am a big fan of cumin when it comes to cooking and this brew carries this aspect over into liquid form! All of the other aromas and flavors going on here definitely make a statement and mix really well with the cumin aspect which was definitely the star of the show.
