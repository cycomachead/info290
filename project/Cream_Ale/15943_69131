2.73,-8.7,2.5,2,3,3,3,"Canyon Cream Ale pours a bright straw yellow color with almost no head. There is an aroma similar to garbage that has been sitting in the hot sun for a while. The taste however is crisp and has a mellow golden malty undertone. The taste is watery, but still some flavors can be picked out. Overall it tastes good, but its a bit weak and boring.","vette2006c5r","Jul 08, 2013"

3.36,12.4,3,2,4,3,4,"Canyon Cream Ale is a true summertime beer. This is not a big beer by any means. It is very light and crisp, with a hint of honey. The taste is magnificent, especially on those hot summer SoDak days. This is a Crow Peak regular; one of the few beers they can.","benlippert","Mar 05, 2013"
2.09,-30.1,3.5,2,2,2,2,"Shared this gem with the rb crew recently. The beer is clear and pale yellow with a small white head. The aroma brings malt, yeast, corn. The flavor follows suit. Corn and malt. Light bodied with lingering adjunct flavors. Eh...not a fan of this one at all.","Huhzubendah","Mar 03, 2013"

3.05,2,3,3,3,3.5,3,"A buddy brought this back from his summer trip out to SD. The beer poured clear yellow with a thick head initially then it dissappeared and did not notice any lacing. The smell had some honey and mild citrus. Taste was ok, malt and a little citrus. Mouthfeel had a light body and mild carbonation. Worth a try...sure....would I get it again...no.","WoodBrew","Beers"

If I have a disappointing outing in person again I plan to address this with the bar tender. Hell I might even bring some beer with me to prove a point.","MNTom","May 16, 2011"
