4.3,5.4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours a slightly amber beer and it's thick and opaque.  Oft-white lacing which carries down the glass.  Cloves, banana, and tangy burnt orange on the nose.  Moderate to rich, full body.  Very similar to a straight hefe with a slight orange/cinnamon/and faint chocolate notes.  None overwhelming.  Finishes with a slightly sweet with a fruity, oft-lemon taste. Another top notch, high quality brew from Ayinger.  Tough to find a better German beer from any other brewer.","bigdeuce","Feb 22, 2015"

3.71,-9.1,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Overall- Pretty good dunkleweizen but not something I'm completely in love with.  It hits on all the characteristics you'd expect from a dunkleweizen, but its a just a bit too sweet for me to love it.  Definitely would try this again, but having a better balance from the hops to cut down on the sweetness would bump this up a notch for me.","CTbrew32","Feb 07, 2015"

It has a little banana and clove on the nose and a banana bread flavor spiced with light clove and lightly sweetened with light kettle sugars. Medium full body and above average carbonation.","pat61","Jan 28, 2015"
