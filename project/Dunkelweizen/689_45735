3.05,-15,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Bonfire Dunkle Weiss is ok....I am just not a fan of this beer style so ratings from me are probably skewed. This was a retro release from Two Bros. The beer was dark almost opaque with brow/ruby hugh. There is a almost non-existent head that is not lacing. There is a light wheatly smell and a sweet mlt taste. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with bland carbonation. Overall...eh.","WoodBrew","Oct 04, 2012"
