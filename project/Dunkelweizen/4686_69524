4.15,3.2,,,,,,"Had this with some bratwursts and sauerkraut at Hofbrau Munchen in Panama City, FL, at Pier Park.  Paired very well with my meal, and as far as I know you can only get this beer at their restaurants/gastropubs.  Not the best dunkelweizen I've had, but solid nontheless, and a great accompaniment to German cuisine.","Das_Reh","Aug 22, 2014"
