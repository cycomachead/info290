4.61,20.1,4.5,4,5,4.75,4.5,"Roasted, nuttiness, caramel malty sweetness. Not as strong of a traditional flavor of a Dunkel. It was a little thinner but easy to drink. The Walnuts worked very well. A tasty and inviting treat. Easy to drink. Not one dimensional but not too complex ether. Just enough to figure it out by the end of the bottle. I hope to get this one again!","KriekKrazzed","Nov 24, 2014"

3.63,-5.5,4.25,4.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"A nice look and aroma leads up to great expectations but a rather odd flavor and rather watery and rough mouthfeel greatly detract from the whole. Perhaps it's the black walnuts that contribute to the weird taste experience and the rather acidic and phenolic character. A hint of a hefeweizen styling and a bit of a nutty character barely pokes through the fruit and sour notes yet can't pull this brew together in the end. Interesting but not necessarily all that great...","beergoot","Aug 12, 2014"

3.72,-3.1,2.75,4.5,3.75,2.75,3.5,"Picked this up because it was on clearance at Riverside Liquors in Frederick. I figured it was interesting enough to be worth a try. Good looking beer but had a weird fizz when poured, almost like a soda instead of a beer. Fizzy head also dissipated quickly, had me a little worried. But the smell was excellent, very interesting, The taste was also interesting, and very good, but not awesome. But feels a little light, and again, kinda fizzy. Overall while not a bad beer by any stretch, being interesting is the best thing it has going for it. While I enjoyed it I will not be swinging back by to grab any more of these despite the good price.","JamieDuncan","Jun 18, 2014"
