3.59,2.9,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a slightly hazy, medium-dark mahogany amber with a fine three finger off-white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of mildy sweet caramel malt, wheat, clove, light cola, spicy. Flavor of mild wheat, hints of caramel, nuts, toasted malt; finishes dry and bland with residual light wheat and clove. Light bodied. A nice smelling, but ultimately underwhelming weizen beer. Really quite a nice presention, and the flavor is fine, but it is very mild and unassuming. Meh.","LiquidAmber","Jan 12, 2014"

3.14,-10,3.5,3.25,3,3,3.25,"0.5l swing-top bottle. Pours murky brown beer with bubbly tan head, transforming into 2-finger foam in a few minutes. Relatively poor aroma: biscuits, raisin, banana. Actually watery taste as if sterling weizen was diluted, apple tartness, metallic tones, dull undertones. Inconsistent low carbonation, mild body. Disappointing experience.","Dentist666","Dec 16, 2012"
