3.71,2.2,4.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Best thing about this beer is its appearance. Poured with a huge, foamy, frothy, thick, fluffy, cream colored head that lasts a long time and good lace. Color at first is a copper amber. Aroma is very mild with malt, a bit roasty, and yeast. Not much else. Flavor is like aroma and I wonder why they even bothered. Body and carbonatoin are ok. Finish is like flavor and short. Forgettable.","rtepiak","Jun 15, 2009"
3.83,5.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"pours a beautiful head of dough bread mass cloudy caramel color. nose is floral, mild pepper, citrus, and burnt coriander. palate of gritty burnt malt and coriander. dry as ever. mild wheat malt sweet, bitter green orange peel finish and wheat husk. Sharp... not particularly broad for a dunkelweiss... malt properties fall short. yet the dryness is quite appealing. a palate cleanser if anything.","Daniellobo","Feb 18, 2009"

4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"OVERALL: A no frills winner here. Very enjoyable and very drinkable, and at 5% ABV it would make a great session beer. One of the best I've had and I would definitely pick it up again. This is the second Schoefferhofer weizen I've had, and both of them have been top notch.","sbe1","Mar 26, 2008"

4.2,15.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability: A fantastic beer, with complex flavors that develop late and leave you wanting another glass just to sample them all again. A standout wheat malt and great hop balance. ABV and smoothness of the brew make it even easier to have another. An exceptional dunkel weizen.","TurdFurgison","Jan 28, 2007"
3.4,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Everything about this beer was good, as I will endeavor to describe. The appearance was rusty brown, hazy, darker than other dunkel weizens I had and well appreciated by me. The aroma had the necessary bananas/cloves, but also included some other interesting fruits such as plum and raisin. It was actually a little "porty" in flavor, not really common for weizens but very nice. The taste was awesome, it contained all the fruits described in the aroma, just richly fruity and a little bready. The mouthfeel was thick and coating, and the drinkability was high, especially considering how filling the beer seemed. I highly recommend you take a stab at this if you see it, it was mighty nice.","RedHaze","Beers"

3.6,-0.8,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Taste is dry, banana bit of maltyness and a moderate to low bitterness however bit yeasty. Somehow missing the fullness of a good darkweizen and having a watery mouthfeel. Refreshing and easy drinkable for shure but bit mainstream and missing something.","paterlodie","Dec 10, 2003"
3.54,-2.5,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a cloudy dark copper under a beige 1.5 finger head with good consistency and decent retention, but very few lace spots. There's a nice strong citrus and spice nose with just a hint of caramel to smooth things out. The mouth is light and very prickly. Mild, perhaps watery taste of yeast, yeast and more yeast. Cilantro is also here. The hps are very subdued, but leave a slight dryness late in the aftertaste. A nice solid brew, albeit unspectacular.","Globetrotter","May 28, 2003"
4.03,11,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This dunkel weizen poured a cloudy, coffe brown color with creamy tan foam that persisted. The smell was wheat, mild banana, and a touch of caramel. The taste was malty with hints of banana (banana cream pie) and caramel with notes of yeast and a tangy finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and slightly creamy with medium body and moderate carbonation. This was a nice and easy to drink dunkel hefeweizen.","UncleJimbo","Mar 03, 2003"
3.8,4.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"First impressions are much what you'd expect, hefe aroma of banana, a little hoppy, slight sweetness. But once it's in your mouth it is evident that the dark malt has added a caramel flavour that has overtaken what little banana flavour is there. Nice, but could do with more flavour.","stoutman","Dec 03, 2002"
3.48,-4.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Quite nice, very quaffable. Sweetish, banana and chocolate flavour. Very, very smooth, and even a bit light. Still, theres enough, German wheat character (banana, clove) and dark malt character (choc/caramel) to keep you interested. Not the best dunkle weiss, but very solid by anyones standard. Not a bad drop.","rastaman","Beers"
3.98,9.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A good, spritzy dunkel weisse that makes up in refreshment what it lacks in depth. Murky copper-brown with fluffy head that doesn't last. Yeasty aroma with hints of pear and candy caramel. There is not much malt presence but it slowly asserts itself as the beer warms. Fruity, initially spiky, spritzy; a very wet, quenching finish. Smooth, easily drinkable, with a slight tint of metal deep down, the only off quality. While not as big and robust as some dunkel weisses, it's still very tasty.","Thrasher","0"
