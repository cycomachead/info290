3.14,-4.6,3.5,3.25,3,3,3.25,"Overall - Not egregiously over the best by date, but is probably a lesser beer than what was initially brewed. Having said that, I didn't find much to think this is a much better brew when fresh. I've had dunkels way out of freshness date with significantly more flavor than this. If I ever get the chance to re-review with a fresher sample though, I find it my due diligence to do so.","TheSixthRing","Jan 06, 2015"

3,-8.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Taste is surprisingly toasty and malty, with plenty of fruit undertones and a spicy, sharp rye malt character. Seems to be pretty faithful to the style, but I had a tough time choking this one down with all the sweetness and spice overwhelming my palate.","secondtooth","Aug 30, 2014"
