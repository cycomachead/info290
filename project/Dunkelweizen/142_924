My specialty beer store had a time getting it, and they don't have it anymore. For the last year or so, World Market was the only place I could get it, and now they tell me it's been discontinued in that size.  This site says its' still available. How do I get it?","AronRa","Jan 31, 2015"

3.97,3.4,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,3.75,"Years ago as I was going thru craft beer education, wheat beers were my favorite and this beer topped my list. I have grown to be an open minded hop head and haven't had this beer in a few years and not much wheat beer in general. I'm not the best person to review wheat beers. This is a very good beer but I am sure there are others better made. Worth a try, works very well with a couple orange slices.","hotpauko",
