3.5,-3.8,,,,,,"This pours a dark, murky brown color with a thick, foamy head. The aroma is full of banana and yeast. The taste is sweet, bready with a lingering tasting of some bread and spices. Smooth and easy drinking with a malty finish.","Lemke10","May 31, 2014"

3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I wanted to make some sort of blaxploitation reference/joke here, but I just couldn't pull the trigger. Hashtag full disclosure. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear topaz topped by over a finger of wan cream foam. The nose comprises dry wheat, mild orange zest, light pumpernickel, and a pinch of cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, with the citrus coming through a bit stronger. This is balanced, though, by strong spicy contingent, mostly clove, though with bits of brown sugar and cinnamon in there as well. I also get some rye bread in the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a tasty and enjoyable dunkelweizen. 'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Sep 20, 2012"

2.94,-19.2,4,2.5,3,4,2.5,"Beer is medium-bodied with medium to medium-high levels of carbonation that are complementary for the style. The result is a slightly fizzy at first, then smoothed-out and foamy mouthfeel. Closes dryly, with a bit of tartness and very minor stickiness across the palate.","falloutsnow","Jun 25, 2012"
