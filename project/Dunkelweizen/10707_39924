3.89,11.1,3.75,4,4,3.5,3.75,"I was quite surprised by this beer. It's got the traditional appearance, although the head retention and lacing don't live up to the finest Bavarian examples. The body and mouthfeel are what you'd expect as well, although slightly on the thin side. The flavor and aroma are where it stands out: I was expecting a standard dunkelweizen which generally displays less fermentation character than their hefewiezen brethren, but this one's loaded with dark fruit, spicy clove/bubblegum, and banana. It's gently caramelish with a light dollop of honey as well, and it's balanced by a combination of mild bitterness, herbal hops, and its softly spicy and mildly tart yeast. It's certainly not the best expression of the style available, but at the same time given the price it's hard to ignore.","NeroFiddled","Jan 08, 2015"

3.69,5.4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"JosephsBrau Dunkelweizen is a cloudy and lively dark amber beer with a thin, soft, slightly yellow film that leaves nice lacing. It has an aroma of clove, banana, plum and dark malt. It smells pretty spicy and a little sweet-- perfect for this kind of beer! It's medium bodied and quite smooth. The finish isn't very tight and leaves the tongue feeling starchy. Wheat is certainly the dominant flavor. Lemon, clove, stone fruit and an herbal note are present. The flavor isn't as strong as the aroma. There isn't really any bitterness here and the sweetness is barely detectable. This is pretty pleasant.

3.94,12.6,3,4,4,4,4,"A surprisingly good dunkel for not a lot of cash. Appearance is a cloudy brown with orangey highlights. Nice tan head that fades to a light covering that stays. A touch of lace here and there. Active carbonation is working all the way down. Smell is where starts to impress. It is full of overripe banana and clove. There is some nice malted wheat that cuts through and a lovely yeast ester that works a little bit of alcohol and pepper. Taste is again a really solid effort. All the flavors you want and previewed in the nose wrapped in a banana bread with raisins. Wheat malt gives a solid core. Finish is mild as it should be, slightly tart apples creep in with a darn near perfect balance that leaves more banana and clove and a mild floral hop bitterness. Feel is light and crisp with a lightly tingly carbonation. Light creaminess. Super drinkable and my new winter session brew. At $6.50 a six this is a stupendous value. If you like dunkel and you are feeling the tight economy buy a six of this and put your cares aside for a while.","scootny","Jan 27, 2012"

Small dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, dark fruit, banana, spices, and yeast. A nice caramel/toffee smell comes about as the beer warms. Taste is of dark fruit and banana up front followed by spice and yeast flavors. The dark malt flavor comes through on the aftertaste and provides a slightly bready taste. This beer has only a slight level of carbonation and seems a bit sticky/syrupy. Overall, this is a pretty good dunkelweizen but it smells better than it tastes.

The taste darkens the wheat, slightly sours the rye a bit, and seems to pour on the black pepper as though 'twere going out of style. I don't know about anyone else, but there are times where I find the pepper a bit o'erwhelming. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly prickly feeling, though this comes more from the peppery-ness than the carbonation.

I believe I only paid $1 for this beer. Better yet, it's really good too. Would I drink this beer again? I sure would and you should too.

3.39,-3.1,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured into 12oz glass. Poured with a small, tan head that quickly dissipated, leaving no lacing. A very cloudy, almost muddy, medium brown. Very bold aroma, a lot of banana and clove in the nose. The flavor also has noticeable banana and clove, with a hint of spice. Has a quick, sharp bite on the finish. The body is a little on the thin side, but not detrimentally so. Solidly drinkable, I can see myself drinking more of these as the weather warms. This a Trader Joes house brand, and I find it to be a solid value. A basically average beer for the style, for $6.00 a 6er, I think I'll explore the rest of TJs house brews.","beertunes","Jan 06, 2009"

Some folks here are calling it "muddy" but I happen to like this beer considerably and prefer to compare its appearance to that of the darker unpasteurized apple ciders. Powerful clove aroma, with bananas and tons of yeast on the nose. The taste is simpler than it could be but is good nonetheless. Wheaty and carmelized malts come through loud and clear. The creamy texture and medium-heavy feel of this brew are extremely appealing. Easily my favorite of the beers made by Gordon Biersch for Trader Joe's. An excellent deal.","droomyster","Dec 01, 2008"
4.12,17.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy brown/amber color. There's a small head with poor retention and only slight lacing. A sweet malt smell (almost fruity).

Wheaty nose of fresh bread, mushy bananas, banana bread, plums, toffee, and cloves. Nice. Tangy wheat malt flavors up front. Hints of toffee and bread pudding as well. Banana and banana bread flavors settle in along with some pear and clove. Yeasty, spicy hop finish with lingering wheat bread and fruit sweetness. Medium-bodied with a hefty, protein-rich feel.

Tastes like a nice accompaniment to Thanksgiving dinner.","HalfFull","Jul 17, 2008"

Tasted like a decent hefeweizen, with maybe a touch of roasted flavors but honestly if I wasn't going out of my way to look for them I might not have noticed. Basically, It's a nice tasting hefeweizen that is darker for some reason; it really doesn't have enough dark malt flavor to be considered a dunkel.

Mouthfeel is creamy and zesty at the same time, with a well-carbonated body and medium-light thickness. All in all, a pretty solid brew for the always cheap, $1 Trader Joe's lineup.

The taste was also a big dose of banana bread and bubble gum, a lot like the TJ's hefeweizen (which I always thought was a fun-house caricature of a hefe). Pretty much indistinguishable, actually, from the hefe, except for the appearance. Mouthfeel was medium-to-light bodied with decent carbonation. One goes down easy, but the intense banana and bubble gum with a complete lack of hop presence to balance things makes this a little much for sessioning.","eberkman","Beers"
