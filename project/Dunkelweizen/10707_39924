There are some wheat tones, molasses, bubblegum-like sweetness and barley malt. It feels a bit cheap but I like the flavors and diversity of this beer.","KYGunner","Mar 01, 2015"

Slightly sweet mouthfeel with decent body. For $5.99 a six pack you really can't go wrong here.","rangerred","Feb 15, 2015"

3.89,11.1,3.75,4,4,3.5,3.75,"I was quite surprised by this beer. It's got the traditional appearance, although the head retention and lacing don't live up to the finest Bavarian examples. The body and mouthfeel are what you'd expect as well, although slightly on the thin side. The flavor and aroma are where it stands out: I was expecting a standard dunkelweizen which generally displays less fermentation character than their hefewiezen brethren, but this one's loaded with dark fruit, spicy clove/bubblegum, and banana. It's gently caramelish with a light dollop of honey as well, and it's balanced by a combination of mild bitterness, herbal hops, and its softly spicy and mildly tart yeast. It's certainly not the best expression of the style available, but at the same time given the price it's hard to ignore.","NeroFiddled","Jan 01, 2015"
2.74,-21.7,2.5,2.75,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Aroma is herbs, fruit, hint of spice and roast, and banana. Taste over-the-top sugary-sweet musk, wheat malt, caramel, more of citrus and wheat sourness.  Scant head of white bubbles.","ygtbsm94","Dec 21, 2014"
