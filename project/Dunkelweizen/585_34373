3.67,-1.3,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Had a pint on tap at an Edmonton, Alberta area pub (Spruce Grove to be specific). After being pleasantly surprised by this brewery's weissbier offering (see that review), I had fairly high expectations for this one. Certainly this was technically proficient and nothing was obviously wrong, a brown-red wood color with ample fizz and an inch or so of beige quick-breaking head. Aroma features the expected banana and clove elements along with some caramel and faint chocolate. Body is much like that of a lighter macro-brewed weiss, on the thin side and featuring an apple-like fruity "young beer" flavor along with some brown sugar, raisin and clove. Banana is low level, at least to my palate. A little sour and quite crisp. Not as complex as its lighter stablemate but pleasant enough I suppose. I have enjoyed less fruity and more malty examples of the style but makes a decent enough patio brew when in the mood for something a touch darker. Not particularly sweet and maybe a little bland. Was hoping for something more robust.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 05, 2014"
