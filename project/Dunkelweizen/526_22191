I really liked this beer and could drink it as well as Kilkenny which is probably my favourite beer from Ireland","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","May 09, 2014"

Smell is nice and taste is a bit strange for the style, but I do like it most of the time.","safaricook","Apr 28, 2012"
3.75,2.2,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Texels Skuumkoppe is a very friendly, soft, easy-going ale. Someone craving a rich dunkelweizen might find it leans a little too much to the hefeweizen side of wheat beers, but that's really only a concern for style guideline sticklers that can't handle it when lines are blurred. Normal people should have a hard time finding a single bad thing to say about it.","biegaman","Mar 27, 2012"
