Pours a nice reddish brown with plenty carbonation and nice creamy head. Smell of fruitiness with banana. Tastes much like smell with some malt insets and other fruit. Fruitiness with malty biscuit following and a slight happiness bite on back end. Comes together very well with smooth feel. A very good dunkle hefe. A favorite for sure.","Gobearswalter34","Jun 30, 2014"
