3.5,6.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown in color and a bit murky with hues of orange. Poured with an off-white foam that quickly dissipated. Sweet, dark roasted malt aroma with hints of over-ripe, almost sour, dark fruit. Medium bodied with lazy carbonation. Flavors are similar to aromas. Roasted and toasted malt flavors along with over ripe fruit. Finished cleanly. Very east to drink, but very forgettable aromas and flavors.","IronLover","Sep 20, 2009"

2.05,-37.7,2.5,2.5,2,1,2,"This beer pours a cloudy brown color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes very quickly for a weizen. The head retention is very disappointing. This is an extremely weak looking dunkelweizen. The aroma is of cloves, banana bread, and eraser. It has all the classic qualities of a dunkelweizen, but they just don't blend well together. This is a very awkward smelling beer. The good news is the it doesn't taste as awkward as it smells. The bad news is that it doesn't taste of much at all. There is some faint toffee and banana qualities, b have to concentrate hard to find them. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with very low carbonation which isn't desirable in a dunkelweizen. Overall, this is a bad beer. Dunkelweizen is my favorite beer style, and the brewer has to work hard to mess one up enough for me not to like it. This was brewed by a hard working brewer.","KarlHungus","Jun 13, 2009"

3.68,11.9,2,4,4,3,3.5,"D: I'm torn over this one. The appearance and mouthfeel were way off, but the aroma and flavor were great. Crank up the fizz and get in some head retention and you'd have a nice beer. Unfortunately, this beer is only half right.","Rayek","Sep 13, 2008"
3.15,-4.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"In summary this was a boring beer to me. Seems like the brewer just phoned this one in. Not something I can really recommend.","Zorro","Aug 03, 2008"

3.11,-5.5,2,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D - Pretty good. There are much better dark wheat beers out there though. I've never really been impressed with Aktienbraurei...the Oktoberfest sucks, and that's a hard one to screw up. This is just mediocre. I like the vanilla wafer and banana pudding notes, so I'm having a hard time hating this beer.","pmcadamis","Mar 11, 2008"
2.99,-9.1,2.5,3.5,3,2,3,"The aroma is heavy with brown sugar and caramel. There is also some dark fruit, raisins, yeast, and bread. The appearance is amber brown with yeast chunks and a small head. The flavor is like the aroma and somewhat bitter and acidic. The palate is thin and poorly carbonated. I like the beer but it just seems sub-par in to many areas to be a great beer.","nick76","Feb 19, 2008"
3.6,9.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Hazy,murky brown beer, with a lovelly large creamy white head. Very fresh, aromas, spicy, medicinal partially,,red berries, some clove. Flavor much the same as the aroma, but with a touch of wheatyness. I liked the palate on this bottle conditioned lager..bubbly,yet still smooth and easily passes over the tongue. Unlike others ..i liked this beer..very subtle but tasty if you give it a chance.","Reidrover","Feb 18, 2008"
2.92,-11.2,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"D: Fairly good, likely to due the carbonation. Its different.","Haybeerman","Nov 18, 2007"
3.27,-0.6,2.5,3,3,4,4,"D'ability - Not an unpleasant drinking beer, but I could probably name a dozen german wheat beers that are better without much effort.","mpyle","Apr 10, 2006"
2.78,-15.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Poured from a 1pt 0.9oz bottle, this beer was lighter in color than expected. This was too light to be considered a dunkelweizen, and in fact resembled its brother St Blasius (weizenbock, apparently Helles version). The aroma is a little buttery, maybe a hint of lactose sourness, not too much of the clove/banana I expected and wanted. Same with the taste, this leaves an impression of slightly sour milk. Maybe the bottle is aged improperly, in which case this review is unfair. But really it shouldn't be sold to the public (me) if this is not the intended outcome. I drank it not long after purchase after all. Bottom line: worst dunkelweizen in this reviewer's experience.","TurdFurgison",
