3.04,-13.4,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"This beer pours with a muddy, near-opaque dark cola brown, with almost no head at all. The aroma is dark and fruity, with a light cherry-like sweetness and a little brown sugar overlaid on a bed of cereal grains. The flavor is likewise fruity and sweet against a nutty, dry graininess. There is also a bit of astringency and some mild but noticeable alcohol burn that distract from the initial flavor profile. It has a nice light/medium body, but the texture is a bit too drying. In the end, this beer has an interesting flavor profile, but a few negative characteristics drag down the overall impression.","devilben02","Mar 14, 2012"

3.12,-11.1,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Chalky palates and flavor throughout the whole beer. Roasty and toasty malts with some dry powdered fruit flavors as well. Palate is pretty thin overall. Pretty easy to drink, but not full on flavor.","scruffwhor",
