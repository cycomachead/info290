3.91,10.1,4.25,3.75,4,3.5,4,"Huge lingering beige head. Translucent cloudy brownish in color. Fine lacing as head diminishes. Some soapy qualities in head. Roasted malt and banana nose. Tasting cloves, coriander as well as some banana nut bread. Very creamy, lightly lingering carbonation and somewhat viscous in mouth feel. Leaves some acidity and drying sensation on my tongue. Overall, well balanced and not overly wheated. I admire many of Bayern's brews and applaud their adherence to the German purity law. I highly recommend this beer to followers of this style.","sporklift87","Jan 15, 2015"

3.6,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"This beer takes me back to my first visit to a pub in Dusseldorf. I learned later that the amazing beer from the wooden keg was called Altbier. Dragon's Breath is reminiscent of that beer - deep and rich in colour, slightly sweet nose, plenty of toasty malt flavour. I will freely admit that it's New Years and my taste buds may be somewhat dulled, so I will keep it short and sweet. Good beer - I'm looking forward to trying one with a clean palate tomorrow!","Bunman3","Nov 05, 2014"
