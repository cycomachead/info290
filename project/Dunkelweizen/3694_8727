3.83,1.1,2.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"This beer has a great and strong Weiss beer aroma. Every characteristic of a Weiss is in it. There is a lot banana and peppery clove. There was only about a finger and a half of fizzy off white head with no retain ability. It has ruddy brown body that I was not overly fond of. It was just a bit odd. The flavor starts off great and it has a fresh flavor but you can’t use this beer as a sipper it gets a plastic like taste as it sits. For the most part it once again has great Weiss profile clove, pepper and a bit of tropical fruit. It was very fizzy and a bit thin in the mouthfeel.","MTNboy","Dec 25, 2011"

5,31.9,5,5,5,5,5,"While I first sampled this beer in Germany nearly 15 years ago, I'm thrilled that it's recently become available in the U.S. I've also noted that several reviewers have this beer confused with Unertl Muhldorf, which is a completely separate brewery and product.","rings","Sep 26, 2010"
3.47,-8.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours dark brown like a dunkrlweizen. Had to recheck bottle label to be sure right one. Light nose with banana clove. Good amount of banana on the palate with toasted wheat cracker. Yeasty action in there too. Hard to get past the atypical appearance.","yemenmocha","Beers"

3.27,-13.7,3.5,4,3,3,3,"bottle as an extra. POurs really dark, much darker than I expected for a hefe. PLenty of citrus and wheat in the nose like I expect but the palate.... Not really what I wanted. More full bodied and syrupy. Its like a hefe extract, if there was one. I could only drink a sample of this not the whole thing, it's ok.","Cakanator","Jul 15, 2009"

3.45,-9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Taste is nice, not as sweet as some other hefeweizens, but a little spicier and more yeasty. Nice bready flavor and medium mouthfeel. Not as creamy as I would have liked though. Refreshing, but not the best hefe I've had. To compare, the Unertl is similar to Schneiderweisse, in terms of a style within the hefeweizen family, but not quite as good.","dasenebler","May 05, 2007"
2.23,-41.2,5,2,2,2.5,2,"Unertl was disappointing. All was well until the aroma test. Its was hard to get past the big stick of butter that fell in my Bier. The body was watery and the flavor was empty. I'll stop here and retest another time...","Ungespundet","Apr 22, 2007"
3.97,4.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Taste is smoky, reminds me of some sausages and has a nice husky malt taste. The wheat give the beer a nice grainy taste. The obvious ripe banana and clove are also present, with the clove being quite strong. The body is thin and make my mouth dry, it feels adstringent on the tongue.","Absumaster","May 01, 2006"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"D: One of the more subdued Hefe's I've had. Despite that, this is a very refreshing beer that keeps tingling the tongue long after the mouthfull has been swallowed.","GbVDave","Nov 09, 2005"
3.88,2.4,5,4.5,3.5,3,4,"500 ml bottle, bought in Germany. ABV is 4.9%. Not to be confused with Unertl Mühldorfer Weissbier (different brewery, different town). Hazy orange-brownish colour, huge off-white head. Lovely aroma of ripe fruits with vinous notes, oak, bananas and cloves. Flavour is moderately acidic and lemony, with faint notes of wood, sour dough bread and cloves. Light bodied. Like most weissbiers a relatively short aftertaste. I drank it slightly too warm, must be very refreshing when colder, esp. on a fine summers day.","Sigmund","Apr 26, 2005"
4.08,7.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"BB 30-03-06. Nice ans lasting head and a great brown beercollor and brown yeast soon after adding it gets even darker remembering more of a dark weizen. Nose shows lots of bannana esters, good chocolate and carramellic sweatnes. Only litle off is the yeasty smell that's also over it but not disturbing that much. Taste is lots of wheatmalts, darkmalt mostly in form of carramalts. Full taste and hardly any sourness and a light bitter aftertaste that again also shows litle yeast. Greatly carbonated and fresh and tasty overall impression. Easy but very enjoyable when drinkable and IMO well worth a try.","paterlodie","Apr 21, 2005"

4.53,19.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Highly recommended from a German who called weissbiers her "milk." Pours much darker then other weissbiers, and very hazy as well. Smell is like a traditional mixed with caramel. This caramel takes precedent over most of the other flavors in the taste too... only a little of the citrus and wheat. This makes it very sweet and all-mouth encompassing. Really pleasant to drink.","Toddv29424","Beers"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"At first glance, you would think that this was a dunkel (dark) beer, but the brewer plainly labels it Weissbier. Its slight caramel color is appealing as is its head that seems to last for days. The initial taste is of banana and clove as expected from a German wheat beer. The beer leaves a lasting impression of juicy apple with a touch of toffee. Overall, this is a fine example of a German Hefe-Weiss and a great thirst quencher.","ark57","0"
