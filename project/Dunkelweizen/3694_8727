3.83,1.1,2.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"This beer has a great and strong Weiss beer aroma. Every characteristic of a Weiss is in it. There is a lot banana and peppery clove. There was only about a finger and a half of fizzy off white head with no retain ability. It has ruddy brown body that I was not overly fond of. It was just a bit odd. The flavor starts off great and it has a fresh flavor but you canâ€™t use this beer as a sipper it gets a plastic like taste as it sits. For the most part it once again has great Weiss profile clove, pepper and a bit of tropical fruit. It was very fizzy and a bit thin in the mouthfeel.","MTNboy","Sep 26, 2010"
