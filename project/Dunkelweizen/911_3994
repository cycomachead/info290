4.31,8.6,4.75,4.25,4.5,4,4,"Pours a light brown color with a foamy head.  Aroma of bubblegum and toasted malt.  The flavor of bubblegum and banana, roasted malt, caramel and dry grains.  Truly a remarkably tasty, authentic dunkel wiessbier from Germany. So good and to drink it in the Teutonia Mannechor, Pittsburgh's German club, was outstanding.  Absolutely fantastic.","Stinkypuss","Jan 01, 2015"

4,0.8,,,,,,"O) I was expecting something similar to Schneider Weisse Original and Weihenstephaner Dunkel, but this is an entirely different take on the style and that is great.  The roasted flavour comes more into place here giving a well balanced and enjoyable bier.  Fill your boots.","Malt_Man","Oct 21, 2014"
