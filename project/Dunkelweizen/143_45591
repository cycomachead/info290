Pours a very attractive darker amber with garnet hints. And a lovely smooth creamy tan head. Can get peaches right enough in the aroma. They tend to dominate. Only later do the nuts and caramel arrive. Taste is rather thinner than expected..but its nice enough..again getting lot of peach, some spicy peppery stuff and a bit of nuttiness. Fine. KInda thin mouth feel but its got nice tight carbonation..that helps. Nice fruity beer","Reidrover","Mar 02, 2015"
