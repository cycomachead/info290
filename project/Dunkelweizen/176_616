Aromas of banana bread, biscuit, and tangy fruit sweetness. Flavors are rich and round initially, with a banana and clove forward flavor that ends up sharp and frothy due to a light body and increased carbonation.

The flavor has more a of date and plum taste, similar to a dark Belgian ale, with hints of the wheat malt and a slight spicy rye bread taste (though I'm sure no rye was used).

4.4,15.5,5,5,4,4,4.5,"500ml into a snifter. Pours a deep brown, almost black in incandescent lights with a massive head that doesn't want to go anywhere, just sit there on top of the brew like a fat top of goodness. Nice and cloudy too. Gorgeous. Man, the Germans brew great beer. I realize this isn't a favorite style of many people, but I love it in the spring and it's delicious. The nose is big and reeks of excellent lager funk that gives it kind of a banana like nose with the alcohol. The taste doesn't disappoint either, it's got a great sharpness from the wheat with a substantial and complex malt profile. Hops balance it just right but don't get in your face. Perfect after the big IPA I just drank, great contrast. Mouthfeel is like a semi-sweet loaf of rich bread, tons of texture. Leaves lace all the way on the glass as the head subsides a little and I drink some more. Very drinkable at this ABV. Wonderful beer. A classic of the style. Highly recommended.","chicagoabbot","Mar 17, 2011"

A brown that's more murky than just regular weizen cloudiness, with a fine cream-colored head. The aroma is notable for the baked bread aroma, and more clove than fruit.

Might take someone with a bit of a developed palate to appreciate it though.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2007"
3.34,-12.3,3,4,3,3,3.5,"Poured from its pint bottle into my glass, it has a earthy-brown color with typical wheat cloudiness. The head is comprised of white, little bubbles which dissapated quickly leaving moderate lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is made up of carmelized barley and fruit esters with little or no hop presence. The flavor is initally sour, but quickly blends for a balanced, medium bodied finish. There are traces of clover and toasted barley in the flavor, but not the yeast ester I typically look for in bavarian dunkels. That being said, I thought it was an all around decent wheat but not a standout for its style.","RiekerStarBrew","Dec 06, 2007"

Nutty to musty malt aroma, light fruit, herbal hops, and some sour wheat notes for a nose. Hearty nutty toasted wheat flavor with an assertive sour lemony citrus and low sweetness that increases slightly as it warms. Sour dough breadiness in combination with the citrus notes balances well with the dark malt. Mild herbal and bitter hop character is careful not to step all over the wheat character. Smooth mouthfeel with a mild carbonation and a pretty clean finish, slight dryness, and sour bread.","cabsandking","Oct 24, 2007"

It has a fruity hefe scent of pale and wheat malts along with the German hefe yeast, but there is a sweet crystal malt element as well. It's not overly sweet, but just enough to let you know it's there. The taste is average. It tastes like muddy water. There is a weak crystal malt flavor laid over a pale weiss taste. It's got a light sweetness and a fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average Dunkel. I'm not impressed with the taste at all. I'm not even sure this is a good weiss minus the crystal malts. These guys should add some more crystal malt and call it a day.

Just a touch of spice in the background. This is smoother and more rounded in the mouthfeel than its hefeweizen cousin.

The dissolving chunks of yeast make for a particularly cloudy brew, which also means alot to me in certain styles. This may be the nicest looking dunkelweiss I have seen in a long time, perhaps ever! Medium copper brown with some sediment and a huge, rocky off-white head that lasted forever. Smell was fairly par-for-the-course for the style, although I got exclusively spice/cloves and no banana on this one. Taste was yeast, dark cereal, and spice. I liked it.

It poured into a weizen glass from Magic Hat a murky caramel color, with shades of light and dark all around. Head was huge at first, then faded into a lacing that remained right up until the end of the glass. In the smell was the distinct aroma of warm baked banana bread with blueberries. There was also a light clove presence. My God the smell was lovely. Taste was spicy in the beginning, and then sort of doughy in the end, not what I would call extremely balanced, but that is what made it all the better taste wise. Body of this beer was light to medium, and ever so drinkable. The low alcohol and sheer delectable nature of this beer make it a great session brew. I could see myself knocking back three bombers of this and still wanting more. This is a fantastic beer. Right up there with the Weihenstephaner Dunkel Weizen for me.

There is a big banana and bubblegum aroma, with tangy wheat, clove, chocolate, and maybe even some smoke - very nice. The flavor adds to this green/grassy and fresh-cut-hay hops and, unfortunately, a touch of paper/cardboard oxidation.

J.E.'s regular hefe-weizen is excellent and this style is an equally good offering.

A very thick head formed as I poured the beer into my Duvel tulip glass, and the off-white bubbles remained until the beer was gone. I noticed an immense amount of sweetbread in the aroma, along with a mild fruitiness and hay. The flavor is quite fruity upfront, with a bit of cherry followed by essence of banana. Freshly baked bread dominated the aftertaste, which lingered for about a minute after swallowing. It's not a full-bodied beer; the texture is lean, but that's what I've been told to expect from this style. I should try more of these to further expand my palate.","CWiggins","Feb 14, 2007"

Light tan head, initially large and puffy, it settled down to a long lasting film and left some lacing. Yeasty, bready nose. This is a pleasant brew, nice take on a very tasty style. Yeasty, nutty flavor notes, also chocolate and cloves late and more as it warmed. Chocolate milk shake flavorings with a kick. NIce dark wheat","Billolick","Sep 28, 2004"

4.15,8.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Update - I hadn't even seen this beer in about six years then caught one at me local beer store and decided to take a second look. The mouthfeel was much better which led me to believe I just may have gotten a bad bottle before. The head again was a beautiful sight, even for a weizen, the yeast continued to dominate throughout, and with the better carbonation and lighter feel I took my rating up a few notches.","RoyalT","Sep 01, 2004"
4.13,8.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer pours a cloudy brown color, before adding the yeast from the bottle. The head is nice and big, about 3.5 fingers high. I have to wait for it to fall a bit before I finish my pour. The yeast darkens the beer a little bit and the head falls to about 2 fingers. The nose is dominated by the sweetness of the wheat with the estery banana hiding behind it. As the beer warms, the banana comes through more. I like how this beer tastes. There is a nice balance between the wheat and the banana, neither one taking the lead, but both of them coming in first. I like it. The beer is thick and creamy from the yeast, just what I expected. Drinkability is high for this one...better than I had expected. It is not sitting heavy as I would expect from the thickness. Each drink makes me want another. That is good in my book.","kmpitz2","Aug 22, 2004"
4.15,8.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Murky brown like unfiltered apple cider. Heavy yeasty smell. Thick, dense, creamy off-white head that looks as luscious as ice-cream and puts up a stubborn, bitter barrier to the beer. The beer is mellow and malty with undertones of banana and spice: clove, cinnamon, and vanilla. Creamy mouthfeel. Tangy finish. As it warms, I also warm to it, and somehow it tastes great with this roast beef I'm eating. I could have another.","gentlebubbles","Jul 08, 2004"
4.23,11,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"One of the best dunkel-weizens I've had. The malty finish is what I look for in dunkels assuming the requisite banana/clove thing. Cleanly fermented, easy to drink, with a nice body and great taste. I would seek this one out again.","Mitchster","May 12, 2004"

3.95,3.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Muddy orange color with a thick head that looks like the puffy head of a root beer float that eventually settles but takes its time. A nice yeasty fruit flavor (banana\clove\even a bit lemony) but not strong. Goes down very smooth, not as powerfully sweet or carbonated as other Hefe-weisses. There was a ton of yeast in this bottle (it settled for a week at my house and I still found yeast in the bottle neck,) accounting for the cloudy\dirty color (if you like the added yeasty flavor). Not much of a smell from this one, but very drinkable. I'd grab another one of these in the future.","PopeJonPaul","Apr 04, 2004"
3.98,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This is like writing two different reviews, one about the first pour, and the second with the yeast swirled in. Initial pour reveals a clear, mahogany(orange when held to the light), and an enormous, rocky, ivory colored head. Huge sheets of lace are left behind. Second pour is decidedly hazy. Tantilizing aroma of banana and clove, backed by grapefruit and some more spices. The second pour, obviously, adds some yeasty bread aromas. Mouthfeel reveals a smooth, medium body with active carbonation. Taste is plenty malty for me, with some hints of chocolate and wheat bread. The spiciness noted in the nose is also prominent in the flavor profile. Unripe banana lends a citrus note, as well. Yeastiness takes over the finish, with fresh baked bread being overpowered by an earthy, mushroomy, finish. Aftertaste still retains plenty of sweetness. This was surprisingly complex, and difficult to review. If you're opening a bottle that has been sitting for a few weeks, you will get two different expereinces if you pour the top half first. Swirling the settled yeast, for the second half, is going to change things considerably, in appearance, taste, and aroma. Personally, I preferred the first half for its clear appearance with mostly sweet taste. The addition of the settled yeast during the second pour will tame down the sweetness and add an earthiness that many may prefer. A very fine Dunkel Weiss, here..with some notable characteristics.","merlin48","Mar 04, 2004"

3.66,-3.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This brew pours a cloudy, orange-tinted brown with a massive, rocky head....take care in pouring this one folks! The aroma is of overripe bananas and with a little bit of clove, but the smell takes some effort to pick up. Banana flavor shows up dominantly in the flavor backed by a fair degree of sweet breadiness which stops short of cloying; a tea-like twang from the yeast breaks up the sweetness. A good example of the style, but I expected a little more maltiness. Perhaps it's my own faulty perception but I expect the Dunkel Hefe's to have a more developed maltiness than their lighter brethren and this one is a little on the light side.","johnrobe","Feb 09, 2004"

3.48,-8.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This is a murky brown beer with excellent off-white head and good retention. The aroma is of mild yeast and fruitiness, but not particularly strong in this segment. I would prefer a bit more strength of smell. Taste is quite good, but somewhat watery compared to other beers within the style. Mouthfeel is also slightly thin compared to expectation. Not bad, but not strong. Because it is slightly thin, it maintains better than average drinkability. I like this offering, but I feel there are better dark Hefe's to be had.","niknar","Jan 04, 2004"
3.95,3.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The nose is yeasty and speaks also of a nice malt base. Plenty of chocolate notes mixed in here as well, along with hints of dark fruit.

Good drinkability on this easy drinking beer.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 14, 2003"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a real good dunkel, and fits right in with the best of the style. Nice chocolate undertones, with the typical large, foamy head, and clove and banana notes.

The head dissolved quickly to a ring around the surface leaving a few spots of lace behind. An aroma of clove, yeast and bubblegum floats over the beer. Each sip of this medium bodied brew begins with a mild clove taste which is quickly followed by fruity banana flavors, bubblegum and yeast. There's a wheat malt taste in the background holding it all together and mild flavors of banana are left behind after each sip.","WanderingFool","Oct 07, 2003"

The beer smelled particularly inviting, and I was expecting something really great. However, the actual taste was a bit underwhelming. It was tasty, but a little lacking in flavor when compared to a Weihenstephaner. Overall, this is a solid dunkel-weiss, and was priced around $1.50 cheaper than Weihenstephaner. I definately recommend this, as it is a solid beer.","WMBierguy","May 25, 2003"

Drinking did not reveal much hop flavor, but it was definitely fruity. I have read others mention banana flavors and they were correct, but I didnt expect it be as strong as it was. It felt full, while also light, in the mouth. It appears to be an excellent example of the style. Its definitely different and I will attempt to try the versions made by other brewers if I can find them.","Kunsan90","Jan 31, 2003"
3.97,4.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark brown with a fair head. The head retention is poor particularly for style. There was a hint of malt in the nose a slight clove aroma. The beer was not super cold and the head died quickly. So I suspect the loss of head may have reduced aroma. The spicy, fruity flavor was prevolant but did not overpower the malt flavor. There was no hop bitternes or flavor and no buttery diacetyl flavor. The beer had a very creamy fullness and had a moderately high carbonation level. The beer was overall very good. It is very drinkable and I would recommend it to someone as a good Hefe-Weiss Dunkel. It is not the best but very good.","LarryKemp","Jan 21, 2003"

3.8,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Cloudy, reddish-brown with orange & crimson highlights. The cream colored head is fluffy but tight; composed of tiny bubbles. It thins but holds a solid surface covering to the end. The aroma is lightly fruity and sweetish with some bubblegum and light toffee. The body is light/medium with a very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation that leaves it gently zesty in the mouth at first; then becoming creamy as it warms. The flavor starts lightly tangy, becoming sweet as it crosses the palate, and displays soft bubblegum and caramel in the finish along with some drying bitterness, a light smoky phenolic and some gentle clove. Although it's well balanced, throughout the glass the sweetness and clove have a tendency to build on the palate. A well-brewed dunkle weiss with some nice character and a good drinkability, but not a leader in its category.","NeroFiddled","Oct 14, 2002"
3.7,-2.9,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Formidably thick and persistant, stiff peak - like, ivory white head is supported by copious bubbling.  Hazy dark bronze in hue.  The signature clove and banana yeast esters are coupled with mellow chocolate, wheat tartness and slight mustiness from the yeast.  A light caramel sweetness rounds the aroma out.  In flavor, tart, grainy wheat quickly yields to banana and light bubblegum esters coupled with a very smooth dehusked chocolate malt foundation.  Caramel sweetness is light, and partially offset by the mild hop bitterness.  The body is perhaps a touch thin and not quite proteinaceous enough to lend a viscous mouthfeel, but this beer remains crisp enough for good drinkability.  Finishes clean w/ residual sweetness quickly fading.  This dunkel weizen possesses all the necessary characteristics of the style, but adds no outstanding qualities of its own.  Quite tasty and refreshing nonetheless.","marc77","Aug 14, 2002"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"A pretty well executed dunkel.  Loads of banana in the aroma, which carried strongly through the flavor, and was well integrated with the slightly acidic tangyness.  Mouthfeel was almost creamy, perhaps from the liberal dose of suspended yeast.","Brent","Jun 26, 2002"
