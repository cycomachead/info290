4.15,-2.4,4.25,3,4.75,4.25,4.25,"Very tasty beer! Scents of fruitiness and hops dominate when the bottle is cracked. I smelled either hickory or some other smokey kind of scent about half way through the bottle. I tasted caramel, cinnamon, and very subtle banana bread. 30 seconds after a sip I can taste some sort of berry flavor which is sweet, like strawberries along side a gentle maltiness. Somewhat complex, and a good beer to share with a close friend at a bbq for those who like to savor a beer. Overall, very pleasant beer. My favorite so far from Weihenstephan.","McGooTheWise","Mar 20, 2015"

4.63,8.9,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Nose highlights lots of brown malts and fruity esters.  Flavors start with a welcoming brown malty sweetness, then a sour apple fruity esters, and ends with clove spice. Minimal hop presence. Perfect level of carbonation. Clean and refreshing.","wiscokid920","Mar 04, 2015"
