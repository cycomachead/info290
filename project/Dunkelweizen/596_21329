3.62,-12.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a cloudy, golden-brown coloring that is slightly hazed with a thin, filmy coating. Good lacing along the glass. The nose is subtle, with fruity highlights, some clove spicing, as well as some coriander. Flavors are heavily spiced, with coriander, nutmeg, and all-spice on a tangy caramel backbone. The aftertaste is a spicy blend, with a smooth, creamy finish. Interesting brew.","GarthDanielson","Dec 18, 2011"

4.18,1.2,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is a bit heavy for a wheat beer but it gives this more of a robust quality I feel is appropriate for a Winter beer. Overall, a nice dunkelweizen but spice qualities overpower the malts a bit too much.","Kinsman",
