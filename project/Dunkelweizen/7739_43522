Really, a 'dunkel', from Bamberg tutoring, no less, welded onto a traditional English ale (so here in Canada, Trad from Big Rock, then?).  Fails abound, no lie, the German association is not even particularly wheaty, let alone a smoke-filled miasma, as I might have been coerced into being led into believing.  Not a bad brew overall, just nothing like what the marketing arm sai- oh, right.","biboergosum","May 24, 2014"

2.31,-28,3.75,2,2,3,2.5,"Pours a crystal clear dark brown with ruby at the edges and a wispy off white head that dissipates quickly. Butter caramel and toffee dominate the aroma, with traces of dish soap. I find no weizen or hops in the aroma of this brew. The flavor isn't much better than the aroma. Buttery burnt caramel with a soapy edge. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. I'm not sure what they were shooting for here, but its safe to say they missed.","johnnnniee","Feb 05, 2014"

3.5,9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Contrary to Picaroons' intentions, Dark and Stormy Night does not "provide all the rich flavours of a stout or porter with the easy drinkability of a wheat beer"; it lacks the quantity of the former and the quality of the latter. It has only a mild, trifling amount of roast and nowhere near the spice, fruit, or effervescence of a dunkelweizen. Nice beer, but not what's advertised.","biegaman","Aug 06, 2013"
