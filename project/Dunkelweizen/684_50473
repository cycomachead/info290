3.18,-2.8,3.5,3,3.25,3,3.25,"Pours a dark cloudy brown head, a medium beige head some light lacing. Aroma and taste is of dark lightly toasted caramel malt, yeast and some grain flavors. A medium body with light carbonation. Finish is lightly toasted caramel malt, yeast and grain. Aroma and taste seem a bit mild for the style, but still an ok drinking brew.","Samp01","Aug 08, 2014"

3.41,4.3,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,"nice pour, good head, great color. Tastes closer to a light porter than a wheat. Not much wheat taste or character here. Overall, very nice flavor with a crisp, clean finish. Some malty and possibly some choclately flavors. Overall, a well done beer sitting above average on the scale !!!!","hophugger","Apr 20, 2014"

2.37,-27.5,4,2,2,3.5,2.5,"o: As a dunkel, this misses by a mile. I don't think it even uses a hefe yeast. As a wheat stout, this is good beer.","DIM","Feb 17, 2014"

2.06,-37,3,2,2,3,1.5,"It has far too much roasted malt for a dunkelweiss (coffee, chocolate) and not enough of the characteristic yeasty flavors (clove,banana), quite a disappointment","ryane","Jan 26, 2014"
3.42,4.6,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with little light transparency and half finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, mildly nutty, slight sour note. Flavor of toasted and caramel malt, hints of chocolate and charred coffee, finishes with light toastiness and light grassy hops. Medium bodied. The malt profile seems closer to a mild porter than a weizen; I'm not getting much wheat character at all. Flavor has nice toasty malt and light chocolate elements, but seems to finish thin with a light sourness. An OK dark malty beer, but not really meeting the dunkelweizen style, and a bit odd for that. This is the second Leavenworth wheat style ale that seemed to be more of a traditionally malted style than a weizen. Odd. OK, but better choices if you're looking for a dunkelweizen.","LiquidAmber","Jan 09, 2014"
