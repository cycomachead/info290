3.78,5.3,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"got this as an extra in a trade.  the size is perfect, poured into a pint.  good clarity, dark amber color.  i got the slightest hazelnut in the nose.  very faint hazelnut in the taste, but it was there.  A very refreshing dunkel that offered a great break from all the big beers I've been drinking lately.  An overall good beer and I'm glad I tried it.","pmangold","Nov 20, 2014"

3.5,-2.5,,,,,,"Finishing with a slight cola-like tack, the beer's semi-dry and slightly bitter finish is just shy of the malty-dry finish of authentic German dark wheat ale and with the bitter hop presence to compromise. Yet there's the soothing taste of chestnut to give a buttery and toasty elegance that's not often reconciled in even craft beer.","BEERchitect","Oct 27, 2014"
