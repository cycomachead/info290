4.25,14.2,,,,,,"Pours a very dark brown if not a bitch black as you can't see through it. Has a good 3-finger foamy creamy thick beige head that settles down to a good 3+mm near the end of the drink. A good amount as well as sediment is seen in the bottom of the glass as well as in the bottom of the bottle. On the label it says "Hefe-weizen must be drunk from the glass-never from the bottle". No problem there. The aroma is of wheat with some hop aromas. The taste is even better than the aroma and has some sweet toffee and brown sugar in the mix as well. Very pleasant and goes down very easy. A tasty brew with medium body and perfect carbonation. A great brew!","BeerWithMike","Aug 30, 2014"
