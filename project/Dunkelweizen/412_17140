A good amount as well as sediment is seen in the bottom of the glass as well as in the bottom of the bottle. On the label it says "Hefe-weizen must be drunk from the glass-never from the bottle". No problem there. The aroma is of wheat with some hop aromas. The taste is even better than the aroma and has some sweet toffee and brown sugar in the mix as well. Very pleasant and goes down very easy. A tasty brew with medium body and perfect carbonation. A great brew!","BeerWithMike","Sep 29, 2014"

The bottle was one of those cool German flip tops that made a loud pop when I opened it. It poured an opaque dark brown with a full head with great retention. Overall the palate was light and thin for such a dark beer and the flavor was subtle with roasted malt, caramel and a bit of wheat. The flavors became more pronounced and complex as it warmed. This was definitely a lighter beer than I was expecting, but a solid German beer nonetheless and highly drinkable.","brurevu","Oct 17, 2013"

It certainly looks like the type of dark beer for a cold winter's night, but the taste is closer to a thin pilsner or even a Hefe. It just felt like it was missing that richness a dark beer usually delivers. Even so, I thought it was pretty enjoyable, and is great if you want a dark beer without that dark beer weight in taste.

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Its...dark chocolate both in color and in primary aroma, one finger foamy white head with really amazing retention time. Holding the glass up close to a light source reveals that there is actually a remarkable lack of sediment for something so chewy and toothsome in texture. Smell mostly like a turbo charged chocolate malt and very little of the expected banana bread. It may have been mentioned before, but this beer really DOES smell more like a Schwarz profile (chocolate, chicory, roastiness and a certain level of acridness) and taste more like the cloven banana bread of a Weizen profile. Not that I'm saying that the Schwarz-like flavors aren't there, they just push back further into the background while the wheat comes forward for a turn. Its really odd how they take turns on your tongue like that. Body is well carbonated, medium thick, and manages to remain refreshing for it despite the relative boldness of the flavors contained within. Well worth trying just on novelty factor alone, but also exhibits some real care and craftsmanship behind the scenes. Straight 4's across the board.","WastingFreetime","Jan 19, 2012"

A very light beer, one of the lighter dark beers I've had. The problem here is that there is a slight (very slight) roastiness, which doesn't add a lot to the beer in itself, but does negate any yeasty flavors, and once again there aren't a lot. For me, one of the great pleasures of a German wheat beer are the esters from the yeast with it's hallmark flavors of banana and clove, set against the backdrop of the soft wheat. Unfortunately I don't get that here at all, and there is no great roastiness or maltiness to compensate. Easy to drink, but doesn't hold my interest.","Georgiabeer","Nov 09, 2011"

I found this beer a bit lighter in body and lower in abv that over dunkels I've tried. Easily drinkable, but not a beer that I'd have several of at one time.

The roast scents are the most appealing. Although the taste has a little breadyness in the front, it's essentially dry. The taste also has a lot of wheat flavor...the nearly tart twang that starts in the mid-taste. The beer is full bodied and very drinkable. I could have a few of these easily.","Suds","Jun 05, 2009"

Think along the lines of a black lager crossed with a weizen, then you have where this beer is going. Pours a touch darker than the average dunkelweizen as well. Nose is subdued with some earth and some light wheat. Flavor begins with a dryish cocoa/chocolate entry then switches to a tangy weizen finish. As it warms the wheat takes a back seat and sort of blends more giving this one a single distinct taste.

It pours dark, showing a very deep red when held to light. It has a creamy mouthfeel, albeit with a prickly carbonation dominating the initial sensation. The malt and wheat flavors are the star. A touch of alcohol comes out on the finish, along with a lingering bit of dark, sweet bread. There is a bright sweetness in the middle that works well, allowing some yeasty action to join the fray, though subtly. No particular fruit comes to mind, just an essence of fruitiness.

I had never heard of a black Hefe and I knew I had to have one, I just had to. Rang up for 1.99 so I was not complaining and out the door I went. Pour was true to the name, very dark brown, nearly black and you could tell it was hazy and full of suspension. Big, towering two inch plus head of foam on top nearly would not stay in the glass and really looked quite full. Tons of side glass lace and a great look. Smell was very nice as well, the main player here being a yeasty and wheat aroma, but the nicest blend of roasted malts and even a touch of some caramel or dark nuttiness mixed in really set it off. The flavor was fantastic. Such a smooth creamy feel, but then again such great carbonation that it did not feel too full or too dull. Flavors were all over, you could definitely tell it was a Hefe as the classic flavor was there, but there were definite hints of roasting, or smoked aromas which were also as big and served to not only darken up the flavor but also the color. Really quite rich, with a touch of sweetness in the middle, and a bite of bitter at the end. This was great with dinner and I actually took a while to finish it, it was just that good. Overall I was not only impressed, but shocked at how good this was. This may have been one of my favorite that I have reviewed in a long time. This was just really outstanding and a shining example of a new style to me. I will be grabbing every bottle I see if I ever see it again and making this my choice of the week if I can.

Refreshing wheat and yeast mainly with some underlzing chocolate. There is a tinge of sourness that comes off as lemony in most wheat beers, but for some reason makes me think of sour cherries. Possibly the mix of dark malts with the lemony flavor? I don't think it's bad, but it does seam out of place. Finishes fairly clean leaving a feeling of carbonic acid in my mouth and burps of yeasty banana. Mouthfeel is just ok. The carbonation is a bit abbrasive and not as soft as I was expecting. It tastes like the diluted a really good Dunkel Weizen with about 20% sparkling water.","HappyHourHero","Sep 26, 2006"

3.51,-5.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a five+ finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace, ton of yeast left in bottle. Deep mahogeny/brown color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Starts balanced, slight malty flavor, roasted malt finish, yeast is not noticeable. $2.45 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","Aug 07, 2006"

3.32,-10.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a dark brown with a huge off white head that fades away. Smells of citrus, hops, banana, with a bit of yeast and wheat. A strong hefe taste mostly of the banana with a small bitter taste. The aftertaste is mostly wheat but fades quickly. After the first sip the beer has a good balance of flavor and has a watery feel to it. The carbonation is subtle. This beer is refreshing and different, but worth checking into for hefe fans.","wingman14","Jun 08, 2006"
3.33,-10.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Standard 500 mL German bottle with some code on the back label. It pours into the weizen glass almost black with some sediment and a finger of tan head with an aroma of roasted/earthy malts. The taste adds to this faint notes of chocolate, spice, banana, and a yeast/wheat tang on top of a light to medium body that seems a bit thin. About average for a dunkel I'd say.","mmmbeer","Jun 01, 2006"

4.15,11.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a dark almost black brown with a small bubbly tan head. The aroma is very nice typical hefe nose of banana, wheat, honey, cinnamon, citrus hops. The taste starts malty on the palate with a slight caramel sweetness followed by a cinnamon, pepper, spicy citrus hop bite. Finishing light on the palate, soft and bready in the finish....fantastic.","Franchise","May 10, 2006"
2.98,-19.9,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Served in a 1pint .9oz bottle. Pours murkish black, with a ruby red hue when put against light. Has a frothy head that slowly settles to the size of one finger width. Smells like a wheat beer. Taste has notes of chocolate with the wheat malt. Seems a bit to watery in the mouthfeel. Was OK. Would drink again but not in a hurry.","gosurfobx","Apr 17, 2006"

4.12,10.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is how I like my "smoked" beers. The smoke is not overpowering and really compliments the rest of the flavors. The smoke stays through almost the entire taste including the ending. The ending also has a slight bitterness that makes it a bit dry. The sweetness (chocolate, coffee and malt) is mostly in the beginning. Much more complex than I would have thought. Very easy drinking. Just a great, solid beer. I will look for the Weisbeir in this line as well.","CharlesRiver","Mar 02, 2006"
3.63,-2.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste; nice wheaty bread dough, with dark chocolate malts on the initial sips. It has a little lemon to it with cloves and just some hints of bananas as it gets warmer. There's a bit of a hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. Very drinkable.","RedHaze","Feb 25, 2006"
4.25,14.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Medium mouth with lots of carbonation. Not too much tingle, but enough to move things along nicely. Good beer! I like this almost as much as Aventinus.","ypsifly","Feb 04, 2006"

4.27,14.8,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Overall a great beer that I'm very delighted I found at the Cloverleaf in Metro Detroit. The leathery flavor is quite unique and a bit puzzling, but I think I like it more now that I'm close to finishing the .5 liter bottle. Definitely will buy more in the future.","malty","Nov 27, 2005"
4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pedro Ximenes solera brown -- dark -- with a hissing tower of foam. Lemon and herbal tea aromas pick up parched black coffee, toast and charred black bananas elements. Limber, bitter roast flavors have a juicy core and are battered with stormy waves of prickly gas. Crunchy green and red apple juice flavors (I believe these are considered "esters"). Dry, light bodied and lemony with roasty bitterness that persists. This is like Hefeweizen with a shot of espresso, only it seems to work ... in a Cuban summer patio sort of way ... with roast pig on a spit.","putnam","Nov 16, 2005"

4.23,13.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Beautiful to behold. Cloudy dark caramel under a 2.5 finger tan contoured head that settles to about half a pencil, then lasts and lasts. Great lacing most of the way down. The nose is crisp with spice, orange and yeast. The mouth is prickly and not too light. The taste is as it should be - nice spice, banana and clove, with just a hint of sweet caramel. All of this is followed by a mellow hop bitterness that lingers very nicely, blending with the spiciness to form a smooth mosaic of pleasure throughout the mouth. Nice.","Globetrotter","Apr 16, 2004"
