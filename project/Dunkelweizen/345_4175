4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy amber color with a white head and some lace. Aroma of wheat, caramelized malt, and a hint of leafy, flowery hop. In the taste, a big dose of caramelized flavor, moderate clove and hardly any bitterness. Medium bodied feel with a good thickness, surely not thin. Overall, Delicious. 5.2% abv dunkel with a firm, nutty malty flavor and a hint of hop and clove.","Stinkypuss","Sep 18, 2007"
