4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy amber color with a white head and some lace. Aroma of wheat, caramelized malt, and a hint of leafy, flowery hop. In the taste, a big dose of caramelized flavor, moderate clove and hardly any bitterness. Medium bodied feel with a good thickness, surely not thin. Overall, Delicious. 5.2% abv dunkel with a firm, nutty malty flavor and a hint of hop and clove.","Stinkypuss","Jan 29, 2012"

3.78,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub awhile ago. Poured a dark chestnut with a head that faded pretty quickly but left some nice lacing. There were lightt smells of brown bread, banana, and a touch of tin. The taste is spicy and slightly roasty to begin followed by more brown bread and bananas. Slightly thin, but very crisp and even crackery. Extremely dry, I would have like this to have been a tad more luscious. It was good, but it didn't wow me. The depth of flavor was a little light and it was a trifle thin.","Georgiabeer","Aug 16, 2007"
4.1,8.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"For those times when grain is what you crave, Victory brings you this fine offering. The malt is sweet, the wheat is crisp, and the result is a pint of fetching flavor and refreshing notes. And with that judicious ABV, drinking it is a fun little past-time. In fact, in an evening of more than a few new flavors, this one was 1b, not a bad standing. I would be most encouraged if this one made its way into bottles, because having the option of enjoying it at home would make it even better.","Foxman","Aug 14, 2007"

3.9,3.4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Creamy bannana sweet and spicey and hoppy, on tap at the Standard Tap and I thought this would be something available later in the summer. brown colour. Spot of toastiness, nuttiness, long finish. SOmething different from Victory, in fact I find their beers are all unique.","Sammy","Sep 08, 2004"

4.35,15.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Draught @ Victory: This beer is a cloudy coppery color. There was no head to it at all. The aroma has notes of banana, cloves and some other fruits. The taste is somewhat malty sweet with hints of the banana, cloves again. Also some nuttiness and a bit yeasty. Very Good!","Boto","Jul 07, 2002"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice brownish color with a head that quickly dissipated. The taste is very similar to their weizenbock. Similar malt base. Instead of bananas and cloves this seemed to just have cloves in the background. Good drinkability to go along with the taste. Will hit the spot if you want a nice, malty beer.","GeoffFromSJ","Beers"
