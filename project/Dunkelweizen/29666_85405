3.75,-5.8,,,,,,"Pours a really dark brown with almost no red tone to it, and looks like there's some cloud to it due to this but held to the light it's clarified. Not much head to speak of, and I'm having this in a tallish sort of goblet that I like for lagers, saisons, and Belgian IPA's. Not the "prettiest" beer I've ever beheld, but the aroma is nice, bready and malty, and the flavor follows suit with a nice tang to it. Very sweet and a little chocolaty, with very, very light alcohol. Super drinkable, nice and clean, good carbonation. I would definitely drink this again, but don't think I'd buy another sixer - probably opt for some Leffe Brun or an Oktoberfest with a little more abv. Still, I think they did really well with this one, and I'll surely have to try one on draught next time I'm at Prost.","BeerWizard","Apr 10, 2014"
