4.3,14.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I've found this a nicely drinkable beer and am happy to have a second. Each sip follows the other naturally and the flavors are never so strong they overwhelm. Rather "subtlety" is a key word to describe this beer. I'll definitely enjoy having this beer again and I think it is a very nice example of an undervalued style. This beer also illustrates for me yet again how valuable it can be to have two or three bottles before reviewing. This is definitely a beer that grows on one and I did not fully appreciate its subtle complexity until about the 2nd or 3rd bottle.","drtth","Aug 22, 2010"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Drought from High Point. Pours deep mahogany with a medium tanned head and lovely carbonation. Great aroma of yeast, banana, chocolate and cloves. Medium, smooth body. Flavor of banana, cloves and chocolate. Medium, fruity-coffee finish. Very tasty brew.","mikeg67","Jul 31, 2010"
3.15,-16.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"This beer pours a very dark brown to light black with a massive head. It has an interesting aroma, dark, roasted grain, slightly smokey, a hint of coffee and a touch of yeast. The flavor is overwhelmingly tangy, almost sour with the dark roasted flavors left in the background to come through on the aftertaste. After reading other reviews, I wonder whether I got an off bottle, no one else had the massive sourness.","cpolking","Jul 22, 2010"
