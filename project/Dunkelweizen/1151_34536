4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Just like I like my women... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sienna topped by over a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, sweet toffee, clove, and light banana peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more clove, and hints of light black pepper, cinnamon, and vanilla bean coming in for some added complexity. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a sorta/kinda grainy feel, and a dry finish. Overall, a nice d-weizen, one that doesn't overdo it on the yeast character, but also maintains a nice level of spice and whatnot. Good times.","TMoney2591","May 14, 2012"
3.39,-15.7,3,4,3,3.5,3.5,"In the world of Dunkelweiss, yeast is king. I wasn't able to detect too much of the German hefe yeast that I so desired. A bit muted but a tasty beer nonetheless. The dark malts were not too pronounced, almost true to a German Warsteiner in that both are black without tasting very black at all. I was looking for a little more yeasty, dark malt, wheatiness from this beer. An appoachable beer for the style.","TSJ4000","Apr 28, 2012"

4.35,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From tap at the brewpub poured into a traditional weizen glass. Pours a cloudy light brown with a quickly disappearing head with some lace. Smells of yeast, citrus and malt. Taste is similar to the aroma but a little more wheat/yeast spice than what was found in the nose. Very fresh tasting and slightly effervescent with full body mouth feel. Too drinkable, very refreshing. I can see why this is an award winning beer.","JoshJayne","0"
4.03,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Medium bodied. The wheat and yeast give it a creamy fullness. A very refreshing dunkelweizen.","NeutroMan","Jan 10, 2010"
4.14,3,4.5,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"mouth feel is smooth with slightly above medium body. despite the good body to this beer it doesn't seem to take up much stomach space. i ate alot while drinking probably about 24 oz. the taste is delicious but possibly easy to over power with food. for piece, this is a win. and for the style, I'm going to have to try more of these but i think i'm a fan.","dnjmed","Feb 21, 2009"
4.11,2.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Additional Notes: Picked up a growler to-go and it almost tastes as good from a growler as it does on-tap. Good carbonation and a crisp feel.","DoppleJock","Feb 21, 2009"

3.98,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"served in a weizen glass, this was a deep ruby brown with an off-white head. lacing was ridiculously thick and clingy. smell was of dark roasted malts hiding some floral notes. this had just a hint of sweetness up front and finshed crisp and clean. hop presence is more significant than typical for the style but not overbearing. the roastiness of the malts was pronounced. mouthfeel was light/medium. a very sessionable brew.","MrMcGibblets","Beers"
