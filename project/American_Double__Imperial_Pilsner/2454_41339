The mouthfeel is where this beer excels, and it where it wanes is its lack of hop character. Definitely a nice sipper, a little sweet for my current palate, but the lingering honey, orange, and cream soda notes are well executed. I've never tried the original -OBP, so I can't compare it.","StevenMilligan","Dec 13, 2014"

Interesting aroma, hints of chemical and natural complexity, I really can't tell which. The flavor is golden when it comes to malt, with nothing else to balance and the honey just about crowns it. I just can't get past the fact that this is a pilsner and it 180s nearly everything I has hopes for when I cracked it.","rawfish","Apr 15, 2014"

4,19.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall- It's not bold for an 11% brew, and I'd certainly recommend having this as the first beer of the night, as the light toasty-honey-nougat flavor would be easy to lose and otherwise it's fairly plain. I'd have a second if I'd bought more than the one bottle... and stop there, this could be dangerous. I'm not sure how the brewers pulled this one off, but bravo- this could have easily been a sticky, sweet, boozy mess and it comes off as a pleasant well-balanced sipper. Even without any other double-honey 10%+ lagers to compare this to, I feel pretty strongly that this one would be significantly better than average.","Lawl3ss","Sep 03, 2012"
2.88,-13.8,2.5,2,3.5,3.5,2.5,"O - I received this beer as an extra in a trade and wasn't sure what to expect from this "Pilsner." It is brewed with honey, so I knew it would be sweet. The smell was nauseating, but the flavor was acceptable. Good fruit flavors and no sign of the 11% alcohol. I am glad it wasn't a bomber, because I was growing tired of it by the end of the 12 oz. pour. To be fair, it wasn't the worst beer I have tried and I always appreciate unique and experimental brews. I don't endorse this beer fully, but if you tend to like beers with some wine or cider characteristics, give it a try.","NoLeafClover44","Aug 21, 2012"

The beer is amber-orange, and has a very small wisp of white suds atop. The nose is slightly sweet with a good amount of grainy and spicy notes. The flavor is fairly boozy, though it is not unexpected given the ABV, and is lightly toasty and caramelized. It is not great but it is not bad at all.

Some citric hops and husky grain flounder in a sea of marshmellow fluff and orange hard candy. I realize the honey the feature ingredient here, but this is overkill. At home it would have been a drainpour; at the bar, I left 2/3 of it untouched.

Not a whole lot going on besides that. The alcohol is hidden in a creepy way because it's so light tasting. The body is a little syrupy and the carbonation low, which gives away the alcohol more than the taste. It's what I would call "a bang for your buck beer".

There's also a very faint orange, but really that's about the only scents that can be detected. You have to really sift through the honey to get to the other flavors. Sweet orange with hints of clove and caramel malts. You do get a sense of the alcohol towards the finish. But honey is what you are ultimately left with. Has a sticky somewhat syrupy feel. I didn't care for this after the first couple drinks, but it did grow on me. A little too sweet to drink very often, but it was a nice change of pace.","alkemy","Sep 06, 2009"

The yeast, a defining quality of many Belgian beers, would be totally different but one key similarity they share the addition of a non-malt sugar source for the yeast to feed on.

Great mouthfeel, too, with a crisp & bubbly medium body that borders on thick, but never becomes too syrupy or viscous. All in all, a pleasant surprise from a (quite honestly) mediocre brewery.

3.2,-4.2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with an off-white head that possesses pretty decent lacing qualities. The aroma is very sweet with a lot of honey and just a touch of malt and alcohol with not much in the way of hops to note. The taste is very sweet and cloying with a lot of honey flavors. Overall, there is just too much sweet honey flavors, but I guess that was the point of this beer. Just not really my thing, a little too sweet for my taste. Overall, OBP 2 is not a bad beer, but not something I would purchase again.","cjgator3","Apr 06, 2008"
4,19.8,4,4,4,4,4,"OBP 2 pours a hazy orange with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a strong, sweet, honey aroma. It does smell like a much more intense version of the original. Sweet and very honey like, a much improved execution over the original, which seemed very light, almost macro like. This has body and full flavor, but if you don't like sweet, this might not be your beer. Pretty good.","Drew966","Mar 03, 2008"
3.65,9.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3,"Poured into a pint glass. Dark straw yellow, almost orange color. Not much head, and even less lacing. Strong honey smell and flavor. Smooth mouthfeel. Better than the original OBP. As far as a pilsner go, this isn't. To me, it's more of a braggot. As far as a braggot, it's good. The original OBP is more of a step-up beer for those who want something better than a light macro, but this beer seems to appeal to the beer geek, though, I don't know too many beer geeks that seek an imperial pilsner. All in all, I'm glad I tried the beer, and since braggots and meads are difficult to find in central FL, I'll probably buy some more when I'm in the mood for that style.","homer321","Beers"
3.05,-8.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Poured into a snifter. OBP^2 pours a slightly hazy straw yellow with a hint of orange in the color. Nice white head that has a low retention, that leaves the nice halo effect, that eventually leads to decent lacing. Strong Orange Blossom honey aroma with some citrus hints, some biscuity and yeasty aromas as well. Strong honey flavor off the bat, that leads into some citrus flavors. I almost tastes like a watered down mead. Smooth mouthfeel, teases the palate, and has a high carbonation level at first, but mellows out over time. Definitely better than other, lighter version, but it just seems to be the same beer with less water and more honey. At 11 percent, this just makes me ask, why?","paulthebeerguru","0"
