4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 4/26/2012. Pours fairly clear bright golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with nice retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent soapy lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, citrus peel, herbal, grass, earth, bread, pepper, apricot, and yeast spiciness. Nice, well balanced, and pleasant aromas; with nice hoppiness and decent strength. Taste of big lemon, bread, pepper, orange peel, grapefruit, grass, earth, and herbal spiciness. Decent sized herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, citrus, bread, pepper, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors, with just the right amount of hop bitterness to balance it out. Flavors definitely showcase the hops more than aromas(which are more of a standard pilsener aroma). Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming present on the finish. Very easy to drink for being over 7%. Overall this is a damn nice and well made imperial pilsener. Nice hoppy flavors with great malt balance; and dangerously easy to drink. Really enjoyable stuff.","superspak","May 31, 2012"

It's a lot more bitter than I anticipated. It also dries out my palate. It's a solid beer, but like most pilsners, there's little variance from the norm.

Spring is a perfect time of year for this beer. After a season of drinking dark heavies, this is very welcome. I wonder if this is the base beer for the Spruce Pilsner?","33nickadams","May 10, 2011"
3.85,1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I wasn't expecting much and this exceeded what I had hoped for. No problem downing these on a hot day while playing 18 holes. Given the abv I may end up face down by the 9th but hell I'd give it a go.","TheDudeRules","May 09, 2011"
4.38,15,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Untill now I have yet to drink a shorts and go "wow"! The pour is a light golden with a crisp white head. Aroma is bready and yeasty with a hint of floral hop. as I ake the first sip I am a bit taken aback by the amount of hop that hits my tounge. This is a bitter beer! Lots of citrus, sweet grapefruit rind flavor. This is almost balenced out by the sweet malt and bready flavors, but not quite. Drinks easy, with plenty of small bubbles to keep me from chugging it. I would seek this out, given the opertunity.","baconsausage","May 02, 2011"
4.38,15,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Herbal, minty hop bitterness up front, along with some sweetish, soapy, soft cookie malt. Hop bitterness crescendos, with notes of resin, sea air, and mint. It's rather dank, and also rather delicious! Honey and melon settle in beneath, but the finish is dominated by the funky, stinky hops. Dry and very appetizing finish. Medium-full body with a soft, creamy feel. One of the best Imperial Pilsners around.","alexgash","Apr 30, 2011"
4.38,15,5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Overall this was a very good Imperial Pilsner, the best I have had so far. This beer was basically everything a good Pilsner should be, but double that. The look and drinkability of this beer was fantastic, this is something I could enjoy during the summer while playing some disc golf. All in all this was a crisp, clean, easy drinking beer that I enjoyed a lot and it gave me a new appreciation for this style, I wish there were more Imperial Pilsners on the market. If you like the drinkability of pilsners and the flavor of pale ales then give this beer a try, it has a great combination of flavor and drinkability.","StoutHunter","Apr 25, 2011"

3.4,-10.8,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Overall- Just not one of my styles. I enjoy it more as I drink it, I think the hops are taking over. But, my palate is hyper-sensitive to Pilsner malts and or Lagers in general.","GrandCruDrew","Apr 17, 2011"

4.25,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"O- i was a little leery of this one because of my lack of experience with the style and my overall opinion of the brewery. despite these factors I was surprisingly impressed by this beer. this beer takes the style that most beer drinkers started with and makes it something they can now be proud of. nice work shorts.","jables7","Feb 05, 2011"
4.23,11,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. This is a clear pale golden color, fizzy with around half an inch of head. Smell is soapy with lots of cereals and light hoppiness. Taste is dominated by a crisp hoppiness, but it is balanced well enough to not be overly bitter. Light white grape flavors are present as well. Delicious with excellent drinkability.","webmanspidey","Jun 18, 2010"

3.35,-12.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"On tap at MI brewers guild fest. Cloudy orange/yellow pour with thin bleached white head. Lots of citric rind in the nose with some hops, and just a little bit of candy to follow. FLavours are massive grapefruit and citrus witha good hops bitterness. Dry, lingering bitter finish. Good! I liked this brweies tent!","mrmanning","Feb 17, 2009"

3.93,3.1,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Drinkability- Overall this is a pretty tasty brew. Hate to sound like a broken record but I wish that bit of over carbonation wasn't there. It doesn't affect the mouthfeel as much as the taste but overall I guess it's not that bad. It gets better as the bottle empties. Really wish I could try this fresh but I did enjoy tremendously. Big thanks again to Jon!","younger35","Mar 15, 2008"
3.93,3.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"One of the better imperial pilsners I have had, cannot believe that it has not changed much since it was fresh, still nice and hoppy like it was brewed yesterday, real dry for its age which was not a bad thing, even smells really fresh still, would drink again but probably not for eighteen dollars a bottle, recommended, it is bottle conditioned and you can definitely tell with how well this tastes at this point in time","Floydster","Jan 27, 2008"

4.32,13.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On with the review. Nice pilsen malt leads a full mouthfeel and dry mid palate that is encoutered with the dry hoppiness of the amarillos that leave a good minute finish for you too digest. Hints of apricot, peach and lemon fill out this complex pilsner. Probably the best Pils I've tried to date. Only wish it were more available.","mcallister","Aug 27, 2006"

3.85,1,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a deep gold with a smallish white head on the first pour, closer to the end the yeastiness mixes in and gives it a paler color and is nice and cloudy. There is a decent size grassy hop aroma along with some sweet sugariness and a sweet grainy aroma. There is also a nice pepperiness in the finish, at the start of the tasting, although this ended up mellowing towards the end. There is a little lemon and grapefruit that develop further in in both aroma and taste as it warms. A very nice balance between the pepperyness and dryness from the hops with the medium body. I may not pay 15.99 again for this, but it is definitely a tasty imp pils and I am glad to see some shorts stuff in bottles making its way south.","hoppymeal","Jun 08, 2006"
4.08,7.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This is the perfect hot/humid but not sunny weather beer. Refreshing and flavorful at the same time. As far as Double Pilsners go I liked the Sam Adams better but this beat out the DFH offering. Pricy but it's worth it if your a true beer geek.","granger10","May 21, 2006"
3.87,1.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Md thick body with a dextrinous quality. Medium carbonation. I must say, the lacing on this beer was the most incredible I've ever seen (too bad the beer was so cloudy). This beer is reviewed to style, which the BA description says should be much more malty than I found the beer to actually be. Honestly, I found the beer to be too hoppy and dry...but just as I finished thinking about how dry my most recent sip was I was wishing for another sip.","mentor","Beers"
3.72,-2.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a light orange color with yellow highlights, slightly hazy. Half inch thick, bright white head forms, but fades quickly. Very little lacing is left behind. Very citrusy and lemony smell. Nice! Definitely can smell the hops, and malts seem to take a backseat to the hops. Somewhat floral with hints of spices. Kinda weak tasting, nothing really stands up and grabs you. Malt and hops are well balanced, with some citrusy, fruit flavors hanging in the back. A little hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a tad thin for me, slightly watery. Lots of carbonation, but its not felt in the mouth. I can hardly believe this 7.1%, very easy too drink. I must say that I like this more than Dogfish Head's Golden Shower. This seems almost like an APA to me. Anyway, it would really be hard for me to shell out another $15.99 for another bottle.","BigDaddyWil","0"
