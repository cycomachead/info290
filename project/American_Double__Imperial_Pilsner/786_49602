2.48,-31.1,3.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Nice random find at a local shop. Never saw it there before, but figured it'd be worth a shot. It pours a clear orange-amber topped by a short-lived finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises mandarin orange, caramel, and a touch of flowers. The taste holds notes of mandarin orange syrup, orange peel, caramel, hard water, and a stiff backbone of flowery booze. Man, does this kind of hurt going down... The body is a stolid medium (almost hefty-leaning), with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, this beer did not sit right with me. There was very little pils character: It came off more like some kind of amped-up imperial amber or something, just poorly done. Boo this.","TMoney2591","Jan 02, 2011"
2.82,-21.7,3,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"D-Its kind of a mess, I have trouble thinking of this as any relation to a Pilsner because I don't get any of the characteristic hops that I love in Pilsners. Instead I got very strong citrus flavors mixed with a bready muddled mess of grain. I feel like some direction with the hops could save this beer, the bottle says they use four varieties, keep it to Saaz and step up the quantity significantly.","larsenju","Dec 23, 2010"
2.97,-17.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Big bodied but really just too much alcohol to make for a nice mouthfeel. Some beers hide the alcohol well...this is not one of them. Not a very drinkable impy pils.","ZimZamZoom","Dec 12, 2010"
3.8,5.6,4,4,4,4,3,"Not bad, my first experience with this style. The hoppy finish was a nice surprise that kept this one clean & crisp.","Rmason104","Nov 02, 2010"
3.6,0,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"D-Pretty easy drinking... I was expecting more of a German hop punch in the face with some corn and graininess in the background. An interesting beer and a style that I'd like to try again.","samie85","Oct 29, 2010"
3.73,3.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Dark honey gold in color and slightly cloudy. Aroma of fresh grain and grass with a hint of sweetness. It is sweet and bitter at the same time with a heavy undertone of malted grain and a bracing pilsner hop finish. Not as sweet and alcohol laden in flavor as many imperials.","cpolking","Oct 13, 2010"
3.92,8.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a deep golden honey boardering on orange color. Smells of corn, malt, grass, pear, and citrus with a noticable alcohol presance. The taste is a pretty straight forward clean bitter lager flavor at first. As it warms and I get more of it in me, I pick up a lot more complex bitter fruity hop flavors and a boozy aftertaste. This one will sneak up on you. Very easy drinking for a beer going on 9%. This is a very interesting style. It's a ratcheted up pilsner much like an IPA is a ratcheted up pale ale. I like it.","lester619","Sep 15, 2010"
3.85,6.9,3,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Smooth, nice body to this beer. It is quite pleasent to swollow and for 8.5 ABV! nice! It is quite drinkable for the style. I like it :)","EwaldEichstaett","Aug 15, 2010"
3.5,-2.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - This is an okay imperial pilsener. A little boozy and lacking balance.","zeff80","May 28, 2010"
3.56,-1.1,4,3,3.5,4,4,"The medium to thick body was creamy and smooth. The carbonation was crisp at most, which help bring out the viscosity. Very easy to drink given the strength of the alcohol and the thick body, a little more from the tasting senses would have helped round it out properly.","climax","Apr 23, 2010"
3.99,10.8,3,4,4,4.5,4,"The flavor mimics the aroma nicely, although a hint of soapiness creeps in among the dusty pilsner malt and bitter, grassy German hop notes. Hops linger in the finish alongside a bit of spicy, medicinal booze. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly, and has a nice weight for the ABV without becoming overly taxing or syrupy on the palate. In sum: a solidly built Imperial Pilsner, and one I'd quickly reach for again.","wagenvolks","Beers"
4.45,23.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall a very well balanced beer, not very complex, but an easy drinker that is worth seeking out. One I'd like to try on tap.","al3","0"
3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer drinks nicely. As noted previously it's a big old American-style lager that is hopped up with some significance.","garymuchow","Feb 18, 2010"
3.9,8.3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D: this one sure beats the Whole Hog 6-ipa...overall a well constructed brew and a good representation of a pils","homebrew311","Feb 01, 2010"
3,-16.7,3,3,3,3,3,"D -- I can't see sitting and drinking several, but very nicely done in the style. Unassuming yet bold, worth the $ (I paid $3.49 / 4 pk), but not amazing.","CPeterson","Jan 24, 2010"
3.62,0.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D - This pilsner falls darn close to a sessionable brew. The medium body and "imperial" boost in flavor knock the drinkability down slightly, but not by a whole lot.","BeerFMAndy","Jan 18, 2010"
3.43,-4.7,4.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Four pack for $8 ain't a bad deal, too bad the brews just don't make a better showing.","Vancer","Dec 30, 2009"
3.92,8.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I first tried Whole Hog Imperial Pilsner at the brewery, and shortly after its initial release. It was a real eye-opener at the time! The bottled version (and this sample in particular) has held up quite nicely considering the time it has spent in the bottle. This is especially poignant considering the fact (or my opinion, rather) that the Six Hop IPA did not hold up as well. Of course, we all know that the hop profile of Imperial or Double IPAs diminishes with the consequence being that the overall flavor profile diminishes, too, but these were interesting beers from a heritage brewery, and make me wonder whether you can't teach an old dog new tricks!","Chaz","Dec 23, 2009"
3.68,2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice beer. By far not the best imperial pilsner I've had (thinking of Golden Revolution) but nice for an old brewery like Point. I can see having several of these although deep down you can tell it's another WI lager.","dstc","Dec 21, 2009"
3.03,-15.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours reddish-orange with a flurry of bubble activity that results in a diminutive off-white head which fades quickly leaving little to no lace behind. Smells malty and grassy with a little fruitiness in the very back. The palate is nearly overwhelmed by a huge spicy alcohol heat, but a few notes of malt and citrus emerge just before a nice little hop bite shows itself. After a while some sour notes emerge as well. Goes down crisp with more alcohol brutality on the throat, and felt immediately in the stomach. Don't get me wrong. I like to taste the alcohol a bit in my big beers, but this one really doesn't have much going on in the balance department. That being said, as it warms up, and I get used to it, it doesn't seem as harsh. The Imperial Pilsner, as a style, doesn't seem to be doing it for me, and this one doesn't help the cause.","stephens101","Dec 21, 2009"
4,11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"D -- At 8.5%, the drinkability of this beer isn't bad, though I think the hotness of the alcohol could become hard to get past after a couple. Otherwise, a mighty fine precision lager.","steveh","Dec 13, 2009"
3.47,-3.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very clear, clean, medium brass body. Small, short-lived, cottony white head. Fruity malt on the nose, with spearmint, pine, floral, and resinous hop notes. A little alcohol burn as well. Honey and toasted malt up front. Becomes fruitier and sweet, with notes of hay and cooked vegetables. Solid hop bitterness comes in midway through. Herbal, floral, and mildly citrus. Honey sweet finish with lingering herbal hops. Medium body with a slightly slick, oily feel. Not bad, but not the best imperial pilsner I've had.","alexgash","Dec 10, 2009"

3.43,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"There aren't a lot of imperial pilsners around, and every one I've had has been different from the rest. This one was interesting, but maybe a little old as I don't get the flavors other reviewers note. Let the experimentation continue!","Mdog","Nov 11, 2009"

1.8,-50,3,3,1,3,1,"D. This is one of the first beers I have ever had to pour out. It was miserable from start to finish. For some reason I couldn't stop belching while I was drinking this. It was like I ate a bowl of potpourri. I will say that the name was appealing but I could not handle the "Whole Hog" half of it was dumped onto the campfire. It was sad day.","Jae27","Aug 15, 2009"

4.88,35.6,5,4.5,5,5,5,"I should start by saying German Style Pilsner is my favorite kind of beer. This beer reminded me of what I had in Germany. It didn't let me down where other American attempts have. No defects. Clean crisp maltiness with a strong hop assertiveness. What a real pilsner is all about. Thick creamy head. Hallertau hop aroma. Taste was cracker crispness with a sharp bite. Pleasantly surprised. Other brewers should take note in this beer. How did they do this?","gobeer","Jul 13, 2009"
3.14,-12.8,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a clear golden color with two inches of white head that had great retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Unfortunately the appearance is the best part of this beer. Very tame aroma. Immediately after the pour I thought I smelled cooked corn but it was just briefly. Then it is just faint hop herbal/floral aromas and some cereal grains. The flavor is not that big considering it is an imperial, until you get to the finish. Then it is bitter and boozy. Not my favorite combination. Extremely dry. The body is rather modest as well considerly the ABV and bitterness. But it does have nice carbonation. I think the brewer missed the mark. Need more from the hops besides bitterness and a bigger malt bill. Nothing unpalatable about this beer, it could be so much better.","morimech","Jul 12, 2009"
2.9,-19.4,3,3,3,2,3,"No head on aggressive pour, flat, clear yellow with some carbonation bubbles around the perimeter of the glass. Malts on the nose, ethanol. Flat tasting, oxidized, fully body though. Lacking any flavor really hurts its drink ability.","ballewblake","Jul 03, 2009"
2.9,-19.4,3,3,3,3,2.5,"D- Not too impressive, no more than a few for drinkability","Fartknocker","Jun 15, 2009"
4.2,16.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"As already said, this brew is exactly what an Imperial Pilsner should be. Floral and lightly malty, with a satisfying quality and crisp finish. All this is present, only the brew is very flavorful and carries an 8.5% APV tag. Very well crafted and pleasant to drink. It is a wonder that more of this style has not been seen. Cheers!","botham","Beers"
3.46,-3.9,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Wouldn't want any more than probably 2 of these due to the mouthfeel. Was expecting a bit more in the aroma and taste categories, but was still a good brew. Kudos to Point for trying something outside of their normal offering.","nsmartell","0"
3.58,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is drinkable far beyond it's listed strength, and has many things going for it. But- and maybe I'm over sensitive- the bubblegum esters on the nose and in the taste knock this one down a good deal. Subtract them, and you've got a nice, fat pils here....or at least a hoppy maibock.","cokes","May 04, 2009"
