There are no big no hop aromas on the nose to season the rich fresh baked bread aromas. Malty sweetness initiates the palate with a definite lemony citrus hop presence. Excellent lacing. It has medium to medium full body - not quite chewy – and has a smooth, creamy texture. Well balanced, drinkable and repeatable.","pat61","Feb 04, 2015"

3.68,2.2,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"now i have passed this thing over in stores for years, but finally i grabbed a single and i think it was a great buy. its only 7% abv, which makes it drinkable and light for any type of imperial, but its still quite hoppy and bitter, and the german type pils malts are huge in the flavor, while its still dry and clean drinking. very well mad obviously, and while its by far not my favorite breck beer, i have to appreciate that a beer this simple is so good. its gorgeous in the glass with a big tall white head and a hoppy nose. vegetal there and fresh and green. its new and excited, and i like the virgin nature it hits the palate with. carbonation is at war with the flavors though, its almost too bubbly, and this is the only style it could ever work with, but work it does, and i appreciate a blue collar mouthfeel as much as anything else. its still a pilsener though, and i will never get off on one, but i like it for what it is and i am sorry i waited so long to indulge. its well worth the few bucks i paid for the single, and i may even drink this one again some day. breck has come a long way lately i think, and maybe i have been behind the times on some of the beers, but this is very good.","StonedTrippin","Dec 10, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, pepper, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, pear, pine, cracker, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, pear, pine, cracker, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial pils. All around well balanced hop, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

Its nose is respectable too, with notes of lemon and grassy aroma, and a touch of biscuit. Then I was in for a little surprise with the nose...well, relative to what I was anticipating. Not knowing what the ABV was, it tasted like a good pilsner without a kick of alcohol. Biscuity and lemongrass flavors, and some notes of simple crisp hops make this pilsner worth a go. And that's before we had in a body which is a lighter medium with agreeable carbonation and one that's easy to drink despite the alcohol. I don't normally understand the concept of taking pilsners to a higher alcohol, but I think Breckenridge has done well here.","DoubleJ","Oct 16, 2012"

Moderately floral, though not necessarily "bright" (to me, the floral character from, say, Centennials are bright, while the Americanized old world hops are more pungent and snappy), the hops are quite enjoyable. The mid-palate has a moderate malt sweetness, with some honey and graham crackers. The sweetness increases as this beer warms up, making it less pleasant. Mildly metallic and mineral-like on the finish, the combination of pungent hop resins, grainy malt sweetness and the mineral character isn't entirely pleasant. An occasional wisp of alcohol is also noticeable. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is decent. I doubt I'll go out of my way to drink it again, but if proffered a fresh pour, I will imbibe.","MsRif","Oct 29, 2011"

2.68,-25.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight pale malt, yeast, and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Pilsner. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, citrus hops, and slight pale malt. Overall, well blended, good appearance, and good mouth feel.","Schmittymack","Jul 28, 2011"

Couldn't really pick up anything on the nose. Taste? SWEET. That's the main description. Honey, some malt, SWEETNESS, no hop bitterness to finish. Left some kind of aftertaste I wasn't too fond of. I think I'll pass on this one if offered up to me; I definitely won't be purchasing it again. TOO sweet; no crispness that I like in a pilsner.","rye726","Jul 11, 2011"

Clear golden honey color with a thin, wispy layer of white head that leaves some streaky lacing before disappearing almost completely. Aroma is light, of pale malts, grains, and grass. Taste is similar: bready, light malt sweetness, grains, grass, a touch of citrus zest, with a decent balance of malts and hops. Smooth, light mouthfeel, and easily drinkable. It's not often I find a pils that I like.","John_M","May 18, 2011"

4.03,11.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pale golden body with a light off white head billowing nicely above the rim of my glass, with fine even lacing. Aromatics contain pale cereal malts where are the hops, well they are here but not like other imperial pils. A bit of citrus grassiness, but the malts shine out a bit brighter here in the hop profile. Flavor has mineral water harshness with a touch of cereal grains light citric hops, really coatas the palate with a nice rolling biscuit malt sweetness with minimal alcohol showing up on the palate. Just enough herbal/citric/hops to balance really one of the better offerings I've had from Breckenridge. Mouthfeel has a nice full on creamy/airy carbonation going down smooth with each sip leaving behind a faint hop bitterness with streaks of hop oils evident. Drinkability is solid, I was surprised at how well this bigger pils drank and the lack of extreme alcohol and hop bitterness compared to what I have come to expect with this style. I really liked the bottle on this one as well super creative well executed I hope this one makes it back in 2011. If you couldn't tell this review is from notes when it was last released.","WVbeergeek","Feb 14, 2011"

Some grass and hay too. Super smooth and creamy with a slightly viscous and chewy body. Malty up front with fresh sweet grains and a touch of honey. Fresh, juicy apples. Spicy hops, with floral, some mild grapefruit, resiny herbal hits, and grass. Mild astringency and a bone-dry finish. Overall, one of the more drinkable Double Pils available. Less about heat (alcohol), more about balance and flavor.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 11, 2011"

The taste has a the same bready malt, and a little bit of noble hops. It is still faint for a beer of its strength. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that is way too low for a pilsener.

Not a big fan of the way the apple comes out, and a little sweet (not necessarily in a nice sweet bready malt way that some of the great pilsners pull off).

The aroma is a touch catty as it warms, but otherwise there's an enticing fruity, floral mix under big woodsy spice. The flavor has a crisp and toasty malt background under big kick of those spicy hops and before a big (but not a huge) biting bitterness. It reminds me of a more reasonable version of the old Sam Adams Imperial Pils. Check it out if you're a fan of the style and big Euro hops.","tempest","Oct 13, 2010"

As it warmed up it was gone so I can't complain too much about the dog qualities. it had a fruity taste but also dirty and thick, not my cup of tea as far as a pilsner goes.
