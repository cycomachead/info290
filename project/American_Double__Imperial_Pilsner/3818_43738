2.99,-23.1,3.5,3.25,2.75,3.5,2.75,"About to return to the theatre, I decided to revisit the Krampus, see how it comes across these days.  It pours a clear sunset amber-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises melon, apricot, caramel, light sweet cereal grains, and a twinge of booze for good measure.  The taste holds notes of boozy grass, sweet cereal, light vinyl, and mild corn syrup.  The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, not terrible, but the booziness and slightly-fruity sweetness clash and create something akin to higher-end malt liquors.  Still not my cup o' tea, really.","TMoney2591","Mar 07, 2015"

First taste is very bitter hops and then a little sweetness. This beer may be out of date, as the flavors are weak and somewhat watered down. The bitterness is not that pleasant and lingers and lingers.......and lingers........Overall, the flavors are there, but they won't go together, kind of like oil and vinegar. Will; have to check date and if it is an old bottle, will revisit in the future...","hophugger","Mar 02, 2015"

3.84,-1.3,4.25,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a good example of a Imperial version of a Helles Lager, it had pretty much all the aspects that I would expect from a Helles Lager, but they were all much bigger, which was nice and it still kept a little bit of that good drinkability that the style is know for with some nicely hidden alcohol.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, just a little crisp, alcohol was well hidden, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, but the since the alcohol is well hidden I don't think I'll have a problem drinking a bomber to myself.  What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and they worked well with this beer and I also really liked how well the alcohol was hidden.  What I liked the least about this beer was that the taste wasn't as balanced as the aroma, I wish more of those malty aspects came through in the taste.  I would buy this beer again, but I will probably wait till it's released next year and I would recommend this to anyone who thinks a Imperial Helles Lager sounds interesting.  All in all I was happy with this beer, I wasn't wowed with it, but it does good job of keeping most of the aspects that Helles Lager has and just making it bigger and bolder.  It isn't my favorite Southern Tier beer, but it is one of the better of the style that I've had and I'm lumping ti together with Imperial Pilseners because that's what BA has it as and I find it to be very  similar to that style. Nice job guys this was a tasty, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Nov 10, 2014"

The taste is a perfect mix for Xmas, piney hops. Flowery hops as well. A bit earthy at times with some more floral notes towards the end. Light amount of malt flavor. Bitter pine finish. Slightly sour. Somewhat boozey. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a hoppy, bitter Pilsner I always look forward to when Winter rolls around.","PicoPapa","Oct 31, 2014"

The aroma is a nice balance of caramel and lemony hops. The alcohol opens the senses. Surprisingly carbonated, almost prickly, on the palate. The malt notes (bread, biscuit, and dark fruit) are briskly swept away as the hops takes over. Resinous pine, grapefruit, old fashion bitterness and a wave of booze finish this off in a big dollop of hops. A nice brew that invites the drinker to have more. I don't know if I would call this a Helles, but it is good.","BeardedBoffin","Mar 23, 2013"

Smell is grapefruit, hard candy, tangerine, and plum. Taste is very similar to the noise lots grapefruit and hard candy, not complaining. Body is medium, plenty of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. Wasn't sure what to expect from this because of the style.

I don't mind that at all. I also like that it isn't some spiced up charred coffee table in a bottle. Kudos. Though I wouldn't mind if this beer was not an imperial..

4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled on 9/19/2012. Pours lightly hazy copper amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass; with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, pine, citrus rind, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, and piney spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, pine, toffee, biscuit, citrus rind, floral, grass, nuttiness, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, pine, nuttiness, floral, citrus rind, and piney spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great malt/hop flavor balance and complexity; with a solid sweetness/bitterness balance as well; minimal cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish; this is dangerously drinkable. Overall this is a highly excellent Imperial Helles style! Great malt and hop flavor balance and robustness; very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 01, 2013"

3.98,2.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber. One finger head and nice lacing. An attractive pour. Aroma of strong hops and citrus. Nice rich malts and hops combination, citrus and pine. Start and middle are phenomenal, but somewhat dry and astringent in the hop finish. Points off for the astringency. This a refrigerated one year old bottle, but still tastes good. Will update after drinking a fresher one.","LiquidAmber","Aug 01, 2012"

Poured into a half-liter pokal, it's a gorgeous amber color with a big ole ecru colored head that sticks all over the place. Big hop smell, fantastic caramel/honey, alcohol esters invite you into a nice warming brew that's not so boozy, but it let's you know it's a strong one. Not what I expected with 'helles' on the label, but certainly satisfying.","wcintula","Jun 06, 2012"

The beer as a whole feels unbalanced because of this, and the lemony hops combine with the floury baguette flavors to give the beer a lemon-lime soda undertone that seemed strange. The brew isn't bad, of course, and hopheads will find it lovely, but I thought a few more sugars and a better caramel-vanilla base would have helped.","jondeelee","Jan 22, 2012"

Striking appearance with definite bonus points for the bottle label and story about "Krampus", Santa's evil side kick. Smell is thoroughly malty with hints of dry tea leaves, earth, and citric hop. Big malt on first sip although some crispness shows through. On further swallows the big caramelly malt flavor remains prominent but more noticeable is an orange-citric element, slightly astringent bitterness, and mellow yeast. Not noticed is the 9.0% ABV...at the moment. The body is medium and well crafted. Overall, this is a pretty darn good double pilsner-style beer.","JackieTH","Dec 28, 2011"

No visible carbonation rising through the beer, head has very respectable retention considering the ABV of this beer, which would generally be a quick head killer. As I drink there is some fuzzy lacing left in my glass. Smell has a nice sweetness to it, sort of a malt sweetness but I also get a bit of apple sweetness and a floral hop scent as well. If you search for it, you'll find the alcohol smell, but it isn't prevalent. The taste is strong, but not overly aggressive, the way I suppose an imperial Helles ought to be. The malts seem to carry the beer, they are sweet on the front of the tongue. The middle of the sip gives a slightly odd floral bitterness, definitely characteristic of the hops, but something just seems off to me. Maybe I have a bad bottle. The taste of the alcohol doesn't come up at all. Mouthfeel is thick-ish. The bottle says 20 Plato. I didn't detect any carbonation in this.

Has a great taste of hop bitterness, caramel, with a malty backbone. This beer is very carbonated and has a great thick mouthful. Overall a good beer. I haven't had much experience with the Helles Lager style, but after drinking this I'm a fan. This will be on my radar every holiday season.","brian44556","Apr 10, 2011"

Aroma was slightly malty, with some hops and a bit of pepper. Taste was spicy, started off as bitter hop but mellowed and then changed to a pepper spicy ending. Felt ok in the mouth, perhaps a tad over carbonated. Wasn't overly thin or thick. A solid beer, well balanced.","mountdew1","Mar 21, 2011"

Pours darker amber with a fair head that leaves some lacing and is fed by a constant small stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Smells bready without being grainy, and fruity and herbal. Lots of citrus juice, some mango and guava, and herbal with dill and epazote. Some tanginess there as well, a faint yogurt trace. The taste is similar, with less breadiness and more herbal and fruity bitterness with the same faint yogurt tanginess that mingles nicely with the citrus and bitterness on the end. I get pine in the bitter notes here as well- fairly heavily at that, along with that unmistakeable tangy skunkiness of summit hops. Very nice!","Georgiabeer","Jan 13, 2011"

This year in the bottle it seems alot more palatable to me than straight onion/garlic. Imperial helles lager my ass, this is as pale/ipa/double pils as it comes flavorwise. Lager yeast maybe, lagering time yeah, but flavor wise blind folded it tastes like a hopped up ale. First of helles means light this is a copper amber colored beer. Crystal clear filtering, fine light off white head forms thick with speckled even lacing. Aroma really nails an imperial IPA nose with big layers of hops pine, citrus, hints of onion/vegetable greeness even spicy herbal qualities. Big malt layers are eclipsed in the nose, a touch of alcohol tickles your nares to let know to be ware. Flavor hits with an aggressive spicy oregano/greeness herbal/citrus/pine explosion almost feels like heat from a pepper in the back of your throat. Malts are caramelized enough to provided sugar coating amongst the hops but don't necessarily make the experience any sweeter. I could pair this with some Thai or Indian food because of the vegetal greeness/spiciness that the hops provide here. Mouthfeel can get a bit rough with residual sugars and hot alcohol, best advice is split it with a friend or someone who has been naughty this year. Drinkability is decent not a regular that I would pursue but seasonally once a year I could tolerate this. Truely unique and somewhat of a clusterfuck but at the end of the day I would say I actually enjoyed drinking it.","WVbeergeek","Jan 03, 2011"

The beer has some warming alcohol notes that play off nicely with the leafy bitterness, and the minty hop aromas. There is a definite sweetness to the beer from the caramels, and this is well balanced against the prodigious bittering hop flavors.

Unfortunately, though, I was a bit distracted by the slightly thin and watery mouth, which didn't seem to correspond with the flavor profile of the beer (bier?).

It's extreme, it's way different, and the way I describe this to my curious beer drinking friends who appreciate good beer is, "It's weird for the style but it WORKS". If you're a lover of IPA's you have to try this before it's gone for another year.

The pine reminds me of the holidays. Mouthfeel is tiny bit watery for the big taste and alcohol. There is a bit of warming but it is a good aspect. The carbonation is appropriate.

Like a tart savignon blanc, white grapes and a hint of light clovey bubblegum. Confusing. The taste is a unique blend of sweet clove and some double IPA type of maltiness with grapefruit hops. At first I recoil in confused infamiliarity. But this grows on you. After the initial white wine impressions I find that generous mouthfuls really help bring out the balance that smooths this odd brew into something pretty special. This seems like a combination of white wine and a mild DIPA. It brings some Belgian hints, so-so drinkability but not overly heavy, maybe what could be called a desert beer?

Medium-bodied and smooth but still contains a good, drying backbite as the hop bitterness really comes through in the end.

Light caramel, toast and slight roast mixed into one mono-toned flavor - I don't find it very pleasing. Some lemony bitterness comes into play at the end. Heavy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. This is not very drinkable in my opinion. It is heavy, the malt flavors are not crisp and defined, and I'm picking up on some sort of a weird off-aroma.

I have no Idea what other Helles Lager's taste like but this is very good, especially for a christmas beer.","dickieb","Dec 23, 2008"

Definitely some spicy hops, some raisin, or sort of a candied fruit. Basically, a not-too-sweet smell, something fruity but kind of heavy. It tastes pretty much like it tastes. Definitely a spicy hop taste. It definitely turns a little sour and bitter. Honestly, I couldn't quite figure out what it was. I think raisins is a good description. It feels fine in the mouth, but not a ton of carbonation. Overall, not a super-drinkable beer because it's sort of muddled. However, it is definitely unique, and I am glad I gave it a shot. That said, there are plenty of better Southern Tier options out there.","callmescraps","Dec 22, 2008"

Smells of spicy hops, dry grass, pine, mint, citrus, grapes, caramel, and bread. Tastes big of spicy hops right off the bat, which sticks throughout. Pine resin, mint, and light citrus notes come through up front along with some grapes and maybe some apple. Backbone consists of candy, caramel, and some bread crust with a finish of more hop bitterness combined with some alcohol. Medium full in body with moderate carbonation.

The aroma is a mix of sweet citrus hop and spicy Belgian like yeast. Quite interested what this is going to taste like. The taste has an overall sweetness with a kick of hoppy bitterness in the end. Krampus has a spicy yeast and hop profile that yields a tropical fruit and citrus flavor; it has a bready malt but nothing that would remind me of munich malt what so ever. The feel is nice and chewy with soft carbonation which leads to a silky feely; good balance between sweet and bitter. Ah, the new age old question, do you really need an imperial helles lager???? After this, I would say no. A helles lager is a fairly delicate style that can't handle the "imperial tag". IMHO a helles is like a Pils, in order to let the malt shine, which it is suppose to, you need to keep the abv in check. The sweet bready munich malt is no where to be found in this brew. While this brew is quite tasty, it does not resemble a munich helles lager.","Gmann","Dec 19, 2008"

The taste is similar to the aroma, but the malt comes out more in the taste than it does in the aroma (but the taste still has a good bit of hops in it). Some spicy hops, pepper and caramel are also noticable in the taste. Has a good sweet/bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and has decent carbonation.

The colour is a clean golden. Big, white head with good retention and moderate lace. Flavour is very hoppy, and tastes very much like it smells.

There's also a backnote of smokey, toasty malts that nicely round out the nose. On the palate, things are just really weird. There is a vague sourness mixing with bitterness of the hops and then a touch of roastiness from the malts. It is just an altogether different experience from any other beer.

4.12,5.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I picked up a 22oz bottle, poured into a snifter glass. Pours an amber/dark orange sort of color with thick head. Leaves lots of bubbly on the side of the glass. My initial reaction to the aroma was "WHOA!" Real sharp aroma, full of hops and pine. I smell a bit of citrus in there as well. Smooth mouthfeel without a lot of fizz. Mild stickiness. Smells sharper than it tastes. The taste is real hoppy at first, but settles down into sweet malt and bitterness. I can't really taste the alcohol, but I drink this having just run five miles and I definitely feel the alcohol. Overall, I like this a lot. This is the first beer of this style that I have ever tried, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. It's an enjoyable beer to drink though and I will be buying more.","mtbbaboon","Nov 14, 2008"
4.17,7.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: This is one weird fuckin' beer. Imperial ... Helles Lager ... that smells like Pliny the Elder ... minus the malt? Very strange, and very interesting. Recommended, highly, if only because it's absolutely strange.","CrellMoset","Nov 13, 2008"
4.03,3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"M + D: A little bit heavier, with a good chewiness. I almost feel like I can bite into this. A big sipper, and a fine option when in the mood for a big, hoppy brew. I'll be happy to revisit this one a couple times over this season.","Proteus93","Nov 11, 2008"
