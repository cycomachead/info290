3.38,-5.6,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours a clear orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that smells pretty good but the hop flavors are fairly subdued.","UCLABrewN84","0"

3.17,-11.5,4.5,3,3,3.25,3.25,"O- The beer looked great but I think it could have used a little more hop punch. I probably wouldn't buy this again unless I see it on tap again.","Muthacack","0"
