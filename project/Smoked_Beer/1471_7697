Smells of smoke amd roasted malts.  A very good balance between the smoke and the sweetish malt base.  Some lite coffee and  dark chocolate undertones.  Thick mouthfeel and a surprisingly light aftertaste.  A great Smoked Ale and a very good Stout.","SFNC","Mar 24, 2015"

The aroma features smoked malt, roasted coffee, bakers chocolate, and molasses. Overall, the nose is mild and the smoke, specifically, is subtle. Fore’s taste follows the nose with a slight roasted malt, molasses, and chocolate sweetness followed by coffee and char bitterness. The smoke comes faintly on the finish. Medium body, creamy texture, moderate carbonation, and a long bitter finish with some smoke.","SierraFlight","Feb 19, 2015"

I think that's a good thing.  A little sweetness, and a nice earthy flavor.  A little raisin and licorice flavor is in this brew.  An interesting and unique stout.  I enjoy it enough that I buy two or three 4-packs every time it comes in season.","MNJR","Feb 13, 2015"

It settled pretty quickly into two fingers of deep-tan/light-brown head, but what happened next was particularly remarkable. It seemed to collapse inwardly on itself and fell much more quickly than I expected, becoming mere wisps. Color was Opaque Black (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose was very smoky, but in more of a burnt charcoal way than the smokiness of a rauchbier. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was more like bittersweet chocolate mingled with a sweet smokiness. It kind of put me in mind of chocolate-covered bacon, which I have tried. I am a fan of smoked beers, but this was a bit sweeter than I like, especially since it seemed to be getting in the way of the smokiness. Finish had that same bittersweet smokiness that I had been getting throughout. I was really kind of underwhelmed, especially given the hype and scores assigned to this beer. Not bad, per se, but leaving a lot of room for improvement.","woodychandler","Aug 07, 2014"

I am happy to report that this beer, unlike some smoked beers, did not taste like someone put out their cigarette in it. It's more of an American Stout than a Smoked Beer. Sadly, I think the smoke robs the beer of some of its richness and malt character and makes it taste a little bland on my palate. Fans of smoked beers may still want to check this one out.","deadonhisfeet","Mar 29, 2014"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a black body with one finger brown head and minor lace patches all over glass. Not completely meaty like a german smokebeer but the aroma Is an intense smoked malt bomb with pretty much everything else subdued. Thick, fuller bodied and even chewy, bready, there are some bitter chocolate sweet notes and the balance is great b/c the smoked taste is not as strong as the aroma and doesn't kill the other taste sensations. A little bit of heat in finish that derives from both the smoke and alcohol and overall leads to a very enjoyable beer.","clayrock81","0"

Big time roast aroma, bittersweet chocolate, smoke char, and just a hint of sweet dark fruits. Flavor is super rich roasty bittersweet chocolate, subtle molasses and fruit sweetness, and finishing with a big blast of smoke on the palate. A combination of smoke and chocolate lingers for a long, while like smoked mesquite BBQ kind of wood. Big rich mouthfeel--impressive for the ABV--silky smooth with low to low-medium carbonation. Reminds me a lot of Plead the Fifth but with extra extra roast and some smoke. Smoke doesn't overpower which gives this a nice complexity among all the flavors present. This is really really good!","BMMillsy","Jan 12, 2014"

The liquid is unsurprisingly black and opaque, lightens up just enough near the surface to see active carbonation and a mild orange tint. The nose is not vastly smoky, more a solid toastiness and roasted nuts and cocoa powder, very chocolaty, no real fruit presence nor citrus, minor notes of mineral water, cereal grains and granola, not overblown but steady and longlasting. Full-bodied, the carbonation brings a light prickle but not much overall activity or freshness. Instead, you get a lot more roast although I’d still call it chocolate and cocoa than coffee related and it only gets smoky when close to room temperature. Grains, tar, black tea, iron flecks, not much going on which is overtly sweet. More earthy with campfire ember accents. Here there’s some apricot, cherry to lower plum fruit flavors. In its favor it is smooth without excessive creaminess, drinks well but not ingratiatingly so. Marked most by its unremarkableness, no flaws, not quite generic, just a beer. Sometimes that is enough.","farrago","Jul 22, 2013"

Definitely some roasted coffee, sugar, cream and hints of vanilla and cocoa there though. Not nearly as menacing as the name led me to assume. The beer tastes pretty mild as far as the smoke is concerned also. I don't get any of the acrid or astringent flavors sometimes found in heavily roasted smoked beers. Roasted barley and char (more than smoke) come out front then a bit of hop bitterness and semi-dark chocolate come out midway and last through the finish.","BeerZack","Apr 03, 2013"

Somewhat subdued smoky malt aromas combine nicely with softly sweet, chocolaty roast, and berries. Deliciously malty flavor...the smoke isn't really center stage, but rather supporting the rich, dark chocolate and cutting the sweetness with a bitter, espresso and campfire finish. Pleasant tobacco and dark fruity undertones. Medium bodied and fairly low on carbonation. I've enjoyed every single one of these Dark Horse stouts...well done!","wedge","Mar 17, 2013"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, late 2012 bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, toast, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity of dark roasted notes; the smoke is very complimenting and not overpowering. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, light smoked meat, light wood, toast, and roasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, light coffee, light smoke, toast, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and robustness of dark roasted flavors with smoke; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice smoked stout! Very robust and balanced with roasted flavors and smokiness; and extremely smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

The flavor gets more roasted with some dark sugar as it warms with smoke flavor and subtle raisin tinge in the finish.

In the glass the beer just looks flat though - limp, wet noodle, erectile dysfunction - no lacing anywhere! Aroma is beautiful, doting touches of sweet milk chocolate in the midst of roasted smoked wood. Caramel, toffee, and booze are also detectable and create a well rounded nose. Caramel & smoked wood hit up front with a strong combination of dark chocolates and alcohol heat in the back. Carbonation is about right here, but the body is too thin, in my opinion, and would match the smoked character better with some more "meat" to it.","hoptualBrew","Beers"

The taste generally follows suit, though the smoke comes off more hickory-style this time, drying things out a bit and distracting from the rest of the flavors. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel.

The aromatics are mostly roasted coffee and some peat and wood smoke. The flavor is a pretty damn good mixture of chocolate malt, roasted malt, oatmeal, and some smoked malts. The great thing about this beer is there is enough smoked malts that they are prominent in the flavor of the stout without going into a dominant role.

4.1,4.6,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This pours impenetrable black with a one finger, tight mocha head that leaves no lace. It almost looks like it's on nitro. On the nose there is a great combination of deeply bitter chocolate with some clean smoke. This isn't like the peat smoke I'm used to in scotch whisky, but more like a clean oak smoke or something else a bit less intense than decaying biomass. It's a really well-balanced nose. In the mouth there is bitter chocolate, full city roasted coffee, a little bit of anise, and all of that riding on a clean cloud of smoke. Again, the smoke isn't overbearing or especially pungent, just present and very pleasant. The body is medium but the finish is nice and long with the bitter chocolate lingering with the smoke. The only downside of this beer is that it's probably a little too distinctive to drink back to back to back, but that's hardly a knock. I like this beer a good deal, quite a bit more than I thought I would. The smoke is just another flavor in a well-constructed stout, rather than a bolted-on gimmicky flavor. After a few misses with me, Dark Horse has really come through with Fore and Plead the 5th.","EricCioe","Apr 11, 2011"
4.33,10.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Way more balanced in bottle than on the draft version I had last week, this dark pitch black Michigan stout forms with a 3 finger thicket of dark khaki tan head leaves thick chunky sporadic lacing. Aroma has dark chocolate, hints of fruity coffee, and underlying layers of smoked malts. Really not bad, one of the better of the four stouts, creamy dark chocolate flavor with hints of coffee and smoked stouts. Flavors in clude dark dry bitter chocolate with hints of roasted barley and smoked underlying malts not in your face but really cohesive and complimentary toward one another. Mouthfeel is big bodied stout with a creamy bodied and lingering smokey bitterness from the dark malts and smoked malt additions. Overall impression is that things just keep getting better when I try a new beer from Dark Horse I want to see more in Ohio and Pittsburgh.

What is there is akin to the smell of a match that someone lit 10 minutes ago: a bit woody; a tad sweet; kind of old. Too bad. Still, this isn't such a bad beer: roast, coffee, molasses, vanilla, etc., and a nice dry finish. Low ABV and a nice creamy head.

The aftertaste is dark fruits and chocolate, reminds me of dark chocolate covered raisins. The mouthfeel is a smooth and creamy feel that leaves a bit of sweetness and dryness in the mouth.

I know this beer is released in January but I think this may be from last year due to all of the sediment in the bottom of the bottle. This beer doesn't smell any different from the Dark Horse One Oatmeal stout. It has dark, rich roasted malts, slight smoke, some oak, and has a lactic acid like sweetness that fades to bitterness. The longer you sip the beer the more smoke you get in the nose. The taste is better than the Oatmeal in my opinion. It surprising starts out as bitter chocolate before finishing with moderate smoke. The more you drink it the sweeter the chocolate becomes. I like it. It doesn't have the lactic acid that the Oatmeal can have. It drinks pretty smoothly and still has good carbonation that tingles the palate. This is probably my favorite one of their stouts. It's also pretty drinkable considering it's probably around 8%, like the Oatmeal.","aasher","Jan 17, 2011"

Some char can be found with a froth on the palate. Good dark roated malt flavors mix in as well. I was expecting a more aggressive smoke flavor, but this is a very pleasing stout and I like the subtleness of the smoke.

The flavor is more of that smoke with roasty malts and bakers chocolate notes, with a little bite of charred bread off the end for balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and round, with a long mellow finish. Smoked ales are pretty tricky- that particular flavor is so aggressive it's easy to end up with a beer that tastes like a Slim Jim©.

The surface of this beer boils with the brown bubbles of carb that rise from the circular cut at the bottom of the glass which agitates and leaves a ring of brown lace all around the interior perimeter of the glass. Aroma of this beer is dark and roasty with scents of burnt grain akin to chocolate, coffee and a bit of smoke are all included. Taste is darkly roasted grain with flavors of dry bitter chocolates, coffee and smoked malt pulls up the tail end of the flavor that lingers through the semi-dry bitter finish. Medium feel with a modest amount of carbonation. For being the smoked version of their stout, it is equally roasty and smokey as the other offerings ive had from them and just barley enough of the smoked character to accent it and set it off as being different from the rest. There is a slight lingering musty flavor left in the mouth along with the smoke flavor that is a bit offputting. Other than that, overall it was decent.","stakem","May 07, 2010"

Dark roasted malt in the smell, combined with some dark chocolate, earth, and just a little bit of the smoke factor. The dark chocolate shines through in the taste, with some earth tones, and the smoke in the background, keeping things interesting. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, which was the last thing I was expecting from a smoked stout. It has the silky texture of a cask ale, but with just a bit of carbonation. Difficult to nail down the ABV on this one, although it does not taste boozy at all. I like the fact that the smoke is not overwhelming on this one.

The darkness is lovely, but it looks lifeless almost. The smell is good, burnt crusty bread, hardwood ashe, dark astringent coffee, dark, unsweetened chocolate all come to mind - it smells like a stout, cooked over an open wood flame, then allowed to cool down, but not quite as intense on the smoky note as I woul expect based on one, too, and tres in regards to their flavors. I think the smokiness here does a nice job enhancing the dark roastiness in all ways. And the very same goes for the taste. You come up with a heavy roast coffe, with bread dunked into it, and a tiny bit of the darkest, burntest crusty bits of a slab of heavily smoked meat. Then it kind of levels out with a nice chocolatey sweetness, and finishes really quite clean. I expected the undercooked weenie taste that is usual in other smoked beers, but if its here, it's a well overcooked, almost black weenie with some ashe on it. I'm really liking this smoked stout., though it may be hard to tell it apart from some other equally as good unsmoked stouts - I could be wrong though, I do start to get a lingering smoky taste as I continue drinking. The body is kind of medium, not as full as the others, nice though, but the carbonation comes on sharply, stinging a bit as I swallow. Overall, though, this is a great one. I mean, of the four (and for that matter about any american stout) this one has the best everyday drinkability. I could see myself reaching for quite a few of these, until the burnt wood caught up with me. That's thwe only real hindrance, but if you like it, if it brings back memories of making BBQ over a live fire, then you'll love it.","taylorhamrick","Aug 28, 2009"

Just not much room left after the coffee gets done. Mouthfeel is reasonably smooth, and drinkability is pretty good as well. Not quite what I was expecting, but still a good brew.","ppoitras","Apr 21, 2009"

The harsher roast notes (likely from black patent malt) make this a nice variation on the ubiquitous smoked porter, and all of the flavors seem to meld together nicely.

Aromas are definitely smoke reminiscent of a campfire, along with roasted malts, and a faint hint of mocha. Flavors are very roasty, nearing a burned malt overtone with the smoke evident, but not over the top. Also hints of espresso and dark chocolate are present. Mouth-feel is smooth and coats the palate well. The roastiness provides good balance to the ale. I think i enjoyed this one and the oatmeal the most out of the series....only problem is I haven't seen Plead the 5th anywhere, and it's probably not available anymore.

I didn't really get much rauchbier aroma, but the smoke might be subtle versus the onslaught of malt. Same in the taste, no real smoke that I could taste but lots of malty sweetness.

No clue what the abv is, but seems a little hot. Good dry stout base, and i actually like the harsh finish in small doses - though over the course of a bottle it gets a bit rough. Mouthfeel isn't terribly viscous, but coats nicely - though that keeps the aftertaste on the tongue for a long time.

Deeper there is a rich, musky earth spiced with whiskey splendor and hints of barbecue. Deep and complex. Flavor carries more of a dry stout character, but is nicely highlighted with grill char, sweet fish marinade, long drying coffee air, and some flatter ocean tastes. Carboniferous and yet higher with bits of brandy marinated fruit, nuts and nice general malt figures. Long smack in the middle of dry and sweet, but generally enjoyable.

Strands of watery lacing that produced several bands before eventually settling into some thin inconsistent webs. Scent of chocolate and malt. Taste similar to nose. Extremely rich with a subdued roasted coffee character in the background that nicely complemented the chocolate in the foreground. Smokiness was not detectable until the brew warmed and little, and only at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and surprisingly light given the consistency; partially due to a mild effervescence across the middle of the tongue. Alcohol was well hidden and only expressed itself as a subtle warming around the back of the tongue. This is my third Dark Horse brew, and I am really falling in love with this company.

Mild burnt wood flavors from start to finish. Dates and plum make a quick appearance on the tongue but are quickly over taken by more charred flavors.

Lots of caramel and bittersweet chocolate up front, smoke and burnt towards the end, but always accompanied by sweetness. Full bodied, average carbonation, slightly dry, decent texture. A solid stout with just enough smoke to keep it interesting, not enough to overpower. Nice balance.","DrJay","Feb 10, 2008"

4.42,12.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours thick oil black as the rich body settles into the glass. A hard pour only gets about a half inch of milk chocolate colored head that quickly fades to nothing. Nose is soft but consistes of smoked meat and toffee. Enters the mouth with a slight smokey soured feel but quickly mellows to a rich burnt malt mouth hue. Extremely smooth and drinkable. Notes of bakers chocolate develop on the back of the tongue as the beer warms. Almost develops a creamy sweetness on the mouthfeel. This beer is hugely drinkable and one I will buy again soon.","SPLITGRIN","Oct 24, 2007"

I don't really taste any smokiness - not sure about the style here. The mouthfeel is very creamy. Very drinkable especially for a stout. This is really nice beer, though. It's a little sweeter than most stouts, but still has enough strength to satisfy.","bassmantin","Sep 10, 2007"
4.15,5.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"From a growler: Pours a flat black color with a medium thick and foamy brown head. Sticky patches of lacing. Strong and smoky roasted malt and coffee aroma. The body is rich and smooth and the smoky character is consistent but not overbearing. Roasted malt, dark chocolate and coffee flavors mesh very well. The finish is dry and smoky with a fair amount of hops peeking through. Not really anything to complain about with this one.","Dogbrick","Aug 27, 2007"
3.92,0,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle. This beer is a very deep brown to black color with a very small deep tan head that falls quickly to a ring around the top. This one is still, with no light working though it. The aroma is ashy roast with a maple syrupy sweetness that comes from the mild smokeyness that sits prevalent in the brew. The flavor is a little more mild than expected. It starts with the ashy roast that moves to a mild chocolate. A peppery spice comes next and blends with a mild pine hop and gives a hint of coffee on the finish. The smoke is really mild in the flavor, and I would have liked it to be a bit more forceful. Mouthfeel is moderate with no detectable carbonation. This is a nice stout. The peppery character is a little strange, but it is something I have noticed in a number of the stouts in the series.","kmpitz2","Jun 10, 2007"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark and inky pour with a small tan head that leaves some patchy lacing. Aroma of chocolate, figs, anise, and a hint of smoke. Smooth and full bodied with an appropriate low carbonation. Taste is pleasantly complex. Dark roasty notes are prominent, with chocolate and coffee. Nuttiness and some fruity berry add a nice dimension and the subtle smokiness is just right. Very nice.","merlin48","Jun 09, 2007"
3.84,-2,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours out jet black, like the others. Very little head, and no retention. Kind of a disappointment here. What's there is nearly brown. The aroma is smoky (maybe by the power of suggestion). Dark chocolate, too. Overall, nice. The flavor is meaty and, well, a little smoky. Faint hints of cranberry and coffee. Despite the lack of any head, it is nicely carbonated. Not as creamy as stouts can come, though. Goes down relatively easy. Overall, I liked One and Tres better, although this is still way better than Too was.","MDekker","Jun 08, 2007"

Mildly sweet roasted malt aromas, chocolate/cocoa beans, and a mild, but noticeable meaty smokiness. Not quite as smoky as I was hoping for, but it's still good. Meaty, smoky flavors right off the bat. Roasted coffee bitterness in the background. Hints of dark fruits before slightly metallic, mildly tart, smoky, peaty malt takes back over with escalating roasted bitterness in the finish. Delicious. Again, not Rauchbier smoky, but maybe just the right amount. Very drinkable, and dangerous, as I imagine that this is at least 7% abv! My favorite of the holiday stouts.","alexgash","Mar 05, 2007"

Taste is really nice. smokey but in a black charcoal smoke way. This flavor lasts only a little while and transitions into a creamy milk stout taste with roasted malts. Smokiness comes back on the finish and is softer and more like a hickory smoke. Full mouthfeel...maybe a bit more like a porter than a stout in the mouthfeel though. A treat to have on tap.","aforbes10","Feb 19, 2007"

Roasted malt with some dark espresso-like coffee flavors. Smokiness is apparent, yet more subtle as opposed to a German Rauchbier, which I was expecting for some reason. Burnt malt with a feint bitter chocolate tone toward the back. The finish is mildly dry. Hearty, intense and enjoyable.","Winter","Apr 08, 2006"

Aroma is pretty expressive, with a nice balanced of peaty scotchy hints and chocolate, cocoa, caramel and coffee aromas. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and initially the flavor is completely lacking in both the front-palate and the mid-palate, until the finish yields rich scotch flavors, light smoke, chocolate, caramel, light malt bitterness and light sourness. I enjoyed the different segments together, but not as a whole. The mouthfeel is very thin, especially considering Dark Horses standards and the flavor, overall, isnt that enjoyable.","Crosling","Mar 26, 2006"

Rich deep molasses is the star with chocolate chips and coffee getting supporting roles. The very back of the taste is somewhat reminiscent of smoke, but not strong enough to convince me that its really there. Very very tasty. Mouth is nice and smooth, with light carbonation.

Not much of a head, but a thin layer of medium brown foam covered the top of the beer. No lace. Odors of salted olives were present, as was some generic smoke notes. Flavor was spicey with notes of black pepper, overcooked malts, and raw coffee. Some smoke toward the finish. Very heavy and filling mouthfeel.

I've always thought that Dark Horse lived up to its name; a fantastic brewery from Michigan that just doesn't get mentioned in the same breath as Bell's, Founders, Jolly Pumpkin, etc, which is unfair because the beers that come out of Marshall stand up to the best beers out of the state. Fore is no exception; a very nice smoky stout that mixes the smoke well with a chocolate maltiness.

Slightly sweet aroma is topped by a respectable amount of smoked malt aroma that has a slightly sharp note, like the fire is still buring beneath the malt. This sharpness continues to the flavor, but then a very dry puckering sensation soon follows. Seems to be a great deal of bitternessbehind this beer. Grassy notes are intermingeld with the smoke, which nearly hides the malt sweetness at first. After a few sips, a bit more of the caramel and raosted malt notes come through. Strong notes of dark chocolate and espresso come through once the taste buds adjust to the smokiness. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I was hoping, but not bad in any way. Drinkablity is pretty good as well. Another nice offering from Dark Horse.","aaronh","Feb 16, 2005"

This is a smoked stout but the smoked part is not really that upfront with my taste buds. Slight tangy flavor that reminds me of barbeque sauce but not smoked like other smoked beers. But maybe that's a good thing. Quite thick but with low carbonation. The other flavors are pretty straight forward. Coffee is main with a bittersweet chocolate flavor. The smoked flavor comes in the aftertaste and picks up intensity the longer I sit between sips (which seems weird, but good). This was a quality brew which I must give dark horse some credit for their creativeness.","granger10","Dec 27, 2002"

Not tremendously complex to my tastebuds. My vote for best Michigan smoked beer is still Bell's Batch 5000. Still have to love the Fore label which looks homemade with a black and white charcoal like drawing. It looks like a homebrew label. We need all the local brewers we can get.
