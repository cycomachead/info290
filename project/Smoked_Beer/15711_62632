3.98,0.5,4,4,4,3.75,4,"A decent smoked beer, a league or two more palatable than the last similar offering from this particular nation (I'm looking straight at you Nøgne Ø). The key seems to be the integration, because while it is indeed smoky, we're led to perceive this as a sub-attribute of whatever typical beer meme we're currently sussing out, rather than as an overarching component of the whole. As wanky as that was, it's true, and a straight-up compliment to the brewer.","biboergosum","Dec 30, 2012"

3.73,-5.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I enjoyed this offering although it isn't my favorite version of the style. The fruit flavors might benefit from some age in order for some of the slightly tart qualities to mellow, which may allow the sweetness to turn a bit richer.","NEhophead","Oct 08, 2012"
3.97,0.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of smoked malt with some caramel malt notes. Taste is good mix between some smoked malt with light smoked fish notes and some caramel malt. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Solid offering with great balanced taste of smoked malt and bacon and smoked fish.","Phyl21ca","Aug 25, 2012"

Some bread and toast, maybe a little bit of toffee. The flavor has a hint of vanilla which is nice, but the smoke and salt notes are almost overwhelming. A little bit nutty and some sweetness of toffee, bread, and toasted malts.","womencantsail","Jun 27, 2012"

3.89,-1.8,3,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer poured a dark brown with a soft, white head that slowly dissolves. The aroma is of dark fruit with subtle smoke and slight chocolate. Strong estery taste with the dark fruit very pronounced up front followed by chocolate with the smoke lingering on the back end of the beer. This beer has less smoke than another of Haandbryggeriet's beers (Norwegian Wood) which did disappoint me. I would like the smoke to be more prevelant, but this was still a very nice, drinkable beer. I enjoyed it, but like Norwegian Wood better.","osusullins","Aug 13, 2011"
3.92,-1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"My last bit o' smoked goodness for a bit (stupid lack of unlimited funds...), but some good stuff recently. This capstone pours a murky garnet-auburn topped by over a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises charred wood, toffee, toasted biscuits, and a small amount of pine sap. The taste brings in more of the same, with the toffee and smoke intertwining nicely, behaving themselves the whole time. Some mandarin oranges somehow sneak their way into the proceedings. Oddly enough, the smoke really doesn't dominate as I expected... The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily, slightly dry feel (man, has my tongue been worked-over a bit here...). Overall, a very nice smoke-based brew, but one that could, somehow, stand to have a bit more smoke involved. Still, another nicely-crafted piece from the Haand boys.","TMoney2591","Beers"

4.13,4.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This brew pours a dark murky kola hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a creamy,frothy two finger head that stays and leaves heaps of lacing all over the shop,the smell is a combination of smokey bacon,roasted malts,chichory,light liquorice and a tinge of herbal hops,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel which coats the mouth with smokey bacon,toasted marshmallows,chichory,beef jerky and finishes with a herbal hoppy bitterness and overall very nice and would drink again.","ADZA","May 11, 2011"
3.75,-5.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a very, very dark brown with a fizzy off-white head that dissipates into a thick, bubbly collar quick quickly with only a spot or two of lacing on the edges of the glass. The nose comes forward with some nice roasted malt and then there's just a touch of smoke in the background. The flavor has a bit more smoke and less of the roast. In addition, there's some cocoa and a bit of strong, bold coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with moderately-high carbonation. Slight fizz on the back-end. Finish is slightly dry and a bit smokey. Nicely done.","Thorpe429","Apr 26, 2011"
4.2,6.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"M: The smoke is chewy, meaty and a stand-out. It coats the tastebuds with a rich flavor that isn't too heavy. The darker malts, yeast strain and smoke all work nicely together.","akorsak","Apr 23, 2011"
3.68,-7.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, this was an interesting take on the style. Pretty tasty and well balanced but I wish that it had more of a smoke component and wasn't so burnt tasting.

4.5,13.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The taste starts with a smokey caramel and coffee. Then the middle unloads more of the Bamberg smoked malts, but you also get some chocolate flavors as well. The finish is a slightly gritty and well carbonated palate with smokey rye bread crust, and maybe just a hint of bacon and wood. This is a great smoke beer. Probably on the top tier of smoked beers that I can enjoy and would buy again.","scruffwhor","Feb 13, 2011"

3.35,-15.4,4,4,3,3.5,3,"500ml bottle served in a Tank 7 tulip. Poured a deep brown with two fingers of tan head. Smokey aroma with a little sausage, dark malt, also a fair amount of citrus hops. Medium bodied. Plenty of smoke in the flavor along with hop bitterness. Smoke lingers in the finish. The smoke flavor became a little like liquid smoke as it warmed, which distracted. One of these is plenty.","homebrewhawk","Jan 11, 2011"
4.48,13.1,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Excellent beer. The smoke is present in the taste and aroma, without being overpowering. There is a nice malty sweetness in the background. I get a load of peat and almost a hint of bacon. I am not big into smoked beers, but I love this one. I could drink a pint of this easily.","raverjames","Jan 04, 2011"
4.27,7.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D - A very impressive Smoked Porter, with a fantastic body that actually helps its drinkability. Don't expect to be beaten over the head with an overabundance of flavors, this beer does have the same understated beauty of other Haandbryggeriet brews I have enjoyed. Really good use of all the ingredients, fantastic balance, no flaws that I can detect. If you like smoke, pick this up.","SammyDavisJrJrJr","Dec 30, 2010"
