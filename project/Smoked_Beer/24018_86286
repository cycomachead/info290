Scent leads with firm notes of smoke, not very distinguished as the type of wood used, big doughy, bready and yeasty notes, some spice and light fruity tartness. Taste follows suit, smoke up front, bread in the middle, spice and light fruityness on the back end. Lighter side of medium, a touch too bubbly. Interesting, yes... overly memorable, no.","rfgetz","Beers"
3.69,2.2,4.5,3,4,4,3.5,"The flavor dials back the smoke a few levels, thankfully, and lets a bit of light sour and funkiness play through. Hints of tart citrus zest, dried grasses, funky barnyard, and tangy wheat. It's actually pretty well balanced, but the smoke still sticks out from the rest of the beer. Bubbles are ample, and the body of Gotlandsdricka is medium-light on the palate. Clean finish with a hint of smokiness and light fruit. Overall, I found this Jester King offering to be an interesting addition to their lineup. Although it's not something I'll be seeking out again (and not worth the $13 price tag), I'm glad I got a chance to try it. Palate-expanding, to say the least.","wagenvolks","0"

The alcohol is well integrated and the level of carbonation helps to move and blend the flavors. This is a curious and diffrent sort of brew. I admittedly researched this style prior to gettin the chance to try it and i was expecting a juniper inclusion that seemed absent here. I gotta admit, the lack of juniper character might be the reason I enjoyed this. Throwing juniper into this mix would have been a trainwreck im sure. This isnt a beer I see myself getting thirsty for or craving. However, i wouldnt avoid having it again sometime either.","stakem","Nov 26, 2012"

That is a shame, because it does not mingle well with the rest of the beer.","champ103","Nov 05, 2012"

4.2,16.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I definitely recommend this to anyone. Jester King says it's giving the beer "additional fermentation with wild yeast and souring bacteria. We presently have a version of Gotlandsdricka that we inoculated with wild yeast and bacteria aging in oak barrels." I can't wait!","BeardedRiker","Beers"

3.85,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Moderate level of smoke, well integrated and not overbearing. The juniper and gale are subdued, and come off more as general spice than anything, with some light bitter phenolics as well. Aftertaste of honeyed malt and soft oak smokiness, a mellow wood-derived astringency cuts through the ample and frothy carbonation. As a historical recreation of an ancient simple smoked ale, it's definitely interesting (especially as a Swede myself) but a little one-note overall.","emerge077","Oct 27, 2012"

I have had nothing like it and I love it. The drinking experience brings immediately to mind a Viking's existence. Seek it out if you can!","mwilbur","Oct 23, 2012"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,""Drink of the good land", eh? This must be Milwaukee's original beer (thank you, Alice Cooper)... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy gold topped by a couple fingers of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, coriander, black pepper, light clove, Belgian yeast, cracked wheat, and a general sense of mild campfire-style smoke. The taste brings in more of the same, with the smoke coming through stronger throughout, creating a fog of sorts on the tongue and fostering an increased sense of earthiness that works with the saison-like surroundings. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a nice little smoked saison, a unique take on an already varied style. Good times.","TMoney2591","Oct 22, 2012"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"D - An odd beer, but a fairly enjoyable one. I refilled my glass a few times, and while I wouldn't want this often I'd certainly have it again in the future. I'm actually fairly intrigued by the upcoming 'wild' version. Worth checking out if you like smoked beers.","MasterSki","Oct 21, 2012"
