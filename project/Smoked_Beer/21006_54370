4.25,16.8,,,,,,"O: Really happy I picked this up. One of the better simple malt brews. Must warn all that this is smoky, delicious, but you need to like some smokiness or you may not be a fan...However, this might be a one time thing for me as an IPA guy","2_Shaynez","Sep 25, 2014"

3.54,-2.7,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Overall, a decent porter that has plenty of potential. If you want to make the "double" part of the label more fitting, fill out the body and ramp up the addition of the smoked malt. That aspect was so promising in the nose but didn't fill out in everything that followed.","ludachris","Aug 06, 2013"

3.47,-4.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"OVERALL: Not nearly as good as I remember it, though that just might be because I've had the chance to try much more of their stuff, and now see how good these guys really are. A quality beer for sure, but this is very similar to their Fumee. Kind of like a Fumee Lite. Many of the same qualities are here, but the smoke is toned down slightly. An enjoyable beer, but given how excellent the rest of their stuff is, this one doesn't quite run in the same crowd.","Jeffo","Jul 02, 2012"

2.97,-18.4,3.5,4,2.5,2,3,"O - Announced as a robust porter, this beers doesn't share much of the characteristics of a porter. It certainly lacks a smoother mouthfeel. Besides, the smoky character is too dominant and hides all the malty notes which might be present. I'm rather disappointed by the beer from Brasseurs Illimités.","duracell","Mar 20, 2012"
2.36,-35.2,3.5,2.5,2,3.5,2,"Ashy, smokey, yeasty flavors dominate. Very dry. This beer exemplifies everything I dislike about porters and smoked beers. Let's see if the drain rejects it as strongly as my palate did...","brystmar","Mar 13, 2012"

4.24,16.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Bottle purchased yesterday from Peluso in Montreal. Pours a dark brown colour with hints of amber. Thick off-white head, leaves traces of lacing down the glass. Smells of chocolate, roasted malt, and a hint of the promised smoke. Nice roasted bitterness in the flavour with the smoke coming through more in the aftertaste. Body is a bit thinner than I expected since it is called a double porter, but still nice to drink. Another great beer from this brewery.","kwjd","Oct 20, 2010"
3.77,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pleasant porter that's nicely drinkable. Pours very dark brown chocolate colour, not much head and maybe affected by a few months' cellaring in that regard. A little roasty and whiff of smoke. Nice with barbeque meal. Mouthfeel middling and it was smooth creamy, although I expected this to be thicker for the declared porter style. Not significantly smokey, but its there.","Sammy","Oct 18, 2010"
4.34,19.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"D: Definitely one of my favourite smoky beers to drink.. especially pairing it up with smoked gouda cheese and olive bread. A bit thicker body would make it better, but no complaints here.","digitalvenus","Sep 13, 2010"
3.7,1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a moderately deep brown with a nice tan head. Right off the bat, the nose is intensely smoky. Charred wood and flames mixed with highly roasted malt as well as faint hints of dark chocolate and espresso. The taste levels the playing field a bit, with the roast and smoke aspects of the beer combining pretty well. Medium body with some dryness and good carbonation for what it's offering. Drinks pretty well for how overpowering the nose would make it seem. All in all, a good beer.","Thorpe429","Jun 24, 2010"
4.26,17,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a very dark brown, nearly black, with almost no foam except for a small layer of swamp colored bubbles. This beer has beautiful aromas and flavors. Smells big on smoked ham and gamey meats, with espresso and roastiness slightly less apparent than the smokiness. Flavors are big and smoky, reminiscent of burnt sausages, dark chocolate, and coffee. I enjoy this beer quite a bit.","droomyster","Jun 14, 2010"
3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I hoped this wouldn't be a smoke-drenched disaster, and it's not. It has subtlety and depth of character, and, most importantly of all, a comforting flavor profile. Makes me wish this was bomber size, as this is about as drinkable as an overtly smokey beer can get.","Metalmonk","Jun 07, 2010"
3.92,7.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: My favourite smoked beer my far. It's a nice combination of porter and smoke making it easier to drink and more pleasurable. Texture was a bit thin, but none the less. A great beer from QC, thanks again Zorprime.","Long813","May 07, 2010"

3.9,7.1,4,4,4,3,4,"Drinkability is good if smoked beers suit you as they do me. There's just a bit more than one thing going on here but not a lot more. Still, I like it.","meatyard","Mar 16, 2010"
3.85,5.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"deep, dark brown with maybe some mahogany highlights. tan head holds for a bit and then diminishes to a collar. nose is fireplace, maple and savory with a touch of roasty, a touch of chocolate, a hint of coffee and an ever so slight hop presence in the mix. taste carries a very good balance, with the malt that has been twice smoked (once over peat wood and once over ash wood) taking the main role. the other flavors dance in the middle and the finish shows off what the whiskey malt does, leaving a dry woodsiness as it goes. was expecting more body, and a little more chocolate/coffee/plain old porter taste. sort of one dimensional, making it hard to drink too many, but still a fun taste of "smoke". way overpriced here in the states as well.","timtim","Mar 14, 2010"

3.64,0,3,4,3.5,3,4,"Nothing too offensive, nothing too interesting. A run-of-the-mill porter with a decent smokiness. It would serve as a good introduction to smoked beers for someone new to the style.","WorldWideStout","Feb 16, 2010"
3.5,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I had high hopes for this after trying their imperial stout. Is seems that one is the star of the bunch; so far none of the others have matched its quality. The lightness of this beer does make it pretty drinkable but there`s just not enough flavour coming through. I think this brew could be easily stepped-up to a great porter with some minor tinkering. On the right track but not quite there.","eat","Feb 14, 2010"
3.59,-1.4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall: I never connected with the Calumet & Calumet Grand Chef and this one, which is basically the same recipe, is no different. I found the taste didn't live up to the aroma and the body was lacking. Still good, but not very good.","papat444","Feb 12, 2010"
3.35,-8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Bottle via Glouglouburp- Pours a dark cola with a slight red hue, minimal head and lacing. Nose- sweet and smokey with a mineral saltiness. Taste- chalky with a dry smokey roast flavour. Slight bandaid flavour on the finish. Medium to light bodied with robust carbonation.","oakbluff","Jan 17, 2010"
3.68,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"P.S.: should be categorized as a smoked porter. Bièreopholie (which was the old name of simple malt) usually was only doing their porters smoked, I think they kept the same recipe as the Calumet, which was a smoked porter.","flipper2gv","Dec 26, 2009"

3.69,1.4,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: A good porter but it is outdone by a number of others. I think this should be categorized as a smoked porter.","argock","Dec 05, 2009"
3.92,7.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and not much lacing. Aroma of smoked is quite dominant with some notes of roasted malt also noticeable. Taste is dominated by a nice mix of smoked malt with a little touch of roasted malt. Body is bit thin and beer would be better with a fuller body with good carbonation. Very well done with loads of smoked malt but I think this beer would be even better with more roasted malt and a fuller creamier body.","Phyl21ca","Nov 25, 2009"
3.82,4.9,3,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer is brown color. More like a dark brown than a light black. The head is made of big bubbles and disappear quite fast, to leave only a thin film of fine bubbles. The aroma is smoky with some roast... and something else. The label says it has some whiskey touch, it is probably that. The taste is roast/smoke... Nice. A good bitterness at the end, it starts slow and finish high. As the beer warms up, the smoke is taking more place in the taste. Medium body, this is a very good session Porter.","ZorPrime","Beers"
3.91,7.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A porter that is greater than the sum of its parts, not as enjoyable when picked apart, as it seems a bit one-dimensional on the surface, yet I thoroughly enjoyed this Double Porter, and salute the spirit of Bieropholie that lives on through this. A huge thanks to Goldorak for bringing me a bottle of this to Alberta to sample.","IronDjinn","0"
