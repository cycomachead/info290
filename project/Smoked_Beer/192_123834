Still, it was certainly worth trying. I don't remember its specific qualities other than it being relatively viscous, very dark, and, of course, quite smoky. Oh yes, I am reminded that it was somewhat tangy as well. Palatable if sipped and consumed with some cheese. I only really like sharp cheddar, but I imagine it would go well with blue cheese for those who enjoy that.","Libeertarian","Feb 21, 2015"

Unique and very nice. Flavor begins bitter with notes of smoked malt, oak, charred wood, bitter black coffee and a slight sour tang. This moves into a middle that is very smokey, with notes of smoked wheat, tangy wheat malt and herbal hops. Finish is bitter with notes of bitter, herbal medicine hops, smoked malt, a slight tang, burnt black coffee and burnt oak wood. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of bitter herbal hops, smoked malt, burnt oak wood and burnt dark roast coffee. Overall impression of flavor is of a very bitter, very smokey flavor that is deep and strong, despite the beer's low ABV. Very nice and very pleasant to the right palate. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a slightly drying, woody mouthfeel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a light, yet smokey, drying and woody beer.

Aromas are heavily roasted, with campfire qualities, toasted wheat, tangy sweetness, subtle bitter hops, and a solid dose of tang and sour at the end. Flavors are surprisingly smooth, with that campfire character toned down a bit, and balanced nicely with a subtle sourness, earthy notes, toasted grains, and tangy sweetness in the backbone.

Good black malt flavor and some mellow smoke.  Light body and easily drinkable overall.  This beer was made for regional tastes and big pours, and it reflects.  In the modern american brewing landscape of one offs and limited batches, it sadly fails to impress when beer geeks expect a blast of this or that.  As an overall experience, it was basically a schwarzbier with a touch of bacon.  Nowhere near a rauchbier, maybe if there was a line between schwarzbier and rauchbier, this would be 25% rauchbier from the schwarzbier side.  If you released this in the 80's, it would blow minds and put your brewery on the map, but in the modern age of wild ales and 13% bourbon stouts, it fails to register for citizenship in crazytown.","UnionMade","Aug 28, 2014"

Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, wheat, wood smoke, dark bread, light char, nuttiness, herbal, and smoke/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and smoke notes; with great strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, wheat, wood smoke, dark bread, light char, light nuttiness, herbal, and smoke/roasted earthiness. Slight tartness/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, wheat, wood smoke, dark bread, light nuttiness, and smoke/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt and smoke flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is a very nice smoked beer. All around good complexity and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt and smoke flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 24, 2014"

3.93,11.3,,,,,,"Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a fine, half finger light brown head with great retention and sheets of lacing. Aroma of smoky toasted grain, cocoa, nuts with a bit of meaty smokehouse. Flavor starts similar to the aroma, with smoky toasted wheat with light hints of cocoa and nuts, develops a bit of tartness as the flavor thins out a bit, exposing the smokiness more clearly. Long lingering smokehouse aftertaste with hints of bacon. A quite nicely made interpretation of a Gratzer leaning towards the theory that this style was slightly sour. I'm not a sour fan, but the light tartness in this was pleasing and fit well with the smoke. I liked this more as I drank the glass and as much as the more lightly flavored attempt at a traditional version of this from Professor Briem. Nicely done and a successful Lips of Faith experiment. Possibly a bit challenging for those not familiar with the history of this rare, nearly extinct style.","LiquidAmber","Aug 21, 2014"

That and Svengoolie. Love it. Anyway, this stuff pours a sorta/kinda murky smoke ash topped by a finger or so of, well, ashen foam. The nose comprises oak smoke, light wood, clove, and a vague sense of cracked wheat in the distance. The taste brings in more of the same, the smoke taking a strong lead, but then the underlying slightly-sour wheat comes in near and through the finish, mixing with the smoke in a fairly enjoyable manner. It's never fully seamless, but it still mostly works. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice bit of wheaty smoke. 'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Aug 09, 2014"

4.2,19,4,4.5,4.25,3.75,4,"Overall, believe it or not, this is our first taste of the “Lips of Faith” series. We’ve been under New Belgium’s distribution net for over a year now, so it’s a bit embarrassing, as many a good release has come out between now and way back when. To make matters worse, this is our first grapple with a Grätzer. Yes, yes, we’ve had plenty of smokes and rauchs in the past, but nothing really like this traditional Polish style. The thing that stands out most about this one is how dark it is, on all fronts. It smells like your elderly, pipe-puffing grandfather’s tweed jacket. You know the one, with the sewn on elbow patches. The flavoring departs from this a bit, but you keep that same, aged essence. It is hard to tell what is “New Belgium” about this, and what is “Three Floyds”, but whatever each contributes here, it works. The smoke stands out nicely, and from what we have researched, they stylistically succeed. The best thing, again, is probably its aroma, as that robustness is lost a bit through the taste, but either way, we would certainly buy this to keep us warm all through the winter.","TheBrewo","Jul 28, 2014"

3.83,8.5,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"22 ounce bottle, label says best enjoyed by May 2015. Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like chocolate, coffee, smoked meats/malt, and dark bread/bready malt. It tastes like bittersweet chocolate, smoked meat/malts, dark bread, wheat, wood, and there's also a nice light tart finish. None of the flavors overpowered the others. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with a good amount of carbonation. I don't think I've ever had a traditional grätzer before so I really can't compare this brew to one. With that being said, I thought this was a good beer and would like to try it again. $8.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Jul 12, 2014"

Taste is much the same with earth, cocoa, and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke and earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

4.1,16.1,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Pours a hazy dark brown, opaque in glass, thick dense tan foam, big chunks of lace down the glass. Smell: porter-y... medium roast coffee, note of oak smoke, milk chocolate, black plum. Minimal floral hop character. Taste: roasty and snappy + smoked grain, baking chocolate, mildly herbal and earthy, with a little tart stone fruit sweetness. There's a very mild acidic bite throughout. Light bodied with a relaxed but fluffy feel. Really quite interesting, tasty and refreshing.","babaracas","Jun 25, 2014"

2.56,-27.5,4,3,2,4,2,"Gratzer starts with decent tan foam head that leaves good lacing in the glass. The liquid is an opaque black liquid that definitely matches the theme well. On the nose I smell sweet smoked barley with a hint of floral hops. The flavor is overpowered with so much smoke it is nearly undrinkable for me. The mouth feel is certainly excellent, but overall this beer is a bit too simple on the nose with way too much smoke on the tongue to be recommended. If you love the flavor of smoke you'll be in love otherwise steer clear. Both companies have better options.","lsiberian","Jun 25, 2014"
3.14,-11,3.5,3.25,3,3,3.25,"Pours a medium brown with white head, decent retention. The aroma starts with heavy smoked malt. Notes of campfire, burnt wood, and other things associated with smoke come to mind. Perhaps a bit overdone in the smoke department. Some roast comes through as well, no apparent lacto on the aroma. The taste starts with chocolate and smoke. Started like a smoke forward smoked porter, not too bad, nothing crazy. Then comes a *hint* of lactobacillus which just makes this beer weird. It doesn't really come across as being tart or sour, just that implied hint of sour wheat. This is followed by some lager yeast notes. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. I give this beer props for being unique, but it certainly lacks in the realm of balance. I think a heavier lacto profile and a bit less malt would have really made for an interesting beer.","homebrew311","Jun 25, 2014"

3.77,6.8,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"nothing like i know gratzers to be. lightly smoked wheat based beers, usually fluffy and blonde. i guess it isnt written in the rules anywhere that it cant be dark wheat malt, and thats exactly whats going on in this three floyds joint effort. pours like a ported, dark dark brown, barley letting light pass, and sporting over an inch of tan milkshake textured head. the nose on it is only subtly smoky, not as intense as expected, but the malts are real roasty, and this again seems more like a robust porter than a gratzer as i know the style. the flavor also shows only a little smoke, its there all the way through, but it isnt the main flavor agent. the chewy dark grains are, and they crowd out the more delicate wheat and smoke properties i was looking for. surprised its not 10% abv, given the involvement of three floyds on this thing, the low abv makes it rather drinkable, despite being a confusing experience. tough to call this one a true gratzer i think, but i like it because it is something different. one of the better lips of faith releases in awhile, but dont expect anything conventional here.","StonedTrippin","Jun 12, 2014"
