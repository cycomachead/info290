4.21,9.1,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Certainly one of the very best smoked beers I've had. The creamy mouthfeel subdues the unique flavors a little and just makes this more drinkable. Another reason to try anything from Brasserie Dupont. From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle.","mactrail","Mar 17, 2015"

Fruity palate, especially apricot and peach with hard candi, light graham cracker with smoke in the finish and an earthy bitterness in the background. This is a very creamy medium bodied beer with fine soft carbonation. Very refreshing.","pat61","Mar 13, 2015"

3.66,-5.2,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"i have to confess, i ordered this one not knowing it was smoked, and wondered the whole time where the bandaid and gauze thing came from, almost medicinal in a way that we usually associate with fruit beers, but there is no fruit here. it is a relief to now see it is a smoked beer, and that makes perfect sense. the smoke is light enough to be confounding, but still obvious, just in a different way, very belgian. light copper colored beer, came out darker than expected from the tap, and cant hold much head at all after a minute or too. a medicine nose, but thats smoke and grain tannins. the saison aspect is lacking for me, its neither funky or fruity, and really doesnt have much of a yeast profile at all, especially considering its brewer. definitely different, i have not had much smoked belgian stuff, so this was a reach for my palate. i didnt love it, found it a league below other beers i have had from these guys, although i certainly can appreciate its uniqueness. i have seen some bottles around too, maybe i will try it in that format and compare...","StonedTrippin","Feb 13, 2015"

3.97,2.8,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,3.75,"I got this from my neighbors. Thank you guys. This is really as special beer. A smoked Saison that gushed on me but was really good. I never had something quite like it before. I found it quite smokey in the aroma though real Rauchbier are much more extreme. There was also a certain earthiness to it that was clearly Saison yeast. A lot of taste and relatively low alcohol.","safaricook","Dec 31, 2014"
3.81,-1.3,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Is it a saison or a smoked beer? That's the question.Pours into a large tulip glass a somewhat murky deep burnt orange with a large blooming off white crown that leaves two full rings of lace as it settles into a frothy mass.The smoke is light in the nose with mild  yeasty phenols and toasted grain detected.Dry on the palate with a little chalkiness and white pepper,the smoke is very light in the finish,a grainy feel.This would be a good springtime drinker while out grilling or planting,I'll revisit it in a few months.","oberon","Dec 18, 2014"

4.11,6.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a quite hazy orange amber with a fine, two finger off-white head that contiues building for a long time after the pour, with pillowy lacing. Aroma dominated by smoked malt with hints of orange and light saison yeast, bit odd and vegetal. Flavor is mild saison yeast, bready malt all covered by nice spicy smokehouse with a hint of peat. Finishes semidry with a pleasant lightly orange residual smokiness. Peppery active carbonation and mouth feel. This does not have the intensity of the Aecht smoked beers, but does a superb job of delivering good smokiness without the hefty malt body of Aecht. The balance between the saison and smoke is just about perfect. A bit on the spritzy side with overactive carbonation, but I did not lose any opening the bottle, so all is forgiven. It's been a long time between new smoked beers and this was a great way to reintroduce myself. This is one of the world's stellar breweries.","LiquidAmber","Nov 06, 2014"

4.28,10.9,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours a hazy copper / dark amber, two fingers thick sudsy tan colored head. Settles slowly with a few rings of chunky lace on the glass. Smell: mandarin orange, grainy with wood smoke - toasty and mildly meaty; lightly herbal. Taste: mild nectarine, grape skin, tangy grain with a little toast and doughiness in the back; smoke is lighter here and lends a cohesive earthy and toasty flavor. Light with space-filling carbonation, finish is mildly earthy with fleshy nectarine and finishing dry. Lingering sweet orange. Baller smoked saison.","babaracas","0"
4.41,14.2,4,4.25,4.75,4,4.25,"Mouthfeel is where this beer takes a slight hit - pillowy head fails to subside well-enough, leaving the mouthfeel tasting over-carbonated.  The feel of this beer is too lively, especially when paired with the spice character, making me wish I had left it out to flatten a bit.  Consistency is a nice medium - not as thin as many saisons and well-suited to the flavor profile.","tkdchampxi","Oct 23, 2014"
