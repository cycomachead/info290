3.72,-2.9,3.25,3.75,4,3.25,3.5,"Overall: Great beer. I had some pulled pork app (roasted, not smoked, but still) and the beer went very well with it. On the whole, while this was clearly a rauchbier it had more flavor and balance than most that I've seen, which tend to hit you over the head with smokiness (fine by me as I like that flavor, but they're often very one-note). This was a great beer that could pair well with a ton of foods with the backgrounds notes but also was lighter and refreshing. I'd definitely try it again.","brother_rat","Jul 24, 2013"

4.02,5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"O - What I loved was how such a light beer can pack so much smoke. I'm used to a smoked porter or rauchbier, but this was a new one to me. I'd certainly give it a shot when considering a smoky beer. Pair it with a sweet marinaded meat and have a awesome pairing.","socon67","0"
