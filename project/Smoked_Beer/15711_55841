Aroma consists of multi-grain malt bill with deep floral and herbal hoppy notes. Taste is a mix between some lightly smoked multi-grain malt with some quite flavourful green and herbal hops with limited bitterness. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Nicely brewed with fresh green hops really coming through and well balanced by grain malt bill.","Phyl21ca","Beers"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle, Batch 355. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready malt, yeast, smoke, and some fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like smoke, bready/grainy malt, yeast, wood, peppery spice, and some fruit. The smoke isn't overpowering in either the aroma or taste, but there's certainly enough there to notice it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. I think this is a good brew, I'd buy it again in the future. $8.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jul 08, 2012"

Automatically the question not to ask is whether this is a superior beer. Its more astringent but still balanced. Palate of chalk, smoke in one spectrum and apple pie and hints of sour notes that all combine into a grassy bitter end. Well carbonated. Ready for hams and creamy cheese. I love this brewery.","rtepiak","Jul 26, 2011"

Color is a clear medium dark amber with some bubble trails as they should be. Aroma is yeast, toffee, malt, dark riper fruit, and a hint of sm oke. Flavor is similar but smoke is much more prominant, followed by a sweet tang that really works to balance the whold. Finish is like flavor and has a long duration. Bit boozy there at the end too. Session if you're in the mood for this kind of thing. I rarely am.","drpimento","Jul 10, 2011"

The nose carries some light smoke and a bit of wood and spice. The flavor is fairly smoked with a bit of the woody character maintained. Not a strong smoke character, but there is a lot of the moderate smokeyness, if they makes sense. Overcarbonated and a light, fizzy body. Not a huge fan.","Thorpe429","Mar 28, 2011"

It poured with a little bit of white froth, and had a medium-full bodied texture. To me some beers really are an experience to drink, and some maybe more for their rarity than purely by their taste. Smoke beers, sour ales, chile beers are few and far between, and I think that counts for something. What I liked most about this beer was it was definitely out of the ordinary, and left me wanting more from Norway.","msmezher","Aug 31, 2010"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Batch 254. Hmm, farmers required by law to make beer? Finally, a coercive act I have no problem with. This apparent relic of bygone days pours a not-quite-clear garnet-amber topped by a finger of thick off-white froth that tries to live forever but ultimately fails. Ah, the mortality of bubbles. The nose exhibits a healthy dose of peat smoke up front, almost like fiery oregano or something, with some wheat, grasses, and wood making up a rather rustic backdrop. The taste holds a rather more subdued smoky character, still fairly dark, that served as a compliment to the somewhat citrus-y and flowery wheat notes. Imagine a very subtly hopped wheatwine which was then nicely smoked. Good times, baby. The body nears heft, with a light carbonation and a somewhat dry feel. Overall, another good time from the Hand boys. Keep 'em comin', you crazy Norwegians!","TMoney2591","0"

3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D - One never knows what to expect with these revivalist, traditional beers, and aside from smoke I really wasn't sure what I was getting into when I popped the cap off of this bottle. I expected something spicy, probably with some juniper; instead I get a lot of toasty, brown malt and muddy clove and allspice/cinnamon. It's kind of like a Belgian pumpkin ale. It isn't really an unpleasant combination, but there is something missing; it seems like it needs a bright note of hops, acidity, or a pungent spice like coriander to lift the heavy malt and smoke off the palate. As it is, it becomes a bit cloying toward the end of the glass and is not quite as drinkable as it might be. Nevertheless, it is an interesting, rustic beer and not quite like anything else that I have had before.","nickfl","Mar 05, 2010"
