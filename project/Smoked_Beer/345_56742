4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"I had this smoked beer at Piper's Pub a couple weeks ago, while visiting the Southside. Nearly opaque dark as night with hints of ruby highlights at the edges, dark tan head forms thick. Aroma has a nice robust layer of smoke, mild smoked meats, with some campfire roasted malts...other tones that arose were a mellow fruitiness with soft grain character of the oatmeal. Flavor actually lead with the tartness of the some vinous dark fruit character with a smoked malt character finishing it off with a pretty heavy hand. Smoked meat was mellow nowhere near as in your face as some of the Bambergian brethren, herbal hops with a nice dark roasted malt character finishes it out to complement the smoked malts. Medium bodied with a soft fuller texture with the oatmeal addition, thick enough for the winter but not overbearing enough to deter me in the early sunny days of Spring. Even carbonation made for effortless drinkability, I didn't detect any heat from this beer, but was expecting something closer to a smoked Baltic Porter in alcohol. Overall, nothing compares to the quality beers from Victory I've been trying on a consistent basis, they understand what great beer is all about. Three styles on side by side this was my least favorite of the three and it was still excellent.","WVbeergeek","Feb 13, 2012"
3.4,-12.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Overall â€“ While it lacks some things in body and mouthfeel it is a nice more bitter porter with good aroma and taste. Worth a try.","Darkmagus82","Feb 12, 2012"

3.92,0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I rather liked this, as it basically came off like a smoked Oatmeal Stout but it was still well balanced, with the smoke never overpowering any of the other flavors. This was maybe a little too lively feeling at times but the overall presentation here won me other. This is the type of unique offering that I expect to find here at the brewpub.","Kegatron","Jan 28, 2012"

3.73,-4.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a clear, dark brown with a small layer of off-white head. Roasty malt aroma, rye spice, and charcoal. Taste of smoke and charcoal, but not too heavy as to detract from the other flavors at play: roasty malts, nuts, grains, subtle hop bitterness. Medium-bodied and pretty decent overall, but I've had better of the style.","Rifugium","Dec 19, 2011"

3.51,-10,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer looks very nice. Dark dark brown with ruby highlights and sheets of just off white lacing. Aroma is pretty smokey. Kind of one note, but not unpleasantly so. Flavor is light and smokey with a nice biscuit malty flavor. Nice, but nothing special. Mouthfeel is too light even for something that is supposed to be low abv. Overall a nice enough beer. Quite enjoyable.","Agold","Dec 05, 2011"

3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The smokiness was nice, with some mild complexities of meat and peppers, but not quite complex enough to carry the beer all on their own.","mynie","Feb 20, 2011"

3.38,-13.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium bodied with a smokier profile than the aroma suggests with hints of charcoal, bacon and BBQ but the smokiness doesn't dominate letting the other flavors shine through. Hints of caramel, rye, toffee and hazelnut with nice bitter hops up front and subtle spice. Decent balance but not as smokey as I prefer. It's still pretty good, however, wit some rauchy flavor as well as some sweet malt, toast and faint dark fruit.","corby112","Jan 16, 2011"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured ontap into a Victory branded pint. Dark brown almost black in appearance, mocha colored head forms. Aroma is light, roasty and smokey. Flavor borders a smoked porter, with gentle chocolate, oatmeal, roasted malt, and coffee. In the finish is where this beer really got me, a pleasant smoked flavor and hint of bbq/smoke cured meat. Nice and rich, smooth and velvety going down. A nice session ale. Smoked beers originated in Germany and for a quick second I thought I was there.","Stinkypuss","Jan 13, 2011"
4.12,5.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"After checking out this brew, and also seeing other reviews, I can help to to add, like I did above, this brew is nearly a meal in itself. Though thin at times, it takes the smoke and the flavors of an oatmeal stout and gives a nice hearty brew that is very enjoyable. I would certianly have this brew again. Another great brew by Victory.","mattgreger","Dec 31, 2010"
4.33,11,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D_A really good marriage of two of my favourite styles of beer, Oatmeal Stout and Rauchbier. The smoke is really nicely incorporated and does not overwhelm the palate. Well rounded and not too charged with alcohol, this makes for a highly drinkable beer. If this gets bottles it would definitely go in my rotation.","sleazo","Dec 25, 2010"

3.86,-1,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability scores really high with me on this one - it's not the most flavorful, complex, or rich example of the style, but it sure is well done and quite easy to put back a few.","BeerImmediately","Dec 21, 2010"
3.84,-1.5,5,3.5,3.5,5,4,"This is a medium bodied brew with an exceptionally smooth feel. It has a light level of carbonation and the abv is suppressed. Very drinkable, if I had more time I would sit and enjoy a few of these. For a smoked beer, it is on the lighter side, possibly a good intro beer for someone who isn't ready to take the plunge into an all out rauchbier assault of smokiness.","stakem","Jul 21, 2010"
3.68,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a dark black with a thick brown head. Smell is very smokey and full of roasted malt. The taste is less smokey than the smell but it still delivers a very pleasant smoke taste that isn't offputing. Nice thick mouthfeel that lingers. All-in-all a really nice offering from Victory.","mymrnngjckt","May 27, 2010"
