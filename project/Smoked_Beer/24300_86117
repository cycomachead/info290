3.74,0.3,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"i have not had much smoked pils, this is only the second or third i can recall, but its probably my favorite of the lot. its less smoke heavy, not so rauch and german and intense and campfire based. its a pils first and a smoked beer second, which lets the light grain still be light, and the mouthfeel not smolder into something much heavier than the style asks for. just a slightly brown hue to the golden beer, but definitely more hazy than most pilsener beers out there. the head is small but easily resurrected with a whirl of the glass. the nose and taste both show some sweetness, not as dry as others, and the lager yeast is totally lost along with the crisp finish it usually brings. the smoke, as light as it is here, still drags it on quite a ways in the finish. woody as it is smoky, i like that, and i still taste all the grain, which is really fresh. carbonation is high even though the beer looks flat. a combination of two styles i dont unconditionally love, but this is a great beer, very well balanced for what it is, and as good in terms of overall quality as we all now expect out of evil twin. i could drink several of these in a sitting, which may be the greatest testament to its appeal.","StonedTrippin","Dec 07, 2014"

The aroma is smokey with some meat and cherry wood aromas. Some booze and maybe even some apricots. The taste is lots of smoke, charred wood, cherry, and malts. Very woody and earthy. Finishes with some more wood and smoked malts. Some floral hop notes. Medium bodied with not much of an alcohol presence. Overall, solid Smoked Beer I'd certainly buy again. Not quite up there with some of the better Rauchbiers but a Smoked Pilsner is an intriguing take on the style.","PicoPapa","Jun 26, 2014"

All of the smoked beers I've tried have been heavier darker ales but this is a light pilsner style beer, I am quite perplexed. The pour is that of a traditional pilsner, golden straw yellow color with a white head and little lacing. The nose of this beer is my favorite thing about it. There is all the sweet simple aromas of a well made pilsner accented by the very natural organic smell of smoke. The aroma makes me salivate and beg to taste. The flavir is exactly what the nose promised, just not as dynamic. The beer is balanced and very well reminiscent of the style and the smoke is natural and adds complexity unlike the smoke on many lesser beers. This is a great beer that begs to be drank and enjoyed. Unorthodox does not always work....This time it does.","lochef81","Mar 22, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy/cloudy pale golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, biscuit, cracker, wood smoke, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and smoke notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, biscuit, cracker, wood smoke, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and yeast earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, pear, biscuit, cracker, wood smoke, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and smoke flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice smoked pilsner. All around good balance of malt, hop, and smoke flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

4.14,11,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"No head really with decent lacing on a murky golden with slight copper hue body. Aroma is strongly smokey and hint of mesquite and only light smoked meat presence, some grass as well. Flavors present and interesting mix of orange and lemon citrus fading in and out with smoked meats and campfire flavors. A rapidly changing and dynamic flavor. medium body and moderate carbonation. Very unique and easy to drink for the style. definitely worth trying.","kylehay2004","Sep 10, 2013"

3.86,3.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,4,"The label says a smoked pilsner,that doesn't seem to fit this beer much.Poured into a becker a slight hazed honey color with a large blooming sticky white head that left multiple broken rings of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Citrusy hops and mild toasted grain stand out most with the smoke being pretty faint.Quite dry on the palate with leafy and citric hops standing out mostly with faint smoke in the finish.A full bodied beer it goes down pretty easy.I like this beer,it's not alot like a pilsner in the flavor and aroma department,and it's not very smokey,still it's pretty damn good and great on a hot humid day like today.","oberon","May 30, 2013"

Fits the style of a Smoked Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes sharply of smoke, pale malt, sweet malt, and slight hop. Overall, the smoke is distinct but not overwhelming, and other flavors are distinguished. This is a very session-able beer.","Tone","May 18, 2013"

3.88,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,4,"O: I found this beer to be very enjoyable and drinkable because the smoked flavors in the taste were not overpowering. This beer seems like it would pair well with barbecued food because it is clean and has some refreshing properties.","metter98","Feb 15, 2013"
3.92,5.1,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"O: I really enjoyed the fact that the smokiness of this beer was not overly intense or too over the top, it kept the beer approachable and easy to enjoy. The aroma of the beer is slightly one dimensional but the flavors are more complex and interesting - this is just what I would expect a smoked pilsener to be. A little too intense to be an easy drinker or a sessionable beer but I would definitely like to have this one again, preferably with some BBQ.","dbrauneis","Feb 11, 2013"

3.98,6.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Home, home on the range... This stuff pours a very lightly hazy straw topped by over a finger of lightly off-white froth. The nose comprises dark smoke, light plastic, very light wheat, and very light grass. It's understandable that the smoke is front and center, but there isn't much else going on at all. Still, nice smoke... The taste brings in more of the same, though now the smoke is hammy, less plastic-y. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an enjoyable smoked pilsner, something that shows that you can, indeed, smoke a pilsner without completely losing sight of the base (though, admittedly, the smoke seems meant to o'erpower all else). Not bad at all.","TMoney2591","Nov 06, 2012"

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from bottle into a COAST Willi. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, smoke, smoked meat, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoked meat, smoke, wheat, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The smokiness on this one really stands out and makes it quite intriguing upon first investigation. I am a big fan of smoked brews when they are done correctly and this one seems to be spot on for what I enjoy. Nice smoky flavors with a nice kiss of sweetness to keep your palate from getting overwhelmed easily. This made it quite easy to drink and would make it easy to drink in large quantities at a cookout. An absolute must try for any fan of the smoke. You won’t regret doing so.","thagr81us","Beers"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint. Pours a orange golden amber with a thin, fine light white head with great persistence and lacing. Light aroma of smoke, smoked meat and faint sweet malt. Flavor starts with nice wood smoke which gradually reveals pleasant biscuit malt and hops. Nice persistant smoky after taste. Great flavor progression and integration. Medium bodied with good creaminess. This is a very nicely made smoked ale. I would definitely return to this if the bomber price point weren't so painful.","LiquidAmber","0"
