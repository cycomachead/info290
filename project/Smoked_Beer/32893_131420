4.07,2,3.5,4,4.25,4,4,"Overall, this has got to be one of the more unique beers we’ve had the pleasure of crossing paths with in a while.  The contrast between the intensely soured lacto and the heavy smokiness, especially through the flavor, made for an incredibly interesting and innovative display.  High acidity meets savory, malty smokiness, and it works.  You get a mix of the best of both worlds, but at the same time, it is easy to see why it might not appeal to some.  Avoid this if you hate sours.  Avoid it if you don’t like smoke in your beer’s flavor.  Otherwise, if you’re adventurous with your beverages, try it, and let this guy get to room temperature for the full effect.  This is our first brush with a Grimm ale, and we can safely say that it has piqued our interest for the brewery.","TheBrewo","Jan 23, 2015"

Uniqueness notwithstanding, this is delicious, quenching and delightfully effervescent. Action/Adventure is indeed something to get excited about. This blockbuster of a beer is without doubt one of the most simultaneously interesting and fantastic offerings of recent memory.","biegaman","Dec 29, 2014"

My research lead me to be intrigued by its Old World charm, and the possibilities of a smoked sour.  Hopefully some other version of this elusive "style" will prove my imagination lives up to the intrigue.","SLeffler27","Oct 24, 2014"

3.75,-6,,,,,,"This beer is in the vein of a smoky berliner weisse (or as they claim a Lichtenhainer which must be a similar German style). It's good but the combination of sweet apple flavors and the heaviness throws everything out of balance. For what its worth I like the way the smoke is integrated.","brianmandell","Sep 19, 2014"
