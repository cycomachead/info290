No reflexes even when put in front of a lightbulb... Smells like smoked bacon, hiding black olives, some medicinal notes, and dark caramel. Tastes like it smells with slightly bitter and long aftertaste, where the smokiness is rising up again at the very finish. The carbonation is moderate and the mouthfeel is quite syrupy, in a pleasant way. Never had one of this style before, but overall quite an interesting experience, though also a bit awkward!","RickyS","Jan 16, 2015"
4.19,7.7,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pours a healthy two finger head of dark tan foam, delicate in appearance, almost all microfoam with a mottled surface. The liquid is a rich brown hue, opaque although you can see a great deal of hyperactive tiny bubbles rushing towards the surface. The nose is as advertised, huge smokiness, peaty with a saline quality as well as gaminess, old school plastic band-aids, there are some chocolaty notes, all of the above wipes out any fruit which might be there, general pungency lasts for some time. Medium-bodied, creamier texture than expected, the smokiness prevents excess sweetness from building and also aids in gluing it to your palate. Charred campfire wood, grill fat, tar, more peat than straight-up earthiness. The carbonation is as strong as the visuals suggest, this helping to relieve some monotony. More chocolate, caramel coming though here. Perhaps moments of plum and, oddly, apricot. Releases well and does not force itself on you, for its category not heavy handed. Given its relative intensity and higher alcohol, this is one I could drink more than one in a single sitting.","farrago","Dec 08, 2014"

The aroma has a lot more smoke than expected. Otherwise, there's a rich caramel/molasses malt sweetness with some chocolate and oak. A touch of grapes and plums. Smoke is the star, though. Little roast. Lots more smoke in the taste. Pretty similar to the aroma in other respects, as well. Moderately sweet. It's a bit meaty with some dark malt fruitiness. Mild bitterness in the finish. Some tannic oakiness dries things out. Mouthfeel isn't quite as full as I'd like for the flavors. It's not thin; it just could use a creamier feel as a backdrop for the flavors. Carbonation is relatively low. Decent beer. Nothing really stands out as particularly good, though. The smoke flavor is nice but kinda takes over. The other flavors are too far in the background.","popery","Apr 19, 2013"

Regardless, this stuff pours a deep, dark sienna topped by a finger of relatively short-lived glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises bacon-y smoke, light Band-Aid, light roasted malts in the background, and a vague sense of molasses The taste really ups the Band-Aid ante with its smoke component, with the dry biscuit ad very light roasted malts unable to do much to assuage my tastebuds. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid (verging on almost-watery) feel. Overall, this beer just didn't work for me. I believe the peated malt just did too much and didn't quite gel with either the beech-smoked malts or the regular malts surrounding it. One thing's for sure: it didn't gel with my sensibilities much...","TMoney2591","Oct 10, 2012"

4.12,5.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a deep maple with a shade of grey beneath a slightly off white creamy head. The most prominent aroma of course is the leathery-smoke quality which overwhelms your senses in the best way possible. Notes of creamy milk chocolate & caramel along with some oak as well. Although the smoke is the main player in flavor as well, the darker malt flavors are initially much more pronounced; not quite rich, but it does add some depth to this ale. Hints of apple and grape, precede a slightly dry finish with more leather in the aftertaste. Full bodied The texture certainly distinguishes this one from a lagered Rauchbier; much fuller and rounded. A really nice smoked ale that I would recommend, especially on tap on account of its added smoothness.","NEhophead","Oct 05, 2012"

4.03,3.6,2.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a 330ml bottle. This bottle produced a ridiculous amount of thick beige head no matter how carefully it was poured. That said, it really provided quite a whiff of the smokey goodness. There's lots of sweet bacon & leather on the nose. It's oddly enticing. The taste, however, is unbelievable. Doesn't seem like it would work, but the dark fruits, chocolate and smoke flavours are balanced and integrated with a lovely bit of sweetness that is gently knocked on the head by the bitter finish. So complex and interesting, even if you're not a fan of smoked beers.","CookstLiquor","May 17, 2012"

Copious, rocky head.Piney aromas, cask wood hues & slightly chocolate fragancy. Gentle smoky touch at first sip. Sweet toasted malts & dark fruit notes. Burnt fudge chocolate hints. Silky & bitter palate. Hoppiness in the middle shows a no bothering oily flavor while lingers into the finish. Medium body, soft carbonation. Smoke & cask wood on the aftertaste. Incredible well balanced & voluptuous flavors. ABV is just a gentle warming sensation masked inside a flavorful beer. Once again De Molen is a winning horse.","GONZALOYANNA","May 16, 2012"
