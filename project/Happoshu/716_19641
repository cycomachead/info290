3.43,20.8,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation that is quite fizzy straight out the gate but tapers off pretty quickly. For more than 5% abv, it works. I am not saying this is a great beer by any means but it is fitting for what it is. I could see myself sitting down and drinking a few of these with the appropriate Japanese food pairing.","stakem","Nov 15, 2011"

2.8,-1.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is a bit on the higher side. Drinkability isn't bad actually. I drank this one after a day of working on the house and it went down pretty easy. It didn't really have a lot of flavor or range though so it's not something I'd personally choose to drink much of. Not any worse then the American macros though and pretty comparable.","billab914","Dec 03, 2010"
3,5.6,3,3,2.5,3,4,"The beer is a clear straw yellow color with a thick white head and a little small amount of lacing. Smells of corn, grain, and a little malty sweetness. Has that unmistakable American adjunct lager flavor. Tastes of corn, grains, and a little malt sweetness and a small amount of hop bitterness. The beer has a thin water mouthfeel and tons of carbonation. Drinkability is average.","TheKingofWichita","Nov 30, 2010"
2.59,-8.8,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"D: This was my second happoshu. Again, I was thrilled at the opportunity to indulge in this very elusive beer style. While it was very cool from an experience standpoint, the beer itself wasn't that enjoyable.","Huhzubendah","Nov 30, 2010"
3.19,12.3,4,2.5,3.5,1.5,4,"Thanks to Alex via someone for this style tick. Alex keeps feeding the beast...A sexy can served in my Darkness glass...Pours a super clear medium gold with about three fingers of head. The head just looks weak, watery and whispy but it actually hangs for a bit and has surprisingly full lacing...A medium skunk aroma, rice, alcohol. At first its pretty offensive but settles down...The taste is light, a little grain, almost no flavor. Like drinking a glass of water that had a drop of beer dumped in as flavoring. It doesn't taste bad or offend me like a bad macro...The feel is really bad, worse than water...Easy to drink, like a glass of water. But if I wanted something that light I'd just drink a glass of water...","jrallen34","Nov 28, 2010"
1.86,-34.5,4,3,1,2,1.5,"The taste is loads of rice along with some cooked vegetables. The mouthfeel is light with decent carbonation. This is pretty gross and near undrinkable. I might say that this style may be worse than American Light Lager if the two I've had are at all representative of the style.","Thorpe429","Nov 28, 2010"
3.13,10.2,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Beer is thin and watery with a decently clean finish, it tastes like a really really light pilsner. overall its just OK. Better than the other one I had for sure.","drabmuh","Nov 28, 2010"
3.1,9.2,3,3,3,3,3.5,"And the boot experience comes to an end. The brew sits in the boot, creating the appearance of a pale workboot topped by a thick white sock. The nose comprises light corn syrup and rice. Not really anything else in there, if you ask me. The taste is more of the same, though with a bit less sweetness from the corn syrup. The body is rather light, with a light carbonation, a watery feel, and a slightly dry finish. Overall, another easily drinkable happoshu, but the touch of dryness at the end puts this one slightly below the Tanrei.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2010"
2.36,-16.9,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"This beer looks a pale golden straw color with a frothy white head. The smell is of rice and a sourish, adjunct funk. The flavor is mainly of the rice hulls that were used in the production of this beer. I didn't know they could be entirely made into a beer but this is that beer. It's pretty adjuct-like all around, so it's hard really to like this beer. It's the better of the 2 that I was provided, but it really wasn't too pleasant of a drinking experience. This almost seemed skunky, which coming from a can makes you just begin to wonder what was put into this beer. This drinks not all that great, but you can get used to it. If you want to tick it, go for it. If you were just curious about it, stay away from Happoshus.","Vdubb86","Nov 23, 2010"
2.36,-16.9,3,2,2,3,3,"Not a big fan of this happoshu really, but I appreciate the tick.","nickd717","Mar 31, 2009"
2.68,-5.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Thanks, Nick. Pale clear yellow with a thin head that retains poorly. Mild aroma, pale malt and rice; sweet and clean. Palate is malty, clean, mildly astringent. Some adjunct-y sweetness in the finish. Light and quaffable, not a particularly bad brew.","largadeer","Feb 17, 2007"

3.4,19.7,3,3,3.5,3,4,"my first taste really surprised me. this tastes more like a real beer than a happoshu. initially it seemed extremely hoppy and bitter for the style, but as i finish the can i start to doubt my first impression. it could be that i really haven't had any happoshus lately - other than a review for namashibori - and this one just seems to have much more flavor. anyway, it's really not bad at all, i'll say good for drinkability, i will revisit this one some time.","davidchollar","Beers"
2.77,-2.5,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Taste misses body and is very clean but pale. Not much malt, not much bitterness, litle alcoholic and some ricetaste aswell as a litle whipped cream taste. Good carbonisation that's quiet high makes it even more watery. Drinkable, certainly on a warm day but don't expect lots of taste.","paterlodie","0"
3.2,12.7,3,3,3.5,3,3,"D - This was a decent quaffing beer, not to be saught out but something for a hot day.","Naerhu","0"
