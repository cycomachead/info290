3.12,0,3.25,3,3.25,3,3,"O boy, another new beer to try here in Tokyo. Poured from a 11.2 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by malts. Taste is malty, slightly sweet, refreshing and easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while nothing special, is a servicable beer.","tone77","Jan 11, 2012"

2.95,-5.4,2.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Well, this seems very much like a pretty plain, inoffensive lager, and quite easy to put back, which I suppose is the whole point. If the malt bill is that much lower than actual beer, I'd be curious to know what all those much thinner, skunkier 'real' beers out there have going on under the hood.","biboergosum","0"
