1.18,-40.1,2,1.5,1,1,1,"drinkability is pretty bad. having trouble getting through my half of the can. no depth. no balance. no redeeming qualities. more offensive than water and about as interesting.","grub","Jul 25, 2009"
1.47,-25.4,1,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Pours a crystal clear greenish tinged yellow, almost like pond scum mixed with urine, thin bubbly white head forms, instantly settles to nothing, few bubbles come up. Smell is pretty vile, very sweet and corny, rice, light floral, grassy, apple cider, weird beany aroma, don't know whats going on here. Taste is like a lightly flavoured water beverage, lightly sweet and sugary, grassy, lightly fruity, really weird, rice, I think my tongue is going numb. Mouthfeel is very weak, light bodied, sparkling carbonation. Not sure why anyone would drink this, but worth the experience! Thanks Robbo!","Viggo","Nov 11, 2005"

Whatever "neo-alcohol culture" Sapporo claims this "nationwide hot-selling product" to have created I don't really care to be part of it. That said, I was happy to be able to check it out. A huge 'domo arigato' to Bobsy!","biegaman","Apr 21, 2005"

1.86,-5.6,2,1,2,3,2,"Overall, it's an extremely boring "beer" with nothing to recommend it. It's fine if you want a thirst-quencher with alcohol in it, and have no money to get anything better. It's cheap. I'll give it that.","thesilverhand","May 20, 2004"
