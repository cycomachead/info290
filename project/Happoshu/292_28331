3.17,3.9,2.5,3,3,3,4,"Golden colour with a rapidly diminishing white head. Sweet malty aroma, with a touch of metal. Taste is a bit mild and bland, but perhaps par for the course for a happoshu. Malty sweetness more or less balanced by the leafy hops. Fairly soft and crisp. Light body and medium-high carbonation. Passable for the style, but I slightly prefer the Enjuko Kuro.","bobsy","Feb 06, 2008"

1.72,-43.6,3,1,2,2,1.5,"This one poured dark with little head and no retention or lacing. The smell was very influenced by the can, tinny and sulfurous. In terms of flavor, tin was the first flavor on the palate, too, and a weak barley flavor comes out last. My drinking partner agreed that it tasted like antique shops smell. You couldn't chug this beer, and since it's happoshu and it doesn't as good as some others, I'm not sure what to do with this one.","saztheorybook","Sep 25, 2006"
3.6,18,3,3,4,3,4,"The taste is pretty well-rounded, with a medium mouthfeel and finish. I give it 4s only for style of course. It's really not bad. In fact, it reminds me of it's great uncle, Kirin Lager! And that is all you can expect from this beer-like beverage. Cheaper than Japanese beer, with a higher abv, it's the obvious choice to go along with chu-hi for a cheep buzz. And it has a dark brother to add a little variety to your swilling!","davidchollar","Jul 20, 2006"
2.41,-21,3.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Drinkability: Not bad, but not good. Comes pretty close to tasting like an actual beer, but like most happoshu, it's got just a few too many off flavors that keep me from really wanting more.","soulgrowl","Feb 16, 2006"
3.95,29.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This is sort of like a filtered american-style wheat beer. Gotta be the happoshu of choice at the moment. It is a bit pricier than others however, pretty much exactly in between the price of beer and happoshu.","donnebaby","Beers"
