2.48,0,,,,,,"I knew I had tried this style before but forgot which one until I saw this and even had a picture to along with it, they sold six packs of this stuff at the local grocery store I believe, one of the weirder beers I had over there, probably will never drink again but not too worried about it, probably better examples of this style but who knows","Floydster","Mar 08, 2006"
2.13,0,,,,,,"Smells like nothing, which is positive for the style. Taste is mildly sweet and impressively neutral with a touch of something chemical-like and artificial in the aftertaste, which seems to be unavoidable in these no-malt brews. Ug. Wildly overcarbonated.","donnebaby","Feb 23, 2006"
