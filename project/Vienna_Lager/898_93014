Drinkability was good, the beer was gone quickly, and I suspect one could slide several of these down in short order. Overall, a solid, if unspectacular, example of the style. Worth trying if you see it.","beertunes","Jan 03, 2015"

I like this brewery and the bulk of their lineup is at least respectable and more often pretty damn good. Cutlass, I happen to think, is fantastic.
