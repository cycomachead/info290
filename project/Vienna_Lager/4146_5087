On it's own, it doesn't ask for much, which is why whoever drinks it wouldn't have to as well. After being a fan of Karl Strauss's Tower 10 IPA, and being spoiled with Anchor Steam beer, this slightly underwhelms overall - especially if this is their flagship beer.

It's funny that the reviews are sort of all over the place (kinda sounds like the LAX bar needs to clean their tap lines). This is a clean, somewhat sweet lager. It's a nice, clear amber with a dissipating white head that manages to hang on with a very tight white cap after a minute. The aroma is mostly doughy malt sweetness. There's a faint hint of herbal hops, but it's just a low abv amber lager with its roots in German brewing. It lacks any real depth of malt flavor. The flavor is vaguely sweet and fairly clean. It's nice to have a <4.5% abv beer, but this one wants for flavor. Mouthfeel is inoffensive, though the carbonation seems oddly low. Ok beer.","popery","Apr 26, 2010"

Smells too sweet, with caramel malt dominating. Tastes better, with a touch of hop spice and dark bready flavors. The finish is dominated by the diacetyl, which I think is okay for the style, but it's not syrupy like most beers with high diacetyl. The lagering leaves it fairly light bodied for its malty flavor. I think this is one of the most sessionable malty beers I've had of late, and if I lived out here, I could see buying a sixer of this for some sweet summertime suds.","jbsteiny","Aug 04, 2008"

The taste is awesome for a lager. I could drink these all day. Very, very well done. A little bit of roasted character with sweetness and subtle malt presence. Very little hops, which is great, because something this sessionable doesn't need to be bitter. The mouthfeel is above average, and in fact fairly heavy. But the drinkability blows this out of the water. Absolutely perfect, everyone should try this when their in the San Diego area! Very well done. Strauss has a new follower!

3.73,12,3.5,3,3.5,4,5,"Not the greatest beer in the world, but on a warm summer day, this makes a wonderful "lawnmower" brew. If you crossed a Yeungling with a Fat Tire, that's what this beer is.","Domingo","Dec 10, 2005"
2.98,-10.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Pretty easy to drink if you don't mind the sweetness, too many other beers I'd much rather drink. The Amber Lager fresh at the brewery is another story.","scottoale","Oct 09, 2005"
3.23,-3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"During a recent visit to San Diego, I had this brew on tap in a Gaslamp area restaurant. I found it to be an enjoyable, flavorful, if ordinary brew. Its a deep golden color, with only a shadow of amber, and a modest white head. The aroma is a well proportioned mix of malt and hop, of medium intensity. Theres a little grain and notable caramel. The taste is mildly sweet, with a slant toward maltiness. Its certainly not outstanding, but it went well with dinner and left me satisfied.","Suds","Jul 20, 2005"

2.9,-12.9,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"After drinking this beer, I now know why all the other reviews for Amber Lager were so short; there's just nothing remarkable one way or another about this beer. It'd be a good beer to have around for non-BA friends, and as an all-malt lager, it's certainly several steps above the macro lagers...but other than that, there's no real reason to ever try one.","swid","Jul 19, 2004"
3.1,-6.9,3,3,3,3,3.5,"A very ho-hum brew IMHO, nice copper look but a weak head which dissipated quickly, smell was quite faint(although I did drink it in a restaurant, which impedes the nose), the taste profile was true to type but had a definite "watered down" taste and most noticably, mouthfeel, cannot stand head to head with SA, which unfortunately for Strauss is it's direct competitor. Easy guzzler on a hot day though.","surfmeister","Dec 08, 2003"

3,-9.9,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer as it sat in my $6.00 plastic cup at the airport was a translucent deep amber color with a rather thin off white head that was bubbly in texture, and the lace a micro thin sheet to not quite seal the glass. Nose was mostly malt with a hint of citrus, start sweet and nicely malted with the top light to middling in feel. Finish was stingingly acidic, the hops apropos to the style and the aftertaste dry and long lasting, a drinkable beer, but certainly nothing to get excited about.","Gusler","Jun 29, 2003"
3.26,-2.1,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Medium gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Mild malts and hops. Mild flavor, good balance of hops and malts. Slight taste of roasted malts, very subtle. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly malty, no bitterness.","beerguy101","May 17, 2003"
3.48,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"A solid lager that has a good look and good taste. The amber color is joined by a decent off-white head that comes up full and lingers a short while. The lacing is OK if not impressive. Malty caramel nose also gives slight hints of hops for the balance that results. Full bodied and tasty palate. Mild aftertaste that leaves a bit of a bready sense. Smooth and even feel. Very drinkable lager.","AtLagerHeads","Sep 26, 2002"
3.36,0.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a decent beer, but not what I expected. It poured a nice amber color with a small head that fizzled away quickly. The smell kind of reminded me of Coors, which did not get me too excited about taking a drink. But lo and behold the taste was not that bad at all. This beer had kind of a strange carlmel-y flavor to it that was pretty drinkable, along with a kind of floral taste that went down very easy. Although this is not a beer that I would buy instead of, say, Stone Pale Ale or Sierra Nevada Pale Ale as a session beer, these would go down pretty well if it came down to it. A very respectable brew.","Dmann","Beers"
2.95,-11.4,2.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Karl Strauss Amber lager: Deep brown beer (no head no lace, but that was solely due to the publican’s giving me every drop for $$’s).  Strong malt aroma, reminds me of Milwaukee as a kid.  Initial taste was very sweet, almost unpleasant.  Improved significantly as it warmed, with a very pronounced bread/cracker malt sweetness, barely balanced by mild hops.  Not bad.","jackndan","0"
