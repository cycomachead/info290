2.57,-9.5,3,2.25,2.5,3.5,2.5,"I was sitting in a Mexican grocery, eating a tripe and tongue taco and noticed this in the cooler. I figured I would enhance the experience by drinking a "real" Mexican beer. No glass to serve it in, I drank it straight from the 32 ounce bottle, hence the higher score in appearance. The nose and flavor is straight rice with a hint of barley graininess. After I poured a little lime juice in it, the flavor did improve but the base beer is poor and weak. It served the purpose as its light character helped to extinguish the habenero spiciness but I wouldn't bother to drink it again.","KYGunner","Apr 15, 2014"
3.44,21.1,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a golden yellow in color and is darker than they regular 'Corona Extra' that you see all the time. Has a good 1-finger white head that settles down quickly to just around the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen but not a lot. The aroma is typical of a Mexican beer with just some grains and hops. Nothing that stands out really. Tastes pretty much like a regular "Corona Extra' with a higher alcohol content with a sweeter slightly dry finish. Overall all is was OK.","BeerWithMike","Apr 12, 2014"

3.13,10.2,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.75,"There is some debate about the difference between Corona Extra and Familiar so I had to try a bottle. Although it does taste fresher, it does not taste like a Vienna style lager and the brown bottle could impact the flavor. The label did state 6% abv, but according to the local distributor website, Origlio Beverage, Familiar is 4.6% abv, the same as Extra packaged in a larger bottle (http://www.origlio.com/crown.php). Since I am an organic chemist with access to analytical techniques I checked it out in the lab and found it is in fact a little less than 5% abv, not 6% as listed on the bottle and here at BA. Thus it is most likely the same product as Corona Extra. In any case it does taste fresher than Extra but comes at a price higher than I am willing to shell out for a beer of this level of flavor. I will likely never buy it again.","wattoclone","Jun 08, 2013"
