There's a bit of grassy hops in the initial taste balanced with bread, caramel and grain malt flavors. Finishes dry with a mild lingering grassy bitterness.","Karibourgeois","Aug 24, 2014"

4.76,35.6,4.75,4.25,5,5,4.75,"Overall: Simply, WOW. I've never had a beer like this, and I want more and more. It's a terribly wonderful complex mix of flavors I've not had elsewhere. Though it's only got 25 IBU, I think the Noble hops here shine enough to keep the tartness noticeable and a wonderful counterpoint to the sweet caramel, but then there's a roasted, bbq-ed something in there that is lovely and hits the nerve endings that crave salt and umami. The mouthfeel is also a lovely contradiction of sensations: thick creamy loveliness with crisp dry tartness. The mouth can concentrate on one flavor, one mouthfeel, and then the other, then the next, and keep going back and forth into a focused point where they all become one unique flavor. This is a really unique, WOW beer. I haven't ever had anything like this and I absolutely love this beer. And it certainly feels like a beer that's got a lot more alcohol than it says on the label, by which I mean it feels like a Doppelbock or 6% Märzen. It veers into Märzen beer territory, then becomes a liquid bbq, then a Pils in it's tartness, and then back, and then whisky notes. Again, WOWOW beer, and a 4.8 of 5. I certainly didn't expect this beer to knock my beer-wow-meter off kilter, and I'm so happy it did.","boddhitree","May 27, 2014"

It isn’t outstanding, but I predict most everyone who tries it will find it worthy of a second bottle.","BryanCarey","Jun 29, 2013"

Hops are still pretty non-existent but there is a light drying bitterness on the finish, a little leafy even. Its a fairly good lager, one I would be happy to order on tap at a restaurant, but it really doesnt do a whole lot to distinguish itself from the pack of vienna lagers. If I had the choice Id rather grab a Penn pilsner, Firebrick or Elliot Ness.","twiggamortis420","Oct 31, 2012"
