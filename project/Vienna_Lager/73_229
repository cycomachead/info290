4.12,1,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Overall: Iv said it before and ill say it again. Great Lakes makes some of the best lagers i have had from this country. I think a lot craft beer enthusiasts get lost in the double and imperial beers and cant appreciate a well crafted lager. For what this is, its pretty amazing and the benchmark for an amber lager in my opinion. Great balance between malts and hops, yet light enough so you know its a lager. Along with Dortmunder Gold, this is my go to lawn mowing, bbq lager of choice. That's all folks","Bone53","Sunday at 07:25 PM"

Perfectly satisfying interplay between malt and hops with a slight tilt toward malt.  It's a solid, reliable favorite that I will return to again and again.

Quite boozy for the style at 6.2% ABV - and it can be felt as the beer is much heavier than say Boston Lager. As far as this style goes, I wish this one was lightened up a little bit. All in all it is a fantastic unique beer. Cheers!","CIBoy10","Mar 27, 2015"

This is sweet and candied and has a super nice perfume like finish...which is amazing! I forgot how good this beer is and how nice it is to step out of the IPA haze and appreciate a style that is different but equally satisfying. This is more malty and is not very bitter.

The hop settles down as the caramel malt and sweetness predominate. Perhaps this should be a new style: "Americanized Vienna Lager". There is also a bitter hop note in the finish but overall an excellent example of the style. As a fan of Negra Modelo and Dos Equis I had to try this based on the glowing reviews here at BA.","wattoclone","Feb 07, 2015"

Against a fading bitterness, a nice spicy hop character emerges that is a bit tart, a bit clove like and has a pepper aspect - outstanding.  The finish is a bit dry, but also has a sweet biscuit component.

I finally decided to review it (after reviewing 100 other beers).  This is a great gateway beer for BMC drinkers.  It has some added depth and complexity while not being "scary".  The flavor profile is nice and the body, and lack of presense of the alcohol, make it a great lawn mower beer.","fscottkey","Oct 13, 2014"

Sweet toasted caramel malt flavors up front with toffee and herbal hop notes into the middle. Tangy, earthy, crisp hop flavor through the middle that transitions back to sweet caramel and toasted malt. Finished cleanly with a bready, very sweeytoasted malt aftertaste.

3.91,-4.2,4,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured into a pint glass, this is a walnut-colored beer, which developed a good half-inch of persistent foam on top. Good malt aroma--rather bread-crusty with a caramel hint. I expected more malt in the taste--it's there, but the moderately high bitterness cuts into it a bit. Not much hop flavor, and it's very clean, yeast-wise. A quite drinkable beer, but the taste isn't all that interesting.","allengarvin","Jul 31, 2014"

The taste is equally rich, with nice caramel malt flavors and just a hint of hops on the finish. It has a great mouthfeel and is all around a top notch amber lager.","delta490","Mar 26, 2014"

Looks fantastic. Aromas of rich caramel and nut, blended and balanced very well. Roasted notes throughout. Flavors are roast forward, with nut and toffee all over the forward tongue. Subtle hops bitterness in the tail end of the palate, with an overall tangy sweet feel. The aftertaste is roasted and tangy sweet, with highlights of sugary caramel. Smooth, light, and slightly crisp body, with a slight cloying linger in an otherwise clean finish. Great beer.","GarthDanielson","Nov 28, 2013"

The sweetness is a little more noticeable than when I tried this on draft, but I didn't check the bottled on date either. I like this beer a lot it is perfect for a single beer to sip or for pairing with food a very good representation of the style with plenty of flavor.","Slatetank","Oct 03, 2013"

This is a beer that I could enjoy any time of the year and it would seem perfectly fitting. To be honest, I can enjoy any beer any time of the year, but this one would seem appropriate in each location and season. It is light in flavor yet rich at the same time. Chewy yet would be very easy on someone who doesn't like a heavy and viscous brew. I tend to lean towards a hoppier beer for everyday drinking (APA, A-IPA and E-IPA) and I also drink a lot of stouts and porters, but this a great lager. I hold this beer on the same pedestal as I would place Victory Prima Pils...another near perfect brew.","jifigz","Aug 12, 2013"

Quality is the key word here. Where i live you can find this in just about every store that sells beer, huge plus. It's also as reasonably priced as craft beer gets at around 8 bucks a sixer.

Nose is outrageous. Lager nose, good malt, bread, grain, sweet toffee. Lightly sugary. Hops are floral elegance with hints of strawberry that remind one of sunshine. Grass, apple and faint spice. Taste is heaven. Really good bread and a deep but light sweetness. Fruits and pale malts dancing with one another on the palate. Hops take the finish with just the right amount of earth, bitter and oil plus a delightful touch of honey for a luxurious aftertaste. Nectar. Carbonation is medium, mouthfeel is thin. It drank simply and light. Honestly one of the best beers I have ever had.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of malt and fruity notes with good complexity; good strength as well. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruit, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a bit. Great balance of malt, hops, and fruity ester flavors; with a nice amount of robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Vienna lager! Great balance of malt and fruity ester flavors with good robustness; and very easy to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 14, 2013"

My girlfriend said it after taking a sip, and I was amazed, because that same description was in my head the instant I tried it. It tastes like a combination of watered-down whiskey and cardboard. I hope something was wrong with the tap at that place, because it's hard to believe this is the beer that's getting such excellent reviews. The color seems to match though - a dark amber.

The clarity of this beer's appearance allows one to see the constant effervescence. The aroma is clean and crisp with bready notes. There might also be a hint of fruitiness, but the doughy bread is the overwhelming scent. The first sip reveals the rich biscuity caramel notes in addition to the breadiness. The malty notes are balanced with just a hint of bitter hops and there is a lingering boozy alcohol taste at the end. The mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied with a mild carbonation. It finishes clean with no stickiness. Although Vienna Lagers are not among my favorite styles of beer, this is a great example of one. It is very flavorful and well balanced. I wish I could get this one more frequently.","Levich","Jan 01, 2013"

Tastes malty with brown & crystal malts and again with light notes of chocolate at the end. Feels medium and nice assertive bitterness at the front & back end of the malts. Hops don't lend themselves noticeable aroma or flavor, assuming hops were mostly for bittering or they just plain faded in this bottle. Overall, a very well designed & executed beer.

This is even MORE enjoyable to me considering I've had a lot of super hoppy beers/IPAs recently. It's nice to have something a bit malty after so much of that. All-in-all, a great beer. Some may be turned off by its sweetness, but that's what I think I love about this beer. The sweetness and bitterness just works very well.

The flavor is much more potent, with big notes of fruity, sweet, and nutty malts being balanced by a dull, musty, earthy character. These flavors are bold and complex at first, but the flavor becomes muddier as the beer opens up, with just a bit of an uncomfortable astringency and an alcohol burn (either that or this beer just pairs miserably with goldfish crackers). The texture is a bit resinous and almost syrupy, which is less desirable than the crisp, clean character that is the hallmark of most lagers, but it goes down fine. Overall, this rich, flavorful lager has some flaws, but I still wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.","devilben02","Jun 13, 2012"

Smells sweet and malty with caramel and toffee right up front, giving way to floral notes with a hint of licorice. Full bodied for a lager. Starts a bit thin but then warms up into a medium mouth feel. Sweet up front giving way to malt complexity and perhaps some spices, such as all spice or coriander, which stays on the palette long after the sip has been swallowed. No bitterness in the finish. Extremely well-balanced. Hits every sense a beer is supposed to.","bigkingken","Mar 12, 2012"

Crisp herbal hop character in the nose along with fresh cracked two-row sweetness and the Vienna toasty caramel. Flavor carries a lot of the malt from the nose. The sweet caramel and rich, lightly toasty malts are smooth and clean. Finishes with herbal hops that have a subtle earthy twist. The toasty grains also carry to the finish melding well with the hop character. Smooth and clean body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Extremely pleased the offerings I have been able to sample from this brewery.","DrinkingDrake","Nov 07, 2011"

Slight orange tinted in color, and once it settles it leaves a good solid quarter inch and little bits of lace behind. Aroma has that yummy Vienna lager grainy, chewy, caramelly scent that I always like. Light Czech. hops add a refreshing edge to it. Taste is smooth with toasty, roasty and nutty grains and carbonation is fine and prickly. Nice balance between bitter and flavor/aroma hops too. Mouthfeel is sliiightly chewy and mostly slick with a touch of grainy texture. Nice array of textures. Overall I like this. I would be happy to have several more...great session beer.","tastybeer","Jul 15, 2011"

3.68,-9.8,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"I definitely like this better than the Dortmund which is not to say the Dortmunder is not a very good beer. I like the maltiness that comes through on the Ness. I know that this beer is often compared to Sam Adams Boston Lager. I drink Boston Lager by the yard but I think this might be a little better.

Sweet caramel malt really stands out in the nose. Lots of sugar and a small amount of hops also come through. Taste is mainly sweet malt. Reminds me a lot of an overly sugary fruit punch.

4.48,9.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Ah, pours a clean brownish red, with a 2 finger head that lays on top of the glass and almost looks like cream as it slimes to the side walls. This fuckers got a big lager scent with a note of spice. Caramel malts, bready, alcohol, cloves, ginger, and a wiff of bittering hops on the end. Sweet and smooth caramel on the tongue, again with the breadiness, nuts and whole grains. Sweet throughout the whole sip until the end, then the hops come into play and give a big biterness on the finish that would otherwise go unoticed. Hearty but not too much, about a medium feel, maybe a light to some, medium carbonation that tickles the tongue, and dry on the finish, pairs fantastic with a big dead animal on your plate. What can i say? Great Lakes cant lose, and this is a home run, cheers!","gabedivision","May 05, 2011"
4.8,17.6,5,5,4.5,5,5,"Final note: Unfortunately I can't give this 5's across the board due to the slightly unbalanced flavor profile, which might benefit from a slightly heavier dose of hops. But it's damn close to perfect. Grab this whenever you see it available.","DrewV","May 05, 2011"

3.76,-7.8,4,3,4,4,4,"Draft to imperial pint glass. Looks good, amber with malty expectations. Smell is its weakest asset. It's almost nonexistent. Tastes good; malty, yet crisp. Goes down nicely.

This isn't a bad beer, and as far as lagers go it is everything I'm looking for. Pours smooth, amber color with white head, sweet flavor and clean finish...and when it was done I ordered something more exciting...Burning River. I would say this is a good transition beer when you're going from one style to the other: like going from porter to ipa? I like Great Lakes as a brewery and I'm really impressed with the diversity of the styles they release and the quality of each beer I've tried. Some of those styles, like american pale ale, I point to Great Lakes as a gold standard example (Burning River). So its hard to get worked up over Eliot Ness because Great Lakes has so many other beers that are better.","alexkeil","Mar 20, 2011"

Let's see if my tastebuds have evolved since then. This stuff pours a clear copper-amber topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, and some very mild and light orange zest. The taste brings the orange forward, mostly in terms of the peel, with the caramel and toffee coming in later. In the end, though, is a short but sharp stab of harsh bitterness. This is probably what turned my buddy and me off so long ago, and not much has changed (though my reaction now is decidedly less vitriolic). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry-ish finish. Overall, an okay brew, but not something I really wanna go for again.","TMoney2591","Mar 14, 2011"

There's a tinge of alcohol on the nose as well, but not enough to detract from the main aromas.

Medium-bodied with a fine, if active, carbonation which gently prickles the tongue. Has much more of a mineral water, spritzy feel to it and the metallic flavors fit in better with the fizz to back it up. Sourdough and grains, pepper, orange citrus, emphasis on hoppiness until near the end where caramel, brown sugar, honey calm the nerve endings.

Having some family out in Columbus definitely creates some anticipation on family visits, to say the least. A soft, dark-honey pour with unexpected bubbly carbonation that led to a minimal head with just slight lace retention. A sweet hoppy malt with mild hints of nuts was apparent both in the aroma as well as in the tasting. A good, decent ale that could lead to many more.

The taste is beautifully balanced, being both malty and rich up front, but dry and with a crackery finish. Great for the style. Rich in the mouth but finishes crisp.

Upon first smell I get tons of the malt scent hitting upfront with the earthy hops coming into play right behind it. I normally don't think of a beer style like this having this nice of a nose on it. As the beer warmed I got more scents of sweet caramel with toasted grains. The flavor profile is a perfect match when compared to the nose. The toasted grain comes through first with a bit of caramel sweetness to it as well and ends with a slight touch of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth with great balance and the medium carbonation. The drinkable is very good on this offering and I would like to replace some IPA's in my rotation with this beer.","TheodorHerzl","Jun 13, 2008"

Sadly someone down state decided to turn him in for selling beer above the 6% alcohol law that are fucked laws here in the DUB VEE endorse. Yes a beer at 6.2% alcohol by volume has been off the shelves for a couple years now, due to some asshole in my state. Now that I got to vent, here goes Eliot Ness ruby caramel vibrant bright crystal clear body with a large beige head forming thick in my 1/2 liter mug lacing is even and simply clings to the sides of my glass. Aroma here has it all with roasted nuts toffee/caramel slightly burnt brown sugar flow going on with spicy German hops a flowing in the background. Also a mild air of citrus peel floats around what a great spicy hop profile, thank god I'm living in Ohio at least alcohol laws are in check. Now I have to start convincing stores to carry a selection and get Cavalier Distributing involved in this region of the state. Flavor has a pronounced funky hop flow with spicy herbal edges and tangy citrus peels flowing with mildly bitter darker roasted malts bringing out a touch of dark chocolate melted over one of your favorite toffee or caramel filled candy bar think Heath sans as much chocolate. Mouthfeel is so nice carbonation is perfect creamy layers divide on the palate with slick hop oils also gracing my palate overall beautifully crafted medium bodied micro brewed beer at it's best. Drinkability is butter, it caresses you.

Mouthfeel is good - some decent carbonation melds well with the malty creaminess. This is an easy drinking/great tasting beer.

The hops have a nice, though subtle, contribution here that is lightly spicy, every so slightly herbal and a nice balancing bitterness in the finish. As the beer warms up the sweetness picks up a bit, at times it becomes a bit too much. Most of the time it is held in check by the hopping levels and the under-current of dry maltiness; like notes of biscuits and lightly toasted malt. This beer certainly blows most examples of the style out of the water, but I can't help but think that this would be that much better if it had not finished a little bit drier; it would be a bit more in balance and all that much more quaffable.","Gueuzedude","Nov 22, 2005"

Big Vienna malt taste that is biscuity, bold and aggressive; astringency from the malt complements the botanical finish of the hops. Toasty as opposed to roasty in the malt. Decent carbonation keeps it burpy and drinkable. A mighty fine lager.

The nose has that typical Lager cleanliness to it, no complains as it is appropriate for the style, behind this feature are notes of toasted caramel-grain and nuts, a faded hint of hay, there also seems to be a kiss of hops spice. The potency is small but workable, the aromas are inviting. The first sip of this beer sold me on its merits, the palate was well blended with toasty caramel malts, hints of grain, hay, and husk, the maltiness is plenty deep, at the finish is a good bite of hops. The hoppines might be a bit much for a Vienna, maybe. Still they work well in this offering and that is all that is important frankly. The finish is clean with just enough of a suggestion of the beer Ive been quaffing. The body is medium-full and quite impressive in its fullness, the carbonation is moderately low, as a whole the mouthfeel is very pleasing and more noteworthy than most beers. It is tremendously drinkable. Eliot Ness is a great beer, sometimes life can be so simple now I will sit back and savor this dandy. Thank you, PhantomVodoo!","bditty187","Mar 04, 2004"
4.73,15.9,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Solid rust/coppery color with a slight chill haze, medium, softly topped yellowy chicken meat colored head that sits a good while before settling to a favorable skim and thin, speckled curtains of lace sticking as we go. Aroma starts a tad light on the nose with some light toasty grains and bread with just a bit of sweetened fruitiness. As it warms a nice smokey-like dryness of multi whole grains, roasty hazelnuts, and hard caramel appear in the nose making it much nicer and even a bit stronger. Taste is mild but eagerly built with some f*ckin' great malts! One of the best profiles of bready/grains ever encountered, wow! Has an easy start that remains in some mixed maltyness of slight sweetness and light toastyness, but that gains with a gradual presence of uniquely thick seven grain pancake-like, toasty wild rice roundness. Spectacular malts! Perfectly milding light grassy spice and hops poke through. Add in the teriffic finish of smokened grains and malts slightly drying and lifting into the finish with mixed roasty nuttyness. Very intriguing flavors indeed, well put together with a delicately rich and smooth body that keeps convalescing. A true showmanship of the meaning behind hand crafted. Wow, what a recipe, great stuff! Try it and see, you'll be impressed no doubt! Absolutely drinkable to the fullest! My new Vienna/Marzen to keep around at all costs!

Taste has a real nice sweet rich chewy malt flavor that also consists of dark fruit (raisins) and caramel (this seemed evident from the nose). Hallertau hops provide a mildly dry bitter middle.

It definitely had a sweet caramel malt that dominated the flavor but was not overbearing. Soothing tea-like hops came in to balance and add to complexity. More flavors ensued but I could not pick up on what exactly they were, they were good though. The beer's finish tasted exactly like the bread I buy from my local bakery.

Now that I've been smelling this beer, sipping, and enjoying its color there does not appear to be enough to give a proper flavor analysis. I'll open another. Ahhhh!

Caramel malt is the featured flavor here, although some red apple fruitiness and spicy hops linger behind. Mouthfeel is somewhat carbonated, but quite smooth overall. This is a very drinkable beer, and one that I find pairs particularly well with Mexican cuisine.

However, if you like a malty, semi-sweet finishing brew that is slightly heavier than a typical lager and has alot more taste, this one should appeal to you. Personally, I feel it has a lot of carbonation, and it kind of takes away from the overall impression. Not my style, but I can appreciate it for what it is.","steelreign","Jun 26, 2003"

The finish leaves an oaky taste and a hint of the bourbon that came through in the smell. A relatively smooth, medium bodied beer. The drinkability has improved since the first time I had it, although it noticeably drops as the beer warms up.

I liked the flavor a lot but would probably pinch a few more hop flowers into the brew kettle, myself.

The taste is malt dominated with a praline-like sweetness but there's ample hops to provide a crisp, slightly herbal bitter finish.
