3.94,6.8,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours copper in color with a large, pillowy head that diminishes pretty quickly. Great clarity. Toasted malts and caramel in the aroma with some light noble hops cutting through. More toasted malts in the flavor, very rich, but with a good hop bite as well. Finishes dry and super smooth. Medium bodied and clean. A really nice lager from Neshaminy Creek. Pairs well with grilled meats and veggies.","Jacobob10","Mar 14, 2015"

I do get a little spicy hops on the finish that linger with some bitterness.  Actually dries my palate out pretty well on each sip.  The beer goes down very easy and is simple and decent.  No flaws anywhere but not overly complex or bold anywhere either.","sulldaddy","Sep 30, 2014"

Several large whiffs resulted in just a few faint malts. Taste is malts, some sweetness, bready, a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer but nothing special.","tone77","0"

Medium bodied with a pleasantly smooth, delicate feel. Fresh, clean, toasted and caramel malt flavors throughout with earth, herbal flavors emerging through the middle to the end. Finished crisply and cleanly with a pleasant herbal tanginess followed by a sour bread aftertaste. Crisp, clean, drinkable and refreshing. ","IronLover","Jan 10, 2014"
