I get biscuity grain with a good bit of sweet caramel there is also a dose of grassy flowery hops as well.  The caramel and malt are the focus in the taste however a good deal of bitterness is in there as well without much in the way of specific hop flavor that is.  The finish is pretty neutral as the sweet character of the beer is only just surpassed by the bitterness to leave just a slight hop tingle on the tongue.  Overall this is good but maybe not as good as some others in the style.","fank2788","Nov 24, 2014"

4.5,18.7,,,,,,"From bottles dated 07/08/14, part of 'Fall Pack Seasonal Sampler' 12-pack: A pleasantly sweet malty lager with notes of lightly toasted grain and dark honey.  The sweetness is balanced by a crispness and rather mild bitterness from the hops.  If I recall correctly, the hop presence is lighter here than in Great Lakes' Eliot Ness Vienna Lager, which is one of my favourite brews.  A floweriness comes to the fore in the finish.  Carbonation seems nearly perfect, if erring on the low side.  A superb accompaniment to salted pretzels, with potent mustard and cheese.  —Reviewed 26 October 2014","BubbleChamber","Oct 25, 2014"

Hits both the sweet and bitter parts of your tongue in a big way and balanced perfectly.  Starts sweet yet gets a nice buttery and spicy (somewhat) dry finish.

4,5.5,,,,,,"Poured a lovely clear amber body with a thin cap of foamy white head. It looked like a classic Vienna lager, quite nice. Scents of lager yeast, soft, bready malt, rich German malt, and a low Noble hop aroma. A caramel aroma is also present, though it should not be in this style. Overall impression of aroma is of a wonderfully crisp lager that is quite malt forward, though not quite so much as an Oktoberfest. It suffers only from the caramel aroma which is not unpleasant but is untraditional. Flavor begins nicely sweet, with bready malt, biscuit, and a light level of floral Noble hops and a low level of hop bitterness. In the middle low levels of Noble hop flavor and bitterness continue, along with bready, biscuit and slight toasted flavors. Finish is semi-dry with notes of Noble hops with medium-low hop bitterness and hint of toasted malt. Aftertaste is grainy malt and a slight lingering bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice Vienna lager that balances malt and hops quite well. It is malty upfront, but gains a nice Noble hop character in the middle and finish to form a balanced whole. Mouthfeel light bodied, with medium-high carbonation, a smooth and creamy feel and a light crispness on the finish. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderfully true to style Vienna lager. Overall this is a very nice Vienna lager. It has an excellent aroma, if not brought down just a hair by the caramel and a fantastic flavor and mouthfeel. It is wonderfully drinkable and quite pleasant to drink. Recommended.","Auraan","Oct 02, 2014"

The taste brings in more of the same, the relatively mild sweetness of the malt balancing very nicely with the floral, lightly-grassy hops.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish.  Overall, a very strong Vienna lager, one that's far too easy to drink for its own good (or, rather, mine).

Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Incredibly clean in flavors as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Vienna lager! All around great robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 05, 2014"

3.9,2.9,,,,,,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a good example of a Vienna Lager, I don't drink this style too often simply because there isn't a lot of them available to me, but I know enough about this style to be able to pick out a good one and I can tell that this is what a Vienna Lager should be like.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these without getting bored with it and I think it would make for a nice Lager to enjoy during the fall.  What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it had everything that I've come to expect from the style and nothing seemed out of place or unnecessary.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change about it.  I would buy this beer again and on it's own, I think a six pack for the fall would be pretty nice.  I would recommend this to people who like the style or anybody who's looking for a nice easy drinking beer with a little bit of flavor to it.  All in all I was happy with this beer and it's just what I want from the style, Sierra Nevada did this style justice.  This isn't my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada, but it's got to be one of the best Vienna Lagers I've had.  Nice job guys, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","0"
