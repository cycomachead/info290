Tasted crisp enough, a little on dry side but touch of sweetness.  A small lingering something, wouldn't exactly call it bitterness on tongue.  Mouthfeel seemed light almost watery.  But to be fair, I've been drinking stouts and porters lately.  Overall a good Vienna, but not sure I would choose this over, say, a lighter porter such as Anchor.","marieli","Mar 17, 2015"

The smell could easily lead me to believe I was drinking a German Marzen.  Bready with a touch of caramel sweetness.  The flavor is much the same, although the sweetness ramps up a touch more than the aroma would indicate.  Again, flavors are wonderful.  Feel falls a little flat, but it's clean and refreshing.  I may not even be rating this beer well enough.  Quite a pleasant surprise.","Andrew041180","Dec 11, 2014"

In a way, it's the perfect flagship beer for a Louisiana brewery since the craft movement still hasn't fully matured there in the way many other states have.  It has a moderately body, a pleasant smell and a solid but unobtrusive taste resulting in high drinkability.  Really not much to argue with here.","Immortale25","Apr 03, 2013"
2.38,-31,3.75,2,2,3.25,2.75,"Any craft beer drinker in the New Orleans area knows that if you go to any run of the mill bar, Abita Amber is going to be the one craft beer on tap. It was hard rating this beer because I partly think the taps down on Bourbon street are disgustingly dirty so maybe that is why it doesn't taste that good, but then again I've had this beer from bottles and it still doesn't taste that good to me. I always get it because it is either this or drinking the watered down mainstreams. Each time, however, the story is the same. I take the first sip and I'm like "wow, this beer is pretty good". Tastes like any other generic craft beer lager, but as it gets warmer in your hand that's when it starts tasting like dirty feet.","Badger72","Apr 03, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a small 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Small amounts of spotty lacing on the glass, with a bit of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of caramel, toffee, apple, pear, toast, nuttiness, herbal, and floral. Nice aromas with good balance and strength; pretty typical Vienna lager aromas. Taste of caramel, toast, nuttiness, biscuit, pear, pepper, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, nuttiness, biscuit, pepper, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Very clean tasting with a good balance of flavors; but it feels a bit watery. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming present on the finish as expected. Overall this is a good Vienna lager. Some good flavor balance and very smooth to drink. Quite enjoyable and very sessionable.","superspak","Aug 12, 2012"

Ambers take many forms and knowing how difficult it CAN be to work with a lager yeast, I am duly impressed that this is not a red ale. I got a rocky finger of tawny head off of my pour and it hung around as long as it could in the humidity of the evening. Color was a beautiful orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty, but also very clean. Mouthfeel was full, nearly thick and the malty sweetness reminded me of hot cereal, oatmeal or cream of wheat. Finish was semi-sweet, sweet, but not cloying by any means.

Dark orange to amber with no head to speak of. Hazy. Taste was bland. It’s not a BMC but I don’t think it’s a craft beer either. The only flavor that I think I can pick out is the faintest hint of caramel. Palate might be the acceptable quality of this beer, mainly because it is carbonated and drinkable.

The caramel is a little roasted, which balances nicely with green and pepper from the hops. Tasty. The body is light and crisp, and the aftertaste is roasted and slightly sour, with a dry finish.

Light mouthfeel, a little heavy handed in the carbonation. Wish there was more to the body of this beer. It just doesn't really stand up, and seems like it's missing ... something. The caramel taste comes rolling in but washes to the sides of the palate and is chased by water.

Little to no bite in the initial taste or finish. Feels sort of watery in my mouth, but I do detect a little fizz buzz. This is a beer that is hard to find unless your are in the brewing area (Louisiana), and it is a little pricey compared to similar ale.

The nose is heavy on the buttery biscuits, as though company was expected; some light caramel and nutmeg finish off a strange olfactory experience. The taste also has a good amount of biscuits, but they're not as buttery as before. Some mild wheat, light caramel, and, following the theme, very mild hoppy floral and citrus notes round out the kinda lackluster flavor. The body is pretty light, with a light carbonation and a semi-crisp finish. Overall, an okay brew, nothing special, nothing objectionable. Easy to down, though.","TMoney2591","Aug 06, 2010"

I definitely get a malty sweetness. Maybe that sweetness is a little bit of wheat. I barely get that bready grit feeling on the back of my tongue on the second sip.

There's something a bit off towards the end of the flavor profile, somewhat sharp and metallic in flavor. Bitterness is present and meets the residual malt sweetness, but seems to be more from the roasted malt than hops. Finishes clean and dry though.

Aroma slightly metallic with mild faint caramel and nut notes mild flowing sweetness and a kiss of herbal hops. Flavor is light with specialty grains just slipping through the fizzy beer flavor, but it works with a mild caramel, nut, and slightly creamy edge with faint hops arising with each sip. Mouthfeel is light bodied as it gets in the craft realm but a nutty dryness does stay on the palate with carbonation tickling the throat. Drinkability is sessionable but damn I want more flavor at this level in the game. I still give props to these Abita beers being early on influences in beers exploitation of myself.","WVbeergeek","Feb 21, 2008"

The mouthfeel says "yes" but the macro hop aftertaste says "no". Basically, this beer falls into my "good standby at a place with lousy selection" category.

The mouth is about right, body is medium, carbonation medium, the ending is short and sweet, literally, a bit of a bite toward the back of the tongue.

Beer finishes dry with a slight earthy aftertaste that some may find to be offputing. I have noted that the quality is slightly variable or perhaps it is me, but this can be a really enjoyable beer or not so enjoyable.

3.45,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Clear, coppery amber in hue, the color is attractive but a lack of animation in such a translucent beer is sad. A slightly off-white head of a half finger topped off the beer; the head retention was fair as it faded quickly to a weak cap. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. The nose is malty but not domineering, somewhat sweet with caramel hints, toasty, earthy at the back. The potency is modest and the aromas are simplistic. It does suggestion German origins but I dont know if Id call it a true Märzen. Inviting by default really. Well, the nose didnt lie. It tastes as simplistic as the bouquet indicated. There is no begin or middle or end, taste-wise. Everything is lumped as one. It is malty sweet with a fair amount of caramel. Pleasantly earthy too, from the hops I assume, mildly bitter. Again, this beer shows its German roots. The more I drank the more biscuity and dry it became. The palate is respectable; while it is plenty tasty it is also very straightforward. Some of this can be expected, as the style dictates. I would image this would be a good beer for beginners, i.e., a crossover beer. The carbonation was a little too stiff and I thought that really hurt the mouthfeel. It was too fizzy, especially considering the smallish frame, medium/medium-light in body. I will say this beer is plenty drinkable, I am sure it would be easy to kill a six-pack and I bet it would work nicely with BBQ dishes.

Strangely, about two-thirds through comes a nice hoppy bite but it is quickly recaptured by the overall malt/caramel again to the finish.

This was truly the best part of the beer. The aroma consisted only of malt. It was subtle and I could not detect the hops. The more I drank of this glass and swirled its contents, the more I enjoyed the maltiness of the brew. The taste began a little chocolaty and finished a little sweeter than I would have liked. There was a little bitterness but no hop flavor. The balance of this entire beer is toward the malt so follows style. The mouthfeel was a little light for my preference. It needed to be a little more full. The carbonation did play a slight bit with my tongue and made up for a lack of body. When asked about Abita, my response has always been, they make a mighty fine root beer. I will have to include their amber as a good beer. I would recommend this as a good session beer.","LarryKemp","Apr 03, 2004"

4.33,25.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I was expecting this dark amber color, but got a light orangey color instead. Big frothy very light tan colored head. The head died out after a few short minutes to a laceing that stood the whole time. Smell was very strange to me. I got citrus, burned malts, and burned nuts. It was very weird how it went in stages. The taste was strange too. First, there was no taste at all, almost watery. Then it went to a short burst of light citrus mixed with wheat. Finally, it went to the strange taste of burned malts/nuts. The complexity of it was shear brilliance to me, thus the high score. The mouthfeel was creamy and bubbly all at once. This was another one of those great beers to sit and drink for a while. I wouldn;t want to spend my Fall nights any other way.","JISurfer","Nov 04, 2003"

A bit of malt sweetness to the taste, but not much else. Actually a hint of sourness in the aftertaste. Low carbonation and a medium-light body make this drinkable, but I'll stay with Yuengling as my choice for this type of beer. Also I have now had it on tap. No real difference. Fizzy head that goes away quickly is the only major difference in the two.","Boto","Oct 29, 2003"

I got this in New Orleans in a "to go" cup to wash out the taste of a $1.50 Skyy Blue (I swear they must be making these with NutraSweet!), so it filled a need. The sad thing is, in the touristy French Quarter, this is the closest you're going to come to finding a microbrew on tap. All else is just Bud, Bud Light...","DrunkMcDermott","Sep 19, 2003"

The aroma was very weak, but a little maltiness was present. The flavor seemed a bit weak to me as well. Slightly sweet tasting, but rather boring. The aftertaste is really dry. There is a bite in the flavor that did not seem to be caused by the alcohol, maybe it was just a bad pitcher.","clvand0","Aug 27, 2003"

3.41,-1.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured into the glass orange/brown in color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. It produced a thick, foamy and creamy head that was beige in color. Lace was stretched inside the glass that was creamy and sheety in places and spotty and non-existent in others. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly simply stated, malts (toasted and sweet), caramel, and a hint of hops (slight). The tastes were also simple in nature, light floral and herb hops, sweet malt and toasted malt, and a leafy dryness near the end. It had a medium to light medium body. Over all it was crisp and light, malt was the lead ingredient. It was watery and quenched my thirst. Not the greatest beer I have had (personally and according to style) but it was above average. A good beer for those who want to try the craft beer experience but are used to the macro beer world.","Jarod","May 20, 2003"
3.85,11.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a stand-by at my house. My in-laws live near Abita and bring it to me when they come here, or have it at their house when I go there. They could get better beer for me, but I'm not gonna complain about it, because they could do a whole lot worse. They know I like to visit the brewery when I can so I guess they think its my favorite. Anyway....12 oz brown twist-off is the only way to get it, other than out of a tap. This is Abita's most popular, and I think a very good representative of the style. It pours am amber color without much head. If you really try you could end up with none, pour hard and what you get won't last very long. The aroma is sweet, roasted malts..toffee/caramel. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel. They didn't forget the hops, as there is some bitterness, but not much. If I have any complaint its that there seems to be a slight sourness in the finish. I think its a good beer to use to convert your BMC friends to something better, because it certainly has a lot more character than the similarly priced American lagers sitting next to it at the grocery store.","au1sec","May 19, 2003"

Out of the bottle it pours to a very thin white head and orange/amber color. Aroma is predominantly pale malt and a bit of carapils and/or Munich malt witha bit of crystal (caramel) malt thrown in. The taste confirms the aroma's suggestion: pale maltiness fortified with a little Munich and or some other darker carmelized malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and bubbly. Very quaffable stuff. I'll have another.","EagleTalon","Apr 19, 2003"
3.2,-7.2,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This must have been an out of date bottle because it was flat and didn't raise a head. I had a sense of a fine beer that was overaged. The look was a cloudy bright copper with virtually no head or lacing. The flavor seemed good despite the flatness of the mouthfeel. Nice aroma of caramel malt with a hop edge. Nicely balanced flavors seem to blend malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Dry finish. Sure would like to have one fresh on tap.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 10, 2003"

Medium in body and fairly smooth. Taste is sweet toasted malts and caramel at first followed by some bready and biscuity notes. Some mildly bitter hops and a dry cracker-like flavor come through in the finish. I cant think of anything in particular that stands out in the beer, but its an enjoyable brew nonetheless.","Morris729","Mar 28, 2003"

It has the rich body, and the crisp to smooth body of a traditional vienna, but it just seems more like an ale than a german lager. As you go through it, it becomes more welcomed as a lager beer, but it still does not seem like a vienna or oktoberfest. It seems more like a rich version of a traditional munich or vienna lager. It is very easy to drink, and it is a good beer for the unexperienced to try. If you are not yet into the stout and dark beer scene, this is one you really should try.","ElGuapo","Feb 16, 2003"

3.05,-11.6,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Amber being Abitas biggest selling beer, it is not overly surprising that the hop character is understated, to say the least. The wide popularity of the beer may also account for its lack of roasted-grain flavor and aroma.","TXHops","Oct 26, 2002"

4.41,27.8,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice crystal copper color with a smallish tan head that runs away quickly and leaves no lace.  Husky, toasty malt is big in the aroma of this one and dominates over all else.  The huge toastiness of this brew carries over into the taste as the brew gets so much towards the toasty end of the malt spectrum that it almost turns smoky.  The toasty aspects of the malt balancenicely because of the lack of a real sweet malt quality and a bit of hops that can be detected in the background that do just enough.  The great toasty malt qualites of this brew leave it surprisingly crisp for this style and help to make it awesomely drinkable.  This would certainly make on hell of a session beer if I could only get it in six packs in my area.","Murph","Sep 30, 2002"

The aroma is slightly fruity and offers the toasty and lightly sweet maltiness of Vienna malt. The flavor follows the aroma with a well-balanced, bready & toasty malt. Some of the Abita house flavor is present but it doesn't stand out as it does in some of their less malty beers. The body is medium with a very fine and moderate carbonation. The creamy mouthfeel helps to accentuate the maltiness. The malt gives way to a dry finish with a touch of hop bitterness and a lightly lingering biscuity note. One of Abita's better beers and a good crossover beer for those starting to look for more flavor.
