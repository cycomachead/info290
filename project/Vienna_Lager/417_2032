The nose features some hop character up front and a touch of skunky character. Notes of bread and grain come through. Not sure if this has been skunked or if it is intentional. The taste is full flavored and is very malty. None of the skunk quality comes through on the taste. Decent balance, minimal hop character. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing with appropriate level of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice Vienna lager. I'm assuming the skunk character is unitentioal and is a result of the storage at the place I purchased the bottle. For that reason,, I am not factoring that into the smell score. It wasn't much of a detractor in the first place.","homebrew311","May 20, 2012"

Taste is very malty, caramel, biscuit, slightly sweet, nutty, enough balance to keep the finish relatively clean.

Nose had a rich caramel sweetness to it. Mouthfeel was medium with a very malty sweetness initially, but giving 'way to a slight grassy hoppiness on the tongue. Finish was incredibly smooth, very pleasant to drink, with an intermingling of the malt and hops that made me wish for more.

The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with the carbonation also leaning that way. Overall, not impressed. Not a bad beer but very generic and un-memorable.","gmfessen","Dec 24, 2009"

This poured a brilliant golden amber color with a 1 finger head that dissipates into some nice sticky lacing. I thought the taste was lightly malty but sweet with a caramel flavor that dominates.

3.82,4.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Color is a brilliant golden amber. Medium-firm pour and produces a rocky, two-fingered medium-pale tan head - good duration and moderate lacing. Nose is fairly malty, with caramel and light honey notes and a lightly metallic tang. There's also some biscuity malt and a slightly herbacious character in the mix. Mildly sharp from the outset, with a nice tanginess dominating. Sweet/sour, but in a fairly light, refreshing sense. Mouthfeel is good, light and cleansing but not due to brisk carbonation. Light notes of green apple, orange, and honey on the palate, with interesting aromatics: bubblegum, clover honey, and light black pepper. A touch of alohol comes through, but it blends well with the biscuity malt experienced on the nose. A fairly lighter bodied lager but *wow*! No lack of flavor here. Hop use is very restrained and the bitterness is very mild - it doesn't linger nearly as much as the tangy malt does. More fruity notes (pear!) a this warms a bit. Finish is clean and dry. Firebrick's appeal has grown on me more and more with each encounter: a lighter bodied full-flavored lager, it's the sort of thing Killian's drinkers would enjoy if only it had a better distribution. A great session beer, and great with light grilled fair in the summer. Firebrick in a can is also one of the best canned beer experiences I've ever had!","Chaz","Jan 22, 2007"

The toasty, bready flavors don't come through the same. Hopped a little higher than the malt can support causes the delicate bread and yeast flavors to subside a little too much.

Understated toasty Vienna malt with a medium caramel fringe dominates the aroma. Subdued herbal hops and a trace metallic twang are secondary. Lacks the intangible melanoidin presence of a prototypical Vienna, but is clean and well rounded, albeit tame, aromawise. In flavor, prevalent in malt backbone is a stately toffee and caramel sweetened light toast impression. Malt sweetness does not become cloying, due to both the functional hopping and ample attenuation. Becomes slightly savory as it warms, with lightly buttery, slightly salty biscuit hints arising. Moderate in body, with a suitably dextrinous, but brisk mouthfeel conducive to easy quaffing. Hop bitterness augments over time, thus drying the overall flavor profile agreeable. Finishes immaculately clean, with a combination of herbal Hallertauer and simple maltose sweetness fleeting quickly. A well crafted, albeit prosaic Vienna. Perhaps it was brewed with domestic malts?

Aroma: Slightly metallic with a roasted malt nut tone and an underlying hop bitterness they're very mild there is no fragrance jumping out at me. Taste: Taste is a clean sweeping amount of toasted caramel malts and bitter sweet tones, nicely balanced a little mild seems mass produced but still tasty overall. Rather uninteresting compared to some Vienna styles but this one beats out the Sam Adams lineup even though this one is lacking compared to Elliot Ness overall not a bad throwback. Mouthfeel: Thin highly carbonated not much texture to speak of. Drinkability: I could put down a few without being filled up, but I wouldn't really yearn for too many of these, they're not challenging my palate seems run of the mill and for the mill I don't run.","WVbeergeek","Sep 03, 2003"
4.13,12.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Easy and simple with close to medium body in feel with a quick creamy start and gaining some bolder qualities as it reaches the midway point and through to the clean crispy lightly dry finish. Quite a nice little brew, the finish is my favorite, and once it warms a bit is very nice and very drinkable. One of the better Schell's brews IMO.","tavernjef","Jul 23, 2003"
3.38,-7.9,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a massive but thin off-white head with a million tiny bubbles racing to join the fluff. The smells of malted earthy grain and very light hops are seeping from the head. The taste repeats with the earthy grain with a lightly sweetened background a very faint hops. This light-bodied brew drinks down very easy with a watery-like characteristic and finishes just barely dry and an astringent taste. Not bad, but not great either. Rather weak in the flavor department, but still goes down nicely in this Texas heat. Thanks to budgood1. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jul 07, 2003"
3.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"A frothy off-white head holds well over a slightly hazy and deep-amber body with a reddish cast. Some nice lacing adds to the appearance, although it doesn't stick to the glass for very long. The aroma displays a clean, gently sweet and mildly toasted malt that's quite welcoming. The body combines a firm maltiness with a gently crisp carbonation for a smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor delivers the rich Munich/Vienna maltiness that the nose promises; well-balanced by a firm bitterness. It's clean and fresh with the malt dominating the bitterness and just a touch of hop flavor at the tail end. It ends with a surge of sweetish, toasty malt followed by drying bitterness in a long and enjoyable finish. It's not complex; nor is it supposed to be. It's quaffability we're looking for here! Very nicely done and quite enjoyable. This beer appears to contain all of the aspects of a brilliant Vienna-style lager and I'd highly recommend it as a perfect companion to grilled and barbecued foods during the summer season.","NeroFiddled","May 25, 2003"
4.3,17.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I really liked this one. The copper orange color and decent white head made for a nice appearance. The aroma was fine with malt, hops, and citrus. The taste is very well balanced, the sweetness of the malt held in check by by the light hopping that it finishes with. Medium to light bodies, I found this to be a very drinkable beer. You won't get tired of it.","Sixpack595","May 07, 2003"

3.2,-12.8,3,3,3.5,3,3,"While not a powerhouse, flavor-wise, this is a decent version of a vienna-style lager. It pours out to a reddish-brown in the glass with light aroma of malt. Taste is that of malt with a light caramel and toffee also present. Not as flavorful as Sam Adams offering and not as good as the Great Lakes Brewing version. However, it is a good beer and worthy of drinking on occasion.","proc","Dec 07, 2002"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"I thought this beer was better than most beer advocates did.  The appearance was hazy copper with a short lasting head.  The aroma was big malt, then faint spicy hops.  The flavor was spiced malt, with a hop presence that was appealing.  The beer was smooth with a long lasting flavor.  Pretty good, though I don't have much experience with this style.","ryanocerus","Oct 29, 2002"
2.98,-18.8,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"This is a very light, refreshing session beer.  It has an amber color with an off-white head.  There is just a slight maltiness to the aroma and taste.  The hop presence was really unnoticable.  I find it odd that this beer just took a bronze metal at the GABF for the American-Style Amber Lager when August Schell sells it as a Vienna-Style Lager.  I do find that it fits more into the style of American-Style Amber Lager than a Vienna-Style Lager.","BeerBuilder","Oct 24, 2002"
3.63,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Nice copper/orange hue with a minimal beige head that recedes to an edging in mere seconds.  Lace is negligible.  There's some slight maltiness on the nose.  Body seems lighter than it should be, mabye medium at best.  There are some slight toasted characteristics.  Also some slight nutty tones.  Hop contributions are minimal.  Better than average, but not great.","Bighuge","Sep 20, 2002"
2.78,-24.3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Schell FireBrick:  If this beer’s not flat, then it’s the least carbonated beer I’ve ever had. Name is dead on, however, this is a fire brick red beer in appearance.   Malt aroma is very apparent, and there is a malt sweetness to this beer, but there is an unpleasant sourness as well.  Not worth your while.","jackndan","Jun 28, 2002"
4.15,13.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a beer that the more I taste it the more I like it. Well balanced, with some nice subtle qualities. Good with food or as a session brew.","garymuchow","May 03, 2002"
4.27,16.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: Very drinkable with big malt complexities. If you like sizeable malty lagers this will be a treat for you. Big enough to pair up with some schnitzel and kraut.","Jason","Mar 09, 2002"
3.76,2.5,4,3,4,3,4.5,"One of the most drinkable of the malty beers.  And I like that this style is still around.  Its quite orange in color and pours with little head at all.  There's a slight bready quality to the mid mouth impact, but the flavor is balanced and lessens evenly as its swallowed.  I don't look for a lot of bite or chewy mouthfeel in Vienna Lagers, so I'm pretty happy with FireBrick.","ADR","Mar 07, 2002"
3.73,1.6,3.5,3,3.5,4,5,"This is one of my favorite easy drinking beers...I struggle to get much aroma, and there is very little head to this beer after the initial pour.  Orangish is color.  This beer is kind of an Octoberfest light...It has some nice semi- sweet tones to it, but is considerably thinner than most Octoberfests..I think this beer would appeal to the beginner conniseur as well as the experienced beer lover.  It is very smooth..has very little hopping, and has a nice malty, but not overly sweet taste to it.  At one point I thought this was on a par with the better Octoberfests...But, me and my brother did a blind taste test with 15 Octoberfests last fall (talk about a challenge at 6 ounces each) and this was not nearly as tasty as the true Octoberfests..I just bought a six-pack, and the memory remains the same...A nice well made easy drinking malty beer...I could drink a lot of these...","ZAP","Feb 20, 2002"
3.99,8.7,4.5,3,4.5,4,4,"this beer is presents a challenge to review because i perceive it as so balanced and smooth nothing stands out.  but maybe that's the beauty of it.  it looks like a red and has a medium body and light smooth creamy mouthfeel of roasted caramel malt.  very muted nose of malts and hops....and a very lightly hopped finsh.  so easy to drink which i would think would appeal to many beer drinkers in general because what it lacks in complexity is made up because of quality.","budgood1","Feb 17, 2002"
