prost
overall
otter
creek
is
doing
some
great
stuff
this
is
a
good
example
ba
has
this
ranked
2
among
american
pale
lagers
to
hoponius
union
and
i
concur
clear
light
yellow
in
color
white
head
nice
citrus
hop
flavors
in
the
aroma
hop
dominated
taste
very
mild
malt
flavor
thin
to
medium
body
served
in
a
pint
glass
cloudy
dark
yellow
in
color
with
thick
creamy
head
that
lasts
great
rich
hoppy
citrus
taste
and
aroma
a
really
really
good
beer
very
good
ipa
this
would
be
a
junior
of
the
great
vermont
ipas
not
quite
as
juicy
and
fruity
but
close
it
does
lack
a
little
on
the
nose
but
tastes
great
if
you
love
citra
hops
like
i
do
search
this
one
out
a
pleasant
surprise
as
otter
creek
underwhelmed
me
otherwise
just
enough
citrus
notes
but
an
easy
drinker
best
when
fresh
it
seems
to
lose
its
character
rapidly
overall
one
hoppy
lager
here
the
use
of
citra
hops
was
more
than
clear
could
have
used
a
bit
more
malt
additions
though
for
balance
different
though
very
sessionable
as
well
a
very
good
brew
cant
say
ive
ever
had
an
india
style
pilsner
before
o
nice
citra
showcase
pretty
good
funky
aftertaste
not
worth
the
price
point
this
didnt
even
taste
like
beer
and
had
a
weird
aftertaste
maybe
this
was
a
bad
keg
draft
at
roosevelt
tavern
in
york
pa
poured
a
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
solid
white
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
very
citrusy
moderate
carbonation
not
at
all
overthetop
hoppy
fresh
clean
mouthfeel
would
be
a
decent
session
choice
poured
a
nice
lager
gold
color
with
about
two
fingers
worth
of
white
head
and
left
a
good
deal
of
lacing
that
is
still
lingering
smells
of
several
things
getting
some
lemon
grapefruit
lots
of
hops
taste
is
surprisingly
good
expected
too
much
of
a
bitter
hop
taste
but
you
get
lots
of
flavor
from
the
citrus
and
fruits
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
little
carbonation
but
goes
down
like
melted
butter
overall
is
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
decent
beverage
has
a
slight
off
taste
but
very
good
otherwise
awesome
loads
and
loads
of
flavor
lemon
grapefruit
orange
and
pineapple
all
blended
together
looks
fantastic
makes
a
great
springtime
or
summer
beer
could
drink
this
all
day
long
maybe
im
missing
all
the
hoopla
on
this
certainly
an
attractive
looking
beer
the
flavour
profile
is
tasty
and
flavourful
easy
to
knock
back
a
couple
on
a
warm
afternoon
but
i
would
sooner
move
on
to
something
with
a
bit
more
to
it
and
going
on
i
notice
some
of
the
citra
offflavours
on
this
creeping
into
the
palate
the
slightly
catpiss
note
and
overall
it
comes
across
as
fairly
standard
a
good
lager
offering
and
with
a
nice
hop
charge
but
its
not
especially
crisp
and
the
hops
seem
muddled
and
catty
slightly
hazy
straw
color
the
nose
has
a
clean
hop
essence
to
it
the
body
is
light
the
flavor
profile
is
crisp
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
lots
of
pithy
citrus
in
the
nose
plus
a
little
cat
pee
biscuits
and
short
bread
for
malt
balance
not
as
hop
forward
on
the
tongue
plenty
of
earthy
citrus
not
as
fresh
and
zesty
as
the
smell
sugar
cookies
and
short
bread
at
the
finish
very
pleasantly
surprised
this
was
damn
tasty
and
went
down
quickly
very
good
ipa
first
time
ive
had
it
and
i
thought
it
was
very
good
nice
hop
up
front
and
malt
finish
i
think
the
ibus
might
be
a
tad
higher
then
55
like
it
says
the
hops
are
a
bit
bitter
but
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
light
refreshing
spring
summer
brew
well
a
lot
lighter
then
the
stouts
i
have
been
drinking
lately
really
a
nice
hoppy
beer
great
with
food
or
just
to
drink
marries
a
great
ipa
with
a
solid
lager
and
makes
them
both
better
i
am
very
surprised
with
how
good
this
is
i
was
really
caught
off
guard
the
hops
really
shine
on
this
unique
beer
it
is
a
nice
cross
of
an
ipa
and
crisp
lager
well
done
two
fingers
worth
of
late
to
develop
slightly
offwhite
colored
crisp
froth
with
a
slightly
rocky
top
comprised
of
loads
of
big
chunky
bubbles
decent
retention
the
color
is
a
pale
lemony
yellow
gold
with
a
very
faint
haziness
a
light
to
moderate
bit
of
sluggish
carbonation
the
first
descriptor
that
comes
to
mind
is
dank
an
odd
mix
of
citrus
and
leather
cold
cuts
thirteen
hundred
plus
reviews
and
i
cant
say
ive
ever
used
that
term
i
struggle
to
tell
whether
the
aroma
is
enticing
or
slightly
off
putting
probably
a
bit
more
of
the
latter
but
its
not
to
the
point
of
being
a
deal
breaker
the
flavor
profile
is
a
slightly
muted
version
of
the
nose
dank
and
hoppy
with
a
few
unusual
notes
mixed
in
the
hoppiness
intensifies
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
quite
sturdy
smooth
carbonation
somewhat
dense
goes
down
smoothly
the
finish
is
a
bit
chalky
as
the
hops
resurgence
occurs
on
the
finish
a
rather
unique
and
somewhat
satisfying
offering
not
sure
that
i
would
drink
this
with
regularity
but
the
world
needs
more
hoppy
lagers
and
this
one
certainly
fits
the
bill
even
with
the
odd
cold
cut
aroma
this
is
a
strange
one
the
hop
nose
is
a
little
subdued
and
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
a
lager
funk
that
im
not
all
that
used
to
probably
wont
be
going
back
to
this
one
this
is
a
great
brew
well
executed
this
would
be
awesome
during
the
summer
solid
4
across
the
board
nice
light
golden
pilsner
color
white
head
india
style
comes
through
beautifully
with
hoppy
citrus
flavors
and
light
malt
taste
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
blends
ipa
hop
flavor
with
a
classic
pilsner
drinkability
one
of
the
best
ipls
out
there
great
citrus
aroma
tastes
follows
a
unique
concoction
that
hits
the
mark
in
every
way
by
that
i
mean
the
brewerys
description
actually
holds
up
here
wonderful
citrus
fruit
complexities
that
shine
through
but
dont
overwhelm
very
disappointing
no
malt
balance
i
like
it
duvel
glassed
it
from
a
12oz
bottle
nothing
bad
to
say
i
like
citrus
but
this
is
a
little
bit
one
note
overipened
lemongrapefruit
with
a
bit
of
peel
grapefruit
peel
sour
which
im
cool
with
maybe
too
summer
id
get
it
again
but
as
a
selection
in
a
mixpack
or
a
sixer
if
the
weather
was
a
bit
warmer
this
would
be
my
go
to
beer
if
it
was
released
midsummer
alas
its
10
degrees
and
im
onto
more
maltier
fare
chimney
rock
inn
on
draft
21415
tastes
skunky
maybe
it
was
a
dirty
draft
line
would
like
to
try
again
pours
a
medium
golden
orange
with
a
white
foam
that
laces
well
the
aroma
is
bright
with
citrus
being
the
standout
the
taste
has
a
grapefruit
unripe
clementine
orange
flavor
that
is
quite
nice
fair
bitterness
but
this
one
is
more
quenching
than
palatescorching
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
brew
very
nice
product
all
in
all
reinventing
the
style
and
its
delicious
dense
head
of
about
a
fingers
height
pale
white
smooth
surface
mostly
uniform
foam
the
lacing
is
thin
however
produces
many
streaks
and
they
all
stick
with
determination
light
filminess
to
the
golden
hued
light
translucent
and
difficult
to
see
through
only
a
few
bubbles
but
they
are
fat
very
pure
and
fresh
nose
abounds
with
a
cornucopia
of
tart
citrus
leafy
herbal
matter
and
toasted
bread
crust
some
peppery
notes
as
well
the
white
pit
fruit
and
pineapple
scents
are
plush
and
do
what
the
can
to
soften
the
contours
overall
has
a
high
energy
profile
mediumbodied
somewhat
creamy
texture
at
first
then
it
becomes
successively
drier
although
stops
short
of
bitter
the
bite
in
the
pineapple
papaya
nectarine
fruit
trumps
any
juicier
apricot
or
peach
the
floral
element
more
pronounced
here
the
citrus
seems
to
settle
on
a
mix
of
pink
and
white
grapefruit
the
graininess
and
herbaceousness
stiffen
the
mouth
feel
after
the
attack
and
the
mild
maltiness
appears
mostly
after
the
show
has
ended
to
its
credit
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
and
its
best
to
just
enjoy
it
than
parse
it
solid
spring
release
from
mike
and
da
boys
at
otter
creek
serving
type
bottle
good
ipl
only
complaint
is
a
slight
diacetyl
finish
other
than
that
this
is
very
competitive
with
jacks
abby
and
founders
ipl
versions
out
there
solid
ipl
jacks
abby
still
my
fave
though
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
one
superb
frickin
beer
i
could
reup
at
the
supermarket
incredible
o
refreshingly
nice
and
easy
drinking
well
done
the
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
aroma
its
a
bit
short
on
the
fruit
side
but
that
is
probably
a
style
point
in
the
relatively
new
ipl
category
easy
drinking
without
the
sense
of
somethings
missing
that
comes
with
session
ipas
definitely
worth
trying
overall
as
advertised
a
lager
that
has
been
hopped
to
hell
good
not
great
this
beer
is
awesome
and
otter
creek
has
come
a
long
way
since
the
early
days
love
this
stuff
i
need
it
in
30
packs
of
cans
for
the
summer
its
perfect
a
citra
hopped
up
lager
with
a
nice
pilsener
grain
front
end
light
and
fresh
and
a
great
takeoff
point
for
one
heck
of
a
refreshing
hop
profile
clear
and
sunny
colored
blonde
beer
excellent
carbonation
short
but
fizzy
and
active
white
bubble
head
the
nose
is
a
balance
between
the
fresh
light
grain
and
the
citra
hops
which
arent
overdone
and
oily
but
simply
clean
and
refreshing
and
rather
delicate
in
their
use
this
is
great
beer
because
it
bridges
the
gap
between
the
pale
lager
drinker
and
the
ipa
drinker
where
both
are
satisfied
its
also
perfect
golf
course
or
boat
beer
just
as
summery
as
they
come
no
heaviness
no
bitterness
just
good
clean
beer
full
of
flavor
that
lemon
tint
to
the
citra
is
perfect
and
the
lager
finish
is
quick
but
not
too
dry
perfectly
refreshing
slammable
beer
of
the
highest
order
here
the
only
thing
good
about
this
beer
is
the
look
of
it
i
really
dont
understand
how
ba
rates
this
so
highly
the
smell
is
of
old
hops
and
fruit
and
the
initial
taste
is
a
bitterness
that
even
a
bitter
beer
lover
as
myself
cannot
stand
as
someone
who
really
loves
grapefruit
this
made
me
taste
a
flavor
of
grapefruit
that
may
have
ruined
grapefruits
for
me
for
good
what
an
absolutely
horrible
beer
the
beer
looks
great
in
a
glass
very
nice
head
deliciouslooking
color
how
very
very
deceptive
once
the
bitterness
hits
the
tongue
and
you
think
the
worst
part
is
over
the
back
of
the
mouth
feel
is
even
more
disgusting
swallowing
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
horrible
things
ive
ever
had
to
do
in
my
life
unfortunately
i
bought
a
6
pack
of
it
at
my
local
grocery
store
wegmanns
and
have
to
finish
the
pack
i
have
3
left
to
go
and
was
so
compelled
by
the
horrible
taste
i
actually
signed
up
for
an
account
just
to
review
how
horrible
this
beer
was
poured
a
pale
golden
body
with
two
finger
head
and
lace
with
a
dirty
earty
grainy
citric
hop
and
malt
profile
along
with
minor
grapesweet
fruit
notes
beer
is
smooth
and
citric
flavored
hoppy
and
yet
also
grainydry
with
a
crisp
finish
i
dont
have
too
much
to
say
to
this
beer
other
than
the
hops
hit
you
pretty
good
and
it
has
balance
with
the
other
main
taste
being
a
dry
grainy
crackerlike
maltiness
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
the
head
on
this
beer
is
outstanding
rocky
and
like
meringue
in
the
glass
from
beginning
to
end
the
citra
hop
shines
here
bright
citrus
and
grapefruit
rind
the
lager
smoothness
makes
this
one
very
sessionable
love
that
its
unfiltered
to
get
the
full
experience
this
one
is
fresh
and
delicious
and
i
am
going
to
try
to
get
a
keg
of
it
for
my
kegerator
nuff
said
wow
what
a
great
beer
i
wish
they
made
this
consistently
in
the
springsummer
months
its
a
very
simple
concept
a
lager
with
a
substantial
amount
of
citra
hops
if
you
like
citra
youll
love
this
doesnt
pack
the
maltbooze
package
that
a
citra
ipa
would
i
would
label
this
as
a
solid
hop
head
lawnmower
beer
you
could
knock
back
a
six
of
this
over
a
warm
summer
evening
otter
creek
should
really
be
marketing
this
as
a
summer
beer
overall
a
tasty
hop
forward
lager
super
light
honey
pilsner
look
tons
of
citra
in
the
smell
with
some
sweet
malt
and
other
tropical
fruit
flavors
taste
is
a
hop
charged
lager
for
sure
certainly
a
new
style
for
me
still
very
good
and
crisp
a
very
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
i
dig
it
overall
i
could
get
this
one
again
i
got
the
white
ipa
to
try
next
as
well
o
really
happy
i
got
to
try
this
its
one
of
the
better
hoppy
lagers
ive
had
o
this
is
a
really
solid
ipl
im
sure
it
would
have
better
fresh
but
right
now
its
still
drinking
nicely
i
actually
wish
i
had
more
than
a
single
bottle
so
i
guess
this
one
was
a
success
doubly
so
considering
its
not
a
complex
beer
though
it
doesnt
need
to
be
o
overall
another
solid
offering
from
otter
creek
might
as
well
just
make
an
ipa
but
hot
dog
if
it
isnt
super
tasty
as
a
pils
o
this
beer
is
deceivingly
hop
forward
it
has
the
bite
of
an
ipa
but
is
restrained
in
its
flavor
aroma
and
viscosity
would
love
to
session
this
during
the
summer
but
i
feel
like
after
a
few
id
be
reaching
for
something
with
more
character
do
i
could
guzzle
a
few
of
these
every
night
forever
and
be
pretty
pumped
about
it
for
the
style
nearly
a
masterpiece
an
extremely
pleasant
surprise
thanks

outstanding
beer
living
here
in
vermont
i
tend
to
get
a
little
bit
sick
of
ipas
i
do
love
my
heady
lawsons
and
hillfarm
but
i
do
miss
lawnmower
beers
this
beer
to
me
is
the
perfect
blend
of
both
it
is
however
noticeably
different
on
tap
and
tends
to
lead
to
a
bit
of
a
headache
the
next
morning
o
now
this
is
my
ideal
pilsner
just
enough
of
my
favorite
hop
added
to
a
classic
pils
flavor
while
still
maintaining
a
superior
drinkability
if
thus
were
available
in
my
market
id
drink
it
all
spring
o
torn
i
usually
do
not
like
lagers
this
one
is
impressive
for
a
style
i
dont
care
for
so
ill
give
it
a
bit
of
a
bump
if
you
dont
like
lagers
this
wont
make
you
a
convert
o
this
is
my
fourth
time
around
on
this
beer
in
a
bottle
before
reviewing
it
i
do
think
the
spice
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
and
maybe
the
malt
the
citra
hops
get
a
little
hidden
in
taste
but
its
a
very
well
rounded
beer
od
nice
but
it
didnt
exactly
smack
me
with
citra
properly
light
and
hoppy
and
seemed
stronger
than
it
actually
is
they
couldve
done
lots
more
with
this
but
ill
take
it
as
is
its
nice
having
options
for
hoppy
lagers
these
days
this
one
has
a
great
crispness
without
being
too
ichiban
noodle
tasting
i
often
get
that
from
isas
huge
citrusy
aroma
up
front
knocks
my
hair
out
of
my
face
dry
mild
bitterness
on
the
backend
but
pretty
subdued
very
clear
golden
appearance
slight
head
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
but
not
inspiring
o
a
delicious
brew
i
will
definitely
have
another
one
to
me
a
better
option
than
most
session
ipas
but
still
only
a
consideration
if
low
abv
is
sought
its
too
dry
for
a
summer
quencher
also
o
i
remember
when
i
first
had
this
beer
i
was
pretty
blown
away
and
my
admiration
for
it
remains
several
weeks
and
a
couple
six
packs
later
just
a
super
clean
lager
that
has
been
beautifully
hopped
with
one
of
my
favorite
varietals
after
this
kind
ryed
and
double
dose
otter
creek
has
really
been
batting
a
thousand
lately
by
far
my
favorite
ipl
and
in
fact
better
than
a
lot
of
ipas
out
there
this
gets
a
perfect
5
from
me
my
first
and
so
far
only
because
i
just
dont
see
how
anyone
could
possibly
improve
upon
it
although
admittedly
the
playing
field
seems
to
be
rather
small
right
now
o
this
is
the
latter
half
of
a
sixer
i
scooped
in
vt
but
i
swear
the
first
four
didnt
taste
this
good
really
showcases
the
power
of
citra
pretty
effective
stuff
that
holds
up
nicely
on
its
own
havent
had
much
experience
with
the
american
pale
lager
but
this
is
a
nice
first
round
recommended
overall
really
impressive
beer
very
strong
hop
profile
mixed
with
the
lager
malts
creates
a
really
big
bold
drink
finishes
pretty
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
hop
flavor
best
ipl
ive
had
so
far
d
fairly
drinkable
the
alcohol
was
just
a
notch
too
strong
but
thats
only
because
im
used
to
this
style
being
relatively
weak
in
that
department
while
not
a
true
session
beer
i
could
have
easily
had
another
in
a
sitting
if
i
didnt
have
anything
else
on
hand
i
love
beers
that
push
the
edge
of
whats
available
and
what
the
norms
are
and
this
certainly
fit
that
bill
like
the
sam
adams
ipl
i
hope
this
is
a
start
of
a
new
trend
that
still
has
a
long
way
to
go
in
terms
of
what
else
is
possible
when
it
comes
to
lagers
of
this
sort
nice
job
by
otter
creek
with
this
new
offering
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
lager
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
pours
yellow
with
some
of
the
dregs
making
their
way
into
the
glass
slowly
adding
a
wispy
fog
to
the
top
half
the
head
is
huge
and
lumpy
leaving
ample
chunky
lacy
deposits
on
the
glass
fresh
fruity
citrus
greets
the
nose
tangerine
grapefruit
and
lime
along
with
some
straw
green
leafiness
and
oily
pine
a
toasted
cereal
malt
sweetness
lingers
in
the
background
but
is
noticeable
big
fresh
hoppiness
continues
into
the
flavor
grassy
bitter
lemon
zest
pine
resin
tea
and
grapefruit
juicy
citrus
oils
linger
on
the
tongue
as
does
a
solid
bitterness
mediumlight
and
moderately
creamy
in
the
finish
other
than
a
certain
cleanliness
to
the
aroma
im
not
sure
i
would
recognize
this
as
a
lager
very
hoppy
crisp
and
drinkable
good
stuff
i
could
drink
many
the
smell
is
classic
citra
rich
deep
musky
hops
and
thats
pretty
much
what
you
get
in
the
taste
too
though
as
it
warms
you
can
catch
more
of
the
citrus
notes
aside
from
the
hops
youre
basically
just
tasting
a
nice
refreshing
lager
it
all
works
though
and
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
easily
the
best
offering
ive
ever
had
from
otter
creek
solid
beer
its
a
well
rounded
citra
hop
featured
ipa
must
try
o
very
drinkable
hoppy
dry
tropical
notes
great
co2
backing
as
well
a
pale
grain
backing
kegcase
worthy
very
enjoyable
great
repeat
factor
so
far
a
sleeper
that
hasnt
really
drawn
the
attention
perhaps
it
should
one
last
note
is
i
thought
this
was
an
ipa
but
is
listed
as
a
pale
lager
this
would
be
an
a
ipa
imho
perhaps
a
bit
better
per
style
as
a
pale
lager
what
ever
you
call
it
its
just
an
outstanding
beer
the
more
time
passed
since
i
had
this
the
better
the
perception
has
become
otter
creek
has
made
a
stand
out
brew
after
this
im
thinking
the
next
big
thing
should
be
session
ipls
taking
the
session
ipa
thing
to
the
next
level
of
easy
drinking
hop
forward
beers
overall
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
pilsnerpale
lager
style
the
citrus
and
the
lemon
do
not
overwhelm
and
is
very
drinkable
well
done
by
otter
creek
here
a
well
made
american
pilsneripl
similar
to
the
vein
of
what
jacks
abby
is
doing
o
otter
creek
has
really
stepped
up
their
game
this
is
much
better
than
any
previous
stuff
ive
had
of
theirs
overall
love
this
citra
bomb
cheers
o
this
was
great
and
it
makes
me
want
to
check
out
more
of
their
small
amount
of
offerings
i
need
to
get
myself
a
kind
ryed
i
really
hope
it
isnt
a
one
off
but
is
actually
a
seasonal
probably
the
hoppiest
lager
ive
ever
had
and
a
good
one
at
that
citra
mantra
wow
mike
gerhart
spelling
has
tamed
the
hops
badass
label
of
him
levitating
with
citra
hop
buds
in
each
palm
since
his
early
days
with
dfh
this
guy
has
been
making
solid
beer
but
after
the
recent
hoppy
beers
otter
creek
has
released
one
of
them
being
a
collaboration
with
lawsons
unfiltered
golden
body
slightly
hazed
bright
white
head
perfect
keller
style
pils
appearance
but
dip
your
nares
into
this
one
and
a
tropical
hop
explosion
goes
off
in
your
senses
think
dank
mary
jane
tropical
fruit
notes
mangopassionfruit
and
grapefruit
peel
with
just
raw
hops
a
bit
of
biscuit
toned
pils
malt
for
a
touch
of
perceived
sweetness
dry
purely
raucous
hop
expression
bitterness
leaves
resinous
oils
on
the
palate
hops
are
just
tattooed
on
the
palate
light
brush
of
biscuit
malts
but
this
is
a
true
hop
monster
only
55
ibus
but
i
perceive
more
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
than
many
maltier
dipas
that
report
100
ibus
carbonation
is
perfect
dead
on
one
of
the
best
ipls
ive
come
across
thus
far
in
the
beer
journeys
sign
me
up
for
a
case
of
hops
citra
mantra
when
did
otter
creek
start
making
better
then
decent
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
slightly
hazy
deep
yellow
color
bottle
clearly
says
it
is
unfiltered
so
the
haze
is
expected
pillowy
white
head
some
light
sheeting
good
retention
looks
like
a
lager
the
aroma
is
stand
out
great
pop
of
citra
hops
orange
zest
lemon
grapefruit
that
sorta
thing
the
hops
really
pop
out
of
the
glass
there
is
also
a
lovely
and
welcome
lageresque
quality
arriving
in
the
form
of
a
hint
of
sulfur
on
the
nose
these
aromas
play
well
together
surprisingly
its
funny
i
did
not
notice
this
lager
quality
in
the
first
bottle
i
drank
several
days
ago
taste
the
malt
part
of
the
taste
is
cracker
like
hops
are
nice
bitter
at
first
creating
a
welcome
bite
and
then
a
flavorful
wave
of
well
citrus
fruits
of
course
i
enjoy
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
so
hoppy
without
that
cloying
hop
sticky
resin
thing
the
beer
is
dry
and
thirst
quenching
with
a
lingering
bitterness
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
going
to
be
in
my
regular
rotation
this
is
just
the
type
of
beer
i
love
better
then
the
sum
of
its
parts
for
sure
full
of
flavor
dry
and
crisp
and
with
a
moderate
alcohol
level
allowing
you
to
enjoy
more
than
one
o
a
really
nice
beer
that
totally
satisfies
my
hop
fix
i
had
a
more
typical
pilsner
yesterday
from
jacks
abby
that
i
rated
slightly
lower
but
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
have
it
if
i
were
having
more
than
one
the
hop
flavor
in
this
one
is
really
quite
potent
again
as
long
as
im
only
having
one
its
fantastic
iam
really
digging
the
ipl
style
i
have
to
say
pours
a
clear
dull
light
golden
with
a
lemon
tinge
to
ita
full
two
finger
bone
white
clingy
head
atopa
great
pour
the
aromas
are
just
dripping
with
citra
goodnessthe
grapefruit
and
fresh
cut
grass
is
just
jumping
out
at
mea
bit
of
lemon
oil
is
also
thrown
in
to
the
hoppy
mix
citrusy
oily
hops
upfront
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
crisp
note
in
the
finishthe
hops
dont
really
punch
you
in
the
face
they
just
linger
nicely
probably
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
to
datea
great
hopped
up
lager
beer
hey
im
rating
an
american
pale
lager
for
that
this
is
outstanding
more
brewers
need
to
put
their
signature
on
a
hoppy
version
of
this
style
the
taste
makes
me
think
i
am
walking
through
a
garden
of
fruit
with
all
of
the
floral
characteristics
lingering
bitterness
at
the
end
nicely
done
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
straw
color
with
a
huge
tightly
bubbled
bone
white
head
that
persists
forever
being
constantly
fed
buy
a
stream
of
carb
bubbles
aromas
of
floral
pine
grass
citrus
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
atop
a
light
bready
pilsner
malt
base
the
flavor
is
very
light
crackery
malt
with
a
fair
amount
of
spicy
earthy
citrusy
hops
hop
bitterness
is
quite
present
as
there
is
little
in
the
way
of
malt
body
to
counter
it
light
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
resinous
mouthfeel
smells
pretty
damn
good
tastes
ok
but
really
needs
a
hint
more
body
for
my
tastes
o
a
fine
refresher
which
nonetheless
feels
substantial
in
your
mouth
fun
to
sip
would
make
a
good
session
brew
despite
being
on
the
heavy
mouthfeel
side
rounds
out
the
vw
bus
series
with
another
hit
ill
be
wanting
more
of
this
taste
starts
with
thick
white
bread
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
moving
to
herbal
hops
and
hay
in
the
middle
with
a
bitter
dank
grapefruit
finish
feel
is
right
on
what
you
would
expect
from
a
india
style
pils
lager
whatever
that
is
hahah
i
would
like
more
carbonation
in
here
though
has
some
nice
creaminess
more
breweries
should
be
putting
out
beers
like
this
presently
ranked
3
of
its
style
for
a
reason
they
hit
the
bulls
eye
here
so
damn
drinkable
with
a
very
well
rounded
citra
hop
character
that
does
not
even
get
catty
not
that
a
touch
of
that
would
be
a
bad
thing
my
beer
guru
shared
what
he
called
a
hippie
beer
decent
looking
beer
with
an
excellent
smell
that
had
me
thinking
ipa
excellent
taste
without
any
bad
bitter
has
me
savoring
the
beer
not
sure
about
cost
but
enjoyed
very
much
and
will
look
to
revisit
again
as
i
felt
this
was
an
excellent
beer
citra
flavor
comes
in
waves
without
fatiguing
the
palate
and
satisfying
my
hop
desires
i
hope
otter
creek
keeps
this
series
going
perhaps
with
different
hops
being
emphasized
o
really
nice
hoppy
lager
just
a
ridiculous
amount
of
hop
aroma
and
flavor
and
great
use
of
citra
hops
overall
draft
or
bottle
and
this
beer
is
solid
either
way
o
overall
a
very
tastey
and
well
balanced
if
you
like
citra
hops
youll
love
this
beer
o
although
this
is
a
pilsner
it
is
more
dank
and
bitter
than
a
victory
prima
pils
a
nice
exploration
into
the
ipalike
lager
territory
had
this
sidebyside
with
a
troegs
cultivator
and
preferred
the
cultivator
which
leaned
more
towards
the
malty
side
of
the
equation
i
like
these
experimental
brews
from
otter
creek
although
this
one
isnt
in
the
same
league
as
the
double
dose
collaboration
with
lawsons
finest
liquids
poured
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
pours
very
cloudy
straw
with
a
tiny
white
head
smells
of
citrus
and
slight
earthy
hops
very
inviting
tastes
of
citrus
and
earthy
hop
tones
very
much
as
strong
as
most
ipas
beer
is
slightly
heavily
carbonated
but
light
bodied
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
is
another
new
to
me
otter
creek
beer
and
the
best
of
the
last
3
ive
tried
this
is
overall
a
solid
variety
pack
considering
the
price
14
for
12
beers
ranging
from
above
average
to
solid
this
being
the
latter
overall
i
can
certainly
see
where
this
beer
wouldnt
be
for
everyone
hopped
like
an
ipa
but
brewed
like
a
lager
without
any
darker
malt
to
support
the
bitterness
works
for
me
though
a
bitter
pale
showcase
of
the
citra
hop
o
otter
creek
has
been
killing
it
with
the
hop
on
the
bus
series
this
is
a
great
showcase
of
citra
hops
with
a
bit
more
complexity
from
the
pils
and
lagering
than
your
typical
single
hop
brew
o
the
drinkability
of
a
lager
with
the
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
beautiful
overall
this
is
a
solid
lager
with
a
real
heavy
dose
of
hops
doesnt
loose
its
lager
roots
by
maintaining
the
malt
and
yeast
qualities
but
instead
pushes
the
style
further
with
a
load
of
citra
hops
o
this
lager
features
characteristics
i
am
more
familiar
with
in
an
ipa
and
it
had
a
nice
bright
brisk
and
clean
feel
that
i
enjoyed
im
sure
this
is
a
hit
with
anyone
who
enjoys
citra
hops
easily
sessionable
something
you
can
get
really
comfortable
with
enjoyed
on
tap
at
plan
b
in
simsbury
ct
really
happy
with
otter
creek
lately
kind
ryed
now
this
clear
light
straw
color
with
a
decent
head
on
the
pour
head
dissipated
pretty
quickly
but
left
nice
lacing
mild
hop
on
nose
touch
of
lager
dankness
which
made
me
a
little
scared
but
did
not
come
across
in
taste
taste
was
crisp
and
citra
hop
left
nice
bitterness
on
palate
with
a
dry
finish
overall
a
delicious
hoppy
lager
this
beer
hits
every
idiosyncratic
mevirtue
that
can
exist
in
a
beer
so
much
so
that
i
really
dont
know
if
i
can
unbiasedly
suggest
the
beer
to
people
i
have
to
assume
theyll
realize
its
great
but
maybe
im
just
too
far
in
dry
cerealy
citra
heaven
i
hope
this
beer
is
released
again
light
pale
yellowishstraw
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
coating
of
mostly
tiny
white
bubbles
smell
is
dominated
by
the
citra
grapefruit
a
little
grassy
a
little
lemon
the
taste
follows
the
nose
well
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
there
but
not
central
a
little
unpleasant
mineral
flavor
at
the
end
with
a
distinctively
sort
of
biting
lager
yeast
and
cleanliness
at
the
end
goes
down
easy
though
the
body
is
a
little
too
light
for
me
not
my
favorite
but
still
quite
good
this
started
out
magnificently
ended
very
good
the
hops
ring
true
in
this
beer
if
otter
creek
could
stuff
the
nose
into
the
taste
this
would
be
one
of
the
best
out
there
o
good
stuff
a
nice
transitionintospringtype
beer
though
im
drinking
it
after
shoveling
a
foot
of
snow
with
lively
citrusy
flavors
awakening
the
senses
while
the
lighter
body
and
strength
this
is
just
5
75
keeps
it
drinkable
overall
a
nicely
hopped
and
rather
tasty
brew
overall
at
only
5
75
abv
it
packs
a
good
deal
of
hop
flavor
into
its
modest
body
quite
tasty
and
crisp
o
overall
a
great
ipl
that
would
great
in
the
summer
hoppy
lager
that
actually
tastes
like
a
lager
citra
is
good
choice
of
hops
for
a
beer
like
this
due
to
its
parentage
hallertauer
mittlefuh
us
tettanger
as
it
provides
melon
tropical
fruit
citrus
as
well
as
herbal
character
aroma
is
a
little
sulfury
fruity
and
herbal
cat
tails
sweet
haylike
and
melon
flavor
upfront
biscuity
middle
and
a
lingering
drybitter
finish
seems
a
littel
disjointed
at
first
but
the
more
you
drink
the
better
the
balance
becomes
and
a
single
theme
develops
great
example
of
what
can
become
the
modern
american
pils
style
o
citra
hopped
lager
huh
ill
try
it
certainly
worth
it
different
as
im
used
to
the
thickness
of
ales
when
dealing
with
american
hopped
beers
but
this
is
a
great
beer
and
id
recommend
it
to
any
beer
fan
lager

and
ale
fans
will
appreciate
its
depth
of
flavor
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
feels
good
but
the
bitterness
lasts
on
the
tongue
without
that
much
flavor
quite
unbalanced
and
really
not
that
drinkable
compared
to
other
ipl
offerings
interesting
and
worth
a
try
but
not
sonething
id
seek
out
or
buy
any
quantity
of
at
55
ibus
this
is
a
very
bitter
beer
the
bitterness
is
not
complex
and
it
does
dominate
any
pale
malt
that
may
be
there
a
borderline
extreme
beer
decent
body
and
a
lower
carbonation
makes
it
feel
thicker
than
a
typical
lager
hop
heads
will
love
this
a
very
amped
up
lager
but
one
that
while
drinkable
and
for
the
hop
fan
still
comes
up
a
little
too
bitter
and
unbalanced
otter
creek
is
stepping
it
up
i
first
had
a
bottle
of
this
and
didnt
love
it
but
the
kegged
version
is
much
better
felt
a
bit
cleaner
o
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
not
as
advertised
was
expecting
something
a
bit
lighter
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
certainly
more
tropical
aroma
and
flavor
the
bitterness
and
mouthfeel
is
high
enough
to
not
make
it
very
sessionable
i
would
not
particularly
seek
this
out
again
although
i
do
like
the
name
maybe
for
another
beer
though
pale
hazy
yellow
cool
white

that
holds
on
very
aromatic
when
you
pop
the
cap
herbaceousalmost
minty
lemon
peel
tropical
fruit
fine
carbonation
is
appreciated
at
first
sip
which
contributes
greatly
to
the
drinkability
as
the
flavors
are
not
as
inviting
as
the
aroma
cereal
malt
gives
it
a
medium
body
as
i
drink
more
of
this
i
do
get
more
flavors
while
subtle
of
grass
mango
pineapple
and
lemon
oil
still
they
get
knocked
out
by
hop
bitterness
and
i
like
it
a
lot
i
would
not
recommend
this
for
the
uninitiated
but
im
really
enjoying
the
juxtaposition
of
biting
bitterness
and
smoothness
otter
creek
is
yet
another
east
coast
brewery
that
is
renewing
interest
and
the
price
tag
doesnt
hurt
either

from

is

i
wouldnt

edit21414
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
now
and
i
dont
want
to
compare
it
to
jacks
abby
i
dont
even
think
jacks
abby
could
do
it
better
this
beer
is
underrated
and
violently
scrumptious
m
light
medium
overall
this
is
easy
drinking
with
enough
to
please
i
may
be
a
bit
tainted
by
the
hopper
lagers
from
jacks
abby
which
this
does
not
live
up
to
however
i
cant
say
for
sure
what
otter
creek
was
going
for
here
if
they
were
going
for
a
more
balanced
approach
they
succeeded
but
if
they
were
trying
to
showcase
citra
hops
over
a
simple
malt
backbone
then
they
could
have
turned
up
the
late
addition
hops
more
i
feel
that
when
brewers
choose
to
use
citra
they
typically
want
to
showcase
it
because
geeks
love
it
its
rare
that
i
find
citra
in
a
balanced
beer
but
kudos
to
otter
creek
if
thats
what
they
were
going
for
balance
is
underrated
and
welcome
even
to
this
hop

is
a

with

i
love
what
otter
creek
has
been
doing
with
these
oneoffs
this
beer
gives
jas
hoponius
union
a
run
for
its
money
overall
not
bad
the
nose
was
great
as
it
just
presented
lots
of
citra
with
a
faint
toasty
malt
underneath
the
flavor
however
brought
way
too
much
straw
toasty
malt
to
the
front
although
i
normally
love
these
flavors
its
hard
to
like
them
when
they
stomp
on
the
delicious
citra
hops
however
they
eventually
come
through
and
bring
a
nice
harmony
the
more
i
sip
the
more
the
malts
seem
to
fade
into
the
hops
and
its
more
citra
but
then
they
keep
coming
back
a
bit
on
the
back
end
with
more
straw
and
grainy
flavors
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
could
have
been
a
great
beer
decent
brew
could
put
down
a
few
but
nothing
to
seek
out
considering
all
the

on
the
market

putting

some
really
good
hoppy
offerings
lately

drinkable

this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
on

a

from

walks
the
tight
rope
of

one
to
sit

enjoy

very

by

too
bitter
brewmaster
mike
is
on
a
roll
with
yet
another
great
beer
if
you
loved
kind
ryed
you
will
probably
enjoy
citra
mantra
tasty
highly
drinkable
and
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
12
pack
if
a
such
thing
comes
around
im
not
really
digging
the
malt
profile
on
this
one
it
really
isnt
working
that
great
with
the
citra
it
smelled
great
but
the
taste
was
a
downer
this
is
a
really
similar
beer
to
hop
ranch
i
like
it
better
this
is
a
very
very
tasty
beer
showcasing
citra
hops
front
and
center
overall
it
is
good
and
im
loving
otter
creeks
efforts
lately
but
i
have
to
say
that
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
kings
of
lagering
jacks
abby
with
this
much
citra
i
feel
they
should
have
added
more
malt
body
to
even
it
out
and
boost
the
abv
a
bit
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
more
wellrounded
brew
it
takes
finesse
but
im
confident
that
they
will
tweak
it
over
time
to
make
it
better
id
still
recommend
this
because
its
different
and
different
is
good
pours
a
pale
yellowlight
copper
color
not
too
much
sediment
with
a
nice
foamy
head
smell
is
almost
completely
of
citra
hops
with
a
very
faint
lager
yeast
in
the
distance
however
what
else
would
you
expect
taste
is
certainly
strongly
represented
by
the
citra
hop
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
not
very
malty
to
speak
of
nor
too
bitter
and
slightly
missing
the
lager
aspects
good
and
light
mouthfeel
as
the
citra
hops
dont
at
all
overwhelm
the
palate
in
a
way
it
reminded
me
of
all
day
ipa
yet
distinct
in
its
own
right
i
think
the
lager
components
could
be
improved
however
i
wouldnt
call
this
ocbs
strong
suit
by
any
stretch
as
with
ocbs
past
few
new
brews
i
enjoyed
this
brew
from
the
self
acclaimed
brewmasater
mike
and
i
would
certainly
try
it
again
if
offered
billed
as
a
helles
lager
it
lacks
the
malt
sweetness
found
in
some
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
when
speaking
with
cricket
hill
founder
rick
reed
he
mentioned
the
east
coast
lager
is
pretty
much
all
he
drinks
at
the
brewery
it
is
easy
drinking
and
crisp
so
i
can
see
why
always
the
first
thing
to
start
with
for
the
beginner
at
cricket
hill
better
than
any
budweiser
miller
light
or
coors
you
will
ever
have

real
good
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
its
simplicity
and
its
nice
crisp
drinkability
this
guy
is
a
surprisingly
invigorating
hybrid
of
craft
and
macro
and
we
can
see
how
aspects
of
this
would
be
appealing
to
both
crowds
of
drinkers
there
has
actually
been
a
big
push
for
this
kind
of
thing
lately
at
least
in
michigan
where
we
are
currently
holed
up
with
breweries
like
shorts
it
is
actually
an
interesting
almost
fullcircle
transition
we
are
witnessing
before
our
eyes
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
if
produced
and
labeled
by
a
bmc
would
be
considered
subpar
but
since
its
coming
from
the
smalltime
and
with
perhaps
a
more
interesting
or
robust
use
of
hops
or
some
random
ingredient
we
enjoy
it
with
much
less
conviction
observational
diatribe
over
despite
the
enhancing
bitterness
of
this
beer
with
warmth
and
its
dimming
appeal
it
goes
down
smoothly
enough
and
can
be
enjoyed
o
while
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
it
comes
across
as
being
rather
bland
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
but
not
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
that
i
have
tried
in
my
experiences
in
drinking
craft
beers
there
are
good
flavors
and
aromas
but
the
beer
is
rather
bland
overall
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
high
white
head
smell
is
your
standard
biscuit
and
herbs
with
some
minerals
for
good
measure
its
malty
and
clean
up
front
mildly
bitter
with
a
touch
of
sulfur
in
the
finish
clean
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
all
in
all
a
nice
local
lager
better
than
most
other
such
options
i
can
find
in
a
bottle
will
probably
get
it
again

the
nose
comprises
white

sweet
bread
think
cornbread
without
the
corn
grass
and
a
touch
of
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
an
overarching
sense
of
mildness
pervading
everything
that
may
sound
outwardly
negative
but
it
actually
works
for
this
beer
trust
me
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
nice
little
beer
nothing

major
in

did
not

much
from
this
brew
but
i
actually
enjoyed
it
o
0
for
2
for
cricket
hill
and
not
sure
theyre
going
to
have
another
crack
overall
a
nice
if
not
slightly
above

there
is
big

hops
in
the
middle
for
hop
heads
i
would
probably
get
this
again
if
i
were
more
of
a
hop
head
but
this
in
my
mind
is
just
above
average
for
the
style
o
pretty
average
lager
not
bad
not
great
some
more
carbonation
would
help
make
it
a
bit
more
crisp
and
refreshing
pale

a
fizzy
white
head
that
shrinks
to
a
skim
raw

floral

for
sure
but
flavorful
and
tasty
with
plenty
of
earthy
hop
flavor
and
a
lean
malt
backbone
irony
mineraly
flavors
are
present
light
bodied
with
seltzery
carbonation
a
really
good
and
tasty
example
of
the
style
some
assertive
hop
flavors
in
the
second
half
of
this
sip
make
this
worthwhile
the
bitterness
is
brief
but
refreshing
and
shows
some
zest
and
vitality
missing
in
a
lot
of
american
lagers
biscuit
themed
malts
and
a
mellow
finish
are
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
the
overall
package
is
neat
and
faithful
to
the
style
this
is
reasonably
satisfying
and
i
would
drink
this
again
this
was
shared
with
a
couple
bas
at
work
it
poured
a
very
bmc
esque
bright
and
clear
gold
with
no
head
it
smelled
of
pale
malt
and
tortilla
chips
the
flavor
was
solely
of
tortilla
chips
minus
the
salt
it
had
literally
nothing
else
at
all
going
on
it
was
so
grainy
it
was
ridiculous
it
drank
light
and
smooth
as
it
should
have
it
left
that
annoying
grainy
corn
tortilla
flavor
behind
and
this
beer
has
a
97
rating
on
ratebeer
how
overall
this
is
awful
and
is
a
definite
avoid
enjoyed
4
of
these
on
a
long
round
of
disc
golf
broke
the
other
one
as
it
smashed
to
the
ground
outside
the
elevator
of
my
apartment
beer
in
pockets
moving
in
regrettable
and
unfortunate
decisionmaking
it
is
a
very
pleasant
outdoors
beer
for
a
warm
spring
day
overall
its
drinkable
its
decent
easy
on
the
flavor
but
goes
down
easy
too
i
dont
know
what
has
been
going
on
with
cricket
hills
beers
in
bottles
lately
but
they
have
been
falling
short
on
taste
i
remember
better
tasting
beers
in
the
past
when
i
visited
the
brewery
not
too
long
ago
the
beers
didnt
taste
this
bland
i
dont
know
if
its
the
stores
i
am
buying
from
if
theyre
keeping
them
longer
than
they
should
theyre
no
expiration
dates
on
the
bottles
overall
not
bad
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
i
have
to
admit
this
was
much
better
then
most
it
at
least
had
a
slight
variation
and
some
flavor
to
it
an
easy
choice
for
a
party
or
beach
day
i
dont
know
if
i
would
purchase
again
but
if
i
saw
it
around
i
would
have
no
issue
in
having
one
just
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
first
few
sips
then
it
starts
to
pick
up
and
a
six
pack
later
its
smooth
pouring
it
in
a
frosty
mug
seems
to
help
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
have
been
to
the
brewery
and
even
volunteered
there
their
ipa
is
very
good
and
strong
sure
its
a
nice
bottle
got
a
cricket
on
it
says
east
coast
lager
i
live
on
the
east
coast
i
like
lager
i
must
like
this
this
was
more
of
a
pale
ale
i
like
lager
dont
get
me
wrong
but
this
beer
was
all
hops
with
a
nice
little
bready
hoppy
citrus
match
up
which
really
doesnt
sound
much
like
a
lager
to
me
md
medium
body
easy
to
drink
nothing
fancy
decent
local
lager
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
lighter
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
id
drink
it
again
if
the
no
other
selection
was
calling
out
to
me
its
a
known
quantity
therefore
it
would
be
ok
for
drinking
in
the
future
pours
yellow
gold
with
a
pure
white
head
it
smells
clean
and
smooth
with
a
hint
of
malt
not
a
very
strong
odor
the
taste
is
smooth
and
easy
a
great
drinking
lager
goes
down
smooth
with
a
little
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
a
really
good
summer
drinking
beer
drinkable
not
the
best
lager
ive
had
nor
the

drinking
it
but
given
an
options
i
would
select
another
beer
feels
wonderful
on
the
tongue
and
drinks
like
a
champ
its
like
a
schaefer
with
micro
quality
very
tasty
beer
to
throw
back
on
a
summer

anytime
for
that

this
is
a
good
candidate
lawnmower
beer
it
hit
the
spot
today
on
the
first
warmish
day
weve
had
this
year
pours
slightly
hazy
orangegolden
with
a
slight
bubbly
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
pale
malt
with
a
bitter
orange
background
the
flavor
is
malty
a
bit
toasted
with
a
spritzy
bitter
orange
hop
character
and
a
pointed
bitterness
down
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
light
there
is
a
faintly
syrupy
edge
to
the
mouthfeel
that
is
not
entirely
welcome
overall
not
too
bad
east

lager
is
a
4
0
american
pale
lager
with
hopitude
something
that
isnt
very
common
in
the
world
of
craft
beer
it
goes
without
saying
but
ill
say
it
anyway
this
stuff
is
orders
of
magnitude
better
than
anything
of
this
style
churned
out
by
bmc
d
using
my
rubric
that
a
c
represents
an
average
for
the
style
this
is
slightly
below
average
though
not
bad
by
any
means
not
a
very
impressive
beer
but
i
was
looking
for
something
light
in
the
fridge
very
light
in
color
not
great
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
d
drinks
pretty
decent
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
and
more
interesting
american
lagers
out
there
this
beer
is
good
better
than
say
victory
lager
which
i
didnt
care
for
overall
bland
and
uninteresting
but
at
least
no
offflavors
and
decently
drinkable
when
cold
relatively
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
finishes
crisp
while
its
cold
but
became
tiny
bit
winy
at
the
finish
as
it
warmed
up

sent
this
one
it
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
healthy
white
head
leaving
lacing
all
the
way
down
smells
of
yeast
and
tastes
mildy
of
malt
with
a
biscuity
flavor
too
carbonation
is
just
about
right
very
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
decent
lager
but
leans
a
bit
too
much
in
the
yeasty
direction
poured
had
a
nice
head
off
white
a
yellowish
color
to
the
beer
and
good
amount
of
carbination
sweet
smells
to
the
nose
when
first
tasted
had
a
funk
taste
to
it
then
i
got
used
to
it
good
but
like
any
pale
larger
i
like
it
drinkablity
is
high
even
on
a
hot
day

notes
from
91904
note
to
self
seek
this
one
out
again
to
see
if
it
is
any
different
an
ok
beer
i
could
mow
the
lawn
with
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
pours
light
yellow
some
hops
on
the
nose
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
smooth
light
easy
to
drink
some
malt
not
too
much
presence
but
enjoyable
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
local
beer
bottom
line
this
is
a
nice
lager
tasty
good
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
im
very
happy
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
as
it
is
a
well
brewed
product
imho
id
drink
it
again
no
problem
drinks
easy
nothing
midblowing
here
but
worthy
of
sixer
while
bbqing
or
watching
the
game
d
again
hard
to
rate
higher
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
here
but
seriously
its
unique
and
interesting
for
a
lager
addition
of
the
simcoe
one
of
the
more
interesting
unique
lagers
ive
had
if
i
had
a
kid
i
would
bring
these
to
its
insert
sport
here
game
and
sit
my
lawn
chair
outside
the
fence
so
some
school
official
didnt
bother
me
while
i
drank
them
and
jeered
the
other
kids
for
being
so
much
less
talented
than
mine
and
the
coach
for
not
fully
recognizing
the
sheer
athletic
prowess
of
my
spawn
then
id
go
home
and
drink
more
while
i
berated
my
kid
for
ruining
my
second
chance
at
living
through
them
with
their
obvious
lack
of
hustle
and
focus
pours
a
slight
hazy
golden
color

carbonation
nice
little
foamy
white

which
leaves
some
sticky

i
never
saw
this
brand
before
and
thought
i
would
try
it
wasnt
anything
great
was
ok
wouldnt
buy
it
again
seemed
like
macro
lager
that
i
was
drinking
this
is
better
than
your
average
lawnmower
beer
perhaps
the
smell
was
only
off
on
this
bottle
the
flavoring
was
made
up
for
it
a
great
pale
lager
thats
relatively
fullflavored
and
wellbalanced
the
malts
are
clean
and
biscuity
while
the
hops
are
crisp
with
floral
and
citrus
flavors
the
malt
is
a
touch
grainy
but
not
in
a
bad
way
rather
it
just
adds
to
the
flavor
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
pairing
with
an
opening
course
at
dinner
or
as
a
stand
alone
appetizer
worth
trying

youre

dont

this

pours
a
grassy
yellow
body
with
a
small
white
head
the
retention
is
prettt
fast
but
the
remaining
lacing
is
pretty
good
the
smell
was
very
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
was
not
as
malty
as
the
smell
and
it
tasted
a
little
sweet
like
a
pilsner
the
mouthfeel
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
it
felt
fairly
thin
overall
this
is
an
easy
going
beer
and
very
drinkable
a
little
like
a
czech
pils
but
not
as
sweet
and
definitely
not
as
thick
its
light
and
refreshing
characteristics
makes
it
a
good
beer
to
drink
fresh
bottle
pale
yellow
with
initial
white
fizzy
head
gazzy
overcarbonated
with

in

the
lagerish
taste
is
overwhelmed
by
the

not
much
taste
here
a
tad
hops
and
more
malt
not
finishable
but
perhaps
meat
tenderizer
would
be
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
know
if
the
floral
notes
in
a
lager
esp
this
one
does
it
for
me
not

good

overall
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
have
wanted
to
try
this
brewery
for
a
while
since
it
is
close
to
where
i
am
from
good
effort
a
nice
refreshing
lager
has
a
lot
of
flavor
similarities
to
some
good
american
bitter
ales
with
a
lighter
lager
body
this
makes
it
very
drinkable
it
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
cheers
this
beer
is
like
a
clutch
hitter
the
appearance
smell
and
finish
were
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
there
beer
actually
tasted
pretty
damn
good
cricket
hill
lager
poured
cloudy
with
a
head
thinner
than
nicole
richie
ouch
zinger
the
nose
was
nearly
nonexisten
with
the
exception
of
a
faint
apricot
as
i
tasted
the
beer
i
got
an
initial
hop
bite
that
i
wasnt
expecting
then
the
palate
launched
into
peach
apricot
and
papaya
it
finished
a
tad
syrupy
with
a
slightly
cloying
fruityness
that
lingered
poured
a
golden
translucent
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
thick
white
colored
head
that
remained
intact
for
minutes
aromas
of
hops
malt
along
with
floral
accents
the
taste
was
very
light
and
flowery
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
to
match
the
sweet
malt
the
carbonation
added
texture
to
this
thin
soft
brew
somewhat
refreshing
but
not
complex
or
overly
flavorful
at
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
some
nachos
and
the
two
worked
well
together
a
decent
beer
with
a
soft
character
that
allows
it
to
be
enjoyed
more
than
once
like
other
cricket
hill
brews
theres
nothing
overly
spectacular
about
this
lager
but
it
hits
the
spot
in
a
solid
way
looks
like
it
should
nice
golden
slightly
orangey
color
smells
perfumey
with
some
grassy
hoppyness
going
on
tastes
fruitier
than
expected
with
more
grassy
hops
and
sweet
malts
going
throughout
mouthfeel
was
fabulous
just
lovely
very
drinkable
another
hot
day
thirst
quencher
id
keep
a
few
in
my
fridge
the
beer
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
strawgold
color
that
sits
beneath
a
frothy
pale
cream
colored
head
that
is
an
ample
2
5
fingers
thick
in
my
small
tulip
glass
the
aroma
is
fairly
clean
with
some
spicy
herbal
notes
a
bit
of
lemon
and
a
clean
sweet
grainy
maltiness
for
a
pale
lager
the
aroma
is
pretty
nice
makes
it
seem
refreshing
and
inviting
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
the
beer
is
quite
crisp
with
an
astringent
herbal
hoppiness
that
moves
to
a
nice
bitterness
as
the
beer
passes
through
my
mouth
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
this
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summers
day
it
is
certainly
a
big
step
up
from
your
standard
bmc
i
really
like
the
spicy
lemon
tinted
herbal
hop
notes
in
this
beer
the
key
to
this
beer
is
to
drink
it
pretty
cold
i
cant
see
this
tasting
nearly
as
well
if
i
allowed
it
to
warm
up
to
even
ale
temperatures
as
is
it
is
a
good
rendition
of
the
style
beer
is
good
happy
beering
drinkability
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
no
its
not
awful
but
there
are
far
better
ones
out
there
the
finish
and
mouthfeel
ruined
it
for
me

12
oz

with
a
picture
of
a

no

dating
found
aromas
detected
were
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
skunk
taste
was
malty
with
slight
spice
possible
hint
of
corn
lightly
bitter
finish
with
a
strange
aftertaste
of
raw
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
sure
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
but
why
would
you
an
average
offering
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
very
basic
and
has
no
real
flaws
but
isnt
really
enticing
at
all
either
itd
be
a
nice
brew
to
begin
converting
macro
drinkers
i
think
aside
from
maybe
stocking
up
on
this
for
a
party
to
do
just
that
i
dont
really
think
ill
be
drinking
much
of
this
brew
anytime
soon
our
minds
drift
discovering
all
the
flavors
involved
feeling
a
beer
that
speaks
our
language
when
we
say
lager
honestly
its
so
light
and
unassuming
theres
really
nothing
to
distinguish
it
from
the
masses
of
continental
eurolagers
congesting
the
shelves
perhaps
a
little
maltier
with
a
more
pronounced
apple
flavor
but
i
honestly
feel
like
im
flailing
for
some
kind
of
flavor
theres
really
nothing
there
id
rather
drink
this
because
its
domestic
but
id
prefer
their
american
ale
nothing
id
buy
again
unless
faced
with
a
poor
selection
pours
and
looks
like
a
macro
except
this
has
no
head
and
is
a
bit
cloudy
no
lacing
and
almost
no
carbonation
well
this
experience
has
started
off
poorly
i
must
say
the
aroma
is
faint
with
lemony
grains
with
a
touch
of
honey
malt
the
flavors
come
together
nicely
after
the
first
few
sips
theres
a
decent
maltiness
along
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
clean
drinking
and
enjoyable
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
finishes
clean
this
beer
did
an
about
face
from
just
moments
ago
not
bad
this
beer
was
a
light
yellow
like
very
weak
tea
there
wasnt
much
aroma
maybe
a
little
malt
if
you
tried
real
hard
the
taste
was
kind
of
a
sour
malt
with
a
small
amount
of
herbs
the
second
part
was
so
light
it
was
hard
to
pick
anything
out
its
texture
was
watery
this
one
was
not
so
unpleasant
i
couldnt
drink
it
to
be
polite
but
i
had
to
work
to
finish
the
pint
p
s
slightly
unrelated
but
it
says
jersey
shore
pour
on
the
bottle
i
found
this
strange
being
that
fairfield
nj
is
no
where
near
the
shore
in
fact
its
at
least
an
hour
and
change
away
from
the
closest
beach
hmmm
pours
a
very
clear
and
lightly
golden
with
a
very
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
thin
and
watery
with
barely
a
hint
of
hop
addition
or
malt
for
that
matter
the
first
taste
is
sharp
and
clean
with
a
mild
malt
character
and
a
very
mild
bitterness
this
is
a
very
light
brew
but
also
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
possesses
just
a
bit
of
fruity
zest
through
the
finish
the
body
is
smooth
and
makes
for
an
overall
very
easy
drinking
concoction
a
yellowgold
body
is
capped
by
a
decentsized
head
of
creamy
brightwhite
foam
the
retention
is
good
and
it
keeps
a
thin
surface
covering
throughout
the
glass
leaving
very
nice
lace
as
it
goes
the
aroma
is
fresh
and
inviting
with
floral
hops
entwined
in
bright
grainy
malt
the
body
is
medium
and
its
crispthencreamy
in
the
mouth
due
to
a
very
fine
carbonation
the
floral
hops
promised
in
the
aroma
are
delivered
in
both
flavor
and
firm
bitterness
thats
equally
balanced
by
semirich
grainy
malt
it
finishes
short
and
dry
with
a
lingering
note
of
floralgrassy
hops
very
nice
much
more
of
a
european
lager
than
i
expected
with
a
respectable
amount
of
hops
and
a
solid
maltiness
kudos
pours
a
slightly
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
dense
blanket

excessive
carbonation
is
notable

the
appearance

mouthfeel

of

gives
this
one
its
character
finishes
crisp
and
clean
pours
golden
with
the
same
citrus
aroma
as
out
of
the
bottle
i
found
this
on
tap
not
to
have
as
much
flavor
then
again
it
was
the
first
out
of
the
keg
it
did
get
better
as
i
went
through
it
nothing
is
lost
as
far
as
the
crisp
brew
that
follows
a
unique
lager
that
is
great
to
drink
this
beer
poured
a
beautiful
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
orange
tint
it
smells
a
little
of
citrus
and
hops
but
the
main
scent
is
that
of
malt
this
was
a
great
tasting
beer
with
plesant
bitterness
fair
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
the
dominant
taste
was
grains
but
there
was
a
little
malt
dept
as
well
the
bitterness
was
responsible
for
a
pretty
dry
finish
for
this
one
as
well
as
a
grassy
taste
in
on
the
back
of
the
roof
of
the
mouth
one
more
thing
it
says
in
small
letters
on
the
bottle
and
in
very
large

the
case

available
for
sale
in
new
jersey
hellllll
yesssssssssssssssssss
not
bad
just
didnt
leave
me
wanting
another
seemed
a
bit
thin
glad
i
got
to

i
popped
the

gentle
pour
because
i
did
not
want
to
rouse
any
lees
that
may
have
settled
on
the
punt
of
the

the
lack
of

simply
meant
that
i
had
to
employ
the
bartenders
trick
netting
me
two
fingers
of
tawny

appeared

this

good

it
let

down
a

it

another

really
just
lacks

enjoyable
also
rather
forgettable
overall
the
last
of
beer
camp
to
review
out
of
the
whole
12
pack
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
hope
to
get
a
few
more
pints
interesting
and
enjoyable
i
forgot
i
had
one
more
beer
camp
across
america
pack
finally
cracked
it
open
this
past
week
first
time
drinking
electric
ray
a
collab
ipl
between
sierra
nevada
and
balllast
point
the
beer
is
an
orangish
copper
color
not
quite
clear
with
one
finger
of
fluffy
eggshell
colored
head
very
nice
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
somewhat
muted
which
is
not
surprising
considering
its
age
i
do
get
some
faint
bready
notes
along
with
a
whiff
of
citrus
the
taste
is
pretty
malty
up
front
but
i
get
some
nice
grapefruit
and
slight
pineapple
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
dang
good
beer
considering
it
is
probably
well
past
its
prime
sadly
i
didnt
get
to
taste
one
of
these
fresh
shared
the
other
beer
camp
boxes
im
thinking
it
was
pretty
good
when
fresh
piney
and
bitter
up
front
with
faint
fruit
presence
on
the
finish
standard
but
solid

b
o
a
tasty
brew
for
sure
pours
a
golden

aroma
is
very
faint

no

of
hops
almost
smells
like
nothing
thick
white

guiness
like
consistency
tastes
floral
with
a
hint
of
hops
not
bad
a
good
collaboration
from
sierra
nevada
and
ballast
point
o
this
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
consider
it
a
great
lager
id
like
it
to
be
more
crisp
and
a
cleaner
drink
the
sweetness
really
sticks
especially
with
the
existence
extra
hops
i
am
drinking
the
beer
at
just
over
two
months
old
it
has
a
floral
citrusy
hop
nose
over
light
grains
with
a
slight
sweetness
but
does
not
smell
like
70
ibu
international
bittering
units
a
measure
of
bitterness
it
pours
brilliant
amber
with
a
light
copper
tint
under
a

snow
white
persistent
foam
cap
electric
ray
starts
very
creamy
on
the
tongue
slightly
sweet
with
clean
light
malt
flavors
supporting
citrusy
floral
hops
finishing
dry
with
a
touch
of
astringency
from
the
hops
electric
ray
has
the
lager
cleanness
and
smoothness
but
it
has
bigger
malt
and
a
much
bigger
hop
flavor
and
aroma
the
body
is
bigger
than
a
lager
without
being
fat
or
flabby
the
carbonation
is

everything
is

good

on

overall
considering
the

content
of

5
it
wasnt
too
overwhelming
simply
drink
slowly
a
good
drinking
brew
a
beautiful
active
swirling
pour
yields
a
full
fingers
worth
of
fluffy
crisp
slightly
offwhite
colored
head
the
color
is
a
slightly
pale
medium
gold
loaded
with
medium
paced
carbonation
gobs
of

cling
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
bright
vibrant
aroma
that
can
be
detected
even
without
bringing
ones
nose
to
the
glass
a
nice
sturdy

presence
sits
atop
a
base
of

excellent
balance
the
flavor
is
as
expected

a

cracker
and
biscuit
malts
base
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium

sturdy
and
slightly
chewy
brisk
and
vibrant
carbonation
an
outstanding
beer
all
around
that
i
would
indulge
in
with
regularity
if
this
were
a
year
round
offering
very
nicely
done
kudos
to
both
sierra
nevada
and
ballast
point
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
to
date
though
i
still
have
a
couple
to
go
o
very
interesting
the
way
taste
buds
work
bitterness
should
build
with
this
beer
the
bitterness
fades
on
top
of
that
it
smells
and
tastes
good
overall
a
fine
example
of
the
style
another
beer
i
would
enjoy
regularly
if
it
was
available
o
good
pilsner
hoppy
more
hop
than
not
mouthfeel
is
malty
sweet
at
first
then
lightly

the
finish
bitterness

most
hoppy

one
of
the
best
ipls
ive
had
delaware
so
far
the
beer
camp
series
is
44
in
my
book
no
the
beers
have
not
been
gamechanging
but
if
you
consider
the
logistics
of
the
whole
box
and
read
what
they
were
going
for
in
each
beer
they
are
solid
brews
odecent
collaboration
would
prefer
it
to
be

this

was
amazing

one
of
the
better
brews
from
the
beer
camp
12
pack
overall
i
am
almost
always
disappointed
by
imperial
hoppy
lagers
whether
they
be
imperial
pilsners
or
iipls
and
this
is
no
exception
with
the
overwhelming
sweetness
in
the
malt
bill
competing
with
the
hops
and
masking
the
crisp
finish
that
might
otherwise
be
appealing
in
a
lager
excellent
beer
very
hoppy
and
refreshing
id
buy
a
six
pack
of
these
o
i
can
understand
where
they
might
have
been
trying
to
go
with
this
a
stronger
ipa
but
not
an
ipa
but
i
think
they
missed
the
mark
when
they
decided
to
make
it
as
high
in
alcohol
as
it
is
for
me
a
lower
and
a
lighter
more
balanced
body
would
have
made
this
one
shine
its
not
terrible
but
it
could
have
been
better
pretty
citrusy
with
an
oily
texture
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
not
bad
either
love
this
this
statement
should
not
surprise
anyone
myself
included
but
this
reminds
me
of
torpedo
the
hop
profile
is
similar
except
this
is
more
bitter
this
is
supposedly
a
lager
but
it
really
feels
like
an
ipa
not
just
because
it
is
hoppy
it
really
has
the
mouthfeel
of
a
pale
ale
regardless
this
is
the
besttasting
thing
ive
had
from
the
beer
camp
pack
so
far
not
sure
about
this
one
damn
near
tastes
like
it
was
brewed
with
lime
peels
or
something
d
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
with
this
one
its
light
crisp
and
refreshingly
hoppy
easily
one
of
top
picks
from
the
pack
with
such
fine
balance
could
easily
crush
cans
of
this
one
on
the
regular
please
make
it
so

also
noticeable
body
is
about
average
for

what
more
can
you
ask
than
a
crisp

with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
and
great
drinkability
easily
achievable
2

does
highlight
rustic

are
on
the

lager
malts
are
really
bold
and
totally
overpower
the
hops
as
a
whole
the

rather
piney

really
a
bold

as
described
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
accompanied
by
a
dirty
bitter

overall
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
sold
brew
this
was
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beer
camp
collabs
i
have
had
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
is
really
good
this
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
pack
well
done
overall
a
sparkling
and
bright
tasting
hoppy
beer
the
lager
character
contributes
to
the
clean
crispness
but
the
yeast
throws
me
off
a
bit
i
like
this
a
lot
but
id
rather
drink
a
ballast
point
palate
wrecker
the
taste
has
a
good
mix
of
citrus
with
light
caramel
in
the
malt
and
subtle
pineapple
and
gentle
mango
mix
of
hop
flavor
with
light
yeast
tanginess
with
mild
citrus
tangerine
and
herbal
hops
stand
out
as
the
finish
is
mostly
dry
very
good
india
pale
lager
was
sufficiently
hoppy
with
lots
of
flavor
and
only
mild
sweetness
pretty
smooth
as
far
as
bitterness
goes
very
drinkable
ive
really
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
and
ballast
point
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
beer
is
a
pale
slightly
amber
gold
it
has
a
decent
head
with
good
retention
that
leaves
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
fullbodied
with
big
orange
and
pine
notes
right
up
front
taste
continues
with
bold
hop
and
citrus
presence
as
well
as
a
nice
alcohol
wallop
lurking
in
the
background
not
especially
surprising
from
an
8
5
abv
brew
categorized
as
an
imperial
pale
lager
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
still
pretty
decent
with
a
level
of
carbonation
that
is
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
potent
brew
with
plenty
of
hops
as
i
would
expect
from
these
two
breweries
but
definitely
not
to
be
classified
as
sessionable
lightly
crisp
from
start
to
finish
with
some
drying
late
easy
to
consume
despite
higher
abv
eh
nothing
really
separates
this
from
several
dozen
other
big
ipas
worth
drinking
but
i
was
kinda
hoping
for
more
ok
now
on
to
the
more
important
stuff
taste
love
love
it
nice
lingering
aftertaste
with
a
carryover
of
the
bitterness
that
first
hits
no
shortness
of
malt
all
in
all
my
favorite
of
this
years
offering
so
far
if
they
made
this
in
a
year
round
offering
id
put
it
right
next
to
my
dirt
wolf
7
gubna
o
no
flaws
just
not
much
stands
out
despite
the
high
abv
this
still
feels
like
a
crisp
light
lager
nothing
exception
but
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
that
just
happens
to
have
a
higher
alcohol
content
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
aroma
of
hops
and
malt
sweetness
lager
yeast
just
like
a
hoppy
ale
but
perhaps
more
bready
the
taste
is
big
on
piney
hop
bitterness
nice
and
earthy
standing
up
to
a
fair
to
strong
toffee
like
malt
sweetness
but
with
crispness
of
a
lager
nice
bitterness
full
bodied
for
a
lager
but
not
a
bad
thing
good
strong
carbonation
on
this
one
overall
a
pretty
awesome
lager
from
the
beer
camp
collaborations
id
get
this
again
some
time
oa
decent
beer
especially
for
a
style
im
not
big
on
o
a
very
pleasant
ipl
although
darker
in
color
and
heavier
in
body
than
most
lagers
i
have
had
the
solid
malt
base
well
balances
the
hops
to
make
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
yet
substantial
brew
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
like
the
crisp
lager
feel
and
finish
with
a
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
present
as
well
i
know
this
opinion
is
probably
not
popular
but
i
like
the
malty
presence
of
the
beer
camp
beers
that
ive
tried
thus
far
o
a
smooth
sessionable
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
3
9
overall
great
ipl
could
have
used
more
aroma
but
everything
else
was
spot
on
4
20
lemony
fruity
hops
hit
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
rind
pith
pine
and
resin
the
flavor
is
an
interesting
array
of
divergent
flavors
i
get
honey
tea
leaves
caramel
lime
lemon
toffee
molasses
seltzer
and
some
cracker
or
barley
the
complexity
is
fantastic
but
its
served
in
a
rather
thin
and
light
package
quite
good
but
very
thin
this
is
yet
another
fine
addition
to
beer
camp
a
fairly
bland
ipl
needs
more
malt
body
imo
overall
decent
but
very
malty
o
a
solid
ipl
with
great
hopforward
notes
that
work
nicely
with
the
lager
yeast
and
maltiness
a
bit
more
of
a
sipper
because
its
approaching
9
and
is
certainly
hopforward
a
highlight
of
the
12pack
o
interesting
india
pale
lager
that
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
ipl
good
mix
of
upfront
hop
notes
with
a
nice
lager
backing
overall
a
rather
tasty
double
ipa
overall
a
decent
level
of
dryness
and
crispness
with
a
good
level
of
flavor
and
a
nice
malt
sweet
and
hop
profile
overall
a
rather
nice
drinking
double
ipa
continued
from
my
review
this
beer
is
my
favorite
from
beer
camp
and
ballast
point
i
would
definitely
buy
cases
of
this
gets
a
5
from
me
cheers
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
sudsy
with
a
milky
temperament
that
spiciness
of
the
hops
lives
and
breathes
in
the
carb
excellent
i
like
the
way
they
melded
the
hops
with
the
texture
of
the
malt
can
they
can
it
already
overall
probably
my
favorite
beer
camp
so
far
overall
nice
enough
and
definitely
hoppy
but
it
doesnt
really
hit
my
preferred
flavor
notes
not
exactly
drinkable
unless
youre
chugging
one
to
get
ready
for
friday
night
just
sweet
as
sin
with
a
hoppy
woody
flavor
lots
of
wood
resins
and
something
that
makes
me
think
of
eucalyptus
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
in
san
diego
in
the
2014
beer
camp
12pack
there
are
a
lot
of
aspects
to
this
beer
that
i
really
like
firstly
it
has
wonderful
aromas
of
citrus
and
pine
with
a
slight
tropical
note
it
also
looks
so
nice
when
poured
with
a
thick
frothy
head
and
a
light
amber
body
my
first
taste
threw
me
off
a
little
but
that
is
just
because
i
dont
drink
many
ipls
it
still
has
a
very
solid
and
bright
taste
due
to
the
hops
however
it
finishes
with
a
classic
malt
flavor
that
adds
some
depth
to
it
overall
its
a
great
beer
overall
bleh
you
call
this
a
lager
this
has
no
lager
qualities
at
all
malt
profile
is
meh
hops
are
even
more
meh
barely
even
enjoyable
this
is
a
kinda
beer
that
seems
like
a
noob
slapped
together
random
hops
and
malts
to
make
this
beer
o
a
nice
ipl
from
ballast
sn
would
drink
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
somewhere
the
body
was
smooth
and
reasonably
full
which
was
something
of
a
surprise
given
the
lack
of
malt
on
the
palate
drinkability
was
nice
but
the
bitter
finish
was
a
bit
unpleasant
overall
a
nice
enough
brew
but
like
others
from
this
box
its
oneanddone
for
me
overall
this
is
easily
the
best
of
the
bunch
through
the
first
third
of
the
box
subtle
yet
assertive
somehow
dry
while
leaving
the
impression
of
sweetness
this
is
what
an
ipl
should
be
like
in
my
opinion
i
would
likely
buy
this
one
as
a
regular
offering
o
damn
good
and
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get

year

is
very
light
but
clean
and
refreshing
some
grassy
and
light
floral
hop
is
present
beer
is
well
crafted
but
the
taste
is
not
desirable
to
me
it
seems
just
light
and
bland
with
a
balance
and
light
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
a
second
sip
and
smell
brings
the
hoppiness
into
play
now
getting
some
resin
and
pine
but
still
it
tastes
at
the
finish
not
so
desirable
once
finished
the
glass
is
smothered
in
beautiful
lace
probably
would
not
buy
this
again
o
good
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
on
a
moderate
body
however
the
feel
feels
foamy
instead
of
smooth
and
feels
a
little
off
overall
an
okay
collaboration
and
worth
getting
once
overall
its
a
bit
overly
sweet
and
i
dont
care
for
the
hop
character
d
this
is
really
good
and
drinks
super
easy
only
had
a
few
of
the
variety
brews
thus
far
but
this
is
definitely
high
up
on
my
list
o
a
nice
hopforward
beer
from
the
beer
camp
box
doesnt
quite
deliver
the
way
id
expected
presents
a
good
beer
but
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
with
so
many
similar
beers
out
there
part
of
the
beer
camp
compilation
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
and

pours
a
clear
dark
golden
color
with
plenty
of
white
froth
some
bright
pineycitrus
hop
notes
on
the
nose
ipl
is
a
strange
breed
i
thoroughly
enjoy
the
hops
on
this
guy
but
like
most
ipls
the
super
hoppy
lager
is
just
odd
nice
carmely
malts
with
that
very
forward
citrus
hop
presence
light
mouthfeel
not
bad
overall
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
these
something
just
isnt
harmonious
here
but
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
aroma
of
green
citric
hops
and
a
faint
whiff
of
ethanol
along
with
some
muddled
light
caramel
notes
taste
is
smooth
and
similar
in
nature
bit
of
spritzy
citrus
up
front
lightly
oily
in
the
middle
and
finishing
with
a
brief
linger
of
hop
spice
firm
in
feel
and
lightly
coarse
in
nature
yet
creamy
at
the
same
time
given
the
hop
balance
warming
brings
forth
more
robust
and
resinous
hop
notes
and
a
fuller
less
oily
feel
smoooth
and
easy
the
initial
waft
of
ethanol
is
now
masked
by
the
hop
charge
i
suspect
well
be
seeing
this
one
again
nicely
done
yep
i
would
like
to
see
this
brewed
up
as
maybe
a
seasonal
offering
and
hopefully
other
reviews
will
see
this
point
and
agree
and
they
do
it

drinkable

super
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
prob
my
fav
so
far
in
the
set
best
of
the
hoppy
brews
for
me
o
this
beer
has
the
hoppy
flavors
you
would
expect
from
an
ipl
and
finishes
very
clean
o
i
was
trying
to
compare
this
with
fathom
originally
if
i
were
to
do
that
fathom
would
win
but
on
its
own
this
can
stand
pretty
well
my
issue
is
that
it
feels
a
little
too
much
like
a
dipa
i
like
the
clean
taste
the
lager
yeast
provides
but
this
is
a
little
heavier
than
that
on
its
own
though
its
tasty
very
dangerous
too
at
8
o
im
really
falling
in
love
with
hoppy
pilsners
because
they
are
far
and
few
between
but
are
a
still
hoppy
but
just
different

12oz

yet
a

on

side
i
am
absolutely
shocked
this
beer
is
8
5
dangerously
drinkable
and
tasty
overall
one
of
the
best
of
the
pack
hoping
this
gets
made
again
oi
had
some
reasonably
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
i
didnt
love
the
direction
sierra
nevada
and
ballast
point
went
with
here
delightful
worth
a
try
o
theres
shades
of
nugget
nectar
in
this
one
particularly
in
how
the
hops
are
featured
upon
further
research
the
mystery
ingredient
i
couldnt
pin
was
oats
that
definitely
explains
the
nice
body
but
i
did
find
the
earthystarchiness
to
be
a
bit
distracting
in
both
taste
and
smell
not
enough
to
undermine
a
solid
effort
though
this
was
still
a
satisfying
brew
overall
a
good
flavorful
and
sweet
ipa
a
little
much
for
all
the
citric
notes
the
malts
and
added
spices
still
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
id
want
too
many
of
these
in
one
session
o
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
halloween
in
a
candy
corn
kind
of
way
its
sweet
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
big
orange
flavor
theres
enough
hop
bitterness
to
provide
some
balance
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
too
sweet
and
not
complex
enough
for
me
to
make
it
a
regular
if
that
were
even
possible
a
good
but
not
stellar
take
on
the
style
hopped
like
a
pro
which
is
expected
and
appreciated
overall
this
really
started
off
well
but
the
beer
just
comes
off
too
boozy
and
it
really
seems
to
destroy
much
of
its
hinting
impressive
quality
you
think
is
coming
its
crisp
and
maltydry
finish
is
creamy
light
and
and
of
waferthin
bread
with
an
unmasking
grain
bite
piquant
in
its
lingering
bitterness
a
tangy
wine
juniper
and
spruce
character
leaves
lasting
impressions
pours
a
nice
medium
amberish
gold
color
the
liquid
has
excellent
clarity
fine
bubbles
in
the
head
which
is
pure
white
theres
a
little
bit
of
lacing
and
the
head
has
ok
retention
for
a
lager
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
malt
and
hops
the
malt
is
honey
with
light
caramel
rather
sugary
floral
pine
and
citrus
hoppiness
citrus
is
probably
the
strongest
of
the
three
mostly
grapefruit
it
smells
like
pine
needles
and
grapefruit
rind
in
honey
with
a
dose
of
lager
yeastiness
the
taste
is
similarly
on
the
sweet
side
the
beer
dries
out
some
in
the
finish
but
its
a
bit
too
big
for
its
own
good
in
my
opinion
theres
a
fair
bit
of
malt
character
more
of
that
sweet
honeyed
grain
flavor
citrus
and
pine
hop
character
with
only
moderate
bitterness
some
booze
very
nice
mouthfeel
light
on
the
palate
for
the
abv
fairly
easy
to
drink
almost
crisp
some
hop
oiliness
i
just
think
the
sweetness
and
booze
creeps
in
a
bit
too
much
particularly
if
you
let
it
warm
up
at
all
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
hopforward
lager
and
definitely
one
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
i
wish
i
came
across
more
quality
ipls
there
is
a
slightly
present
alcohol
to
this
beer
but
it
seems
to
fade
as
the
beer
warms
up
very
easy
to
drink
o
a
fine
ipl
worth
seeking
out
more
balanced
than
an
average
american
ipa
this
may
lack
the
hop
hit
desired
by
some
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
across
america

o
not
a
fan
of
how
this
one
was
done
for
one
thing
it
might
as
well
be
an
ipa
with
a
lot
of
bittering
hops
i
dont
get
as
much
of
that
characteristic
crisp
breadiness
that
comes
with
lagers
it
simply
gets
boozy
as
it
warms
and
the
hops
altogether
seem
to
be
solely
for
bittering
id
like
more
contribution
to
aroma
rather
than
just
plain
bitterness

being

its
not

just

in

out
there
the
appearance
was
dark
yellow
with
a
good

the
smell
was
mostly
hops
but
had
some
toasted

and

the
taste
was
straightforward
with
a
mellow
beginning
and
a
crisp

with

the

was

i
would

although
you
would
never
know

o
not

much

and
a
lack

the
alcohol
hurt
the
beer
for
me
personally
a
decent
brew
certainly
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
worth
trying
o
a
very
good
ipl
it
has
a
bright
effervescent

and
flavor

very
citrus
heavy
mostly
mango
and
pineapple
the

drying
with

the

is
that
it
is
a
touch
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
that
certainly
doesnt
make
it
bad
though
seek
and
enjoy
overall
drinkable
and
tasty
this
is
an
interesting
beer
theres
a
very
slight
homebrewtasting
element
to
the
hops
but
maybe
thats
just
my
own
palate
making
assumptions
otherwise
its
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
strength
i
could
find
myself
accidentally
quite
wrecked
on
this
stuff
o
this
could
have
been
very
very
good
with
a
better
hop
profile
the
miss
was
the
lack
of
citrus
notes
in
the
taste
the
nose
was
terribly
weak
as
well
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
could
have
been
so
much
better
the
flavor
has
a
rounded
hop
character
with
just
enough
malt
on
it
to
let
it
shine
theres
a
drying
finish
as
well
another
enjoyable
one
the
second
bottle
i
tried
was
even
more
delightful
than
the
first
o
this
is
a
nice
sweet
and
hoppy
ipl
just
wish
the
abv
was
toned
down
a
bit
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
hops
i
was
expecting
a
bigger
hop
presence
o
very
drinkable
ipl
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
but
this
was
good
im
still
surprised
by
the
8
5
abv
i
didnt
see
it
until
after
i
finished
it
pours
a
barely
foggy
amber
minimal
head
bland
nose
beer
seemed
thick
syrupy
and
off
the
mark
at
first
thankfully
things
get
back
on
track
fairly
quickly
the
hops
start
to
show
through
in
a
decently
spiced
way
the
body
still
retains
a
degree
of
syrupy
thickness
which
continues
to
be
a
detractor
for
me
to
be
honest
but
what
is
there
is
still
a
pretty
nice
drinker
i
still
liked
the
previous
two
better
than
this
one
though
12oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
overall
this
is
excellent
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
12
pack
is
half
as
good
as
this
12
ounce
bottle
part
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
12pack
served
in
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
goldenamber
color
with
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
long
time
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
floral
and
citrusy
grapefruit
tropical
fruit
hops
and
some
caramel
and
bready
malt
i
think
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
its
all
floralcitrus
hops
and
caramelbready
malt
theres
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
brew
but
unfortunately
i
liked
it
less
the
longer
i
drank
it
pours
into
a
becker
a
deep
orange
hued
medium
golden
with
a
great
looking
full
two

white
head

settles
very
slowlyjust
a
great
head
with
a
slower
pour
caramel
and
sweet
dough
with
a
little
booze
mixed
with
some
piney
hops
in
the
back
endiam
a
little
surprised
by
the
extent
of
the
booziness
flavors
of
sweet
dough
and
more
booze
with
some
cutting
spicy
and
piney
hops
in
the
finish
i
like
itits
a
little
sweeter
than
most
for
the
style
but
i
like
it
just
the
same
25
for
12
beers
ouchies
as
a
ballast
point
fan
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
bought
the
mix
pack
i
was
a
little
let
down
nice
coppery
orange
color
decent
head
that
lacked
retention
real
nice
nose
smells
like
good
weed
malty
taste
underscored
with
hops
i
can
taste
the
booze
but
theres
no
burn
medium
body
solid
one
off
but
not
the
best
ballast
point
beer
overall
4
25
not
everything
is
perfect
about
this
beer
but
its
goddamn
solid
in
pretty
much
every
single
regard
id
rank
this
up
there
with
the
best
ipls
out
there
personally
and
its
awesome
to
see
sierra
nevada
granted
with
ballast
point
in
tow
nail
a
lager
if
only
this
could
be
a
regular
release
excellent
as
expected
o
im
not
sure
what
was
going
on
in
this
one
but
i
wasnt
a
fan
the
hop
varieties
didnt
work
for
me
or
something
big
chunky
foam
kicks
up
over
a
golden
beer
sticky
clumps
of
lace
cling
to
the
glass
attractive
smells
of
citrus
pith
and
pine
resin
and
a
hint
of
hay
pretty
classic
taste
is
moderately
bitter
citrusy
grapefruit
pith
to
a
bit
puckering
the
malt
is
pretty
minimal
so
the
hop
oils
are
rather
intense
almost
coming
off
as
garlic
or
oniony
at
times
body
is
medium
mouthfeel
is
average
good
experiment
but
not
something
id
buy
again
alright
beer
number
2
out
of
the
pack
i
love
ballast
point
its
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
right
now
this
beer
is
about
like
its
cousin
fathom
i
understand
this
is
a
collaboration
but
sierra
nevada
is
doing
this
to
bring
what
the
individual
breweries
in
the
pack
do
showcasing
them
if
you
will
this
is
not
ballast
points
best
effort
but
it
is
much
better
than
the
first
one
i
tried
from
the
much
lauded
three
floyds
this
is
a
hoppy
lager
its
a
fine
beer
the
aroma
is
there
but
if
you
look
at
reviews
including
my
own
about
fathom
you
will
get
a
pretty
good
picture
of
what
this
beer
is
all
about
the
only
difference
is
that
this
one
is
a
bit
more
boozy
than
fathom
its
a
solid
beer
but
i
am
hoping
there
is
a
knock
your
socks
off

coming

because
of
the

again
this
was
a
nice

ipl
i
could
drink
this
anytime
one
of
my
beer
camp
favorites
overall
fantastic
beer
ballast
has
some
great
beers
and
this
one
proves
it
once
again
this
is
a
clear
copper
beer
with
a
tiny
initial
head
that
fades
very
quickly
the
nose
offers
an
abundance
of
piney
hop
scent
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
quite
bitter
lots
of
typical
americanhop
flavor
good
malt
balanceactually
its
hard
to
write
this
review
because
theres
nothing
special
about
this
beer
its
a
generic
ipa
with
a
lager
yeast
which
does
little
to
make
it
stand
out
its
basically
the
same
as
a
thousand
other
ipas
ive
had
in
the
past
o
pretty
decent
nice
and
fresh
with
high
alcohol
content
but
too
strong
i
like
it
o
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
overall
the
lager
aspects
could
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
its
still
nice
overall
i
have
never
been
that
impressed
with
imperialdouble
lagerspilsners
or
india
pale
lagers
this
is
kind
of
a
cross
between
those
two
but
it
is
a
slam
dunk
i
love
this
beer
and
it
shows
that
extreme
lagers
can
work
possibly
my
favorite
from
the
box
so
far
love
me
some
ballast
point
and
love
me
some
ipl
this
is
excellent
blonde
and
hoppy
well
carbonated
biscuity
insanely
light
for
how
strong
it
is
alcoholically
and
just
a
supremely
well
made
beer
overall
that
makes
the
box
almost
worth
it
regardless
of
the
other
eleven
beers
i
thought
so
anyway
looks
dead
sexy
in
a
teku
glass
with
a
nice
white
ring
on
top
and
rising
bubbles
even
time
i
flick
the
glass
active
and
clear
there
is
just
enough
pilsener
type
malt
to
give
backbone
for
the
muscular
hops
to
be
supported
by
but
they
dont
need
much
help
here
this
is
the
hoppiest
beer
in
the
box
ive
had
im
about
seven
beers
into
it
clean
finishing
floral
and
still
somehow
delicate
without
being
aggressively
bitter
or
harsh
in
any
way
i
would
never
had
known
it
was
so
strong
either
aside
from
the
buzz
it
amplified
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
id
love
to
see
this
one
become
a
full
time
offering
from
either
brewery
its
that
good
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
fruit
and
candied
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
nice
crisp
citrus
forward
hop
characteristics
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
pours
out
a
light
copper
body
with
a
moderate
head
nose
is
clean
yeast
soft
caramel
and
loads
of
citrus
hops
big
on
grapefruit
flavor
is
very
smooth
yeast
is
really
clean
malts
give
a
toasty
caramel
flavor
middling

hops
are
very
oily
tons
of
grapefruit
and
a
touch
of
orange
blossom
floral
character
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
full
with
a
creamy
yet
slightly

beer
wish
it
had
a

but
its
well

12
oz
fresh
bottle
pour
into
mini
pilsner
glass
head
is
light
in
body
with
big
bubbles
and
a
khaki
froth
staying
around
color
of
the
beer
is
between
gold
and
chestnut
brown
has
decent
amount
of
malt
detected
with
a
little
roastiness
not
much
on
the
nose
a
little
fruit
such
as
apple
and
pine
needles
to
bring
in
some
earthiness
taste
is
apple
pine
a
little
grapefruit
some
malted
notes
such
as
cocoa
and
carmel
to
finish
with
the
hops
drinks
a
lot
like
a
maibock
with
slightly
more
piney
and
citrusy
notes
in
there
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
good
for
the
lager
yeast
style
dry
finish
and
very
nice
balance
of
fruitiness
and
mildness
of
the
yeast
lends
to
a
good
mouthfeel
and
finish
overall
should
pair
nice
with
some
german
foods
such
as
brats
mustard
veal
and
pretzel
overall
an
above
average
beer
in
my
opinion
but
i
can
see
why
some
would
like
it
its
an
okay
representation
of
the
style
not
that
i
have
much
to
compare
it
to
it
certainly
isnt
in
the
same
league
as
humulus
lager
if
i
were
you
i
would
give
it
a
shot
though
but
only
if
you
like
in
your
face
hops
o
i
thought
this
was
very
good
i
love
the
crispness
of
a
good
lager
paired
with
the
ipa
qualities
overall
this
is
and
exceptional
ipa
that
i
wish
we
could
drink
most
frequently
but
im
afraid
this
is
it
picked
up
a
12
pack
of
the
beer
camp
this
is
my
6th
pick
out
of
the
pack
and
it
is
so
far
my
favorite
pours
a
dark
copper
and
a
bit
of
head
but
i
pour
slow
smell
is
a
typical
ipa
floral
and
grapefruit
which
is
in
the
taste
also
this
is
simply
a
great
collaboration
and
i
wish
i
could
find
a
12
of
this
by
itself
an
enjoyable
imperial
lager
another
well
executed
collab
between
two
awesome
breweries
nothing
particularly
outstanding
just
a
well
brewed
tasty
big
hoppy
beer
o
i
have
no
problem
with
a
hoppy
lager
what
i
do
have
a
problem
with
is
imperial
lagers
that
are
lacking
in
malt
body
and
thats
what
this
is
the
mouthfeel
especially
suffers
in
this
attempt
at
a
high
gravity
highly
hopped
lager
o
a
good
start
to
this
years
camp
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
sixer
of
this
if
it
were
available
in
that
format
now
which
one
should
i
try
next
feels
crisp
and
clean
with
hoppy
ipa
properties
again
a
mild
taste
of
citrus
and
grass
clippings
slightly
resinous
with
a
lingering
dry
bitter
aftertaste
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
series
in
my
opinion
overall
a
fantastic
example
of
an
ipl
though
there
arent
1000s
to
choose
from
like

cheers
clear

with

also
has
flavors
of
citrus
floral
hops
and
bread
finishes
dry
with
a
very
mild

very
well
done

and
can
really
tell
its

flavors
bitterness
and

character
with
notes
of

and
slight

this
moves
into
a
balanced

with

mingling
with

of

and
hints
of
alcohol
with
a

quite
similar
to
an
ipa
with
very
little
indication
of
the
lagering
making
it
through
the
hops
and
high
abv
still
quite
nice
and
very
balanced
between
a
high
level
of
bitterness
and
sweet
malt
which
lends
the
beer
its
moderate
bitterness
level
overall
and
its
complexity
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
silky
feel
very
nice
and
quite
easy
to
drink
masking
its
abv
nicely
overall
this
is
a
good
hoppy
beer
it
balances
the
hops
and
malt
nicely
in
the
flavor
and
has
a
pleasant
aroma
and
mouthfeel
that
make
it
quite
pleasant
to
drink
a
good
effort
from
two
great
breweries
overall
ipa
or
ipl
hard
to
tell
as
its
one
of
the
heavier
and
more
flavorful
ipls
ive
had
to
date
guess
well
have
to
take
the
brewers
word
for
it
in
any
event
its
pretty
good
though
frankly
i
see
more
sierra
nevada
influence
in
this
beer
than
ballast
point
o
interesting
and
enjoyable
the
abv
is
hidden
but
does
creep
up
pours

almost
clear
light
orange

not
a
fan
of
the
ipl
or
ipa
but
overall
this
isnt
the
worst
ive
had
smell
is
sweet
and
flowery
taste
is
not
harsh
isnt
giving
that
lock
jaw
effect
no
lingering
bitter
on
the
back
of
the

appearance
is
a

with

very
solid

kick

this
is

no

at
all
i
liked
this
better
as
a
sample
on
tap
but
its
still
very
very
tasty
quite
different
likely
than
what
you
might
expect
a
very
good
beer
perhaps
a
bit
oversweet
but
with
nicely
balanced
bitterness
and
a

with

almost

that
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
tastes
medium

im
quite
impressed
by
the
hop
flavors
in
this
one
im
familiar
with
both
sierra
nevada
and
ballast
point
hopped
beers
and
this
is
nothing
like
either
an
interesting
and
complex
hopping
i
think
if
this
was
a
bit
more
floral
it
could
actually
get
cloying
but
i
did
not
get
tired
of
tasting
this
if
this
went
into
production
it
would
be
on
my
rotation
list
i
seem
to
like
this
more
than
most
reviewers
but
this
one
really
hit
all
the
buttons
for
me
very
nice
overall
a
really
cool
beer
to
try
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
to
be
8

especially
for
a
lager
very

very

its

this
lager
was
pretty
good
it
was
not
what
i
expected
it
was
lighter
than
i
thought
that
it
would
be
it
smelled
really
good
as
well
the
taste
was
not
that
bad
i
know
that
i
liked
it
if
anyone
has
not
had
this
beer
they
should
try
it
out
that
is
if
you
like
this
kind
of
beer
it
had
a
golden
look
to
it
i
know
that
i
have
always
liked
shiner
beers
so
if
their
are
anymore
out
their
that
i
have
not
had
i
cant
wait
to
try
them

the
taste
started
out
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
with
sweet
malt
but
finished
a
little
on
the
dry
side
overall
it
wasnt
that
great
o
overall
a
light
blonde
lagger
noting
special
but
refreshing
o
this
seriously
needs
more
hoppiness
to
it
whats
sad
is
that
this
missing
feature
is
all
that
stands
between
shiner
blonde
being
just
another
crappy
aal
which
it
is
and
a
wholly
solid
prepro
pils
a
shame
really
overall
an
uneventful
adjunct
lager
quaffable
however
standard
macro
lager
tastes
more
like
a
light
lager
meh
where
it
really
falters
is
charging
more
than
other
bmc
quality
stuff
decent
enough
to
give
someone
without
feeling
really
embarassed
but
dont
bother
buying
these
in
quantity
pick
up
some
pbr
olympia
rolling
rock
etc
they
all
do
the
same
thing
but
this
is
a
little
more
expensive
for
some
reason
this
beer
is
better
than
major
brand
x
lite
but
not
by
a
lot
o
wow
i
figured
out
of
all
in
the
variety
sixer
i
got
this
would
only
be
enjoyable
to
drink
in
order
to
quench
my
thirst
after
an
intense
workout
but
its
not
even
accomplishing
that
for
me
this
is
not
what
beer
is
supposed
to
be
like
its
like
they
didnt
even
try
thats
because
of
how
low
the
alcohol
was
which
i
never
tasted
or
felt
from
start
to
finish
session
beers
dont
get
much
of
obvious
than
this
and
had
i
bought
another
it
would
have
gone
down
just
as
easily
afterwards
its
nice
to
find
a
brew
of
this
style
without
the
fillers
that
the
massmarket
beers
consist
of
here
is
just
an
unassuming
beer
that
goes
down
nicely
without
much
thought
and
once
in
a
while
that
can
be
a
great
thing
i
may
give
this
a
go
again
in
the
summer
the
aroma
is
so
mild
as
to
be
almost
nonexistent
the
flavor
is
mild
and
on
the
malty
side
this
is
a
very
light
beer
really
a
nice
one
for
what
it
is
kind
of
a
high
class
lawnmower
beer
if
you
will
pleasant
enough
goes
down
easy
a
nice
clean
crisp
lager
it
was
worth
trying
if
you
like
a
basic
beer
its
a
good
lawnmower
beer
or
a
substitute
for
aals
its
not
much
to
write
home
about
though
there
are
many
other
beers
at
the
same
price
point
that
are
better
popping
the
top
its
a
bit
of
adjunct
smell
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
with
wispy
white
head
that
disappears
in
an
instant
taste
has
a
bit
of
grape
and
yeast
but
fades
to
a
weak
grape
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
apparently
carrying
the
lack
of
backbone
not
a
keeper
a
decent
enough
drink
a
blonde
with
a
shiner
is
never
a
good
combination
in
real
life
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
relatively
shortlived
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mildly
funky
wheat
light
grass
and
a
touch
of
wholekernel
corn
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
with
more
corn
which
is
now
even
sweeter
than
before
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
limp
blonde
barely
a
stepup
from
your
average
adjunct
lager
i
suppose
a
taste
test
would
reveal
whether
this
is
better
than
keystone
but
well
probably
never
know
from
the
12
oz
bottle
as
part
of
the
family
reunion
sixpack
overall
drinkability
just
a
badbelow
average
beer
overall
the
body
was
nicely
full
for
the
style
but
yet
stayed
crisp
even
and
clean
drinkability
was
very
nice
the
beer
went
down
quickly
and
easily
overall
a
nice
little
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
probably
worth
throwing
a
sixer
in
the
fridge
to
have
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
lighter
mediumish
body
lighter
than
expected
carbonation
nothing
to
really
recommend
this
brew
except
it
is
better
than
the
megabrew
offerings
overall
quite
simple
and
easy
drinking
if
looking
for
a
session
brew
or
when
looking
for
something
very
simple
then
this
will
work
just
fine
mouthfeel
its
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
where
i
was
expecting
it
shiner
blonde
reminds
me
a
lot
of
labatt
blue
it
is
a
simple
straight
ahead
allmalt
lager
that
isnt
really
memorable
for
about
a
buck
a
bottle
you
cant
complain
as
it
beats
out
nearly
every
adjunt
lager
and
will
suffice
in
washing
down
some
food
i
may
come
back
to
this
in
the
shiner
variety
pack
even
though
there
isnt
much
variety
as
it
offers
a
lot
of
acceptable
beers
at
a
low
price
single
finger
head
with
better
than
expected
retention
and
decent
lacing
on
a
bright

lots
of

with
grain
notes
for
the

flavor
is
very
light
with
more

minimal
malt
presenece
and
a
sharp
bitter
note
which
comes
and
goes
as
it
rests
on
the
palate
light
body
and
high
carbonation
this
one
is
very
bland
and
plain
refreshing
and
no
bad
after
taste
but
unimaginative
its
good
i
had
been
looking
for
an
everyday
beer
since
strohs
committed
suicide
by
aquiring
schlitz
and
ruining
themselves
i
bought
a
6
of
bottles
and
was
quite
happy
with
the
overall
product
a
very
good
crisp
taste
that
does
not
linger
on
well
after
the
drink
this
is
not
a
beer
snob
beer
its
a
working
guys
beer
another
from
the
shiner
variety
6
pack
a
pretty
decent

cant
ask
for
much
more
from
a
blonde
5
00
body
is
on
the
light
side
and
the
carbonation
is
crisp
the
refreshing
feel
of
the
beer
and
the
overall
dryness
made
it
a
very
nice
choice
on
a
broiling
sunday
afternoon
during
a
backyard
barbeque
maybe
a
little
watery
but
thats
to
be
expected
i
think
certainly
nothing
profound
here
but
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
an
easy
drinking
quencher
overall
this
beer
has
little
flavor
and
was
hard
to
finish
since
it
was
so
bland
average
bland
macro
maybe
some
extra
sweetness
and
metal
it
would
be
a
session
beer
that
could
be
refreshing
on
a
really
hot
freakin
day
otherwise
it
isnt
worth
a
crap
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
sessionable
but
really
nothing
super
special
or
interesting
about
this
beer
i
think
it
would
be
super
easy
to
drink
outside
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
in
texas
d
basic
sort
of
lager
sort
of
straddles
style
too
flabby
for
a
pils
not
rich
enough
for
a
dort
some
almost
cream
ale
traits
but
it
drinks
alright
it
would
be
a
fair
to
good
hot
day
beer
and
it
does
have
enough
spine
for
some
milder
food
overall
comes
across
as
a
amer
light
beer
nothing
like
a
belgian
blonde
it
is
hard
to
believe
there
is
a
light
version
of
this
beer
suitable
as
a
dining
beverage
or
thirst
quencher
overall
i
liked
it
i
didnt
expect
to
like
it
but
i
did
this
was
a
decent
beer
with
more
flavor
than
i
expected
from
this
style
serving
type
bottle
o
not
too
impressed
got
this
in
a
reunion
sixer
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
somewhere
and
see
if
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
pours
the
color
of
straw
with
a
finger
length
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
very
mild
but
i
could
pick
up
some
malt
the
taste
is
fairly
crisp
and
clean
and
the
hop
flavor
is
mild
if
i
had
to
sum
up
the
taste
id
say
it
was
fairly
average
the
mouthfeel
was
light
this
is
an
average
beer
overall
i
picked
this
up
as
part
of
the
shiner
family
reunion
six
pack
this
is
in
the
league
of
bud
light
coors
light
etc
except
a
bit
better
i
could
see
kicking
back
a
few
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
texas
summer
day
beer
pours
a
light
golden
yellowish
color
with
light
head
and
foam
brew
smells
sweet
and
light
with
a
nice
malty
taste
to
finish
it
off
very
surprisingly
good
beer
worth
a
try
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
barbeque
or
a
light
meal
this
is
one
of
the
better
blondes
i
have
tried
in
some
time
its
not
too
expensive
so
its
worth
a
try
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
produced
a
clear
straw
color
a
average
white
head
and
there
was
some
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
corn
and
malted
barely
light
in
body
this
lager
was
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
the
taste
of
fresh
grain
appears
but
not
much
else
there
is
maybe
a
dash
of
hops
added
clean
brew
nothing
exciting
but
that
is
more
of
a
result
of
style
if
i
had
my
choice
to
drink
this
or
budweiser
i
would
choose
this
one
however
that
doent
say
much
ok
session
beer
good
summer
beer
prost
this
lets
down
the
family
reunion
six
pack
the
kosmos
reserve
lager
is
miles
better
tastes
like
a
pretty
legit
pale
lager
its
a
lot
better
than
shiner
blonde
light
that
stuff
was
terrible
im
not
really
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
cant
really
find
anything
wrong
with
it
its
boring
as
hell
but
its
a
bit
above
average
if
anything
maybe
ive
been
drinking
too
many
adjunct
lagers
because
this
tastes
almost
good
sorry
i
cant
be
more
helpful
i
just
dont
drink
a
lot
of
american
pale
lager
this
one
seems
good
for
what
it
is
o
a
less
than
spectacular
beer
but
about
par
for
the
course
for
the
style
overall
if
you
take
this
beer
and
put
it
up
against
the
cheap
adjuncts
it
comes
out
crisper
and
more
refreshing
than
most
all
of
them
great
beer
for
picnics
crab
feeds
etc
i
really
like
the
lightness
and
refreshness
of
this
one
probably
the
best
shiner
beer
ive
sampled
to
date
overall
remarkably
underwhelming
for
the
price
i
could
have
paid
less
money
and
gotten
a
whole
bunch
of
other
beers
that
pretty
much
taste
the
same
i
do
not
think
i
will
be
buying
it
again
but
if
it
was
a
hot
day
and
i
was
offered
one
id
still
drink
it
its
still
beer
in
all
honesty
this
beer
sucks
however
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
its
definitely
better
than
your
average
bmc
oa
good
beer
for
its
class
very
light
i
would
drink
this
kind
again
if
i
was
thirsty
for
it
ill
probably
not
be
having
this
one
again
as
it
is
just
too
much
like
a
lite
beer
for
my
tastes
i
got
this
as
part
of
the
family
reunion
variety
pack
but
its
not
something
i
really
have
any
desire
to
drink
again
overall
pretty
much
the
lightest
blonde
i
ever
had
so
it
will
be
the
base
line
as
such
might
give
the
rest
to
my
friends
d
simple
watery
and
low
quality
its
drinkable
and
slightly
better
than
most
macros
but
that
aint
saying
much
o
not
too
bad
of
a
lawnmower
beer
not
much
aroma
or
flavor
but
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
would
probably
grab
over
any
bmc
o
overall
kind
of
underwhelming
and
forgettable
situation

macrodrinking
friends
overall
impression
very
easy
to
drink
but
would
probably
sway
to
other
blonde
ales
available
nothing
against
you
guys
spoetzl
but
this
just
wasnt
a
huge
hit
for
me
ill
stick
to
all
the
other
brews
in
the
line
up
i
wish
there
was
more
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
just
thin
and
bland
i
just
dont
get
how
i
use
to
like
shiner
beers
i
bought
the
variety
pack
and
it
has
a
shiner
blonde
in
it
the
beer
appearance
is
very
average
and
boring
the
smell
has
a
slight
amout
of
corn
and
malt
the
taste
is
of
wheat
and
really
not
much
else
the
mouthfeel
too
me
is
kind
of
below
average
it
has
a
decent
amout
of
carbonation
and
sort
of
burns
overall
this
beer
is
not
good
i
have
never
cared
for
anything
spoetzl
and
this
doesnt
help
their
case
d
well
its
what
i
expected
but
it
sure
is
drinkable
light
crisp
lowish
abv
though
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
o
not
bad
at
all
better
than
most
macros
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
shiner
bock
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
this
one
is
good
too
dr
easy
for
the
type
cold
is
best
a
better
bmc
lager
the
appearance
and
smell
just
are
ordinary
the
taste
is
a
matter
of
its
own
it
tasted
somewhat
stale
like
youd
see
in
cheap
lagers
that
you
always
avoid
the
aftertaste
is
strong
and
not
very
pleasant
for
me
its
almost
tasting
like
stronger
version
of
coors
light
or
tecate
light
all
and
all
a
drinkable
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
personally
would
prefer
this
beer
over
any
of
the
other
mainstream
pale
lagers
out
there
the
fruity
qualities
are
a
nice
bonus
this
was
a
very
refreshing
brew
that
is
perfect
for
a
hot
day
my
pour
created
a
big
fluffy
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
this
was
a
greg
koch
special
to
be
sure
nose
had
a
light
lagerlike
honey
sweetness
underlain
by
a
very
light
sulfurous
odor
but
nothing
terribly
untoward
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
and
the
immediate
taste
in
the
mouth
was
of
metal
followed
by
a
lager
sweetness
did
i
get
this
out
of
a
can
no
but
i
definitely
tasted
metal
and
that
was
not
pleasant
finish
was
less
obtrusive
but
i
still
had
that
metallic
tang
in
mouth
well
after
the
swallow
i
cannot
remember
whether
i
liked
it
in
the
can
but
if
my
scores
were
better
than
from
a
bottle
stick
to
a
can
overall
this
is
just
a
poor
showing
tastes
sour
and
drinks
to
full
and
not
crisp
and
refreshing
enough
for
the
style
despite
the
lack
of
malt
body
flavor
this
is
a
very
forgettable
beer
maybe
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
its
not
a
beer
you
want
to
enjoy
for
flavor
ill
pass
next
time
oone
step
above
an
adjunct
lager
its
really
not
too
bad
its
fairly
boring
but
also
pretty
refreshing
its
not
something
i
would
necessarily
get
again
however
if
i
had
to
drink
it
i
wouldnt
be
too
upset
not
a
blond
i
would
tell
anyone
about
o
i
dont
like
bashing
beers
but
this
one
just
doesnt
have
what
it
takes
i
have
had
other
shiner
styles
that
i
like
but
this
one
not
so
much
summary
this
definitely
isnt
shiners
best
brew
there
is
just
nothing
special
or
memorable
about
it
a
decent
choice
if
you
enjoy
a
lighter
beer
every
now
and
then
apple
juice
looking
beer
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
but
no
head
no
lacing
nothing
a
light
fizzy
yellow
beer
smell
was
very
faint
and
almost
nonexistent
peach
and
maybe
some
spice
grainy
paper
thin
and
watered
down
this
almost
got
poured
down
the
drain
but
i
decided
to
give
it
a
fair
shot
still
not
working
for
me
if
you
are
on
this
site
dont
get
this
beer
overall
blonde
is
kind
of
an
overstatement
in
what
this
is
doing
unless
its
a
dumb
blonde
joke
i
expected
better
from
shiner
barely
better
than
an
average
macro
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
straw
color
not
a
bad
head
but
it
dissipates
quickly
light
aroma
little
bit
of
husky
grain
and
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
more
of
the
same
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
a
step
up
flavor
wise
from
the
macro
lagers
but
not
by
too
much
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
or
maybe
a
good
bridge
beer
for
not
craft
drinkers
overall
average
pale
lager
but
without
major
flaws
and
certainly
quite
drinkable
in
my
opinion
one
of
shiners
better
offerings
theres
nothing
exciting
happening
here
but
nothing
too
terribly
off
either
the
light
body
makes
it
go
down
easily
o
not
very
representable
of
the
style
rjt
o
exactly
as
advertised
really
light
and
refreshing
would
take
this
over
a
bmc
lightlite
any
hot
texas
day
i
think
ill
pass
on
the
light
blonde
that
just
came
out
though
this
ones
light
enough
already
o
probably
best
as
a
lawnmower
beer
just
an
average
pale
lager
honestly
i
think
this
was
my
favorite
shiner
just
due
to
the
fact
that
i
consider
it
a
lawnmower
beer
and
it
accomplishes
that
goal
handily
the
fancier
shiners
just
fall
way
short
of
their
goal
while
this
one
seems
to
have
hit
its
desired
mark
overallif
i
was
thirsty
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
cold
just
for
the
hell
of
it
besides
that
this
beer
is
close
to
not
even
being
beer
drain
poured
half
way
through
cause
not
even
worth
it
next
beer
overall
not
worth
it
for
the
price
would
make
for
a
good
lawnmower
beer
if
the
price
was
right
maybe
6
a
six
pack
or
less
okay
so
i
got
it
in
a
shiner
mixed
6
so
maybe
this
particular
brew
would
be
cheaper
than
the
mixed
6
was
but
the
mixed
6
was
the
same
price
as
the
bock
and
102
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
just
average
in
every
way
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
some
lemon
and
slight
grassiness
up
front
followed
by
a
bit
of
bread
doesnt
scream
blonde
to
me
more
like
a
slightly
sweeter
pilsner
in
character
easy
drinking
but
not
memorable
if
you
are
looking
for
complexity
of
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
definitely
not
your
beer
however
there
is
a
certain
purity
to
the
brew
that
makes
it
a
great
laid
back
summer
beer
the
color
is
very
light
very
thin
and
not
a
ton
of
taste
however
this
beer
will
never
surprise
of
overwhelm
you
only
retain
a
crisp
and
refreshing
finish
good
both
warm
and
cold
shiner
brews
are
definitely
growing
on
me
o
a
very
easy
drink
but
almost
no
flavor
incredibly
dissapointed
by
this
beer
will
not
try
again
there
is
very
little
character
to
this
like
most
beers
this
style
but
it
is
well
brewed
pure
clean
crisp
refreshing
drink
a
bunch
and
you
will
be
fine
but
you
will
need
to
pee
flavors
not
too
hoppyand
maybe
a
little
flat
in
taste
in
short
i
guess
i
have
tasted
worse
never
the
most
exciting
style
but
hey
it
was
part
of
the
mixed
12
pack
to
be
honest
though
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
lots
of
lively
bubbles
taste
is
light
to
medium
bodied
nice
crispness
to
it
finishes
nice
and
clean
with
a
tinge
of
hop
bite
nothing
special
but
as
far
as
blonde
ales
go
you
cant
do
much
better
nice
easy
drinker
on
a
hot
day
overall
drinkability
one
of
the
crappier
shiners
almost
refreshing
but
not
quite
something
is
lacking
overall
for
the
style
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
it
tastes
more
like
a
pilsner
than
an
adjunct
beer
i
could
have
several
on
a
hot
day
it
has
a
very
clean
taste
to
it
if
i
were
not
grading
to
style
though
i
suspect
this
would
be
about
a
3
25
overall
a
decent
beer
it
serves
its
purpose
as
a
light
beer
but
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
one
could
use
a
little
more
taste
on
the
back
end
as
well
overall
yeah
yeah
refreshing
and
all
but
its
subdued
and
subtle
to
a
fault
never
really
satisfying
overall
overall
one
of
the
better
apls
ive
had
id
definitely
take
this
over
a
macrobrew
any
day
thats
for
sure
overall
impression
looks
and
smells
can
be
deceiving
this
one
was
pretty
enjoyable
actually
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
for
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
body
with
a
1
finger
head
which
dwindles
to
a
very
small
trace
of
bubbles
sitting
on
the
body
not
too
much
in
the
nose
pretty
much
just
generic
beer
smell
taste
is
alright
with
a
light
cornmalty
flavor
and
very
loght
hop
finish
not
too
much
special
about
this
beer
refreshing
but
just
beer
summary
this
is
an
average
beer
i
gave
it
7
110
or
c
i
havent
tasted
very
many
different
beers
but
this
one
has
a
unique
taste
i
havent
experienced
before
i
can
taste
hops
topped
with
sweet
malts
but
theres
some
flavors
i
cant
identify
here
it
looks
tastes
and
feels
like
a
pale
lager
to
be
quite
honest
im
a
little
disappointed
in
shiners
most
prized
beer
i
was
just
expecting
more
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
often
but
not
one
i
would
turn
away
either
this
is
an
middle
of
the
road
beer
beings
as
it
lacks
real
flavor
i
would
not
keep
it
on
hand
or
buy
it
again
for
that
fact
for
myself
however
the
beer
coming
from
spoetzl
is
cheaper
than
some
crafts
and
quite
a
bit
better
than
macros
in
having
to
bring
beer
to
a
bbq
this
would
be
a
good
choice
and
considering
some
of
my
friends
dont
drink
craft
and
would
likely
bring
a
bmc
being
4
4
and
smooth
this
beer
is
a
great
sessioner
for
such
gettogethers
good
beer
spoetzl
brewery
pass
notes
what
you
would
expect
from
an
average
pale
lager
nothing
exciting
and
dominated
by
cooked
vegetable
and
corn
flavor
pours
a
very
pale
yellowish
color
with
the
scent
of
grassy
grains
has
a
very
nice
blend
of
different
grains
and
wheats
in
its
taste
finishes
with
a
nice
smooth
taste
and
a
light
feel
not
to
much
craft
in
it
but
if
you
are
a
millerbud
drinker
during
the
summer
give
this
a
try
instead
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
a
tad
mild
some
malts
and
sweetness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
b
this
is
a
dainty
airy
beer
id
almost
call
it
a
beer
for
those
looking
for
a
beer
without
all
that
beer
taste
to
it
id
call
it
a
session
beer
but
frankly
it
is
too
light
for
that
not
saying
it
is
bad
just
that
it
is
insubstantial
12
ounce
bottle
one
of
the
6
brews
in
shiners
family
reunion
6pack
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
aroma
is
sweet
malt
grain
and
corn
the
aroma
isnt
bad
at
all
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
but
the
with
sweet
malt
being
the
strongest
thing
that
i
can
taste
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
grainy
finish
like
the
aroma
it
doesnt
taste
bad
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
its
not
a
beer
i
would
make
a
point
to
seek
out
but
if
someone
gave
me
a
bottle
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
d
a
pretty
generic
blonde
ale
not
bad
but
not
particularly
good
either
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
one
overall
much
like
the
light
but
lighter
not
much
here
to
talk
about
a
local
though
more
expensive
version
of
the
big
crap
beers
my
girlfriend
suggested
that
it
tastes
like
a
betterquality
bmc
i
have
to
agree
because
i
can
actually
taste
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
this
beer
very
drinkable
taste
more
like
an
adjunct
lager
than
american
pale
lager
allmalt
notes
this
seems
to
be
a
very
average
beer
allaround
it
is
clean
and
simple
what
you
would
expect
from
a
good
blonde
ale
i
prefer
blonde
bombshell
over
this
one
for
a
blonde
ale
but
this
is
very
drinkable
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
its
a
little
lacking
in
aroma
but
overall
taste
and
drinkability
make
up
for
it
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
subtle
i
may
get
a
little
grain
but
the
beer
hardly
has
any
aroma
at
all
the
flavor
is
grain
wheat
grass
and
corn
nothing
too
special
and
really
not
too
appetizing
medium
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
not
one
of
the
better
beers
from
shiner
d
just
enough
flavor
for
a
light
refreshing
treat
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
little
too
bubbly
could
stand
to
smooth
out
a
bit
as
far
as
flavor
goes
this
is
decent
some
nice
crisp
citrus
slight
corngrains
finishes
creamy
and
sweet
not
bad
at
all
it
accomplished
what
i
wanted
it
to
refreshing
and
it
hit
the
spot
this
is
far
better
than
the
macro
lagers
out
there
decent
crossover
beer
for
the
inquisitive
drinkability
not
too
strong
of
an
after
taste
easy
to
come
back
to
but
probably
not
worth
favoriting
d
eh
mediocre
at
best
not
something
id
seek
out
but
would
make
a
good
beer
pong
beer
or
something
for
a
baseball
game
other
than
that
bland
and
boring
and
not
very
blonde
like
at
all
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
it
tasted
like
a
run
of
the
mill
mass
produced
light
beer
personally
i
will
never
bother
with
this
one
as
it
has
nothing
to
offer
me
shiner
tx
can
keep
it
i
sure
hope
the
locals
in
shiner
tx
chill
this
beer
really
cold
because
i
cant
imagine
the
horrors
of
a
merely
cool
one
on
a
hot
day
in
southcentral
texas
ratings
are

nothing
wrong
with
the

pretty

for
the

down
easy

nothing

here
good
beer
though
im
appreciating
it
more
because
its
over
a

degrees
out
drinkability
surprisingly
i
enjoyed
this
beer
easy
to
sip
on
with
enough
character
to
make
me
enjoy
each
sip
i
have
plenty
of
other
beers
that
id
prefer
over
this
but
this
was
a
bottle
worth
trying
through
a
trade
d
pretty
drinkable
low
abc
and
the
flavors
are
not
too
bad
overall
pretty
average
notes
will
not
be
buying
this
one
again
and
not
sure
ill
be
finishing
it
drinkability
this
is
craft
i
call
bs
on
that
for
the
same
price
of
this
6pack
i
could
have
bought
a
12
of
stag
which
has
10x
the
flavor
drinkability
no
fanks
didnt
even
finish
the
first
one
this
is
a
total
lawnmower
beer
and
i
bet
would
quench
quite
nicely
in
the
summer
heat
it
also
would
wash
down
some
spicy
hot
wings
or
jalapeno
poppers
pretty
nicely
drinkability
a
nice
easy
drinking
sessionable
lager
i
got
a
six
pack
and
would
do
so
again
not
a
big
abv
sipping
beer
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
its
a
good
watching
the
game
or
sitting
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
beer
average
lawnmower
beer
this
one
isnt
going
to
be
for
the
craft
lover
but
at
least
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
aluminum
can
i
guess
better
than
a
macro
lager
but
not
by
a
whole
lot
mouthfeel
was
medium
drinkability
was
excellent
and
perfect
for
lawnmoer
mania
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
my
pilsner
glass
was
out
of
regular
pint
glasses
it
was
part
of
a
6
brew12
bottle
variety
pack
from
shiner
had
a
lot
of
tiny
rapidly
forming
bubbles
that
created
a
very
thin
layer
on
the
top
of
the
beer
not
a
very
strong
taste
but
also
not
an
offensive
taste
my
nonbeer
drinking
friends
would
probably
drink
this
beer
professionals
would
not
be
too
impressed
with
the
flavor
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
as
an
afternoon
beer
with
lunch
since
it
is
also
rather
light
d
not
too
flavorful
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
not
filling
at
all
since
there
isnt
much
substance
to
it
very
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
it
seems
like
one
of
those
beers
that
is
designed
to
be
poundable
but
while
its
light
enough
for
that
role
i
didnt
find
it
to
have
the
kind
of
flavor
id
care
for
even
in
a
lighter
beer
m
and
d
light
and
dry
body
makes
this
a
good
beer
to
consume
quickly
for
gaming
reasons
if
need
be
d
i
guess
its
an
easy
drinker
if
you
like
it
not
much
here
though
i
was
suprised
since
i
like
the
other
shiner
brews
ive
tried
d
it
is
what
it
is
d
not
much
to
get
excited
about
with
this
swill
will
not
purchase
again
bottle
poured
a
golden
blond

lager
with
a
medium
pure
white
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
sweet
floral
malt
with
light
crisp
hops
notes
taste
is
more
enjoyable
then
i
had
expected
with
floral
and
dry
notes
well
balanced
body
is
about
average
with
ok
carbonation
better
then
i
had
expected
nothing
bad
just
a
bit
too
subdued
drinkability
go
elsewhere
while
i
could
down
a
few
of
this
in
short
order
there
are
cheaper
beers
out
there
that
do
the
job
just
as
well
if
youre
looking
more
for
a
tasty
drink
go
elsewhere
too
theres
very
little
of
that
here
thanks
exiled
surprised
how
much
i
liked
it
considering
that
it
is
rather
light
in
the
taste
department
but
i
like
the
beers
from
shiner
and
this
one
is
no
exception
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
mediumlow
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
however
im
not
sure
if
its
unpleasant
or
if
its
somehow
linked
to
the
taste
which
makes
it
unpleasant
either
way
im
not
liking
it
d
i
could
tak
or
leave
this
honestly
but
it
is
true
to
the
style
and
has
many
qualities
i
expect
from
a
blondemainly
refreshment
and
it
is
a
quencher
foremost
sessioning
extremely
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
drinkability
its
not
horrible
but
its
not
all
that
great
theres
better
beers
within
this
style
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
looks
like
an
american
macro
lager
being
a
clear
goldenstraw
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
and
millions
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
nondescript
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
and
weak
faded
hops
slightly
skunky
the
taste
reveals
more
of
the
skunkiness
tastes
like
many
generic
pale
euro
lagers
ive
had
skunkiness
and
all
grainy
and
one
dimensional
two
if
you
count
the
skunk
i
have
nothing
positive
to
say
about
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
just
a
touch
of
tongueburning
carbonation
overall
a
beer
that
would
be
easy
to
drink
if
you
wanted
to
but
as
the
flavor
stands
im
not
sure
why
you
would
stick
with
shiner
bock
a
much
better
beer
drinkability
i
feel
like
the
flavor
comes
in
like
two
unbalanced
notes
its
not
horrible
and
this
is
not
my
style
of
choice
but
this
is
really
just
middle
of
the
road
sessionable
but
i
doubt
i
would
choose
it
d
drinkability
is
the
strength
of
this
beer
it
can
be
enjoying
in
large
amounts
without
hangovers
but
dont
drink
two
or
three
at
a
barbecue
in
alpine
or
marfa
in
may
or
have
a
few
during
your
stay
in
big
bend
national
park
this
is
a
great
texas
backyard
beer
d
this
is
the
high
point
of
the
beer
i
would
call
this
a
lawnmower
beer
as
this
is
more
of
a
refreshing
drink
on
a
hot
day
than
anything
pours
light
yellow
with
no
head
aroma
of
pilsner
malt
clove
and
a
little
fruity
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
pale
flavors
and
light
hops
thinking
that
this
was
the
same
as
spoetzls
first
brew
from
1919
makes
it
a
bit
more
interesting
but
its
not
much
different
from
a
macro
lager
a
good
alternative
to
bmc
drinkability
overall
not
too
impressive
it
tastes
pretty
good
but
isnt
too
great
for
much
else
is
a
good
choice
for
outdoor
texas
barbecue
though
id
drink
it
again
although
probably
not
regularly
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
grain
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
grain
and
a
hint
of
citrus
overall
not
an
exciting
blonde
at
all
more
of
a
regular
lager
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
notes
the
lack
of
carbonation
combined
with
the
light
flavors
is
a
little
weird
i
can
see
this
being
a
summer
beer
in
the
yukon
mainly
though
i
think
this
is
a
beer
intended
to
appeal
to
people
who
dont
drink
beer
in
fact
ive
known
people
who
disliked
all
beer
but
this
one
i
suppose
it
fills
a
useful
market
niche
but
its
really
not
for
the
beer
geek
verdict
blonde
is
certainly
not
the
most
complex
or
exciting
beer
in
the
shiner
lineup
but
i
dont
think
it
was
ever
meant
to
be
this
is
pretty
much
shiners
take
on
the
american
macrostyle
lager
and
the
result
is
certainly
a
little
more
interesting
than
the
offers
from
the
big
three
this
works
well
as
a
gateway
beer
for
the
budmillercoors
set
d
is
drinkable
great
for
sitting
by
the
pool
or
enjoying
outdoor
activities
d
i
did
not
care
too
much
for
this
beer
below
average
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
thin
line
of
bubbles
for
a
head
looks
rather
thin
a
standard
american
lager
smell
some
sweet
honey
malt
and
hop
a
sweet
malt
flavor
and
earthy
hop
finish
a
slightly
bitter
finish
from
the
hop
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
before
the
carbonation
kicks
in
drinkability
is
ok
the
flavor
is
extremely
light
and
unsubstantial
a
few
hints
of
light
malt
are
about
the
only
things
i
can
taste
it
has
less
flavor
than
the
shiner
light
it
is
crisp
smooth
and
refreshing
absolutely
no
off
flavors
are
present
its
a
well
crafted
beer
but
the
lack
of
body
and
flavor
are
disappointing
very
pale
yellow
thin
white
head
that
disappears
real
quick
like
although
it
does
leave
some
thin
lace
smells
faintly
of
corn
and
grain
very
thin
malt
profile
with
a
really
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
puts
this
above
bmc
but
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
much
fairly
high
carbonation
actually
as
it
warms
there
is
a
bit
more
maltiness
to
this
than
i
thought
this
would
make
one
hell
of
a
lawnmower
beer
but
there
are
cheaper
lawnmower
candidates
out
there
especially
during
a
hotter
day
this
beer
is
hard
to
beat
for
drinkability
its
perfectly
quenching
and
easily
sessionable
the
lack
of
interest
though
doesnt
really
entice
me
to
drink
more
d
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
d
compared
to
the
other
blondes
made
in
texas
this
one
is
disappointing
just
below
average
ok
on
a
hot
day
i
guess
but
id
rather
have
a
southern
star
or
real
ale
version
of
a
blonde
ale
drinkability
its
not
a
bad
drinker
at
all
despite
my
comments
above
the
abv
is
perfect
for
sessioning
and
it
has
enough
flavour
not
to
bore
you
to
death
i
notice
a
lot
of
people
selecting
this
brew
but
i
cant
really
understand
why
it
does
nothing
for
me
the
finish
is
starkly
brisk
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
i
was
expecting
much
better
this
is
easily
the
worst
beer
in
a
case
of
shiner
family
reunion
including
the
lights
id
probably
reach
for
an
old
milwaukee
before
this
its
not
undrinkable
though
but
it
damn
sure
isnt
my
favorite
d
when
i
drink
pale
yellow
fizzy
lager
i
prefer
shiner
blonde
d
for
what
i
would
normally
consider
a
crappy
beer
its
very
drinkable
if
i
hold
my
nose
i
could
down
a
few
six
packs
pours
an
insanely
pale
color
it
looks
like
watered
down
lemonade
not
even
sure
if
i
have
seen
a
beer
with
this
little
color
before
has
no
head
either
pretty
boring
overall
smell
is
decent
has
more
of
a
belgian
wit
aroma
to
it
than
a
lager
but
it
is
pretty
decent
overall
taste
is
alot
like
the
smell
closer
to
wit
than
a
lager
but
its
pretty
average
drinkability
is
the
best
part
its
light
and
relatively
refreshing
so
having
a
few
of
these
is
no
problem
overall
a
decent
beer
for
me
this
is
the
classic
beer
for
showing
someone
what
is
the
next
step
up
from
the
bmcs
not
bashing
them
but
not
much
flavor
in
them
this
one
is
mild
enough
to
start
someone
on
their
journey
to
better
beers
for
me
its
a
very
rare
changeup
beer
if
im
at
a
place
with
limited
selection
or
if
im
having
beer
newbies
over
blah
after
being
somewhat
surprised
with
shiner
light
i
thought
this
could
be
enjoyable
nothing
i
will
revisit
when
shiner
light
is
much
better
hmm
shiner
isnt
hit
or
miss
its
hit
all
the
time
for
me
but
tasting
this
again
is
a
little
weird
i
found
a
shiner
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
could
be
mixed
in
with
a
typical
american
macro
lager
as
its
on
that
level
golden
yellow
quite
translucent
head
pours
big
and
foamy
then
is
gone
in
seconds
some
bubbles
keep
coming
up
from
the
bottle
of
the
glass
if
it
werent
for
them
id
guess
the
beer
was
flat
smell
is
lemon
more
cleanerlike
than
fresh
lemon
though
taste
is
humdrum
with
corn
flavors
that
blend
into
a
mild
bitterness
some
of
that
lemon
is
still
there
too
mouthfeel
is
quite
lacking
very
little
carbonation
really
thin
i
think
the
macros
have
better
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
not
too
good
i
think
ill
keep
these
in
the
fridge
for
friends
atmosphere
is
okay
flavor
is
decent
yet
subdued
feel
is
pretty
generic
all
this
makes
for
a
light
but
somewhat
flavorful
drinkable
brew
decent
quaff
overall
not
as
bad
of
a
beer
as
i
thought
it
would
be
definitely
a
little
watery
and
bland
but
not
a
terrible
beer
overall
a
good
example
of
an
american
lager
nothing
else
mouthfeeldrinkability
i
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
shiner
but
this
beer
falls
well
short
of
what
i
expected
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
body
with
virtually
no
head
white
has
a
slightly
skunky
malty
aroma
a
very
light
skunky
taste
fizzy
malty
taste
fresh
tasting
slightly
dusty
palate
not
too
complex
of
a
flavor
drinkability
pretty
bland
and
unexciting
but
that
is
what
this
style
is
all
about
easy
drinking
and
certainly
wouldnt
scare
off
any
macro
drinkers
overall
like
an
american
light
beer
in
the
worst
way
possible
no
thanks
o
its
quite
drinkable
for
its
style
not
great
not
poor
it
would
be
good
if
it
had
more
body
to
it
not
shiners
best
product
but
is
actually
a
good
beer
for
a
grill
out
and
a
good
choice
for
an
intro
into
craft
beers
d
nothing
much
is
really
here
id
drink
it
at
a
party
if
it
was
the
best
of
a
poor
selection
but
i
wont
buy
it
knowing
this
breweries
rep
for
poor
looking
brews
i
gave
this
one
an
aggressive
pour
out
of
the
bottle
still
very
little
head
no
retention
and
no
lacing
the
liquid
itself
was
a
clear
bleached
golden
color
the
nose
was
weak
pilsnerlike
malt
and
a
minerallike
quality
similar
to
what
one
gets
out
of
canned
beer
for
an
allmalt
lager
this
was
rather
washed
out
pale
malts
and
some
bread
but
no
hops
balance
and
not
enough
punch
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
however
the
higher
carbonation
helped
to
fill
in
the
thin
body
typical
overall
for
a
macro
lager
but
their
original
bock
beer
is
better
watery
that
just
about
explains
this
beer
if
it
werent
so
watered
down
it
might
be
ok
but
definately
not
a
good
showing
from
spoetzl
drinkability
is
moderate
flavor
isnt
too
great
but
its
not
repulsive
either
there
are
plenty
of
other
lagers
that
i
would
much
prefer
before
this
one
though
d
drinks
down
quick
and
easy
for
when
you
wanna
drink
something
light
that
isnt
offensive
d
this
could
have
passed
for
coors
in
a
blind
taste
test
very
bland
and
boring
stuff
really
pours
the
palest
of
pale
yellows
with
a
thin
finger
of
head
that
hangs
for
all
of
five
second
before
leaving
no
lacing
this
has
some
skunky
aromas
along
with
some
mild
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
even
more
bland
than
the
nose
it
taste
of
wimpy
malts
and
some
wierd
mineral
flavorslike
licking
a
dry
rocksome
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
tailbut
not
enough
to
get
excited
about
the
body
is
thin
and
is
ok
for
a
blondebut
then
there
is
this
overpowering
wave
of
carbonation
that
is
borderline
offensivevery
dry
finish
that
doesnt
suit
this
very
well
on
to
somthing
better
i
hope
poured
a
dark
golden
color
into
a
glass
minimal
head
to
the
beer
smell
was
weak
in
other
words
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
as
for
the
taste
also
rather
bland
sort
of
a
corn
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
was
not
bad
but
not
much
of
anything
as
i
have
stated
before
shiner
beers
are
mass
craftmicro
above
average
verus
bud
light
but
noth
against
much
else
slightly
sweet
corn
smell
well
carbonated
slight
corn
taste
up
front
quickly
dissipating
muted
simple
taste
overall
and
not
very
bitter
at
all
nothing
too
pronounced
and
a
short
finish
overall
i
thought
this
was
decent
for
the
style
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
a
try
but
wait
for
a
sale
pretty
good
beer
for
what
it
is
poured
this
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
glass
the
color
was
a
blonde
color
as
the
bottle
refers
the
smell
was
a
bit
hoppy
but
sweet
while
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
more
robust
than
say
your
average
macro
it
is
a
quality
beer
i
would
be
able
to
enjoy
this
one
year
round
i
would
commend
shiner
for
once
agian
hitting
the
nail
on
the
head
with
their
beer
i
like
pilsner
style
beers
so
this
one
appealed
to
me
lighter
in
color
and
taste
than
say
a
pilsner
urquell
thin
head
with
a
whiff
of
hop
aroma
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
much
better
than
the
usual
run
of
the
mill
massed
produced
lagers
from
the
us
i
like
shiner
beers
and
i
like
this
one
overall
not
too
bad
i
know
this
is
mean
but
honestly
it
is
quite
similar
to
a
regular
bud
i
feel
like
they
dont
quite
cut
the
corners
as
bad
as
ab
but
they
are
shooting
for
the
same
basic
end
product

of

clear

leaving

interest
in
qualitytasteful
beer
not
really
a
pilsener
guy
so
maybe
i
am
prejudiced
but
i
found
nothing
special
in
this
brew
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
or
memorable
if
you
want
a
good
shiner
beer
try
the
bohemian
black
lager
schwarzbier
decent
head
dissipated
quickly
standard
fare
pilsener
taste
not
their
best
effort
a
good
choice
if
you
want
a
pale
american
lager
but
dont
want
the
bmc
pours
a
typical
clear
bright
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
head
aroma
is
malty
and
of
average
strength
flavor
is
malty
and
on
the
thin
side
no
complexity
it
feels
a
little
watery
rather
like
a
light
beer
it
is
nice
and
smooth
but
not
particularly
delightful
to
drink
not
really
sure
what
to
say
about
this
one
got
it
at
a
barbecue
after
having
a
very
tasty
anchor
liberty
ale
almost
an
incredibly
average
beer
oxymoron
color
is
golden
macrolager
color
with
a
minor
head
that
dissolves
very
quickly
nose
is
mild
mostly
grain
and
malt
taste
is
likewise
unexceptional
feel
is
a
little
thin
bodied
i
dunno
its
one
i
would
and
did
drink
at
any
barbecue
but
not
if
something
else
is
available
its
also
so
i
hear
insanely
cheap
here
which
gives
it
a
couple
points
in
my
book
d
good
drinkability
this
would
be
a
good
choice
if
you
dont
want
to
stop
and
reflect
on
the
beer
youre
drinking
you
just
want
to
put
a
cold
one
back
speaking
of
which
i
recommend
this
one
straight
from
the
fridge
4045f
cheers
d
it
is
an
okay
beer
it
just
lacks
in
flavor
compared
to
other
allmalt
lagers
jon
drinks
really
easy
but
kind
of
tasteless
a
step
up
from
bmc
though
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
light
clear
straw
forming
a
thin
1
inch
head
with
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
with
some
light
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
a
slight
hop
presence
a
little
malt
and
alot
of
grain
flavor
light
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
bad
beer
this
reminds
me
alot
of
st
pauli
girl
but
without
the
overpowering
skunkiness
but
in
the
end
its
just
okay
pours
a
crystal
clear
darker
straw
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
subtle
and
inviting
the
doughy
yeast
characters
came
out
first
with
the
head
as
it
fades
it
leaves
a
grainy
and
malty
smell
with
some
sweet
notes
the
taste
is
the
same
very
subtle
crisp
and
clean
better
than
your
average
macro
but
not
by
too
much
easy
drinker
nice
mouthfeel
good
with
just
about
anything
a
beer
for
all
people
not
offensive
but
nothing
spectacular
this
one
is
good
when
you
just
want
a
nice
american
lager
enjoy
shiner
blonde
is
a
beer
that
offers
a
few
good
points
as
well
as
a
few
negative
points
almost
equally
balanced
between
the
two
its
dominate
flavors
of
yeast
sweet
malted
barley
corn
and
cereal
grains
and
the
crisp
finish
remind
me
of
many
other
standard
beer
products
its
one
of
those
take
it
or
leave
it
type
of
beers
one
that
wont
offend
and
that
most
will
find
acceptable
but
not
one
that
stands
out
in
any
positive
way
shiner
blonde
is
a
standard
golden
lager
with
a
shortlived
white
head
it
does
leave
some
nice
lace
at
the
outset
and
a
sulphury
lager
aroma
its
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
medium
body
the
flavor
delivers
a
subtly
sweet
straightforward
and
mildly
grainy
malt
thats
lightly
infused
with
a
nondescript
hop
flavor
mostly
floral
and
a
touch
spicy
but
muddled
and
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
its
wellmade
readily
accessible
and
fairly
drinkable
with
the
exception
that
it
lacks
enough
complexity
to
compel
you
to
have
another
d
not
awful
but
not
worth
it
with
so
many
gret
beers
out
there
i
dont
think
i
will
have
this
again
pretty
easy
to
drink
sessionable
as
well
not
much
too
this
beer
just
a
light
fizzy
beer
that
probably
goes
well
in
the
summer
with
a
bbq
serve
cold
pours
light
golden
with
a
three
finger
head
of
white
soap
bubbles
excellent
clarity
decent
retention
and
nice
spotty
lacing
extra
pale
malt
in
the
nose
with
some
mild
hops
mabye
cluster
overall
clean
aroma
pale
malt
sweetness
upfront
clean
lager
flavor
with
a
hint
of
kolsch
yeast
character
semidrying
aftertaste
again
a
low
alpha
hop
flavor
and
meak
bitterness
the
timid
flavors
do
balance
and
it
is
very
pleasent
on
the
tounge
light
in
body
with
an
effervescent
carbonation
finshes
soft
with
just
a
touch
of
altkolsch
yeast
and
pale
malt
a
superb
hotweather
quencher
too
bad
its
released
so
late
in
the
year
if
i
lived
in
tx
could
get
this
cheaply
rather
than
6
a
six
and
i
didnt
have
access
to
yuengling
beers
i
could
see
this
becoming
a
goto
beer
otherwise
average
as
they
come
opinion
this
beer
is
ok
but
there
really
isnt
all
that
much
to
set
it
apart
from
anything
you
could
call
this
a
macro
brew
as
easily
as
you
could
a
very
neutral
craft
beer
i
dont
know
this
beer
is
just
ok
it
isnt
metallic
and
gross
like
you
often
get
with
this
type
of
beer
so
they
didnt
screw
up
it
is
just
very
bland
corny
and
neutral
this
is
an
average
beer
like
the
big
three
maybe
a
little
better
i
prefer
high
life
to
this
if
i
want
a
no
frills
macro
its
just
average
the
only
think
i
dont
like
is
the
mouthfeel
it
needs
to
be
more
crisp
its
just
not
the
crispness
i
expect
from
an
american
lager
fairly
drinkable
but
who
would
want
more
than
one
i
suppose
if
this
is
the
only
beer
available
id
have
another
in
a
pinch
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
persistent
head
it
had
a
slightly
malty
sweet
smell
the
taste
was
mild
and
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
noticeable
carbonation
with
a
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
hot
day
pours
golden
color
with
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
malt
corn
and
some
faint
hops
taste
is
malt
corn
and
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
dry
with
a
bite
from
the
carbonation
this
beer
is
what
it
is
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
hot
day
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
non
seasonal
beers
from
shiner
pale
yellowgold
color
with
a
fizzy
thin
white
head
that
disspates
quickly
lacing
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
light
aroma
of
straw
and
corn
lightbodied
with
vaugue
grassy
hops
malt
and
corn
flavors
the
finish
is
effervescent
and
lightly
bitter
although
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
kind
of
a
wet
blanket
all
around
bottom
line
not
bad
not
great
shiner
bock
or
kolsch
are
better
looks
the
way
its
supposed
to
golden
no
real
head
retention
doesnt
smell
so
great
kinda
like
wet
cardboard
or
a
wet
dog
or
something
flavor
is
a
quick
burst
upon
your
tongue
and
then
dissapates
i
prefer
shiner
kolsch
over
this
not
the
worst
shiner
there
is
bock
gets
that
honor
but
i
prefer
most
of
the
other
shiners
over
this
one
that
all
being
said
i
think
this
beer
will
go
well
with
the
dinner
im
about
to
eat
lasagna
overall
i
think
this
one
is
a
better
beer
than
their
bock
simply
has
more
flavor
but
has
a
little
bit
more
of
a
raw
taste
slightly
oranged
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
nose
is
consequently
difficult
to
discern
sour
and
sickly
sweet
for
the
most
part
yeasty
beer
smell
the
flavor
is
not
much
to
speak
of
either
primarily
a
tame
malt
presence
that
is
notquitebutalmostcloyingly
sweet
some
slight
hop
spice
just
off
bitter
finish
thin
mouthfeel
not
watery
but
completely
unimpressive
would
be
easier
to
drink
if
it
had
more
flavor
makes
me
wish
for
some
brooklyn
lager
a
light
and
drinkable
beer
im
not
going
to
be
pretentious
about
any
tasting
experience
of
any
brew
so
i
must
say
that
if
you
switched
my
glass
of
blonde
with
a
glass
of
budweiser
i
wouldnt
notice
a
huge
disparity
macro
in
a
prettier
bottle
nothing
wrong
with
that
though
pours
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
delicate
white
head
somewhat
spicey
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
thinnish
carbonated
mouthfeel
borders
on
watery
taste
is
fairly
clean
and
uninspiring
reminds
me
a
lot
of
your
typical
american
macro
lager
grainy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
hops
are
present
but
very
light
this
beer
is
too
meek
to
be
offensive
yet
too
lacking
in
flavor
to
be
recommended
appearance
has
a
clear
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
bright
white
two
finger
sized
head
leaves
behind
streaks
of
lace
aroma
contains
corn
and
rice
tones
with
light
two
row
malted
grains
leaves
behind
a
weak
hop
aroma
very
grassy
in
origin
flavor
has
a
creamy
sweet
corn
and
rice
texture
with
light
pockets
of
hops
that
have
grassy
components
to
it
very
nice
light
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
overly
carbonated
profile
drinkability
is
less
than
complex
when
it
comes
to
overall
drinkability
very
simplisitc
in
nature
i
will
pass
next
time
i
like
this
beer
and
will
buy
more
d
nonfilling
light
with
some
solid
flavor
went
well
with
the
pizza
i
was
eating
simple
beer
im
not
going
to
seek
it
out
but
a
good
beer
to
give
your
buddies
to
get
them
off
the
macros
although
this
beer
describes
it
self
as
a
bohemian
style
golden
lager
pilsener
urquell
it
aint
the
recipe
has
likely
changed
over
what
the
bohemian
and
german
founders
of
the
spoetzel
brewery
would
have
intended
therefore
the
ba
description
of
light
all
malt
american
lager
is
certainly
more
fitting
and
what
one
should
expect
from
this
beer
altogether
shiner
blonde
is
a
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
perhaps
more
so
directly
from
the
bottle
ive
hjad
avergae
experience
with
shiner
so
far
but
since
i
am
in
texas
on
vaaction
and
its
in
the
fridge
here
why
not
actually
much
better
than
allmalt
beverages
that
i
can
thik
of
nothing
too
exciting
but
this
could
be
session
brew
down
here
pretty
light
and
quite
easy
to
consume
my
wife
enjoyed
it
as
well
which
always
is
nice
to
know
if
i
was
sweaty
thirsty
id
grab
one
or
take
one
if
given
choices
i
would
definitely
choose
something
else
guess
everything
isnt
bigger
better
in
texas
afterall
it
is
best
served
cold
and
paired
with
bbq
preferably
a
combination
plate
featuring
brisket
and
hot
links
onions
jalapeños
optional
pours
out
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
quite
faint
just
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
light
malt
flavor
with
only
a
slight
presense
of
hops
finishes
very
clean
and
dry
light
bodied
with
a
neutral
texture
not
unpleasant
but
theres
nothing
special
here
decently
drinkable
light
bodied
but
with
an
odd
aftertaste
i
cant
identify
not
a
horrible
horrible
beer
overall
but
its
not
something
i
see
myself
purchasing
much
of
in
the
future
not
so
good
al
drinkability
ive
had
beers
that
were
very
unsophisticated
like
me
that
were
well
balanced
or
refreshingly
light
and
remarkably
drinkablebut
this
one
missed
on
all
marks
not
able
to
bring
my
self
to
imbibe
the
ab
macros
i
opted
for
a
shiner
blonde
and
settled
in
to
listen
to
mitchs
song
the
music
and
dancehall
did
not
let
me
down
i
guess
2
out
of
3
aint
bad
this
beer
does
go
down
like
water
which
at
least
makes
it
drinkable
i
wont
buy
it
again
unless
its
on
sale
for
really
cheap
i
could
drink
it
again
but
there
are
better
beers
all
over
the
place
drinkability
very
drinkable
refreshing
beer
goes
down
like
water
nothing
offensive
but
no
complexity
either
would
be
a
good
summer
brew
in
its
home
state
of
texas
i
would
imagine
crystal
clear
gold
in
color
big
white
head
fades
with
pretty
good
retention
smells
grainy
and
grassy
lots
o
malt
no
hops
taste
is
very
mellow
and
uncomplicated
stradling
the
fence
between
euro
lager
and
american
macro
this
beer
is
nothing
special
good
for
a
backup
beer
but
thats
about
it
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fell
not
long
after
pouring
the
smell
is
of
grains
and
some
hops
the
taste
crisp
but
not
very
note
worthy
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
nicely
carbonated
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
it
did
not
leave
a
strange
taste
in
your
mouth
like
some
of
the
lighter
beers
do
overall
i
would
say
its
not
too
bad
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
help
expose
people
to
better
higher
quality
beer
i
had
this
one
ontap
over
dinner
during
a
recent
business
trip
to
texas
apperance
a
pale
yellow
fizzy
liquid
with
a
pretty
but
slight
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
faint
hoppiness
its
a
very
carbonated
beer
that
gives
seriously
fizzy
carbonic
sensation
with
virtually
no
malt
flavor
and
a
restrained
but
crisp
hop
finish
this
ones
a
close
relative
of
most
macros
id
avoid
it
if
i
saw
it
again
your
basic
pale
lagar
here
for
4
23
a
sixer
its
fresh
and
competively
priced
with
the
bmc
crowd
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
fruity
maybe
a
bit
tart
plenty
to
smell
but
kinda
weird
the
taste
is
a
little
bland
it
has
some
malty
flavors
coming
through
but
just
not
much
else
going
on
a
little
one
dimensional
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
the
drinkability
is
good
though
just
decent
nothing
wrong
with
this
lager
great
lawnmowin
brew
just
doesnt
offer
anything
i
can
use
though
if
there
was
nothing
else
available
in
some
certain
situation
id
endure
it
this
is
the
weakest
of
the
shiner
beers
that
ive
had
still
havent
had
their
light
or
winter
but
blond
is
still
a
decent
brew
appearance
is
pale
golden
with
short
head
aroma
is
clean
but
runofthemill
basically
a
higher
end
macro
smell
blond
tastes
solid
but
unremarkable
no
offtastes
are
present
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
but
fairly
boring
this
beer
works
well
in
that
it
wont
offend
ba
members
and
will
also
work
for
people
who
are
used
to
macros
i
could
easily
knock
back
quite
a
few
of
these
without
getting
tired
of
it
a
decent
beer
doesnt
have
quite
enough
flavor
or
character
for
me
to
have
it
too
often
but
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
good
hot
summerday
beer
drinkability
ill
drink
what
i
have
left
but
wont
be
picking
any
more
of
this
up
on
future
trips
south
i
dont
really
have
much
thats
good
to
say
about
shiner
blonde
so
i
think
ill
stop
right
here
thumbs
down
grabbed
this
for
the
hot
day
in
the
sun
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
slight
head
that
is
decent
smell
is
grainy
with
light
hints
of
hops
taste
is
very
refreshing
kick
of
grilled
corn
on
the
forefront
with
a
little
hop
twang
that
flow
great
with
this
light
lager
ligh
bodied
but
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
on
those
hot
sweaty
day
slightly
better
than
the
american
macros
bought
this
for
a
cookout
i
went
to
yesterday
because
it
was
pretty
darn
hot
and
wanted
something
on
the
lighter
sidepours
a
light
blond
color
with
a
thin
wispy
head
that
is
gone
fast
and
leaves
no
trace
aromas
of
corn
husk
and
a
light
grassiness
but
not
much
there
at
alltaste
like
aroma
to
me
was
dominated
by
corn
with
a
light
herbal
not
decent
when
cold
and
goes
down
real
easy
but
this
could
pass
as
something

tasted
like
a
worse
version
of
yuengling
the
head
was
fluffy
and
it
poured
a
weird
gold
mainly
a
bready
lager
that
lacked
much
else
dont
think
i
would
want
to
ever
drink
this
again
overall
very
good
but
not
outstanding
somewhat
reminds
me
of
shiner
oktoberfest
but
with
less
flavor
gold
clear
pilsner
looking
average
head
with
pretty
nice
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
light
hops
citrus
this
beer
is
malt
forward
barely
with
the
hops
coming
out
and
making
a
nice
showing
the
balance
is
nice
on
this
one
and
the
finish
is
clean
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
its
a
hopped
up
lager
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
it
tasted
and
how
easily
it
drank
clean
no
off
flavors
or
scents
looks
a
little
hazy
and
thin
head
with
hardly
any
retention
slight
orange
tint
to
the
body
first
sniff
shows
plenty
of
hops
i
thought
it
might
be
a
pale
ale
on
my
first
sip
i
was
pleasanty
surprised
to
find
all
crisp
bready
lager
cracker
and
a
hint
of
caramel
underneath
to
balance
with
those
extreme
hops
bit
of
a
watery
finish
even
though
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
these
hops
did
not
add
bitterness
to
this
drink
just
aroma
and
flavor
this
brewer
did
the
hoppy
lager
very
successfully
in
my
opinion
better
than
many
outlier
requires
at
least
six
words
o
not
bad
i
prefer
it
over
the
premium
beer
and
the
czech
pilsner
that
were
also
in
the
mixed
pack
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
in
the
future
aint
nothin
finer
than
shiner
v
i
have
to
give
it
a
horrible
rating
for
value
as
this
beer
is
a
special
reserve
item
and
as
such
you
can
nowadays
only
find
this
in
the
shiner
family
variety
pack
and
you
only
get
one
when
you
buy
it
worth
a
try
though
not
the
greatest
beer
a
little
mushroomy
probably
would
not
do
again
a
solid
american
lager
theres
nothing
amazingly
awesome
here
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
particularly
wrong
either
this
would
be
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
as
way
to
introduce
allmalt
craft
brews
to
someone
more
used
to
the
standard
american
macro
overall
4
12
although
fairly
average
in
all
other
categories
just
like
their
hefeweizen
the
taste
just
knocks
this
beer
out
of
the
park
as
an
american
pale
lager
this
is
my
favorite
yet
its
got
so
much
right
and
so
little
wrong
with
it
so
much
zing
and
no
off
flavors
this
was
a
freebie
which
makes
it
all
the
more
enjoyable
but
i
would
buy
this
with
my
own
money
too
shiner
has
some
hit
and
miss
brews
but
this
ones
a
winner
sweet
lips
this
brew
is
good
a
pleasant
but
average
beer
that
is
clean
and
has
a
bunch
of
biscuit
taste
i
would
not
turn
this
one
down
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
either
ill
pass
overall
not
a
bad
pale
lager
reminds
me
more
of
a
bock
than
a
lager
the
taste
is
cleanly
balanced
grainy
malt
flavor
with
a
mildly
bitter
and
clean
hop
finish
not
a
lot
of
lingering
but
it
is
semidry
poured
a
beautiful
rich
golden
body
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
tint
and
a
thin
foam
cap
of
head
for
the
style
it
looked
fantastic
and
very
inviting
scents
of
bready
and
sweet
malt
with
a
mediumlow
level
of
floral
and
herbal
hop
aromas
a
simple
appealing
classic
american
lager
aroma
profile
very
nice
flavor
begins
with
mediumlow
sweetness
with
a
nice
honeylike
character
that
carries
throughout
the
sip
this
is
quickly
joined
by
a
nice
mediumlow
level
of
floral
hop
flavors
with
mediumlow
bitterness
in
the
middle
there
is
a
nice
mingling
of

flavors
mingling
with
a
low

slight
grainy
flavors

that
is
refreshing
and
a
good
example
of
an
american
lager
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
slightly
drying
feel
and
an
unfortunately
low
level
of
carbonation
it
feels
fairly
good
but
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
american
lager
it
is
pleasantly
dry
and
floral
in
taste
with
a
nice
floral
and
malty
aroma
the
mouthfeel
could
use
a
little
work
but
otherwise
this
is
a
solid
example
of
an
american
classic
o
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
way
too
much
hops
that
takes
over
any
flavour
profile
that
may
be
present
distracting
will
not
be

again
overall
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
huge
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
aromas
of
earthy
mineral
water
atop
grainy
sweet
bread
light
earthy
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
bit
malty
sweet
with
a
light
earthy
fruitiness
medium
to
full
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
so
far
i
liked
this
on
the
most
from
the
mixed
12
pack
i
got
its
a
decent
lager
not
horribly
complex
or
continental
inspired
but
drinkable
just
the
same
im
quickly
becoming
a
fan
of
this
brewery
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
but
with
some
definite
hop
aromaflavors
and
quite
unique
compared
to
most
american
lagers
at
a
stretch
i
would
compare
it
favorably
to
grainbelt
premium
which
ive
not
had
in
awhile
another
lager
beer
with
some
hops
in
it
as
i
recall
i
had
tried
some
shiner
before
in
wyoming
and
thought
it
tasted
either
weird
this
particular
beer
or
a
little
blah
everything
else
perhaps
it
sat
around
too
long
lots
of
bud
and
coors
drinkers
down
there
overall
3
25
very
drinkable
i
would
not
mind
drinking
this
with
my
dinner
or
with
friends
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
thats
what
matters
right
p
ours
a
light
copperamber
in
color
with
close
a
finger
white
head
that
settles
down
to
the
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
malts
with
some
wheat
the
taste
is
actually
better
with
some
good
flavor
of
the
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
finishes
slightly
tangy
from
the
hops
different
but
very
drinkable
had
this
one
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
from
shiner
typical
of
most
of
the
shiner
beers
decent
looking
beer
with
okay
at
best
smell
but
rather
tasty
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
certainly
drink
it
again
but
do
not
think
that
i
would
purchase
unless
the
cost
were
low
surprisingly
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
nice
malty
aroma
malty
on
the
palette
with
a
crisp
finish
smooth
malty
flavor
pours
a
pretty
light
amber
with
a
substantial
head
of
foam
nice
lacing
as
the
head
subsides
it
was
hard
to
know
what
to
expect
from
reading
the
description
on
the
bottle
although
it
was
interesting
reading
a
little
bit
of
shiner
brewery
lore
clear
golden
orange
pour
with
a
minimal
white
head
and
light
carbonation
aroma
is
mainly
grain
and
toast
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
grain
and
malt
flavors
upfront
but
there
is
a
nice
hop
presence
on
the
back
end
leading
to
a
slightly
bitter
finish
o
better
than
i
expected
nice
refreshing
german
beer
would
be
a
great
hot
weather
beer
or
a
camping
beer
i
would
keep
this
in
my
beer
fridge
if
they
sold
it
in
12
packs
i
could
rotate
it
with
schlitz
and
old
style
when
im
looking
for
a
good
simple
decent
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps

of
the
beer
small
dots
of

slowly
drip
into
the
remaining

on
the

down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
grass
and
slight
metallic

taste
is
much
the

with
grain
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
too
memorable
in
my
opinion

overall
a
decent

beer
a

hops
3
25
from
front
to
back
while
the
majority
of
my
experience
with
shiners
mixed
6pack
was
lackluster
the
kosmos
pale
lager
was
the
epitome
of
bland
long
story
short
its
malty
taste
made
it
easy
to
drink
but
it
lacked
any
real
depth
or
strong
flavor
profiles
it
simply
didnt
stand
out
picked
up
a
variety
of
shiner
beers
poured
into
to
a
pilsner
glass
has
a
nice
yellow
color
with
a
head
that
goes
away
quickly
grainy
in
a
aroma
with
a
bit
of
grassy
notes
somewhat
sweet
in
flavor
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
during
warmer
weather
when
it
seems
the
style
would
probbly
suit
it
better
this
beer
will
probably
not
sway
me
from
trying
other
beers
from
spoetzl
high
d
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
orange
straw
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
cereal
grain
and
corn
but
not
that
strong
tastes
of
sweet
grain
beer
is
light
bodied
and
heavily
carbonated
definitely
drinkable
overall
an
above

with

good

with

a

not
at
all
watery
like
a
imperial
version
of
the
shiner
premium
better
but
only
slightly
o
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
because
of
the
taste
the
nose
had
me
expecting
more
of
a
malt
flavor
and
instead
gave
me
a
bitter
one
while
i
dont
necessarily
like
bitter
beers
like
ipas
i
can
appreciate
hoppy
beers
such
as
laguanitas
or
arrogant
bastard
because
although
they
are
bitter
the
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
that
gives
your
palate
a
lot
to
work
with
with
this
beer
i
felt
there
should
have
been
more
flavor
and
instead
just
got
a
mildly
bitter
beer
with
no
real
malt
taste
i
say
this
is
an
okay
beer
have
tasted
the
entire
spoetzl
brewery
portfolio
didnt
enjoy
as
much
as
other
shiners
but
good
backstory
and
overall
worth
a
try
overall
a
tasty
well
balanced
ale
o
im
a
little
let
down
because
while
it
succeeds
where
other
shiner
beers
failed
such
as
providing
something
resembling
hoppiness
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
why
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
maybe
its
not
that
fresh
ah
well
tickers
gonna
tick
bro
american
pale
lager
yup
hmmm
not
much
going
on
here
just
a
hint
of
malt
next
to
no
hops
and
basically
very
little
of
note
to
comment
on
here
kind
of
a
nasty
metalic
after
taste
best
thing
i
can
say
is
thankfully
there
were
only
two
of
each
beer
in
the
box
this
isnt
a
beer
that
is
probably
on
anyones
wants
list
its
fairly
non
descript
i
have
no
idea
what
makes
this
a
special
reserve
beer
as
it
seems
pedestrian
but
the
good
news
is
no
off
flavors
of
any
kind
there
probably
isnt
anything
too
challenging
for
your
average
non
beer
geek
person
i
dunno
maybe
someones
mom
would
find
this
to
still
be
too
bitter
as
it
isnt
as
watery
and
mild
as
a
bud
light
a
slightly
better
macro
but
nothing
worth
purchasing
overall
you
can
skip
this
one
not
unpleasant
to
drink
but
nothing
special
here
everything
about
this
beer
is
average
very
good
for
an
american
pale
lager
sadly
it
only
available
in
variety
pack
only
wish
spoetzl
brewing
company
release
a
6
pack
of
this
beer
o
ill
say
ive
definitely
had
worse
beers
but
its
still
nothing
special
not
bad
for
the
style
the
body
was
smooth
clean
and
even
drinkability
was
very
good
you
could
easily
have
a
pile
of
empties
before
ya
knew
it
overall
an
ok
little
brew
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
not
worth
hunting
down
easy
drinking
not
bad
but
just
a
notch
above
bmc
imho
overall
its
ok
but
not
one
of
spoetzls
best
twisting
the
top
smell
is
adjunct
but
grape
like
on
the
pour
its
a
maple
syrup
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
holds
then
fades
on
the
taste
the
brew
has
notes
of
black
licorice
and
cascades
this
brew
is
an
interesting
combination
of
saaz
hopping
and
a
blonde
malt
combined
with
a
carbonation
that
is
tricky
and
tasty
hey
you
guys
spelled
cosmos
wrong
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
sweet
flowers
and
a
touch
of
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
more
grass
and
a
kiss
of
lemon
peel
in
the
background
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
slightly
watery
feel
and
a
sortakinda
almostdrying
finish
overall
a
boring
little
lager
one
that
makes
me
wonder
why
this
particular
formula
was
the
reserve
definitely
a
better
than
average
specimen
of
this
often
uninspiring
category
quite
drinkable
if
not
noteworthy
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
h
and
h
beverage
in
abilene
overall
drinkability
definitely
one
of
shiners
better
beers

on

as
im
just
watching

the
weaknesses
stand
out

one
was
enough
in

session
overall
not
much
taste
i
really
cant
describe
the
taste
well
i
dont
taste
any
hops
which
is
unusual
for
a
dry
hopped
beer
im
dissapointed
im
starting
to
wonder
if
this
brewery
has
a
single
decent
beer
o
not
as
good
as
the
first
time
i
tried
it
again
all
i
have
is
one
bottle
so
no
worries
not
a
drain
poor
but
almost
overall
fairly
bland
beer
overall
for
the
term
special
reserve
d
it
has
flavor
but
it
falls
into
the
adequate
category
all
low
end
background
and
base
it
needs
some
higher
and
accent
notes
to
liven
it
up
and
have
the
middle
rounded
out
more
o
its
a
decent
pale
lager
that
has
some
good
flavor
and
is
very
easy
drinking
o
better
than
shiners
flagship
bock
and
i
could
put
a
hurtin
on
a
six
pack
pretty
sure
shiner
accomplished
what
they
set
out
to
do
with
this
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
flavorful
beer
this
would
be
good
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
o
not
bad
certainly
but
rather
pitiful
and
boring
for
something
marketed
as
the
special
reserve
beer
of
an
established
brewer
i
recommend
this
one
o
i
do
not
like
the
style
i
think
its
boring
and
flat
if
you
like
budweiser
i
would
say
try
this
i
am
pretty
indifferent
to
this
and
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
the
problem
here
is
with
all
of
the
awesome
stuff
being
done
in
craft
brewing
why
is
shiner
trying
to
make
an
average
tasting
beer
without
any
characteristics
at
all
i
am
not
even
remotely
ready
to
give
up
on
this
brewery
they
just
need
to
retire
this
stuff
though
its
been
done
a
million
times
before
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
and
dark
golden
hue
aroma
is
sweet
and
hoppy
with
honeysuckle
notes
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
malty
and
hoppy
with
some
nice
hints
of
floral
and
spice
mouthfeel
light
moderate
co2
good
call
for
those
who
like
the
flavor
of
shiner
beers
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
hoppy
so
if
you
are
a
fan
of
ipas
then
you
will
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
i
always
love
the
history
of
original
brews
and
found
this
to
be
a
nice
light
citrusy
tasting
beer
light
but
flavorable
the
color
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
care
for
but
is
easily
overlooked
when
the
beer
hits
your
tounge
overall
a
nice
beer
ps
my
first
review
overall
easy
drinking
but
lacks
much
flavor
or
character
overall
quite
nice
tasty
for
the
style
and
refreshing
one
of
the
better
american
lagers
ive
had
to
be
sure
distinctly
spoetzl
i
only
wish
their
more
available
bock
was
on
the
same
level
id
definitely
be
willing
to
buy
it
again
but
im
pretty
sure
you
can
only
get
it
in
the
assorted
packs
poured
this
american
pale
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
copper
color
produced
an
average
white
head
nice
retention
and
it
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
malted
grain
and
a
suggestion
of
bittering
hops
medium
in
body
this
pale
lager
is
crisp
clean
and
has
a
nice
base
of
malted
grain
sweet
caramel
and
some
hops
the
finish
is
semi
dry
and
the
aftertaste
leaves
you
wanting
to
take
another
gulp
overall
it
is
only
as
exciting
as
an
american
pale
lager
can
get
but
i
would
take
this
over
one
its
evil
macro
brewed
breathern
prost
pours
golden
amber
with
a
finger
length
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
there
appears
to
be
plenty
of
carbonation
from
the
bubbles
the
smell
is
of
slightly
sweet
malt
with
some
hop
aroma
i
could
taste
some
of
the
malt
flavor
with
the
hops
coming
in
at
the
end
its
very
carbonated
with
a
light
body
there
is
some
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
overall
id
say
this
is
a
decent
offering
from
shiner
its
a
standard
lager
that
goes
down
decently
well
o
this
is
an
okay
pale
lager
nothing
i
need
to
stock
up
on
but
worth
a
try
because
i
appreciate
spoetzl
brewery
first
thing
i
noticed
when
i
poured
this
beer
was
it
is
slightly
darker
than
most
other
american
lagers
it
has
an
average
amount
of
head
and
lace
an
aroma
thats
a
bit
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
beer
is
over
carbonated
but
a
bit
bitter
not
a
great
beer
but
a
worthy
effort
a
remarkably
unremarkable
beer
here
nothing
offensive
or
out
of
place
nothing
memorable
take
your
ordinary
adjunct
lager
and
remove
the
adjuncts
and
this
what
you
get
one
dimensional
and
no
corn
of
cereal
flavors
goes
down
easy
enough
and
makes
for
a
superior
alternative
to
the
big
three
appearance
is
an
orangeyellow
and
relatively
transparent
fairly
weak
smelling
with
a
notable
absence
of
hops
for
a
dry
hopped
beer
tastes
like
a
fairly
standard
lager
with
a
bit
of
hops
that
come
through
near
the
end
feels
fine
in
the
mouth
just
an
ok
beer
o
i
really
dont
care
much
for
spoetzl
brewery
beer
but
this
one
is
halfway
decent
i
still
dont
think
its
good
by
any
means
but
for
sure
decent
o
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
i
went
in
without
expectations
and
came
away
pleasantly
surprised
for
the
style
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
let
alone
as
just
beer
its
pretty
good
and
could
definately
be
an
easy
drinker
very
pleasantly
surprised
o
this
beer
is
alright
but
a
bit
bland
there
is
nothing
that
inspires
me
about
this
it
says
on
the
bottle
hopjacked
lager
and
it
doesnt
taste
very
hoppy
if
its
not
hoppy
im
not
hoppy
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
from
the
shiner
family
six
pack
unoffensive
is
probably
the
best
word
to
describe
this
beer
overall
sessionable
and
decent
lager
better
than
i
expected
after
pouring
this
beer
has
a
nice
sweet
citrus
bitterness
i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
is
called
reserve
when
usually
that
signifies
that
the
beer
is
the
brewerys
cream
of
the
crop
in
this
case
the
beer
is
entirely
bland
and
forgettable
so
why
is
it
considered
to
be
their
reserve
overall
aside
from
the
blonde
this
is
a
very
watery
lager
that
isnt
had
to
put
down
but
not
really
flavorful
to
make
me
really
enjoy
my
last
two
worst
beer
they
ever
made
overall
cant
find
much
difference
between
this
hop
jacked
lager
compared
to
other
main
stream
consumer
beers
like
budweiser
or
miller
high
life
drinkable
in
a
pinch
but
not
for
someone
looking
for
a
more
distinctive
hoppy
andor
malt
flavored
craft
beer
great
example
of
a
below
average
beer
i
feel
like
this
beer
just
misses
the
mark
it
is
not
terrible
by
any
means
but
is
simply
boring
d
its
drinkable
and
definitely
sessionable
but
really
simple
and
boring
dont
waste
your
time
o
just
another
average
beer
from
this
brewery
dont
let
the
reserve
fool
you
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
once
again
i
feel
this
beer
could
use
some
hops
to
add
body
and
character
o
honestly
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
this
style
gets
such
a
bad
rap
from
the
macros
that
decent
lagers
like
this
one
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
the
alcohol
in
this
is
weak
enough
that
this
could
be
a
session
but
if
given
a
chance
why
not
just
enjoy
the
flagship
beer
from
spoetzl
my
glass
looked
and
smelled
like
i
just
washed
it
after
i
downed
the
contents
and
amazingly
thats
the
figurative
memory
that
i
will
take
from
this
beer
shiner
fans
could
do
better
than
this
offering
overall
i
began
eating
chips
halfway
through
this
tastingit
wasnt
in
search
of
a
proper
pairingactually
not
an
indictment
but
the
word
reserve
usually
is
well
reserved
for
a
beer
that
stands
out
and
this
does
not
overall
this
is
fairly
decent
however
i
am
just
not
really
drawn
to
it
i
could
easily
have
more
though
so
i
have
no
real
major
complaints
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
no
type
of
lacing
the
smells
are
of
light
malts
and
light
hops
the
feel
is
lighter
the
taste
is
good
for
shiner
a
little
hop
bite
with
some
light
bready
malts
12
oz

short

this
is

brew
all
in
all
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
glaringingly
wrong
here
just
not
something
id
be
excited
to
get
again
the
first
thing
that
hits
me
is
its
high
carbonation
followed
by
a
sharp
bitterness
followed
by
a
dull
bread
flavour
its
better
than
i
was
expecting
considering
that
the
packaging
referred
to
it
as
being
loaded
with
hops
it
is
certainly
better
than
i
remember
it
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
that
i
considered
hoppy
i
hated
it
saying
that
it
tasted
like
a
straight
christmas
tree
but
i
guess
my
palate
has
become
more
tolerating
of
hop
use
i
still
think
that
it
should
be
used
only
in
moderation
and
only
to
subtly
balance
sweetness
in
some
beer
styles
but
its
use
in
this
brew
doesnt
really
bother
me
much
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
i
am
not
repulsed
by
it
still
not
really
anything
special
about
this
beer
its
fairly
lame
all
around
dr
i
keep
forgetting
its
american
pale
lager
and
want
to
say
its
crappy
stuff
but
its
good
for
the
style
a
fine
macro
alternative
overall
a
good
beer
with
excellent
potential
83
o
im
pretty
impressed
goes
down
easy
is
flavorful
for
the
style
would
choose
this
over
any
macro
lager
overall
impression
very
refreshing
great
for
a
first
beer
of
the
night
and
reminds
me
of
an
adjunct
very
smooth
and
easy
would
definitely
recommend
for
beer
pong
dry
pilsner
malt
clean
inoffensive
malty
flavors
little
to
no
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
really
sightly
watery
with
a
dry
finish
its
ok
but
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
unless
freshness
was
guaranteed
overall
i
was
finally
able
to
pick
this
up
from
the
family
reunion
12
pack
i
heard
the
story
about
this
beer
on
the
tour
at
shiner
this
was
a
nice
refreshing
beer
i
has
a
nice
spice
to
it
and
is
very
drinkable
a
very
fine
beer
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
dry
but
the
aftertaste
is
what
bothers
me
for
me
it
feels
like
im
drinking
stale
bread
i
am
unsure
of
how
kosmos
might
have
felt
about
twistoff
caps
but
i
am
not
a
fan
there
is
no
pop
no
nothing
until
the
pour
in
this
case
resulting
in
a
foamy
soapy
finger
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
gorgeous
deepgold
with
nequality
clarity
that
would
have
made
both
midas
and
croesus
sit
up
and
take
notice
speaking
of
taking
notice
the
presence
of
earthy
grassy
noble
hops
really
stood
out
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
solid
hop
presence
up
front
underlain
by
a
light
malty
sweetness
it
was
very
clean
and
totally
refreshing
especially
for
a
lager
finish
was
semidry
and
the
hops
really
held
their
own
throughout
i
would
drink
this
more
often
a
as
an
alternative
to
pilseners
and
b
if
it
were
sold
in
its
own
sixpack
instead
of
being
lumped
in
with
the
family
by
far
one
of
the
better
shiner
offerings
i
have
had
but
that
is
not
saying
much
spend
the
few
extra
bucks
on
a
decent
6pack
because
the
flavor
upgrade
is
well
worth
it
much
better
6pack
offerings
in
this
range
as
well
including
long
trail
victory
or
even
sam
adams
which
mildly
pains
me
to
say
overall
this
beer
is
not
very
memorable
but
its
a
decent
thirst
quencher
if
youre
looking
for
a
simplistic
lighter
beer
tastes
hopped
but
no
where
near
the
hopjacked
description
on
the
bottle
this
added
some
disappointment
to
the
experience
overall
i
really
like
this
one
from
shiner
this
brewery
was
one
that
helped
me
discover
the
word
of
fine
beer
so
naturally
i
have
always
been
somewhat
partial
to
their
offerings
m
good
mouth
coating
nice
carbonation
and
a
good
bitter
hop
finish
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
and
quickly
vanishing
cap
aroma
is
pretty
faint
but
does
show
a
decent
effort
in
the
hops
department
flavor
is
very
clean
maltier
than
hoppy
but
there
is
a
presence
from
both
sweetly
malted
pale
and
germanic
in
character
hops
are
grassy
also
of
continental
character
making
this
come
off
as
maybe
a
light
bock
style
very
clean
and
drinkable
with
good
body
not
bad
but
in
a
crowded
scene
nostalgic
american
import
styles
doesnt
stand
out
much
copper
to
amber
color
loads
of
swirling
carbonation
and
thick
white
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
bread
and
caramel
with
floral
and
citrus
notes
clean
malt
flavor
slightly
toasty
with
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
could
be
a
little
more
assertive
definitely
decent
for
the
style
this
is
what
the
big
american
beers
should
be
like
there
are
plenty
of
uninspired
choices
in
this
style
but
kosmos
is
not
one
of
them
a
good
choice
on
a
hot
day
poured
into
a
becker
a
clear
medium
golden
with
withalmost
a
creamylike
top
with
good
carbonation
aromas
of
toasty
cereal
grain
and
dryish
cracker
maltthe
aromas
are
pretty
light
dryer
flavors
with
a
little
smattering
of
leafy
hopsa
bit
of
sweet
dough
in
the
finish
no
frills
but
not
a
bad
lager
beeraverage
to
above
average
like
many
shiner
offerings
rjt
overall
not
a
bad
quencher
its
got
enough
character
to
interest
you
as
opposed
to
a
mainstream
american
pale
lager
and
it
goes
down
easy
worth
at
least
trying
the
next
time
you
bbq
a
typical
pale
lager
imo
easy
enough
to
drink
as
a
thirst
quencher
nothing
bad
about
it
but
nothing
particularly
unique
either
shiner
kosmos
a
tribute
to
the
guy
that
started
it
all
for
spoetzl
and
with
the
name
reserve
in
the
title
this
hopefully
wont
disappoint
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
kosmos
is
a
crystal
clear
peachy
gold
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
rather
subdued
but
is
of
light
fruits
like
grapes
and
pears
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
but
is
balanced
nicely
by
an
nondistinct
hop
bitterness
to
the
point
of
being
more
hoppy
than
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
in
body
with
the
carbonation
being
thin
yet
aggressive
a
lingering
bitterness
leaves
the
mouth
dry
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
probably
not
something
worthy
of
a
homage
to
someone
like
kosmos
spoetzl
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
comes
across
to
me
as
another
member
of
the
american
retrorevolution
like
schlitz
gusto
an
overall
solid
pickup
o
turned
out
to
be
a
more
balanced
version
of
shiner
blonde
with
the
nice
little
hop
bite
that
it
provides
wish
this
one
came
in
a
six
pack
very
sessionable
overall
not
bad
but
not
the
best
id
probably
buy
more
if
it
was
at
a
yuengling
price
its
good
to
mix
things
up
otherwise
at
this
price
it
isnt
worth
it
d
i
couldnt
get
around
the
bland
taste
so
i
didnt
find
it
very
drinkable
it
probably
took
me
30
minutes
to
finish
the
bottle
overalldrinkable
but
wouldnt
reccommend
this
beer
if
you
want
an
easy
drinkable
light
beer
with
little
flavor
go
for
it
if
not
pass
on
it
and
grab
something
else
drinkable
and
light
nothing
too
memorable
very
drinkable
take
on
the
style
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summers
day
there
is
nothing
distinguishing
about
this
it
isnt
flawed
excewpt
that
it
has
no
taste
i
would
not
buy
it
again
after
trying
most
of
a
shiner
sampler
i
would
not
buy
anything
from
this
brewery
ever
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
would
be
great
for
a
summer
outing
or
a
winter
evening
inside
it
is
great
brew
i
look
forward
to
the
other
brews
in
this
family
reunion
pack
part
of
the
shiner
mixed
12
pack
pours
a
light
goldenorange
color
barely
any
head
not
much
for
carbonation
either
taste
has
a
light
to
medium
body
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
taste
reminds
me
of
an
otter
creek
copper
ale
a
bit
of
a
metallicspicy
bite
to
it
nice
easy
finish
nothing
breaking
the
boundaries
here
but
a
nice
solid
beer
that
makes
for
easy
drinking
give
it
a
try
along
with
this
12
pack
nothing
blows
you
out
of
the
water
but
not
a
bad
one
in
the
bunch
and
only
11
99
overall
lets
be
honest
for
a
change
it
is
shiner
so
roll
in
with
simple
low
expectations
and
youll
be
treated
to
simple
clean
lager
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
it
pours
golden
with
a
fairly
stable
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
cap
for
quite
a
while
and
even
leaves
some
lacing
both
the
smell
and
taste
have
light
notes
of
lager
yeast
and
a
nutty
rice
like
finish
there
is
a
yeasty
tang
in
the
taste
and
a
rounded
slightly
bready
maltiness
the
hops
are
almost
nonexistent
not
terrible
and
it
even
grows
on
me
as
i
drink
it
but
it
is
awfully
light
and
there
is
a
late
metallic
tang
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
of
o
decent
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
to
me
dryhopped
is
a
nice
touch
but
the
dryness
isnt
coupled
by
anything
in
the
middle
that
would
round
out
the
taste
d
easy
drinking
and
probably
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
although
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
or
any
of
spoetzls
other
offerings
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
it
was
offered
this
beer
came
in
the
family
six
pack
d
kosmos
reserve
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
it
would
make
a
great
companion
while
hanging
round
the
grill
this
summer
with
a
bunch
of
close
friends
pours
a
medium
gold
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
medium
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
is
of
canned
corn
tin
can
and
earthy
grassy
hops
taste
is
way
different
than
aroma
malty
backbone
rides
in
a
pepperygrassy
hops
finish
and
a
soft
dryish
mouthfeel
a
middle
of
the
road
anytime
easy
quaffer
poured
thin
with
a
weak
head
gold
amber
not
much
aroma
somewhat
like
a
light
lager
that
shall
remain
nameless
flavor
was
the
only
shining
moment
but
not
by
much
light
malt
and
straw
flavors
small
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
flaccid
it
amazes
me
that
more
than
one
of
these
beers
is
labeled
some
kind
if
reserve
if
it
is
that
special
to
some
dude
named
kosmo
keep
it
overall
a
very
nice
pale
lager
well
done
by
the
folks
at
shiner
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
probably
because
of
the
smoothness
easily
could
spend
an
afternoon
drinking
a
6
pack
this
is
shiner
really
this
one
is
worthwhile
from
a
brewery
that
has
made
its
name
making
beer
that
is
only
a
mere
step
away
from
swill
this
is
a
quite
good
beer
and
if
i
see
it
again
in
6
packs
i
will
buy
more
as
a
lawnmower
beer
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
highly
sessionable
this
reminds
me
alot
of
shiner
101
exactly
what
you
would
expect
as
a
lager
i
wish
this
came
in
a
6
pack
as
it
would
be
great
in
the
summer
notes
not
horrible
for
the
style
but
not
great
either
slightly
hoppy
and
slightly
bready
malt
nothing
special
just
average
or
slightly
above
average
beer
for
the
style
nothing
i
would
come
back
to
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
there
are
other
beers
id
rather
have
while
i
have
not
found
any
of
the
shiner
family
reunion
pack
beers
to
be
memorable
this
one
i
could
at
least
see
drinking
again
faint
praise
to
be
sure
but
better
than
none
at
all
the
sweetness
gets
to
me
after
a
while
and
if
you
let
this
get
too
warm
it
starts
to
get
a
slightly
unpleasant
bitter
taste
to
it
so
serve
it
cold
drink
it
quick
pours
a
pale
amberorange
body
with
a
small
head
dwindling
down
to
just
some
bubbles
sitting
on
the
body
smells
albeit
not
too
strongly
of
bread
biscuity
and
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
nice
upfront
hoppiness
is
balanced
by
caramel
malt
throughout
the
sip
hops
kick
in
at
the
end
again
resulting
in
a
pleasurable
taste
this
is
probably
the
best
shiner
beer
ive
tasted
really
a
nice
lager
with
flavor
which
does
not
fade
out
like
a
couple
of
the
other
shiner
beers
12

are

ok
aroma

theres

with

drinkability

overall
i
think
its
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
enjoyed
it
another
good
find
from
shiner
this
kosmos
reserve
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
good
scent
of
wheat
and
malts
it
has
a
very
bold
flavor
of
herbs
but
is
surprisingly
mellow
a
very
surprising
taste
for
a
pale
lager
d
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
and
while
it
isnt
very
complex
it
is
much
better
than
i
assumed
it
would
be
the
malt
is
light
and
simple
but
pleasant
enough
however
the
hops
are
what
really
stands
out
in
this
beer
they
are
spicy
and
earthy
with
a
very
fresh
character
that
makes
the
beer
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
is
excellent
for
what
it
is
and
i
would
happily
drink
it
again
d
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
nothing
im
going
to
seek
out
ever
again

1
thumb
34
and
1
sideways
on
this
beer
haha
i
still
havent
formulated
a
strong
view
if
this
beer
it
has
a
great
taste
if
your
looking
to
just
kick
back
and
have
a
few
beers
with
the
boys
the
downfalls
are
that
it
is
only
available
in
the
variety
pack
with
10
other
beers
some
of
those
not
rebuy
choices
for
me
and
the
smell
is
completely
lacking
in
character
i
think
that
if
it
was
available
in
6packs
i
would
buy
it
again
and
keep
at
least
a
6
on
hand
in
my
fridge
great
beer
spotzl
brewery
overall
better
than
the
first
2
shiners
i
had
but
nothing
really
special
guessing
this
one
is
a
pale
lager
or
something
of
the
sort
somewhat
drinkable
ok
typical
average
beer
good
warm
wheather
refresher
not
much
of
a
reserve
though
notes
this
one
is
drinkable
but
just
kind
of
boring
d
a
sweet
malt
and
moderate
bitterness
that
provide
for
a
robust
yet
easy
drinking
brew
overall
i
thought
this
shiner
was
surprisingly
good
i
would
choose
this
one
over
a
shiner
bock
any
day
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
but
i
would
have
this
again
shiner
kosmos
reserve
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
mild
perhaps
a
bit
malty
bready
malt
flavors
are
noticeable
at
first
hops
come
in
to
balance
it
out
toward
the
end
nice
and
light
reasonably
tasty
a
decent
warm
weather
beer
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
adjuncts
with
some
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
corn
wheat
grassy
hops
and
grapes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
terrible
by
any
means
but
not
too
good
either
a
nice
drinker
with
some
interesting
notes
kind
of
a
pale
alelager
blend
solid
beer
this
is
drinkable
enough
but
pretty
bland
a
decent
average
lager
and
not
one
ill
be
looking
for
again
i
seem
to
recall
my
first
experience
with
this
brew
as
being
much
more
lackluster
but
on
this
second
goaround
midday
when
my
palate
is
probably
more
attuned
it
strikes
me
as
a
very
decent
representation
of
whatever
its
aiming
to
be
balanced
with
just
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
yet
not
overpowering
in
any
one
area
this
is
what
the
german
brewing
tradition
is
all
about
in
this
reviewers
opinion
shiner
bock
should
kick
the
dirt
and
be
replaced
with
this
more
characterful
and
authentic
lager
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
no
hi
abv
to
worry
about
no
bad
taste
either
go
ahead
drink
these
by
the
12
pack
if
you
cant
find
any
thing
better
that
is
not
a
bad
little
beer
so
far
the
family
pack
has
turned
out
a
few
good
little
beers
overall
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
kind
of
tastes
like
anchor
steam
beer
ive
had
shiner
bock
before
and
thought
it
was
ok
so
i
picked
up
this
mixed
12
pack
mostly
for
the
bottle
caps
for
my
collection
if
this
is
any
indication
of
what
the
rest
of
the
pack
will
be
like
im
not
going
to
be
in
for
a
real
treat
it
is
drinkable
though
and
pretty
easy
to
put
back
just
nothing
special
and
still
not
sure
who
this
supposed
to
be
reserved
for
a
drinkable
brew
from
shiner
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
notes
i
think
this
would
be
one
of
the
beers
that
people
might
knock
down
just
because
its
easily
accessible
and
a
basic
lager
i
think
they
hit
on
the
intended
style
quite
well
it
has
more
complexity
than
an
adjunct
lager
which
i
like
and
is
quite
refreshing
a
decent
lager
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
pint
glass
formed
a
1
beige
head
above
the
clear
golden
amber
brew
head
lasts
very
well
with
lots
of
chunky
lacing
aroma
is
balanced
but
minimal
taste
is
moderately
sweet
to
start
balancing
bitterness
is
quick
to
follow
a
bit
of
earthiness
present
that
isnt
quite
my
bag
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
another
slight
twist
on
the
lager
style
these
shiner
beers
so
far
are
predictable
and
boring
goes
down
easy
i
cojuld
drink
a
case
i
like
this
beer
about
as
much
as
the
smokehaus
its
one
of
the
best
from
shiner
pretty
nice
for
the
style
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
the
right
circumstances
would
easily
buy
these
for
barbecues
etc
im
not
sure
whom
theyre
reserving
this
for
blase
d
kosmos
is
an
alright
beer
but
i
doubt
itll
wow
anyone
besides
being
a
suitable
alternative
to
bmc
stuff
theres
nothing
outstanding
here
a
slightly
above
average
beer
in
a
below
average
style
d
not
normally
a
style
i
like
but
this
one
wasnt
too
bad
could
see
having
a
couple
at
a
cook
out
it
poured
out
a
dark
yelloworange
that
made
me
really
unnerved
when
i
first
saw
it
wasnt
a
normal
beer
color
smooth
texture
and
very
little
bite
good
flavor
yet
unremarkable
would
drink
again
but
not
actively
seek
out
the
shiner
bock
is
a
better
option
from
this
brewer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
isnt
much
to
it
that
would
make
me
select
it
over
many
others
worth
a
try
d
very
sessionable
it
doesnt
really
have
a
standout
characteristic
but
its
a
good
overall
beer
d
a
good
session
quaff
if
i
see
it
again
ill
consdier
buying
it
drinkability
an
exceptional
beer
from
shiner
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
pretty
damn
tasty
it
really
hit
the
spot
for
me
this
is
something
i
would
recommend
for
anyone
a
nice
but
small
beer
within
the
same
class
as
summits
extra
pale
and
budweizer
american
ale
thanks
exiled
i
tried
this
as
part
of
a
shiner
sampler
i
have
to
say
i
love
shiner
bock
as
a
session
beer
but
this
was
something
unexpected
appearance
was
a
straw
yellow
with
little
carbonation
smell
was
strange
like
a
lemongrass
soup
taste
followed
the
smell
light
and
citrus
some
hops
mouthfeel
was
average
not
terribly
overpowering
but
underimpressive
drinkability
alright
not
my
favorite
but
not
awful
drink
i
could
have
many
of
these
and
while
the
flavors
arent
real
strong
the
beer
tastes
very
good
shiners
best
in
my
opinion
the
mouth
can
feel
the
light
carbonation
and
watery
feel
ok
but
too
light
for
me
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
one
i
would
definitly
drink
again
golden
yellow
color
the
tiny
bit
of
head
that
it
had
quickly
dissipated
no
lacing
nothing
much
to
the
smell
a
little
spicy
hop
maybe
a
medium
bodied
lager
with
much
more
flavor
than
a
macro
malty
and
hoppy
good
clean
flavor
for
a
golden
lager
low
carbonation
but
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
on
a
hot
day
a
better
alternative
to
mass
produced
stuff
d
a
basic
lager
w
a
bit
more
hopping
flavor
wise
but
doesnt
make
me
want
anotheraverage
drinkability
m
medhigh
carbonation
medium
body
drinkability
its
okay
not
something
im
going
to
get
excited
about
but
i
could
drink
it
again
this
is
a
beer
without
pretense
it
taste
good
looks
nice
in
a
glass
and
is
easy
to
drink
too
bad
they
dont
release
this
in
cases
should
be
there
flagship
beer
much
better
than
shiner
bock
initial
impression
from
the
pour
does
not
impress
as
there
is
not
much
aroma
and
little
head
retention
the
first
sip
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
that
quickly
fades
as
the
long
malty
finish
disappoints
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
this
medium
bodied
clear
amber
lager
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
for
more
while
it
may
be
a
better
alternative
to
the
mass
market
lagers
ill
not
pursue
it
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
doesnt
seem
like
much
at
first
but
it
grows
on
you
drinkability
i
would
venture
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
you
can
buy
in
the
8dollarsixpack
range
unfortunately
it
is
only
available
with
other
shiner
beers
in
the
family
reunion
six
or
twelvepacks
i
wouldnt
exert
any
more
energy
to
get
another
one
drinkability
pretty
average
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
but
i
dont
turn
my
nose
up
either
its
certainly
one
of
the
better
shiners
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
particularly
great
beer
either
ive
only
seen
these
in
sixers
of
shiner
family
reunion
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
six
of
these
if
it
were
by
itself
though
i
would
like
a
single
of
this
occasionally
notes
while
not
my
favorite
lager
of
all
time
the
dryhopping
definitely
lends
it
its
own
unique
aspects
so
its
worth
trying
i
really
wish
they
sold
this
by
itself
though
otherwise
it
would
have
been
a
unique
and
interesting
summer
beer
worthy
of
buying
again
i
dont
want
to
buy
another
sampler
for
a
single
kosmos
reserve
though
verdict
i
have
to
say
i
found
this
rather
plain
while
its
a
pleasant
enough
beer
there
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
anything
special
enough
about
kosmos
reserve
to
warrant
all
of
the
pomp
and
exclusivity
pours
a
clear
copperorange
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
pale
hop
yeast
cleanliness
and
slight
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hop
yeast
cleanliness
sweet
malt
and
a
dry
hop
finish
overall
my
most
favorite
pale
lager
ive
had
drinkability
possibly
the
best
balanced
beer
that
i
have
had
from
shiner
and
overall
a
pleasure
to
drink
its
not
quite
hoppy
enough
for
hardcore
hopheads
but
is
still
enjoyable
for
your
average
beer
advocate
also
might
be
a
good
gateway
into
hoppier
beers
would
definitely
have
this
again
pours
a
bright
goldenyellow
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
of
grape
and
champagne
light
and
crisp
body
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
that
ends
with
a
dry
clean
finish
the
light
carbonation
makes
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
alternative
to
macro
lagers
if
thats
what
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
brew
has
a
nice
appearance
and
nose
good
solid
flavor
very
nice
quaff
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
some
good
earthy
hop
and
sweet
malt
aromas
but
this
beer
is
not
very
aromatic
a
decent
malt
flavor
with
some
good
earthy
hop
nothing
too
complex
in
the
taste
it
is
little
bit
above
average
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
a
simple
good
pale
lager
that
has
an
extra
dose
of
noble
hop
thats
pretty
decent
mildly
sweet
malts
combine
with
toasty
and
floral
hop
bitterness
to
give
this
one
more
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
anchor
steam
and
brooklyn
lager
has
an
old
fashioned
feel
to
it
i
would
definitely
buy
a
sixer
of
this
if
they
would
package
it
by
itself
good
beer
d
this
is
maybe
the
best
shiner
beer
ive
had
and
the
dry
hopping
is
appreciated
but
it
still
falls
somewhat
short
dark
gold
pour
almost
amber
thin
white
head
that
stays
around
smells
faintly
of
grain
a
little
grassy
maybe
tastes
better
than
it
smells
pale
malty
flavors
up
front
some
noble
hops
and
a
clean
finish
its
very
carbonated
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
if
you
really
hunt
for
it
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
and
i
dont
get
the
negative
reviews
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
im
guessing
this
wont
be
around
much
longer
but
it
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
if
it
were
on
tap
i
finally
tracked
down
a
bottle
of
the
shiner
some
people
have
been
talking
about
poured
into
a
pint
glass
its
a
pretty
beer
with
an
amber
color
and
a
thick
creamy
head
the
aroma
though
is
nothing
to
speak
of
just
a
slight
graininess
despite
the
labels
assertions
of
its
aromatic
dry
hopped
nose
the
flavor
isnt
bad
at
least
theres
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
though
bitterness
is
moderate
at
best
mixed
with
a
typical
shiner
malt
fairly
good
drinking
beer
it
at
least
beats
the
standard
shiner
hands
down
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
myself
having
one
after
another
without
batting
an
eye
but
it
just
isnt
the
beer
i
would
rather
spend
my
time
on
drinking
pretty
much
offensive
to
all
my
senses
i
had
to
try
a
family
pack
looks
like
a
lager
smells
a
little
maltier
than
i
expected
with
some
of
the
regular
shiner
hoppiness
tastes
a
tad
sweeter
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
warmth
feels
a
little
thicker
but
the
carbonation
comes
out
about
half
way
through
i
could
drink
a
few
overall
a
slight
disappointment
though
i
guess
id
built
it
up
in
my
head
its
not
at
all
bad
just
not
remarkably
good
drinkability
pretty
good
decent
tasting
and
im
guessing
pretty
low
in
the
abv
department
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
another
bottle
or
two
d
drinkable
but
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
with
this
brew
as
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
it
d
pretty
decent
for
the
style
nothing
amazing
but
a
fairly
well
made
beer
that
like
everything
else
from
shiner
is
aimed
to
the
masses
not
the
beer
geeks
out
there
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
just
want
a
beer
and
not
anything
crazy
pours
straw
colored
lots
of
carbonation
yet
it
fails
to
bring
about
any
head
on
top
after
mere
seconds
the
head
is
gone
nose
has
some
hop
notes
kind
of
a
hybrid
of
both
citrus
and
piney
taste
is
nice
and
suprisingly
hoppy
really
a
decent
beer
but
kind
of
shitty
you
have
to
buy
it
in
that
family
pack
mouthfeel
is
pretty
clean
overall
refreshing
d
not
all
that
impressive
supremely
sessionable
its
kinda
like
a
lightish
vienna
lager
i
liked
it
d
easy
drinking
session
beer
if
you
could
get
it
as
a
session
beer
without
the
family
pack
one
of
6
different
beers
i
expect
to
see
this
as
a
stand
alone
sixer
at
some
point
but
this
isnt
going
to
stand
out
much
from
the
macro
crowd
overall
a
major
disappointment
i
never
had
this
when
it
was
around
a
long
time
ago
and
had
been
reading
posts
about
how
great
it
used
to
be
so
was
eagerly
awaiting
its
release
was
hoping
to
find
a
shiner
that
i
like
these
days
either
they
changed
the
formula
or
im
missing
something
very
bland
and
flavorless
dont
recommend
just
reviewed
5
of
the
6
beers
in
the
6
pack
id
reviewed
the
6th
a
couple
years
ago
and
all
were
bland
and
not
worth
having
again
i
used
to
love
shiner
when
i
first
moved
here
about
15
years
ago
but
i
find
them
now
to
be
middling
shame
but
time
to
move
on
this
beer
is
the
only
reason
why
i
bought
the
shiner
family
mixed
packed
after
trying
it
i
am
disappointed
i
cant
really
make
anything
out
in
the
nose
or
flavor
just
bland
i
am
sorry
kosmos
spoetzl
this
is
a
disservice
to
you
this
brew
pours
up
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
the
nose
is
grainy
pale
malts
nothing
crazy
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
kinda
buttery
mouthfeel
slight
hop
bittering
light
bodied
low
carbo
damn
i
wish
that
the
spoetzl
brewery
would
just
make
one
intense
beer
but
if
were
just
comparing
beers
within
the
brewery
id
say
this
one
is
not
one
of
their
better
offerings
pours
a
big
fizzy
white
head
that
extremely
quickly
diminishes
orangeyellow
colored
body
extremely
clear
looking
malty
english
malty
aroma
some
nuttiness
but
mostly
smelling
of
adjuncts
maybe
some
vegetables
nutty
fizzy
taste
overcarbonated
tasting
some
of
that
same
vegetableness
somewhat
refreshing
some
hoppy
bitterness
but
none
of
the
grapefruitiness
or
other
aspect
of
the
hops
is
present
some
corn
taste
maybe
meh
does
not
get
any
better
as
it
warms
less
tasty
im
kinda
glad
this
is
a
reunion
beer
i
dont
mean
to
knock
it
but
i
expect
much
more
from
shiner
maybe
im
putting
too
much
pressure
on
them
pours
out
golden
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
very
faint
mostly
floral
apon
first
taste
the
carbonation
is
the
first
shock
to
the
system
other
than
that
this
is
just
plain
nothing
special
about
it
too
me
its
just
a
few
ingredents
different
from
their
blonde
light
and
spezial
liecht
very
disappointed
yet
again
by
shiner
drinkability
i
could
sip
a
few
of
these
very
nice
for
shiner
a
totally
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
at
all
if
the
brewery
brought
this
back
on
a
year
round
or
seasonal
basis
its
a
solid
lager
and
makes
a
fine
session
beer
along
with
the
100th
anniversary
beer
they
did
dopplebock
kosmos
helps
make
2009
a
very
good
year
for
the
folks
at
shiner
thoughts
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favs
from
shiner
i
hope
they
rerelease
this
as
a
seasonal
in
sixer
i
like
it
alot
its
not
an
a
beer
but
a
solid
b
beer
i
do
not
care
what
you
think
this
is
certainly
a
nice
brew
if
the
rep
for
shiner
reads
this
release
it
in
sixers
overall
not
very
good
honestly
oh
well
had
to
try
it
pours
very
pale
yellow
color
virtually
no
head
what
is
there
is
carbonated
no
lacing
sour
fruit
aroma
yeasty
bready
with
some
spicy
bitterness
in
taste
nothing
special
drinkable
but
would
only
drink
if
nothing
else
present
and
really
wanted
a
beer
pours
out
to
a
thin
white
sudsy
head
that
lasts
but
does
not
lace
very
pale
yellow
and
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
is
very
light
and
grainy
and
slightly
grassy
flavor
is
very
light
and
thin
not
much
going
on
reminds
me
of
another
all
malt
lowcallowcarb
beer
that
is
no
longer
brewed
for
what
it
is
it
is
ok
overall
one
of
the
most
watery
boring
flavorless
craft
beers
ive
ever
had
overallnot
a
true
replacement
of
the
shiner
blonde
it
bears
little
in
taste
resemblance
to
that
beer
to
me
i
do
like
the
fact
that
spoetzl
is
trying
to
work
a
light
beer
and
for
that
i
will
try
to
keep
a
six
or
two
in
the
lager
for
friends
who
prefer
light
beers
overall
shiner
l
blonde
fail
atmosphere
is
fair
lots
of
effervescence
and
a
giant
head
also
some
persistent
lacing
nose
is
light
grain
with
a
strange
sweetness
and
pervasive
odor
of
methane
gas
very
light
and
shallow
flavor
almost
indistinct
overall
this
is
not
so
good
quaff
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
light
straw
coloring
with
a
thin
low
profile
sparse
white
filmy
surface
coating
aromas
of
toast
floral
highlights
and
some
funky
esther
flavors
are
tangy
and
light
with
an
effervescent
character
keeping
the
body
crisp
toasted
grain
backbone
with
some
buttery
highlights
the
aftertaste
is
light
with
a
toasty
character
frothy
slightly
sharp
finish
its
really
not
much
different
from
your
typical
light
american
lager
o
this
is
a
light
easy
drinking
lager
nothing
fabulous
but
okay
rjt
o
meh
certainly
a
step
down
from
other
shiner
brews
i
guess
its
probably
a
step
up
from
the
socalled
yellow
fizzy
beers
and
at
least
your
money
goes
to
a
smaller
brewery
than
inbev
or
millercoors
am
i
grasping
at
straws
o
probably
good
on
a
hot
day
overall
impression
while
the
blonde
by
shiner
spoetzl
is
relatively
easy
going
also
i
had
no
trouble
putting
this
one
down
in
under
5
gulps
a
bit
too
watered
down
for
my
taste
i
know
its
a
light
blonde
but
why
have
a
style
this
easy
enjoyed
the
beer
for
what
it
was
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
got
my
girlfriend
to
split
it
with
me
i
have
pretty
low
expectations
this
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
somewhat
sweet
and
light
no
real
hop
presence
the
feel
is
very
light
taste
is
like
what
i
expected
very
light
adjunct
beer
but
better
than
the
big
three
lights
this
transparent
yellow
beverage
smelled
a
bit
like
hops
i
thought
i
tasted
none
though
it
was
like
lightly
beerish
flavoured
carbonated
water
and
i
dont
like
carbonated
water
im
an
american
i
was
outside
on
a
hot
day
and
i
still
would
have
preferred
a
shiner
bock
even
those
are
pretty
watery
though
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
grain
with
nothing
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
and
some
grassy
notes
this
beer
tastes
almost
exactly
like
miller
lite
which
i
assume
is
what
the
brewers
were
going
for
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
easily
drinkable
low
abv
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
just
nothing
notable
o
quite
drinkable
has
good
flavornot
watery
yet
smooth
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
fizzy
head
with
modest
retention
and
decent
lacing
as
clear
as
one
could
ask
for
the
style
pours
a
golden
yellow
into
pilsner
glass
smell
denotes
the
onset
of
undesirable
qualities
but
not
really
present
in
the
taste
the
beer
i
had
was
probably
a
couple
months
past
the
best
before
date
but
has
not
gone
bad
yet
similar
flavor
and
feel
to
a
dos
equis
lager
especial
but
less
sweet
and
less
crisp
slightly
watery
not
as
carbonated
as
similar
lagers
but
then
as
i
said
its
past
bbd
www
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
just
taste
like
a
cheap
beer
middle
of
the
road
light
beer
appealing
to
as
many
people
as
possible
overall
light
and
easy
drinking
pleasant
and
should
pair
well
with
many
foods
pretty
bland
and
average
at
best
when
beer
is
just
beer
was
part
of
the
reunion
6
pack
its
just
a
macro
style
lager
but
a
bit
better
than
your
average
bud
miller
or
whatever
but
nothing
special
i
wouldnt
ever
seek
it
out
on
its
own
27
home
bottle
decent
smell
and
taste
though
very
bland
and
average
beer
thin
astringent
a
touch
and
had
alcohol
heat
in
the
finish
a
bit
lacking
in
malty
flavor
and
finished
carelessly
with
a
hops
bitter
great
beer
its
good
i
like
it
a
easy
drinking
lager
a
dime
a
dozen
but
still
enjoyable
feel
gone
immediately
o
nothing
special
here
id
rather
just
drink
an
mgd
or
something
easydrinking
chugger
from
spoetzl
not
a
lot
of
smell
or
taste
for
that
matter
maybe
a
step
up
from
standard
us
macro
brews
maybe
not
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
on
a
hot
day
overall
nothing
special
about
this
beer
glad
i
tried
it
tastes
like
a
metallic
step
up
from
keystone
pours
nicely
into
pint
glass
with
a
fine
white
head
that
has
some
lacing
very
mild
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
very
blase
not
much
to
it
fine
for
lunch
on
a
work
day
or
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
are
thirsty
not
a
fan
would
not
purchase
and
would
not
likely
drink
if
offered
for
free
not
my
usual
sort
of
beer
but
for
what
it
is
its
quite
serviceable
would
be
a
good
summertime
thirst
quencher
if
you
can
find
it
shiner
premium
would
be
good
as
a
slightly
more
upscale
replacement
for
the
standard
american
megalagers
overall
3
73
a
great
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again
and
again
better
than
the
macros
for
sure
and
much
cleaner
finishing
the
only
hit
i
would
give
it
is
that
its
taste
is
a
bit
lacking
but
overall
its
very
malty
and
pairs
with
food
well
it
does
what
its
supposed
to
not
a
craft
beer
with
tiers
of
flavor
so
dont
judge
it
by
that
for
what
it
is
and
it
is
a
basic
no
frills
lager
it
does
a
great
job
slightly
above
average
sweet
and
clean
lager
would
not
be
the
first
i
would
go
to
but
not
one
to
turn
down
either
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
cheap
it
wont
blow
your
hair
back
but
its
worth
a
taste
condor
recommended
and
approved
it
was
a
screwcap
so
no
pop
but
plenty
of
glug
as
i
nearly
upturned
the
bottle
just
to
see
what
would
happen
i
got
a
brief
pseudocascade
followed
by
the
creation
of
three
fingers
of
dense
fizzy
bonewhite
head
that
began
to
fall
fairly
quickly
leaving
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
strawyellow
srm
2
im
not
sure
if
this
is
intentional
or
not
either
way
not
horrible
there
is
a
sweetness
to
the
malty
character
in
the
flavor
with
grainy
notes
and
a
nice
clean
hop
bite
to
finish
overall
nothing
too
fancy
i
always
really
liked
shiner
blonde
and
i
love
the
rebranding
with
the
oldschool
packaging
great
easydrinking
pale
american
lager
the
only
issue
i
have
is
when
it
tries
to
be
more
fancy
than
it
is
such
as
price
but
if
it
is
at
the
same
price
point
as
the
other
macro
beers
where
ever
you
may
be
then
this
wins
a
solidly
decent
lager
nothing
particularly
outstanding
to
write
home
about
but
definitely
a
good
option
compared
with
many
of
its
american
counterparts
it
has
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
great
clarity
its
well
balanced
but
doesnt
end
up
tasting
like
much
of
anything
particular
however
the
fact
that
its
price
is
that
of
a
premium
beer
one
would
expect
much
more
than
this
what
gives
in
my
opinion
and
its
mine
and
mine
alone
i
think
shiner
needs
to
pack
this
one
up
and
forget
it
seriously
i
was
really
disappointed
and
i
like
some
of
shiners
brews
this
is
a
marketing
focus
opinion
for
free
and
its
brutal
but
im
being
honest
all
successful
companies
know
that
you
give
your
customer
what
they
want
and
not
what
you
think
theyll
like
or
need
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
wisps
of
foam
on
top
aromas
of
light
bready
pilsner
malt
with
a
hint
of
either
caramelized
sugar
or
caramel
flavoring
and
a
hint
of
prune
type
fruits
very
faint
aromas
of
earthy
spicy
hops
round
us
out
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sugary
sweet
with
hints
of
prune
or
fruit
little
to
no
hop
flavor
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
keep
this
from
cloying
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
like
i
did
its
the
shiner
version
of
budlight
only
about
10x
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
stuff
is
what
ill
reach
for
next
time
i
want
to
drink
some
cold
american
lager
pours
golden
clear
with
a
thick
white
head
on
top
you
can
smell
the
grains
and
hops
in
it
the
taste
is
very
good
with
a
hint
of
malt
some
grains
and
kind
of
a
sweet
taste
that
i
cant
figure
out
well
worth
the
money
o
i
said
a
lot
of
negative
things
here
but
nothing
was
really
all
too
bad
i
think
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
it
just
doesnt
take
a
stand
anywhere
its
boring
tastes
like
a
cheap
mid
20th
century
american
brew
on
the
plus
side
its
drinkable
and
nice
and
would
probably
be
a
perfectly
acceptable
camping
or
beer
pong
brew
certainly
its
better
than
most
american
macrobrews
i
bought
this
beer
as
part
of
a
variety
six
pack
for
about
8
50
overall
2
25
not
very
pleased
with
this
beer
however
it
does
have
some
qualities
its
refreshing
certainly
good
for
very
casual
drinkers
just
not
the
most
tasteful
overall
its
a
good
lager
much
tastier
than
the
typical
stegmeier
i
pick
up
if
i
see
it
again
for
a
buck
i
will
try
and
score
a
six
pack
had
this
as
part
of
shiner
variety
pack
could
be
the
most
bland
beer
i
have
ever
had
nothing
bad
to
really
say
nothing
off
putting
it
seems
like
all
shiner
beers
have
the
same
appearance
with
different
colors
and
none
seem
to
have
anything
going
for
the
nose
this
one
has
nohing
wrong
with
it
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
also
does
not
really
have
anything
good
about
it
basically
meh
easy
drinking
but
again
meh
poured
this
beer
producing
a
robust
foamy
head

quickly
subsided

little
remnant

but
not
unpleasant

is
decent

not

very

equally
unmemorable
not
a

but
nothing
distinguished

perhaps
slightly
better

good
carbonation
at

a
drinkable
beer
not
the
kind
i
would

was

right
mood
shiner
premium
beer
35
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
this
beer
is
nice
and
smooth
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
complex
enough
for
my
tastes
summary
i
was
skeptical
about
this
brew
but
it
turned
out
to
be
just
fine
would
be
good
with
something
spicy
mexican
or
chinese
maybe
definitely
a
decent
nonbmc
brew
and
besides
with
a
spoetzl
name
its
just
so
german
c
wanted
to
like
this
but
no
thanks
schlitz
is
better
o
not
very
good
the
taste
is
way
too
watery
and
there
arent
any
standout
flavors
i
think
this
is
just
a
mediocre
beer
that
just
barely
has
more
flavor
than
macro
lagers
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
but
i
drank
8
last
night
and
it
wasnt
strong
enough
good
beer
though
its
not
offensive
but
theres
just
nothing
here
pretty
generic
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
it
isnt
a
beer
id
be
quick
to
label
craft
but
it
is
a
beer
that
is
far
superior
to
any
macroadjunct
lager
this
beer
does
have
the
qualities
such
as
good
drinkability
that
one
would
look
for
in
a
beer
such
as
this
its
also
refreshing
with
a
low
abv
which
makes
it
an
ideal
lawnmower
beer
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
shallow
hue
giant
head
lots
of
effervescence
and
some
pretty
solid
lacing
nose
is
pale
and
bready
white
bread
with
a
slight
hop
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
earthy
and
light
overall
this
is
decent
quaff
overall
there
is
not
much
to
this
beer
at
all
a
very
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
at
all
interesting
not
something
i
will
pick
up
again
o
no
bad
not
memorable
either
overall
far
superior
to
most
macro
beers
or
for
that
matter
most
pale
lagers
brewed
by
microbreweries
overall
light
and
not
that
great
from
a
craft
brewer
pbr
or
hamms

to
a
nice

that
falls
to
a
thin
ring
of

refreshing
pilsner

with
a

this
is
well
made

carbonated
a
buddy
brought
me
this
back
from
texas
with
him
the
label
art
is
pretty
cool
retro
look
to
it
poured
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
frothy
white
light
head
that
quickly
disappears
to
leave
a
clear
surface
behind
steady
flow
of
carbonation
bubbling
throughout
aromas
of
roasted
grains
and
a
buttery
sweetness
not
much
else
really
flavors
of
toast
and
corn
with
roasted
qualities
throughout
light
palate
on
a
thin
body
the
aftertaste
is
roasty
as
well
slick
clean
finish
this
one
strikes
closer
to
an
adjunct
than
anything
else
i
can
put
my
finger
on
o
this
is
an
okay
lager
fairly
typical
for
a
shiner
solid
pale
lager
nothing
too
remarkable
or
unusual
but
very
tasty
and
one
of
their
better
beers
mouthfeel
is
light
appropriate
to
style
and
doesnt
get
too
watery
or
thinnedout
a
light
touch
of
both
crispness
and
smoothness
makes
this
a
pretty
good
one
though
it
could
use
a
bit
more
of
each
if
youre
going
light
this
is
better
than
most
options
available
as
far
as
this
type
of
lager
is
concerned
o
theres
nothing
very
appealing
about
the
smell
or
taste
of
this
beer
to
make
me
want
to
try
another
overall
satisfied
would
buy
a
case
again
i
have
to
say
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
beer
but
it
actually
impressed
not
remarkable
for
big
flavors
or
complexity
but
at
this
moment
it
hits
the
spot
light
bodied
mildly
carbonated
with
nothing
offensive
i
can
say
this
brewery
stuck
to
basics
and
created
an
authentic
german
beer
mediumlight
body
crisp
and
more
than
semidry
on
the
finish
overall
impression
wasnt
expecting
much
after
the
smell
but
it
tastes
interesting
enough
that
i
could
easily
go
through
a
few
nothing
thrilling
but
this
isnt
a
bad
lighter
beer
overall
a
solid
not
spectacular
lager
that
may
be
my
least
favorite
in
the
variety
pack
this
is
very
clean
an
certainly
sessionable
as
an
overall
beer
probably
closer
to
a
3
5
yet
compared
to
others
in
the
style
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
ones
if
not
just
due
to
the
pleasing
flavors
in
here
o
overall
not
bad
after
several
lackluster
beers
from
this
brewery
not
as
crisp
as
one
expects
and
certainly
not
mugpitcher
worthy
drinks
like
a
wheat
or
pilsner
body
with
just
enough
show
of
hops
to
let
you
know
its
there
o
its
easily
drinkable
but
its
too
onedimensional
and
the
undercarbonation
really
hurt
it
for
me
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
is
rather
strange
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
would
probably
not
drink
it
again
d
overall
a
decent
beer
with
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
feel
the
crisp
malt
begins
the
flavor
portion
with
mild
toasted
grain
and
slightly
noble
tasting
hops
which
give
subtle
lemony
pith
elements
to
the
taste
with
a
subtle
herbal
mild
flavor
the
citrus
edge
adds
to
the
flavor
since
it
gives
a
contrast
to
the
sweet
elements
in
the
malt
and
the
hops
seem
slightly
spiced
which
gives
the
impression
of
a
pilsner
at
that
level
almost
since
the
yeast
flavor
is
dry
as
it
finishes
it
could
go
either
way
i
liked
this
since
i
found
it
to
be
a
good
american
pale
lager
with
some
nice
hop
flavoring
this
lager
is
good
quality
since
there
are
flew
noticeable
flaws
and
it
finishes
rather
smooth
and
quaffable
o
it
has
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
a
very
good
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
kind
we
get
here
in
s
florida
everyday
one
should
not
buy
this
beer
and
try
to
fing
complexity
in
it
its
not
characteristic
for
american
pale
lager
overall
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
were
different
and
pleasantly
surprising
and
except
for
the
somewhat
heavy
texture
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
this
beer
was
mild
back
in
the
90s
and
thesedays
it
seems
even
more
tame
i
cant
really
figure
who
or
where
i
would
recommend
this
its
light
in
every
way
so
i
guess
id
recommend
it
to
people
who
dont
drink
beer
or
people
who
need
to
drink
beer
when
its
over
100
degrees
out
o
eh
lacking
flavor
and
depth
easy
drinker
very
light
crisp
and
bubbly
in
mouthfeel
with
a
basic
bread
and
malt
backbone
taste
the
aftertaste
runs
to
mild
noble
bitterness
with
a
slight
tinge
of
metal
somewhat
boring
but
reasonably
drinkable
not
outstanding
but
decent
within
the
style
overall
above
decent
lager
the
body
is
a
little
watery
but
kind
of
refreshing
nonetheless
it
tastes
like
a
light
lager
a
little
bitter
like
a
pilsner
overall
this
was
a
good
lager
it
would
make
a
nice
alternative
to
the
regular
bmc
lagers
all
the
flavors
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
were
there
and
nice
and
light
like
they
should
be
this
would
make
a
good
summertime
beer
i
could
see
drinking
a
couple
of
these
while
mowing
the
lawn
or
playing
some
disc
golf
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
but
it
is
a
welcome
addition
to
tommyknockers
mixed
six
pack
i
would
recommend
alpine
glacier
lager
to
anybody
that
likes
a
nice
light
refreshing
lager
now
the
nose
was
light
and
the
taste
followed
but
for
what
the
bottle
said
it
should
be
like
it
was
spot
on
biscuits
and
earthy
notes
lemon
and
honey
some
fruity
yeasty
notes
the
taste
is
light
not
overly
watery
with
a
malt
forward
biscuit
bready
front
end
with
earthy
hops
in
the
back
and
hints
of
lemon
very
light
crisp
clean
smooth
and
refreshing
clean
finish
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
tommyknockers
which
isnt
saying
much
but
still
this
is
a
pretty
decent
lager
the
flavor
is
light
but
not
watery
overall
a
good
choice
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
and
refreshing
tommyknocker
alpine
glacier
lager
was
golden
in
color
and
hazy
it
had
a
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
sweet
malt
and
lemony
citrus
the
taste
was
malt
hops
and
spice
with
a
little
bitterness
the
finish
was
dry
with
more
spice
and
light
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
just
less
than
medium
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
also
good
this
is
a
good
pale
lager
and
worth
trying
out
notes
i
like
this
beer
will
purchase
again
i
have
been
pleased
so
far
with
all
my
samplings
of
tommyknocker
brews
d
very
good
may
be
a
very
good
introduction
to
craft
rookies
i
really
like
this
brew
clean
hoppy
and
delicious
at
first
taste
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
beer
but
after
a
couple
drinks
i
realized
that
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
on
it
a
good
lager
with
a
bit
of
a
citrus
taste
i
liked
this
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
a
damn
good
beer
worth
my
money
time
and
taste
surprisingly
good
and
highly
drinkable
d
a
tasty
offering
and
a
worthy
attempt
at
the
style
i
liked
the
balanced
hops
and
malt
characteristics
and
the
mouthfeel
made
for
a
refreshing
lager
definitely
worth
trying
is
you
can
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
or
a
pint
not
sure
what
a
glacier
lager
is
but
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
light
belgium
wheat
blue
moon
comes
to
mind
d
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
session
lager
hazy
straw
colored
body
pretty
large
pillowy
white
head
tops
it
off
decent
amount
of
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
nothing
overpowering
on
the
nose
just
some
regular
lagered
malts
nice
light
pale
malts
are
the
main
part
of
the
taste
nice
little
kiss
of
hops
as
well
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
style
thats
hard
to
do
a
lot
with
doing
something
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
one
of
those
sit
outside
in
the
sun
beers
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
hops
taste
is
mild
malts
with
some
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
great
overall
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
is
great
for
me
a
little
thick
but
good
just
enough
foam
to
keep
the
tongue
dancing
this
beer
has
a
very
hazy
brass
body
there
is
a
semi
rocky
head
it
has
a
fruity
and
grassy
flavor
the
hops
and
the
malt
flavors
are
distinct
you
can
definitely
tell
which
flavors
come
from
which
ingredient
i
thought
it
was
very
balanced
the
bitterness
and
the
sweetness
counter
themselves
well
a
good
drinking
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
d
easy
drinking
abv
is
very
manageable
a
bit
filling
at
time
the
flavors
are
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
sessionable
for
sure
d
smooth
session
beer
i
took
2
sips
and
it
was
gone
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowgolden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
bready
malt
hints
of
toffee
and
very
faint
hints
of
spicy
hops
the
taste
more
forthcoming
than
the
aroma
the
is
the
same
bready
malt
with
a
lot
more
of
a
hops
character
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fuller
than
light
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
isnt
the
more
complex
beer
of
this
style
ive
tasted
but
it
is
good
enough
that
i
find
it
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
again
overall
fairly
drinkable
pale
lager
attempt
ive
tasted
worse
thats
for
sure
but
probably
would
not
purchase
again
in
some
ways
its
similar
to
otter
creek
summer
ale
from
vermont
which
is
mediocre
but
still
better
than
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
23
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
some
tart
malt
sweet
malt
slight
hops
some
slight
pine
notes
and
some
slight
yeast
cleanliness
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
lager
cleanliness
slight
hops
some
sweet
malt
and
some
hints
of
pine
causing
a
little
dryness
overall
a
great
improvement
over
an
american
adjunct
though
still
lacking
in
body
for
my
taste
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
in
quantity
though
goes
down
smooth
good
carbonation
level
good
hopmalt
balance
though
its
not
terrible
with
so
many
good
beers
out
there
to
be
enjoyed
i
really
cannot
imagine
having
to
drink
another
of
these
just
not
enjoyable
at
all
edit
after
posting
my
review
then
looking
at
others
some
of
you
guys
really
need
to
study
the
style
and
rate
according
ot
the
the
fucking
style
not
personal
preferance
american
pale
lager
is
a
generally
boring
beer
not
meant
to
be
complex
if
you
are
looking
for
something
to
knock
your
socks
off
dont
look
at
this
style
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
so
much
better
than
a
bmc
being
light
and
clean
on
the
finish
makes
this
one
fairly
drinkable
there
are
better
summer
beers
for
the
price
i
was
rather
disappointed
by
the
blandness
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
much
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
deserves
a
better
rating
than
what
many
here
have
given
it
im
rating
here
based
on
the
potential
that
exists
within
this
style
overall
it
has
a
good
balance
with
hops
and
yeast
clean
and
simple
finish
a
decent
beer
overall
i
have
always
had
nice
things
from
this
brewery
and
i
hope
that
this
bottle
was
the
exception
not
the
rule
d
a
nice
session
beer
that
pairs
well
with
typical
american
food
good
for
a
revisit
in
the
summer
months
d
this
is
my
first
tk
brew
and
its
an
exceptional
allmalt
lager
that
provides
plenty
of
subtle
lager
flavors
with
great
body
that
belies
careful
attention
to
detail
in
appropriate
malt
proportions
to
give
a
full
flavor
drinkability
its
ok
a
rather
acceptable
lager
all
except
the
mess
and
subsequent
cleanup
would
make
for
refreshing
summertime
drinking
or
a
good
candidate
for
a
lawnmower
beer
in
that
i
will
drink
it
out
on
my
porch
while
the
apartments
landscaping
crew
maintains
the
grass
work
on
workers
well
its
pretty
drinkable
thats
for
sure
i
mean
its
a
bland
tasting
lager
with
little
flavor
but
if
its
cold
it
will
go
down
and
smooth
and
give
you
a
buzz
if
youre
looking
for
one
if
youre
looking
for
a
lager
with
taste
id
look
elsewhere
a
little
lackluster
but
still
better
than
a
bud
or
coors
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
strawyellow
color
with
a
thin
creamy
looking
head
the
smell
is
pretty
neutral
slighlty
sweet
with
grainy
malt
the
flavor
has
the
same
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
decent
hopping
to
balance
finishes
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
touch
of
mouthburning
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
just
by
the
nature
of
the
beer
light
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
not
the
greatest
beer
out
there
but
id
order
this
over
bmc
beer
if
given
the
option
overall
this
is
not
an
overwhelming
brew
but
it
was
a
tasty
one
however
i
do
not
see
myself
getting
this
again
poured
a
orangish
gold
with
decent
head
retention
and
good
lacings
a
noticeable
smell
of
hops
and
some
huskiness
real
dry
smell
plus
maybe
some
dry
fruits
or
something
i
dont
even
know
what
im
trying
to
say
with
that
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
this
beer
but
they
dont
really
go
anywhere
some
sour
fruitish
taste
but
it
does
go
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
backbite
i
just
really
wouldnt
want
this
basic
lager
for
myself
again
wasnt
bad
wasnt
standout
overall
tastier
than
expected
a
good
solid
lager
enjoyable
not
a
bad
brew
if
you
wanna
just
kick
it
with
a
lager
but
why
fork
the
extra
cash
to
get
something
a
little
more
interestingbetter
than
bmc
d
this
is
an
okay
lager
nothing
to
rush
out
and
stock
up
on
but
it
is
worth
a
try
d
i
would
have
probably
called
this
an
american
pale
ale
in
a
blind
taste
test
based
on
the
nice
level
of
hoppage
for
an
allmalt
lager
this
is
stunning
but
as
beer
in
general
its
a
little
above
average
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
doesnt
stun
you
with
complexity
or
bombastic
flavor
but
wins
you
over
with
its
easydrinkin
attitude
and
general
combination
of
flavors
if
i
were
headed
to
a
party
where
i
knew
i
would
be
doing
some
serious
sessioning
this
would
be
an
excellent
tool
for
the
job
d
very
drinkable
but
no
real
compelling
reason
to
drink
more
if
i
was
hot
and
thirsty
a
couple
of
these
would
knock
back
easily
btwthe
more
i
drank
it
the
more
that
bitter
ending
didnt
sit
well
became
less
enjoyable
the
warmer
and
more
i
drank
drinkability
obviously
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
overall
wasnt
too
surprised
however
if
given
a
choice
of
typical
lagers
this
would
be
near
the
top
d
these
are
easy
to
put
down
its
not
a
good
beer
that
i
want
to
buy
a
case
of
or
even
a
sixer
of
but
you
could
pound
these
back
the
body
is
light
but
finishes
sweet
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
of
a
drier
and
crisp
finish
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
ok
overall
there
are
some
off
flavors
here
that
i
just
couldnt
get
past
but
easy
enough
to
drink
for
an
allmalt
lager
this
was
pretty
good
i
had
this
as
my
last
sampler
from
the
pack
appearance
is
pretty
good
some
head
and
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
good
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
the
smell
the
malt
is
of
good
quality
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
in
body
and
some
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
as
well
nice
yellow
gold
color
with
a
big
soap
bubble
head
that
drips
to
a
nice
cap
that
leaves
good
lacing
steady
flow
of
carb
bubbles
gives
it
some
nice
life
smell
is
light
grain
and
reminds
me
of
corn
husk
taste
is
grainy
with
a
little
bit
of
yeasty
fruit
esters
giving
a
little
twang
upfront
it
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
bitterness
mouth
is
on
the
light
side
but
dosnt
drift
completely
to
watery
overall
this
one
is
ok
certainly
better
that
bmc
and
a
potential
cross
over
beer
for
the
non
craft
beer
lover
not
enough
overall
flavor
for
my
liking
but
there
are
really
no
obvious
flaws
either
overall
a
refreshing
lighter
beer
that
is
a
fine
example
of
its
style
and
if
you
dont
like
the
style
dont
drink
it
and
dont
review
it
against
non
allmalt
lagers
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
decent
good
session
beer
but
i
woudlnt
seek
this
beer
out
again
nice
to
have
once
though
it
pretty
much
looks
like
a
belgian
wit
to
me
it
has
the
cloudy
light
hue
it
smells
slightly
lemony
upon
tasting
it
again
i
taste
cider
notes
not
overbearing
and
some
lemongrass
to
finish
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
im
not
sure
if
this
is
because
of
the
odd
aging
process
of
sitting
in
a
warmish
building
for
a
year
and
then
my
refrigerator
for
a
week
all
things
considered
a
good
lager
but
ultimately
not
much
better
than
most
of
your
gas
station
lagers
certainly
not
worth
the
additional
cost
this
poured
from
the
bottle
a
pale
yellow
color
with
not
much
of
a
white
head
the
nose
has
some
faint
grains
and
possibly
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
well
not
much
hop
balance
in
the
taste
either
a
decent
grainy
malt
structure
though
the
body
was
light
and
crisp
not
a
bad
lager
from
tommyknocker
this
will
probably
be
the
last
time
i
have
this
one
a
very
average
beer
that
said
this
is
sitll
a
brew
that
i
would
be
happy
to
sit
and
drink
a
few
of
at
any
time
for
any
reason
just
if
im
buying
id
either
spend
half
to
get
a
macro
to
wash
some
the
wings
or
grab
a
standby
for
a
highquality
sipper
much
more
a
golden
ale
than
any
kind
of
lager
nice
flavor
but
totally
out
of
place
for
a
lager
beer
d
overall
its
sessionable
and
drinkable
and
its
not
bad
between
this
and
macro
swill
i
would
still
take
this
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
pours
a
semicloudy
pale
straw
color
with
a
decent
lace
of
head
not
much
to
smell
here
a
little
dank
though
taste
is
mediocre
and
not
as
bad
as
it
could
be
going
down
its
very
carbonated
and
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
and
dont
recommend
it
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
id
probably
drink
it
but
wont
ever
buy
it
again
a
ambitious
pour
resulted
in
about
12
head
that
did
its
best
to
hang
around
a
couple
of
minutesdecent
lacing
straw
colored
a
lot
like
a
bud
maybe
a
hint
of
ginger
in
nose
other
than
that
smells
a
lot
like
a
bud
pretty
darn
hoppy
not
ipa
hoppy
but
close
somehow
tastes
of
a
little
ginger
good
mouthfeel
and
refreshing
i
would
go
back
for
more
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
session
lager
before
i
ever
had
it
i
totally
dismissed
it
based
on
the
name
alpine
glacier
sounds
like
a
cold
watery
coors
product
anyway
i
learned
long
ago
to
try
something
with
an
open
mind
and
i
am
glad
it
did
i
plan
on
drinking
a
lot
of
this
beer
in
the
future
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
simple
beer
i
will
turn
to
this
cheers
to
tommyknocker
for
impressing
me
with
such
a
simple
beer
who
needs
imperial
this
and
that
when
you
can
have
a
wellmade
craft
beer
lager
who
am
i
fooling
i
like
imperial
whatevers
too
recommended
overall
a
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
domestic
lager
nothing
that
knocks
my
socks
off
but
then
again
this
style
shouldnt
i
could
put
a
6er
of
this
away
without
a
hitch
drinkability
the
beer
is
easy
enough
to
consume
but
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
another
if
ever
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
medium
white
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
sweet
somewhat
oxidized
and
a
slight
floralspicy
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
somewhat
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
the
bitterness
is
low
carbonation
high
and
too
prickly
thin
bodied
and
rather
dry
at
the
swallow
overall
this
is
not
an
impressive
brew
overall
this
was
not
bad
just
not
really
up
my
alley
it
was
a
hardly
there
light
ale
that
did
its
job
in
not
tasting
like
stale
macro
garbage
and
really
having
a
different
vibe
to
it
all
together
i
could
see
myself
having
one
a
hot
day
as
refreshment
not
terribly
bad
but
again
just
not
my
style
d
has
more
flavor
then
the
average
lager
while
still
maintaining
that
lager
feel
beer
definitely
lets
the
drinker
know
it
is
a
quality
brew
with
quality
ingredients
light
and
smooth
with
a
pleasant
flavor
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
an
above
average
rendition
from
tommyknocker
not
bad
i
guess
one
bottle
was
enough
for
me
though
d
good
its
a
solid
lager
an
excellent
example
of
a
crossover
brew
for
lager
fans
and
a
fall
back
brew
for
craft
enthusiasts
recommeded
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pour
a
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
not
really
there
i
cant
smell
to
much
in
this
brew
maybe
a
little
corn
a
slight
bitter
sour
smell
taste
is
pretty
weak
it
taste
like
a
carbonated
water
not
really
any
flavor
at
all
maybe
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
that
is
all
really
carbonated
water
and
i
was
truly
dissapointed
i
would
not
buy
this
again
it
was
probably
the
worst
in
the
tommyknocker
lot
this
its
unlike
any
lager
ive
had
to
date
rich
yet
light
drinkability
two
in
a
night
is
good
a
little
sweet
though
first
sip
reveals
a
crisp
light
texture
with
fine
tingly
carbonation
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
pears
and
general
fruit
again
like
the
nose
i
also
get
just
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
lagery
more
of
a
mild
pale
ale
imo
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
lighttomedium
body
moderate
carbonation
light
crisp
pretty
much
just
a
basic
lager
good
if
your
looking
for
something
light
on
a
hot
day
and
your
not
looking
for
anything
with
much
complexity
average
ale
color
with
a
thick
head
if
you
drink
this
out
of
a
bottle
watch
out
as
it
really
foams
flavor
has
strong
fruity
overtones
so
it
tastes
almost
like
a
cider
more
than
a
beer
exceptionally
smooth
it
goes
down
easily
could
be
a
good
beer
to
help
wean
people
off
of
macrobrews
the
mouth
is
just
a
hair
above
average
but
drinkablity
suffers
from
the
taste
so
far
im
2
for
4
on
beers
from
this
brewery
drinkability
great
this
beer
is
as
close
to
the
macro
swill
as
i
like
to
come
perfect
for
hot
afternoons
and
bbq
this
is
a
easy
drinking
well
balanced
beer
typical
lager
characteristics
with
a
smooth
mouth
feel
nice
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
better
than
some
of
the
tommyknocker
offerings
ie
maple
brown
ale
clean
and
clear
decent
flavor
wouldnt
reccommend
but
wouldnt
turn
down
a
cold
one
if
it
was
offered
bought
it
in
a
sampler
pack
to
compare
price
was
reasonable
i
read
some
prior
reviews
on
this
lager
before
typing
this
and
i
must
say
i
am
very
surprised
by
what
i
found
i
think
those
that
didnt
like
this
particular
offering
had
way
too
high
of
expectations
this
beer
doesnt
wow
you
its
not
meant
to
it
is
just
a
quality
easy
drinking
beer
thats
what
makes
it
great
poured
into
a
glass
the
color
was
mostly
golden
with
a
hint
of
something
a
little
darker
a
one
finger
head
was
apparent
for
a
short
time
quickly
becoming
lacing
which
stuck
around
as
i
polished
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
malt
was
very
prevalent
very
little
hoppy
smell
here
i
can
see
where
other
reviewers
get
the
grassy
smell
from
upon
my
first
sip
there
was
some
carbonation
that
was
evident
the
taste
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
finished
clean
and
didnt
hang
on
the
tongue
long
left
you
wanting
another
sip
it
has
a
medium
bodied
mouth
full
nothing
to
heavy
but
not
a
coors
lightbud
light
feel
to
it
either
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
have
while
watching
the
game
or
sitting
on
your
deck
i
think
i
will
go
have
another
chalk
up
another
fine
offering
from
tommyknocker
the
pour
into
my
pokal
raises
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
falls
to
surface
lacing
the
beers
body
is
a
hazy
gold
with
very
slight
amber
highlights
and
it
has
a
lot
of
suspended
particles
the
nose
has
a
nice
soft
bready
character
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
simple
but
welldone
the
taste
has
a
very
clean
lager
taste
that
is
just
amazing
its
very
clean
and
tastes
like
a
perfect
allmalt
for
what
this
is
its
great
theres
no
noticeable
hop
character
but
it
works
for
this
beer
im
sure
its
there
preventing
it
from
getting
too
sweet
the
mouth
is
surprisingly
thick
with
very
fine
carbonation
an
excellent
beer
that
i
will
be
buying
for
easy
drinking
nights
in
the
future
pours
light
yellow
with
a
small
head
that
disappeared
immediately
smells
about
like
any
other
lager
grassy
smell
tastes
weak
very
watery
leaves
very
little
aftertaste
no
bitterness
no
hoppiness

the

not
a
bad
offering
from
tommy
knocker
just
dont
overanticipate
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
one
or
two
finger
white
head
depending
on
your
pour
with
a
good
lacing
to
the
finish
slightly
fruity
smell
maybe
blueberry
it
has
a
distinct
taste
which
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
mouthfeel
light
with
good
carbonation
its
my
first
time
for
this
style
but
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
to
better
judge
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
bought
the
motherlode
mix
12
pack
and
pulled
the
first
one
out
of
the
box
to
try
this
was
it
the
color
was
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
a
decent
pale
head
on
top
no
particular
smell
except
a
clean
slight
malt
at
the
first
taste
i
thought
it
would
be
rather
thin
and
boringa
bit
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
but
a
few
swallows
into
the
glass
i
realized
that
there
was
a
very
pleasant
fruity
hops
flavor
in
the
back
that
really
put
a
nice
zip
into
the
beer
not
overwhelming
just
enough
to
really
make
a
refreshing
taste
i
admit
i
liked
it
it
would
be
an
excellent
party
or
session
beer
and
would
be
great
for
a
summer
bbq
definitely
much
better
than
your
typical
allmalt
american
lager
actually
something
id
buy
to
have
around
pours
a
five
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
piney
nose
starts
sour
and
yeasty
never
tasted
a
lager
like
this
hints
of
sweeter
lemonade
but
finish
is
piney
1
49
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
chalet
party
goshen
in
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
grassy
malt
with
a
fruity
yeast
smell
that
smells
similar
to
a
toned
down
witbier
there
is
not
much
at
all
going
on
in
the
taste
department
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
a
slight
amount
of
hops
and
really
nothing
much
else
overall
this
is
a
really
clean
and
easy
to
drink
brew
but
is
lacking
character
to
make
this
a
regular
in
the
rotation
if
this
beer
is
characteristic
of
the
style
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
many
of
these
theres
just
nothing
of
interest
for
me
here
drinkability
a
great
summer
session
pick
the
flavor
is
foodfriendly
the
abv
is
reasonable
and
it
doesnt
fill
the
belly
good
beer
this
a
nice
twist
on
a
usually
bland
style
overall
not
bad
at
all
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
this
one
this
reminds
me
very
much
like
a
blue
moon
it
has
a
honey
cloudy
appearance
w
a
small
head
that
fades
but
laces
the
glass
throughout
the
entire
pint
the
smell
is
a
lot
like
blue
moon
as
well
very
subtle
sweetness
w
a
wheaty
smell
it
tastes
just
like
it
smells
wheaty
and
slightly
sweet
hoppy
aftertaste
not
a
great
beer
but
its
ok
da
good
lager
easy
to
drink
and
session
i
think
4
poured
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
moderate
white
puffy
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
but
virtually
nonexistent
taste
is
very
average
with
nothing
that
really
stands
out
either
bad
or
good
finishes
very
refreshing
but
so
do
lots
of
other
beers
a
very
average
beer
the
drinkability
is
ok
you
could
easily
put
down
several
but
why
with
all
the
great
beer
out
there
i
wont
but
this
one
by
its
self
mk
good
for
the
style
and
clearly
a
step
up
from
the
macro
lager
category
it
is
ok
in
the
mixed
12
pack
but
i
cant
see
running
out
to
buy
this
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
my
glass
on
a
hot
summer
day
either
overall
better
than
the
typical
american
lager
but
still
nothing
to
get
excited
about
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
4
offwhite
head
above
the
cloudy
light
golden
amber
brew
head
fades
slowly
leaving
almost
solid
lace
as
it
recedes
aroma
is
minimal
and
nondescript
taste
is
light
malts
upfront
with
a
slight
hops
bitterness
for
balance
really
neutral
overall
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
of
ok
but
why
bother
genre
not
something
i
would
look
for
again
disappointed
with
this
one
a
medoicre
offering
better
than
a
macro
nothing
to
seek
out
d
eh
up
to
about
a
second
after
the
beer
hits
your
tongue
it
has
some
serious
promise
oh
well
they
cant
all
be
perfect
i
suppose
some
people
like
that
grain
taste
but
i
dont
the
taste
i
found
was
heavy
on
mineral
water
but
also
there
where
traces
of
citrus
that
were
well
balanced
by
the
hops
it
was
not
too
bitter
and
retains
sort
of
a
crisp
taste
it
also
has
a
crisp
feel
even
though
it
is
rather
light
on
the
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
makes
a
decent
though
no
perfect
summer
session
beer
all
of
you
abmacro
lager
drinkers
this
would
be
an
appropriate
first
step
to
further
your
tastes
this
is
one
of
those
times
when
ive
chosen
to
judge
a
beer
more
in
relation
to
its
style
peers
than
in
a
vacuum
agl
is
one
of
the
best
allmalts
that
i
can
remember
drinking
and
for
that
it
deserves
praise
no
need
to
pull
this
one
out
of
an
ice
bath
youll
want
your
palate
in
full
working
order
to
appreciate
what
alpine
glacier
lager
has
to
offer
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
watery
the
beer
is
very
bland
in
smell
and
taste
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
the
beer
is
very
bland
and
inoffensive
although
not
outstanding
this
is
a
worthy
effort
in
a
style
that
is
generally
pretty
indistinct
firm
malt
base
without
significant
grainyness
some
citric
acidity
without
accompanying
citrus
fruit
flavor
adequate
but
a
bit
bland
hops
this
beer
calls
to
mind
both
canadian
and
bohemian
lagers
with
some
characteristics
of
each
grew
a
little
too
tart
toward
the
end
but
overall
an
acceptable
beer
last
swigs
tommyknocker
tries
to
make
an
inoffensive
beer
that
lacks
flavor
this
beer
is
a
light
golden
coloer
it
is
fairly
clear
with
a
good
amount
of
floaters
there
was
a
thick
head
the
smell
is
grainy
and
and
a
bit
of
fresh
cut
grass
the
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
with
wheat
characteristics
up
front
the
mouthfeel
is
firly
light
with
some
lingering
bitterness
this
would
be
a
very
drinkable
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
style
this
would
be
a
great
summer
time
lager
if
it
wasnt
for
that
aftertaste
light
gold
and
slightly
translucent
arctic
white
head
of
almost
12
an
inch
on
a
decently
hard
pour
thick
clingy
laces
on
the
pint
glass
simple
aroma
sweet
and
honeyish
in
impression
light
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
pretty
seemless
combination
of
simple
malt
and
a
good
hop
sense
to
start
of
slightly
medicinal
but
fairly
wellintegrated
and
with
a
bit
of
oiled
and
conditioned
leather
there
is
a
slight
lean
toward
a
watery
fade
at
the
end
but
the
finishing
crispness
helps
to
do
an
adequate
job
of
pulling
it
back
and
lending
an
ok
close
drinkable
and
attractive
fairly
ordinary
and
could
perhaps
use
more
of
a
signature
hop
sense
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
and
grainy
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
yet
fruity
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
bit
grainy
but
its
all
malt
and
easy
drinking
well
its
beer
thats
about
it
certainly
prefered
over
many
other
american
lagers
but
i
do
expect
more
from
dependable
microbreweries
it
has
a
solid
malt
base
that
shows
weakness
in
flavor
aroma
and
mouthfeel
lack
of
decernable
character
allows
the
grain
flavor
and
husk
bite
to
dominate
a
little
too
watery
into
the
finish
light
noble
hop
spiciness
helps
out
a
little
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
12
oz
with
an
overdue
freshness
date
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
4
finger
head
that
peeks
above
the
glass
and
is
rocky
when
it
starts
to
recede
kinda
looks
like
a
hefe
good
so
far
the
aroma
is
viney
with
grape
juice
which
im
sure
is
from
the
age
the
taste
is
sourgrapeyvinegary
down
the
drain
second
bad
beer
from
the
mixed
12
ive
got
hopes
for
the
dopple
because
of
the
abv
and
the
pale
because
of
the
hops
i
guess
well
see
drinkability
good
crisp
clean
lager
that
is
nothing
special
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
minimal
head
nose
is
malty
and
hoppy
expected
for
an
allmalt
lager
taste
is
heavy
with
malt
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
slight
hop
bite
body
was
heavier
than
i
would
have
expected
from
appearance
and
its
name
a
solid
step
up
from
a
macro
lager
but
i
would
probably
reach
for
any
of
the
other
tommys
in
the
sampler
before
this
one
still
a
solid
beer
that
is
sessionable
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
lightly
cloucy
gold
color
with
minimal
head
just
a
little
foam
smell
is
straight
clean
malt
crisp
and
slightly
grassy
nice
maltiness
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
fruity
for
the
style
kind
of
whitish
not
the
best
lager
ever
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
and
watery
needs
more
body
ok
but
there
are
better
for
cheaper
eh
a
good
enough
brew
but
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
i
have
a
few
other
tommyknockers
in
the
fridge
and
im
hoping
for
improvement
im
on
a
quest
to
taste
as
many
nonmacro
pale
lagers
as
possible
this
one
is
pretty
high
on
the
list
so
far
not
bad
but
not
much
going
on
here
either
nice
hazy
amber
orange
pour
with
dense
white
head
small
aroma
of
malt
and
citrus
taste
was
a
grainy
orange
with
a
finishing
lite
hop
bite
mouth
was
unfortunately
to
tangy
and
carbonated

little
thin
also
so
maybe
a
good
summer
brew
step
above
the
macro
crap
but
better
ones
are
out
there
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
in
the
stable
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
a
decent
palate
cleanser
after
a
couple
of
belgian
ales
but
this
is
a
rather
undistinguished
american
microbrewed
lager
hazy
pale
goldenyellow
has
a
small
foamy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
light
grainy
and
grassy
aromas
starts
with
a
light
bready
and
grainy
flavor
finishes
clean
and
smooth
light
and
watery
mouthfeel
not
much
going
on
here
but
alright
for
the
style
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dies
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
grassy
hop
character
with
very
little
malt
a
little
bit
skunky
the
flavor
is
really
thin
and
watery
slight
malt
sweetness
but
not
much
also
a
small
hop
presence
not
too
enjoyable
the
beer
pours
a
light
straw
color
just
a
little
on
the
light
side
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
head
with
just
a
trace
of
a
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
malty
not
at
all
what
i
expect
from
a
lager
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
but
the
flavor
is
very
watered
down
a
disapointment
to
say
the
least
the
beer
is
light
to
moderate
in
my
mouth
but
nothing
to
sing
about
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
but
that
is
due
to
its
lack
of
flavor
and
resemblance
to
water
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
but
if
someone
gives
you
one
then
drink
it
a
free
beer
is
a
free
beer
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
lager
no
strong
flavor
but
no
off
or
adjunct
flavor
either
the
beer
was
refreshing
but
so
is
water
im
sorry
i
tried
to
find
something
good
about
this
beer
but
i
just
couldnt
i
hope
i
just
caught
a
bad
bottle
or
a
bad
batch
the
alpine
glacier
lager
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
it
had
lots
of
lively
carbonation
with
a
suprisingly
decent
creamy
white
head
with
good
retention
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
whole
way
down
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
hops
pretty
disappointing
taste
way
too
bland
and
not
much
too
it
as
it
warmed
a
little
more
flavor
came
out
a
sweet
malt
taste
with
a
little
citrus
and
a
kind
of
skunky
aftertaste
it
was
pretty
smooth
going
down
and
better
than
a
macro
but
thats
about
all
i
can
say
good
about
it
pours
pale
golden
in
color
had
to
pour
straight
into
the
glass
to
get
any
head
at
all
trace
hops
in
the
aroma
not
much
else
i
honestly
cant
taste
anything
in
this
beer
my
tongue
feels
the
cold
carbonated
liquid
but
my
tastebuds
arent
telling
me
much
i
bought
it
because
i
liked
the
label
but
thats
about
it
this
lager
scales
new
heights
in
blandness
pours
a
pale
and
lightly
fizzy
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
barely
detectable
hops
rather
thin
bodied
and
clean
with
a
weak
hops
flavor
finish
is
crisp
id
take
this
over
a
macro
lager
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
thats
about
it
this
brew
poured
a
very
small
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
that
quickly
disappeared
and
a
straw
yellow
weak
looking
typical
lager
body
its
aroma
was
that
of
a
mild
malt
variety
its
ratgher
weak
hop
flavor
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
lack
of
character
brings
this
ones
ratings
down
this
lager
poured
a
small
white
quick
diminishing
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
is
cloudy
with
carbonation
and
the
hue
is
pale
yellow
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
there
was
fair
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
has
a
sweet
hoppy
taste
and
it
is
thin
and
watery
in
my
opinion
there
is
nothing
very
special
that
i
have
to
say
about
this
brew
as
it
lacks
character
color
is
a
medium
golden
yellow
has
some
chill
haze
poured
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
a
light
malt
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
apple
taste
is
very
clean
and
crisp
it
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
hoppy
average
carbonation
a
non
offensive
aftertaste
not
a
great
brew
but
still
decent
and
drinkable
if
the
macros
were
more
like
this
i
would
buy
them
much
more
often
which
now
is
never
this
one
would
be
great
an
a
hot
summers
night
at
the
ball
game
pours
a
clear
medium
golden
color
topped
by
a
crisp
white
head
aroma
is
very
malty
and
clean
very
inviting
it
begs
to
be
tasted
the
first
sip
is
clean
and
maltdriven
with
a
slight
sweetness
as
well
very
little
bitterness
but
a
clean
finish
a
subtle
fruitiness
becomes
apparent
as
you
quaff
the
mouthfeel
is
full
for
a
lager
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
nothing
really
outstanding
but
a
very
good
beer
this
would
be
a
great
conversion
beer
and
if
macros
tasted
like
this
id
always
have
some
around
the
house
a
decent
session
beer
that
seems
like
a
lagerale
hybrid
the
smell
is
a
slightly
nutty
lagerfunk
the
front
is
sweetish
the
middle
is
lagery
somewhat
buttery
and
fairly
full
the
finish
is
crisp
bitter
slightly
watery
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
pours
a
very
pale
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
looks
a
lot
like
a
hard
cider
nose
is
light
sweet
malts
and
grains
and
is
a
bit
herbal
taste
up
front
is
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
honey
followed
by
some
citrus
notes
good
balance
of
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
light
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nice
step
up
from
the
macros
pours
a
slightly
hazed
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
mild
as
most
lagers
are
but
also
has
hints
of
hops
that
got
me
anxious
this
lager
has
some
character
mild
yet
lightly
hopped
and
i
can
taste
no
adjuncts
a
good
brew
to
bring
someone
away
from
the
typical
macros
it
has
a
light
earthy
and
grainy
taste
along
with
the
hops
and
finishes
crisp
and
clean
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
and
drinks
down
easy
my
review
numbers
are
based
on
this
style
and
although
its
not
my
favorite
style
it
is
a
good
interpretation
of
a
lager
a
very
pleasant
surprise
cheers
this
beer
is
a
very
pale
light
golden
with
slight
haze
and
no
head
clean
malt
aroma
with
subtle
notes
of
grain
the
taste
is
a
notch
up
from
your
typical
marco
lager
but
not
that
much
better
some
grain
notes
are
present
fairly
smooth
maltiness
minimal
amounts
of
hop
contributions
it
goes
down
rather
easily
almost
like
water
but
with
more
taste
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
one
ill
purchase
again
anytime
soon
straw
colored
but
cloudy
nose
actually
has
a
bit
of
a
spicy
hop
note
to
it
taste
is
corny
sweet
almost
tastes
like
a
honey
beer
body
is
about
right
for
this
style
pretty
decent
for
a
basic
lager
id
drink
it
again
this
lager
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
white
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
the
light
flavor
possesses
a
hint
of
malt
on
top
of
a
sharp
body
with
a
very
clean
finish
light
all
around
but
quite
refreshing
this
beers
color
is
unlike
any
i
have
ever
seen
a
murky
light
brown
color
resembling
pear
juice
lots
of
fine
bubbles
with
a
small
offwhite
head
decent
lace
aroma
consists
of
herbal
and
botanical
aromas
flavor
begins
with
mild
maltiness
which
is
soon
overwhelmed
by
bitter
citrus
hop
flavors
finish
is
clean
and
a
bit
dry
an
odd
beer
all
in
all
perhaps
its
a
bit
old
as
the
date
stamp
is
03122002
nothing
on
their
web
site
about
this
beer
clear
golden
color
pours
a
thin
head
that
barely
sticks
all
the
way
down
has
a
medium
body
and
a
slightly
grainy
aroma
well
nothing
special
but
its
solid
and
smooth
and
has
some
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
its
very
good
and
easily
ranks
at
or
above
the
budmgdhighlifecoorsmichelobpbrbuscholdmil
conundrum
my
sixer
was
bought
on
special
because
it
wasnt
fresh
but
was
still
pretty
good
kenzinger
a
nice
beer
when
your
having
more
than
10
phila
brewing
co
has
a
wide
variety
of
beer
and
if
you
stop
in
make
your
own
case
for
only
27
from
unfiltered
walt
wit
to
newbold
ipa
to
kenzinger
lager
something
for
all
a
very
average
beer
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
i
cannot
find
this
anywhere
outside
of
the
city
limits
of
philadelphia
and
thus
get
at
least
one
when
in
the
city
this
is
a
great
everday
drinking
beer
it
is
very
crisp
refreshing
full
bodied
and
hoppy
i
really
call
this
my
perfect
go
to
beer
i
can
bring
a
case
of
this
anywhere
and
it
seems
to
please
all
beer
drinkers
alike
it
is
always
bright
and
fresh
and
beats
drinking
cheap
domestic
brews
from
the
brewing
giants
it
has
a
certain
bite
to
it
that
i
find
to
be
delicious
i
will
always
back
this
beer
its
definitely
an
american
take
on
lager
rather
than
a
traditional
one
but
if
you
want
a
light
crisp
hoppy
lager
this
is
a
good
way
to
go
this
is
the
beer
budweiser
should
be
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
good
representation
of
the
stylethe
malts
do
not
taste
like
those
in
a
german
helles
o
this
one
does
not
really
fit
well
into
any
specific
style
but
it
is
an
interesting
beer
to
try
i
did
not
love
it
but
i
didnt
hate
it
either
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
but
not
super
interesting
pale
yellow
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
bready
biscuity
aromas
with
light
floral
hop
and
earthy
grassy
notes
at
the
end
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbination
flavor
is
similar
with
bready
biscuity
malt
up
front
with
floral
hop
flavor
through
the
middle
to
the
end
finishes
clean
and
crisp
with
a
tangy
floral
hop
bite
followed
by
a
bready
maltiness
an
easy
but
not
too
ordinary
drink
one
can
easily
enjoy
more
than
one
of
those
on
a
warm
summer
evening
good
job
by
phila
brewing
co
but
maybe
some
fine
tuning
in
what
its
being
marketed
as
like
i
said
this
is
what
i
give
to
people
looking
to
try
something
new
with
only
experience
in
millercoorsbudkeystonewhatever
or
yuengling
lager
it
does
its
job
plus
it
keeps
me
satisfied
on
the
cheap
in
quite
a
few
bars
o
good
bitter
beer
also
decently
affordable
before
this
i
wasnt
familiar
with
the
boys
at
the
philadelphia
brewing
company
after
this
i
think
ill
get
friendly
with
some
of
their
other
brews
its
a
nice
balance
of
bitter
and
savory
enough
to
interest
a
seasoned
beer
drinker
drinkable
enough
not
to
drive
away
an
amateur
o
overall
a
decent
better
though
the
nose
has
nothing
going
on
the
taste
is
nice
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
worth
checking
out
once
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
kolsch
light
body
taste
starts
out
slightly
grass
citrus
hop
bitterness
then
turns
sort
of
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
tart
finish
overall
a
good
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
an
interesting
kolsch
though
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
pilsner
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
white
head
on
it
that
didnt
leave
much
lacing
bit
of
a
hoppy
nose
to
it
slight
citrus
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
pretty
decent
a
bit
of
malts
some
bitterness
and
a
fairly
clean
crisp
taste
very
nice
on
a
hot
day
worth
haveing
again
quite
a
staple
beer
here
in
philly
the
last
5
years
pours
a
clear
gold
with
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
noble
hops
mostly
a
delicate
floral
some
sweet
tasting
malt
character
tastes
light
refreshing
with
a
nice
crisp
hop
bite
a
tad
too
sweet
to
be
an
excellently
rounded
beer
but
the
eveness
is
mostly
there
a
great
session
beer
clocking
in
at
only
4
5
abv
surprised
to
see
this
classified
as
a
kolsch
always
figured
it
was
a
hoppy
pale
ale
overall
a
solid
contender
in
the
the
everyday
beer
category
a
good
drinkin
beer
as
stated
above
its
too
bitter
for
the
style
but
i
like
it
actually
its
probably
my
favorite
kolsch
ever
d
this
was
a
fine
example
of
an
ipa
it
is
surely
not
a
kolsch
pilsner
or
even
a
lager
not
what
i
was
wanting
or
expecting
i
didnt
love
this
one
when
i
thought
that
it
was
some
sort
of
overhopped
pilsner
when
i
learned
that
a
kolsch
sort
of
over0hopped
pilsner
it
is
fair
to
say
i
might
have
liked
it
a
little
bit
less
not
a
horrible
beer
but
not
something
that
i
would
really
want
another
glass
of
either
overall
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
the
balance
is
all
wrong
for
the
style
notes
a
micromacro
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
wont
pour
it
down
the
drain
either
a
tasty
inexpensive
blonde
ale
but
not
the
best
that
pbc
has
to
offer
poured
a
clear
goldenyellow
with
a
small
but
lacefriendly
white
head
grains
and
floral
hops
in
the
nose
similar
taste
with
light
floral
hops
lightly
toasted
grains
pale
malts
grass
and
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
light
body
and
easily
drinkable
and
usually
cheap
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
freshly
dried
grains
slight
citrusy
hop
presence
very
light
very
carbonated
semi
dry
on
the
mouth
definitely
a
decent
beer
doesnt
do
anything
groundbreaking
but
doesnt
disappoint
overall
kenzinger
is
one
of
my
favorite
local
beers
its
the
perfect
craft
alternative
to
your
run
of
the
mill
backyard
beer
i
find
myself
wanting
it
as
soon
as
the
weather
in
the
city
of
brotherly
love
turns
warmers
medium
body
higher
carbonation
tingly
and
a
bit
dry
drinkable
and
refreshing
alright
for
a
happy
hour
beer
or
something
during
a
baseball
game
but
nothing
id
go
out
and
buy
often
hv
exceptionally
drinkable
ill
drink
this
a
go
to
brew
any
day
and
all
day
pours
brings
a
goldencolored
transparent
beer
with
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
no
real
visible
carbonation
nose
brings
forward
a
pretty
strong
grainy
presence
along
with
a
slight
amount
of
noble
hops
though
not
enough
of
the
latter
to
really
call
this
a
pilsner
the
flavor
is
mildly
fruit
with
a
bit
of
grain
and
some
mild
noble
hops
fairly
chewy
though
still
a
bit
light
carbonation
is
moderate
though
it
seems
like
it
should
be
a
bit
higher
light
body
drinks
pretty
well
overall
my
guess
is
either
a
kolsch
or
a
munich
helles
going
with
the
former
given
the
fruitiness
and
lack
of
true
bready
flavor
comes
to
me
looking
the
part
with
a
pale
golden
color
thats
a
bit
yellowish
on
the
sides
not
much
of
a
cap
off
of
the
spout
and
once
it
reached
me
there
was
nothing
not
a
very
good
looker
no
cling
scents
include
pale
malt
heavy
some
faint
apple
and
well
thats
it
taste
is
laid
back
if
this
is
a
kolsch
its
not
a
very
good
one
i
remember
thinking
this
was
a
biere
de
garde
but
i
could
be
wrong
pale
malt
without
the
sweet
caramel
and
light
apple
juice
like
tastes
nothing
in
terms
of
hop
flavor
just
a
small
earthiness
feel
is
a
step
above
light
and
not
very
carby
this
just
goes
down
kinda
dead
like
bottles
seem
to
be
a
bit
livlier
this
is
not
a
beer
that
ill
be
getting
alot
i
remember
getting
a
mixed
case
of
fresh
pbc
beer
and
drank
one
of
these
than
gave
the
rest
of
the
five
bottles
to
the
cooler
at
a
party
to
try
to
get
rid
of
them
overall
i
didnt
think
this
was
crisp
enough
to
be
a
traditional
kolsch
but
it
was
still
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
not
worth
seeking
out
but
a
decent
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
d
refreshing
but
the
best
kolsch
but
its
drinkable
a
careful
pour
still
produced
a
large
and
foamy
head
retention
and
lacing
are
top
notch
color
is
pale
yellow
smell
is
different
for
a
kolsch
more
of
a
corn
smell
than
anything
else
taste
is
bitter
and
a
little
dry
some
corn
husk
lemon
zest
and
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
is
fluid
but
there
is
certainly
some
weight
on
the
tongue
doesnt
seem
like
a
traditional
kolsch
and
isnt
really
my
thing
d
ok
for
a
hot
night
but
i
was
disappointed
that
the
waiter
at
an
upscale
restaurant
would
recommend
this
someone
trying
to
convert
from
macros
to
micros
might
find
this
a
step
in
the
right
direction
albeit
a
small
one
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
to
say
it
finishes
as
crisp
as
say
a
gaffel
a
heavier
feel
takes
it
just
beyond
the
realm
of
being
refreshing
as
well
its
still
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
good
job
now
fix
your
other
beers
because
them
prices
be
right
i
got
the
best
mix
of
brews
to
session
with
this
weekend
ranging
from
the
four
brews
from
pba
found
in
the
burgh
right
now
to
some
southampton
keller
pils
and
sierra
nevada
kellerweiss
and
summerfest
in
the
dbf
appears
a
slightly
hazed
golden
hue
in
the
body
with
fine
haziness
suspended
in
the
glass
full
on
thicket
of
bright
white
head
forms
nicely
lacing
is
sporadic
on
my
hop
tulip
pint
glass
from
sierra
nevada
aroma
has
a
slight
metallic
hint
to
it
with
a
nice
mellow
citrus
playful
malt
and
hop
ratio
flavor
has
a
nice
zesty
citric
hop
mix
going
with
some
light
toasted
malts
it
has
a
light
ipa
flavor
going
on
with
the
massive
amounts
of
alpha
acids
from
american
hop
additions
mouthfeel
is
dry
in
the
finish
a
nice
unrelenting
hop
bitterness
in
a
lighter
styled
brew
carbonation
is
sturdy
even
a
bit
much
at
times
overall
feel
is
a
solidly
dry
hoppy
finish
that
brings
the
hop
burps
cooking
drinkability
overall
just
due
to
the
flavors
provided
and
enjoyment
of
the
product
is
very
high
add
the
sessionability
to
your
drinkable
score
and
this
one
rises
substantially

3
of

in

mild
some
hops
taste
is
crisp
well
balanced
malts
and
hops
feels
medium

in
the

has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
d
high
drinkability
typical
of
a
lager
it
fiills
the
mouth
just
fine
but
i
am
going
to
ding
the
drinkability
for
the
overhopping
it
really
does
detractexcessive
hops
that
is
d
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
a
thick
and
dense

lots

t
quite

extremely

without

it
is
hard
to
know
whether
this
beers
flavor
profile
is
being
accurately
reflected
or
if
this
particular
bottle
is
old
but
after
reading
a
few
other
reviews
the
characteristics
that
i
am
picking
up
seem
consistent
with
other
reviewers
a
little
on
the
dry
side
and
with
a
slight
hop
bite

as
far
as
kolshs
go
kenzinger
seems
to
miss
the
mark
the
lemony
flavors
are
somewhat
offputting
it
is
unlikely
i
would
buy
this
particular
beer
again

d
not
the
best
kolsch
ive
ever
had
but
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
d
just
average
not
much
more
to
it
good
to
style
really
enjoy
this
one
pours
a
clear
bright
golden
yellow
fluffy

retention
good
minimal

smell
is
of
freshly
dried

and
a
hint
of
lemony
citrus
taste
is
of
freshly
dried
grains
slight
citrusy
hop
presence
very
light
very
carbonated
semi
dry
decent
light
beer
doesnt
do
anything
wrong
which
makes
it
stand
slightly
above
light
bmc
products
d
a
pretty
solid
kolsch
here
flavors
are
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
i
feel
that
this
beer
with
its
fauxretro
label
is
probably
targeted
at
the
bohohipster
crowd
to
ironically
appreciate
but
that
doesnt
detract
from
enjoying
what
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
d
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
over
and
over
again
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into

shaker

i
loved
this
one
in

clear

doughy

is
very
pleasant
blend
on

wheat

and
an
easy
drinker
it
has
positive
characteristics
of
an
allmalt
lager
pilsener
and
american
wheat
all
in
one
very
enjoyable
and
if
more
kolshs
are
like
this
one
it
might
just
be
my
new
favorite
style
poured
into
a
sierra
nevada
tulip
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
voluminous
pillowy
head
i
think
this
bottle
may
have
been
a
little
shaken
before
i
opened
it
there
appears
to
be
little
spherical
spices
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
coriander
aroma
is
yeasty
crisp
with
some
citrus
and
grass
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
but
with
good
carbonation
despite
the
frothy
explosion
on
the
pour
taste
is
smooth
crisp
citrus
yeast
orange
very
spicy
overall
i
enjoy
this
brew
and
would
try
it
again
overalli
love
a
good
kolsch
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
brew
and
this
hits
the
mark
solidly
nice
job
d
really
simple
yet
delicious
so
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
in
a
session
highly
recommend
this
as
one
of
the
best
kolsch
beers
brewed
in
the
us
d
a
quaffable
ale
no
doubt
about
it
the
low
alcohol
level
is
a
feather
in
its
cap
overall
it
was
ok
though
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
dont
think
i
would
revisit
this
one
again
d
an
easy
session
beer
to
pound
back
a
case
of
this
would
be
good
for
the
dave
show
a
truly
sessionable
beer
gold
with
some
haze
and
a
thin
cap
of
fizzy
white
bubbles
lots
of
spotty
lacing
floral
and
lemon
hops
were
prominent
in
the
aroma
backed
by
some
citrus
sweetness
and
cereal
grains
balanced
flavour
bitterness
was
light
but
stayed
solid
underneath
the
malt
until
the
sweetness
faded
leaving
it
to
linger
in
the
finish
lemon
hops
up
front
a
bit
floral
with
a
hint
of
spice
a
bit
biscuity
and
bready
but
not
overly
so
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
crisp
and
on
the
dry
side
more
powerful
in
character
than
i
expected
this
one
has
a
solid
hop
presence
quite
refreshing
d
you
could
make
an
afternoon
out
of
these
but
if
you
did
so
i
think
youd
be
aiming
for
a
buzz
instead
of
just
enjoyin
the
beer
drinkability
very
high
this
beer
had
grown
on
me
a
lot
the
first
few
timesi
had
it
i
wasnt
impressed
but
it
is
a
great
session
beer
with
some
unique
characteristics
and
flavors
that
come
together
to
make
this
a
tasty
refreshing
beer
i
like
how
this
beer
is
the
session
beer
at
many
bars
in
philly
now
3
kenzingers
at
many
places
if
you
like
session
beers
then
try
this
one
oh
by
the
way
i
dont
think
this
is
much
like
a
kolsch
except
they
may
use
a
kolsch
yeast
as
there
are
some
interesting
and
subtle
flavors
going
on
drink
is
very
good
easy
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
while
ive
had
few
of
this
style
i
am
sure
there
are
better
examples
out
there
gold
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
smells
like
a
macro
taste
is
bready
with
some
citrus
and
malts
i
have
nothing
really
bad
to
say
about
this
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
kind
of
boring
and
run
of
the
mill
with
that
being
said
the
beer
as
whole
was
good
ive
this
several
times
now
as
i
have
purchased
the
variety
pack
a
few
times
its
okay
but
i
wouldnt
pursue
it
drinkability
all
in
all
a
pretty
nice
version
of
the
style
d
complex
fullflavored
and
sessionable
this
ones
a
winner
looks
like
they
worked
some
bugs
out
nice
offering
from
pbc
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
during
the
warm
summer
months
pours
a
clear
golden
yelow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
and
flavor
are
both
quite
bland
with
no
noteworthy
traits
crisp
and
easy
to
swallow
but
nothing
about
the
flavor
stands
out
not
as
hoppy
as
advertised
another
bland
and
boring
offering
from
this
dissapointing
brewery
drinkability
an
odd
beer
and
not
in
a
fun
quirky
way
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
it
not
recommended
from
a
brown
22oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
light
pale
color
with
almost
no
head
and
well
below
average
carbonation
smells
of
light
malts
and
a
tad
of
hops
in
the
nose
first
sip
is
sweet
with
a
light
malt
backbone
very
light
bodied
lightly
hopped
but
not
too
light
nicely
carbonated
d
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
am
envious
of
those
who
have
access
to
this
great
tasting
beer
although
not
extreme
it
is
a
great
tasting
beer
that
i
recommend
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
the
beer
is
the
color
of
honey
a
1
foamy
white
head
formed
nice
lacing
was
left
as
the
head
subsided
very
nice
lacing
was
left
down
the
entire
glass
once
i
was
finished
smells
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
bread
can
taste
some
bitter
hops
and
biscuity
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
crisp
carbonation
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
im
fortunate
to
sample
this
less
than
a
week
after
bottling
im
blown
away
by
this
one
especially
after
the
newbold
complete
opposite
this
one
does
philly
proud
i
wanna
throw
one
in
the
freezer
so
i
can
enjoy
it
in
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
was
surprising
fruity
spicy
and
yeastdefinitely
european
the
aroma
was
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
a
sharp
bite
from
the
hops
attacks
the
palate
followed
by
grainy
malt
character
finishes
with
a
quick
flash
of
bitterness
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
throughout
a
little
different
than
other
kolsh
beers
i
have
had
but
definitely
worth
trying
o
overall
this
is
a
great
light
to
mediumbodied
summer
session
brew
though
i
wish
it
were
a
tad
smoother
im
not
to
familiar
with
the
kölsch
style
but
this
seems
quite
hoppy
and
bitter
which
is
thirstquenching
and
quite
enjoyable
actually
rather
complex
given
the
unassuming
abv
and
lesserknown
style
d
good
marks
as
session
material
a
bright
citrusy
hop
zing
makes
this
a
summer
time
quencher
that
is
case
worthy
d
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
but
there
are
better
kolschstyle
beers
around
that
i
would
go
to
first
perfect
for
the
summertime
a
nice
light
body
with
a
bitter
hop
kick
that
is
just
enough
for
this
time
of
year
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
a
characterful
session
brew
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
style
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
not
my
type
of
beer
but
it
is
a
good
beer
if
you
want
something
that
has
some
extra
power
to
it
t
very
flavorful
and
full
bodied
for
what
to
me
is
an
unassuming
beer
given
style
and
abv
bready
malt
body
up
front
that
has
an
earthy
grainy
body
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
bitter
hop
taste
very
clean
creamy
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
by
no
means
exceptional
even
for
the
style
but
great
to
stick
with
for
a
night
clear
yellow
brew
with
foam
white
head
holds
its
own
crisp
light
malty
aroma
a
very
fresh
homey
flavor
minimal
bitterness
lots
of
crispness
and
good
flavor
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
screams
session
beer
immediately
makes
you
want
to
grab
another
perect
for
summer
perfect
drinkability
this
beer
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
flavorful
yet
easy
on
the
palate
d
very
drinkable
even
with
the
hoppier
flavor
actually
i
kind
of
preferred
this
one
over
most
kolsch
biers
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
that
i
need
to
pick
up
often
now
that
i
enjoy
the
style
and
the
beer
itself
one
fine
beer
and
thanks
again
pbc
philadelphia
brewing
companys
kenzinger
is
a
decent
beer
for
what
its
worth
but
doesnt
really
stand
up
next
to
other
pale
ales
that
are
out
there
seems
a
bit
grainy
so
much
so
that
i
almost
felt
like
i
could
taste
more
malt
than
hops
which
for
me
defeats
the
point
of
it
being
a
pale
ale
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
to
balance
things
out
color
and
aroma
are
good
and
overall
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
wouldnt
over
the
choice
of
a
better
pale
ale
if
available
the
is
as
described
on
the
website
a
real
drinkin
beer
rich
golden
color
frothy
head
bright
scent
slightly
spicey
in
the
nose
taste
is
slighty
hoppy
with
a
nice
yeast
finishvery
nice
balance
light
in
the
mouth
very
easy
to
drink
a
true
session
brew
its
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
without
even
begining
to
feel
full
from
it
a
perfect
year
round
brew
great
for
bbq
in
the
summer
or
watching
football
when
its
cold
outsidea
good
brew
to
get
your
buddies
away
from
that
other
stuff
they
keep
around
if
you
know
what
i
mean
overall
quite
tasty
and
a
surpise
to
me
cause
i
didnt
know
what
style
this
was
until
i
started
to
drink
and
review
it
a
really
good
bbq
beer
the
body
was
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
was
great
for
many
this
will
be
a
great
beer
for
me
i
just
didnt
connect
with
it
my
hopes
sank
faster
than
tbios
stock
drinkability
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
session
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
almost
citric
and
sweet
toned
flavor
is
interesting
definitely
some
complexity
there
citrus
and
a
minor
dough
mild
bitter
tone
bitter
citrus
cuts
in
on
the
back
side
feel
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
the
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
good
too
this
is
actually
pretty
tasty
i
will
admit
that
when
i
see
the
word
kölsch
i
am
prepared
for
a
much
milder
flavor
experience
shall
we
say
this
exceeded
that
and
was
pretty
tasty
well
worth
trying
a
good
intro
to
the
pbc
i
bet
this
would
be
nice
on
cask
dthis
is
a
quality
all
malt
sessionable
beer
drinkers
beer
i
would
happily
have
this
on
hand
as
my
bud
this
beer
along
with
the
newly
revived
reading
premium
shows
that
you
can
make
a
beer
that
has
flavour
low
abv
and
made
to
please
even
beer
geeks
such
as
myself
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
color
good
carbonation
i
also
thought
this
felt
similar
to
an
american
pale
ale
strong
citrus
hints
and
floral
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
mainly
citrusygrapfruit
biscuit
grassy
flavor
this
was
a
very
stable
and
balanced
brew
and
for
a
great
price
another
good
one
from
pbc
i
really
like
the
row
house
red
the
kenzinger
is
not
far
behind
d
nothing
great
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
a
good
session
beer
thats
worth
a
try
looking
forward
to
this
brewerys
other
beers
and
this
is
a
good
start
maybe
the
flavor
could
work
a
little
harder
in
catching
up
to
the
aroma
but
the
end
result
is
a
fine
first
sampling
from
a
newly
labeled
local
brewery
the
subdued
flavor
actually
helps
in
making
this
one
seriously
sessionable
beer
i
can
think
of
very
few
times
when
i
wouldnt
be
fine
with
one
of
these
in
my
hand
ill
have
to
make
sure
it
happens
again

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
grains
and
malts
you
pick
up
a
hit
of
hops
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
now
for
the
taste
it
is
sweet
with
grains
and
malts
not
bad
but
not
great
yuengling

has
a
nice

there

in
this

the
mouthfeel
of

is
niceclean
and
smooth
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this

i
like
how

this
brew
is
a
nice
drinking
brew
nothing
fancy
but
nothing
cheap
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
thank
you
yuengling
brewery
looks
like
the
average
american
adjunct
smell
is
of
yeast
taste
is
of
corn
and
yeast
i
did
not
like
this
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
goo
beer
for
the
particular
style
that
is
to
say
that
it
is
a
good
easy
drinking
session
beer
if
at
a
party
drinking
many
beers
with
many
wings
i
think
it
is
a
good
choice
pleasant
taste
and
aroma
looks
light
in
color
and
has
a
clean
smooth
taste
to
match
poured
with
a
decent
head
but
it
did
not
last
long
very
mild
hop
aroma
some
say
it
has
a
corn
flavor
i
cannot
say
i
detect
that
but
it
is
certainly
light
in
flavor
if
i
were
going
to
drink
one
beer
each
night
i
would
pick
something
more
full
bodied
but
as
a
party
brew
this
is
pretty
good
overall
3
37
its
a
competent
lager
with
some
traditional
bmc
characteristics
its
got
some
nice
bready
hop
and
banana
that
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
and
actually
reminds
me
a
little
of
natural
ice
im
not
secretly
aching
inside
wishing
they
sold
it
here
in
my
part
of
the
country
but
id
try
it
again
if
offered
it
is
a
capable
and
tasty
adjunct
lager
overall
again
at
5
00
a
6
pack
you
cant
go
wrong
in
my
opinion
puts
miller
bud
and
coors
all
to
shame
and
saves
you
money
in
the
process
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
translucent
straw
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
sweet
cereal
grain
a
tad
bit
of
corn
very
sweet
tastes
of
cereal
grain
but
much
more
flavorful
than
most
adjuncts
beer
is
light
bodied
easy
drinking
good
carbonation
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
o
not
bad
the
fruityish
bubblegumcitrus
peel
elements
could
be
toned
down
a
touch
but
theyre
not
all
that
offputting
actually
the
level
of
dryness
balances
that
out
nicely
would
prefer
to
have
more
of
a
grainy

im
no
connoisseur
but
i
enjoy
fancy
beers
having
said
that
this
is
my
goto
beer
when
all
i
can
reach
is
the
local
gas
station
before
kickoff
gotta
love
the
oldest
brew
in
the
states
great
for
saturday
afternoons
watching
football
kinda
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
metallic
hops
on
the
nose
maybe
a
hint
of
cooked
corn
and
dirty
dishwater
as
it
warms
flavor
is
right
there
too
sweet
malt
metallic
hops
and
cooked
corn
moderately
low
carbonation
lends
a
pleasant
creamy
mouthfeel
somewhat
lengthy
mouthcoating
impression
keeps
it
from
being
a
clean
finish
even
though
its
mostly
flavorless
i
like
this
beer
regardless
of
what
others
say
this
beer
taste
better
than
coors
and
budweiser
beers
the
beer
is
used
to
drink
as
my
regular
beer
and
i
still
but
six
pack
now
again
a
good
drinking
beer
when
you
dont
want
a
lager
or
a
ale
and
just
want
a
plain
good
beer
to
drink
big
time
disappointment
yuengling
makes
it
a
point
to
call
this
premium
beer
but
its
average
at
best
and
thats
basing
average
on
the
budmillercoors
standard
crap
good
cheap
beer
that
taste
good
will
drink
again
overall
not
an
awful
beer
certainly
more
flavorful
and
tasty
than
bud
coors
etc
but
i
still
would
venture
to
believe
that
better
choices
can
be
made
wherever
this
is
available
poured
very
pale
yellow
straw
color
with
a
white
suddsy
head
clear
with
obvious
carbonation
showing
not
very
aromatic
hints
of
malt
maybe
corn
and
grass
beer
also
smells
like
its
starting
to
skunk
taste
is
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
just
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
thin
mouthfeel
slightly
dry
but
very
drinkable
an
easy
pick
over
other
the
macroaals
out
there
since
it
actually
has
some
flavor
and
some
aroma
the
body
was
the
typical
thin
and
crisp
expected
from
the
style
drinkabilty
was
ok
the
beer
went
quickly
and
with
much
effort
overall
an
ok
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
you
probably
know
what
youre
getting
when
you
buy
the
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
as
most
light
lagers
can
be
but
clean
with
a
body
actually
veering
toward
medium
overall
typical
aal
profile
although
a
bit
subpar
fans
of
bmc
would
enjoy
this
but
id
recommend
yuengling
traditional
any
day
overall
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
moderate
level
of
flavor
a
very
standard
american
lager
this
is
a
very
sessionable
lager
in
drinkability
its
not
unlike
the
traditional
lager
but
in
flavor
its
rather
weak
and
disappointing
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
well
balanced
beer
a
great
lager
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
seen
this
for
the
first
time
last
week
and
i
cant
find
it
anymore
im
very
familiar
with
the
traditional
lager
but
this
poured
a
little
lighter
in
color
but
seemed
to
have
more
flavor
a
sweeter
aroma
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
and
for
4
29
for
4
pint
cans
its
a
good
deal
o
thanks
for
the
history
yuengling
overall
it
is
an
alright
beer
that
it
good
at
social
occasions
the
flavor
is
dry
and
grainy
with
a
corny
slightly
sugary
taste
w
a
hint
of
toast
the
taste
is
slick
like
canned
corn
with
the
malt
light
the
overall
flavor
is
clean
expect
for
the
dms
which
is
distracting
although
the
crisp
finish
is
like
eating
a
corn
pop
it
leaves
little
in
the
way
of
taste
after
the
swallow
just
comes
and
goes
like
a
pop
song
overall
i
dont
fault
this
it
is
not
terrible
just
not
impressive
and
a
lackluster
flavor
in
general
i
think
it
might
appeal
to
those
who
may
like
other
mass
produced
lagers
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
actually
prefer
from
a
can
that
and
the
fact
that
we
could
get
a
case
of
pounders
in
college
for
about
15
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
premium
offering
from
americas
oldest
brewery
if
all
you
want
to
do
is
get
hammered
with
a
couple
buddies
you
could
do
worse
than
this
beer
but
not
much
overall
basic
pilsner
has
all
the
elements
one
would
expect
for
a
premium
poured
into
a
red
solo
cup
muahaha
a
pale
strawyellow
color
fizzy
with
a
finger
or
two
of
bubbly
white
head
that
receded
quite
a
bit
rather
quickly
aroma
of
boring
grains
light
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
citrus
zest
the
taste
followed
the
smell
pretty
closely
with
grains
pale
malts
light
floral
hops
all
a
bit
metallic
but
not
entirely
unbearable
light
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
particularly
if
nothing
else
is
available
this
beer
sucks
pours
strawgold
and
clear
with
fizzy
white
topping
of
foam
smell
is
grainy
and
macroish
reminds
me
of
pbr
or
genny
red
or
high
life
or
many
many
others
taste
is
simple
grainy
also
with
just
a
faint
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
thin
and
finishes
clean
overall
this
is
similar
to
yuengling
lager
except
for
the
color
and
this
also
lacks
the
distinct
sulphur
character
decent
enough
brew
low
abv
makes
for
easy
drinking
hard
to
find
except
at
some
distributors
straw
yellow
in
color
pleasant
aroma
typical
pale
taste
very
middle
of
the
road
but
also
refreshingly
drinkable
an
excellent
choice
for
hanging
out
with
friends
in
the
bar
it
goes
very
nicely
with
seafood
this
i
tried
at
a
red
lobster
here
on
long
island
eastcoasters
dump
on
this
plenty
but
to
be
honest
this
definitely
outpaces
a
lot
of
mediocre
craft
apls
ive
had
in
my
time
olisted
as
a
pale
lager
no
thats
wrong
this
is
an
adjunct
and
its
terrible
even
for
an
adjunct
its
just
that
bad
the
tastes
themselves
arent
horrible
but
the
overall
lack
of
taste
is
just
upsetting
completely
blah
beer
obviously
not
a
craft
beer
but
i
have
no
serious
complaints
i
am
not
impressed
this
is
a
very
mediocre
beer
it
is
half
way
between
yuegling
light
and
their
lager
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
lager
so
i
thought
i
would
give
this
one
a
chance
i
know
not
to
do
that
again
it
has
a
very
tinny
metallic
flavor
that
i
assume
comes
from
the
can
which
when
i
have
had
the
lager
in
the
can
is
not
present
i
think
this
is
the
biggest
disappointment
from
yuegling
i
have
had
a
pale
golden
lager
with
thin
head
that
goes
away
rather
quickly
smell
is
of
light
malt
and
mild
hops
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
with
a
doughy
breadiness
thinnish
feel
with
fizzy
carbonation
that
has
a
light
crispness
i
have
heard
this
referred
to
a
pennsylvanias
bud
inbev
should
only
be
so
lucky
not
a
bad
beer
and
for
the
style
a
solid
player
with
real
flavor
and
refreshment
o
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
beer
has
a
little
bit
more
flavor
and
substance
than
your
typical
macro
but
over
a
its
really
just
a
mediocre
beer
pod
up
in
lil
cup
at
the
tampa
yuengling
brewery
i
cannot
imagine
what
is
premium
about
this
i
like
yuengling
products
nearly
across
the
board
but
this
is
terrible
it
looks
like
garden
variety
light
fizzy
swill
but
smells
far
worse
than
the
average
adjunct
lager
it
literally
reeks
of
urine
or
goats
take
your
pick
it
tastes
pretty
bad
too
but
just
like
cheap
watery
beer
maybe
a
tad
sweaty
it
is
not
scarybad
like
the
smell
do
not
fall
for
the
label
this
is
vastly
inferior
to
all
other
yuengling
products
o
yinz
know
kinda
fun
to
drink
ps
i
have
no
idea
if
thats
proper
pittsburghese
but
its
fun
to
saythinktype
yinz
im
no
big
fan
of
pale
lagers
but
this
happens
to
be
a
pleasant
and
nicely
drinkable
one
rather
benign
but
light
and
refreshing
and
without
a
completely
watery
disposition

thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
tossin
in
a
surprise
box
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
release
from
yuengling
this
beer
is
very
generic
i
cant
honestly
say
that
there
is
anything
special
in
this
that
would
make
someone
seek
it
out
ive
had
one
bottle
of
this
and
it
was
pretty
much
just
your
typical
run
of
the
mill
brew
yellow
in
color
taste
is
of
some
malts
and
corn
not
much
hops
to
speak
of
overall
its
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
im
a
fan
of
traditional
yuengling
and
i
havent
ever
had
a
bad
beer
from
those
guys
at
pottsville
pa
tastes
like
a
typical
macro
nearly
no
hop
weak
but
grainy
malt
thin
bodied
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
simply
said
a
lawn
mower
beer
d
easy
to
drink
not
complex
simple
honestly
ive
killed
about
three
cases
of
these
in
the
past
half
year
and
every
time
i
buy
one
i
remember
why
i
hadnt
for
a
while
they
give
me
gas
and
make
me
queasy
on
average
its
one
of
the
cheaper
lagers
out
there
but
drop
the
2
extra
and
buy
the
premiums
older
more
sophisticated
brother
the
yuengling
original
d
i
could
drink
a
fair
amount
of
it
but
i
would
probably
chose
not
to
it
isnt
offensive
or
even
bad
just
not
appealing
to
me
id
much
rather
have
the
traditional
lager
from
yuengling
glad
to
try
it
good
value
for
the
price
pours
a
thin
yellow
straw
color
with
a
sickly
thin
white
head
and
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
adjuncts
such
as
corn
rice
and
simple
grain
some
malty
sweetness
in
the
nose
as
well
no
hops
to
be
found
tastes
mostly
the
same
some
sweet
corn
and
malt
and
a
little
biscuit
or
yeast
bread
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
not
too
wonderful
drinkability
is
not
great
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
slight
noble
hops
as
well
as
grain
the
taste
is
grain
and
a
bit
if
bread
some
slight
bitterness
in
a
lift
body
drinks
okay
and
is
much
better
than
high
life
and
the
like
but
not
too
great
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
grains
and
malts
some
sweetness
very
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
quite
sure
what
makes
it
premium
but
this
is
a
good
everyday
lager
nuthin
fancy
but
drinkable
nonetheless
a
fine
beer
overall
for
what
it
is
drinks
easy
nothing
special
here
but
i
could
do
a
few
on
hot
summers
day
like
today
better
than
most
of
its
ilk
a
pleasant
suprise
reigning
champ
of
cheap
beer
this
and
miller
high
life
are
my
budget
go
to
brew
considering
i
am
located
approximate
2
hrs
from
the
brewery
and
my
local
shop
sells
a
ton
of
this
i
get
it
nice
and
fresh
this
is
classic
beer
beer
nothing
fancy
tastes
crisp
and
clean
with
a
touch
of
body
and
grainhops
ice
cold
its
a
great
bbq
or
boating
beer
no
one
will
be
offended
or
not
enjoy
one
out
of
the
ice
box
a
sixer
goes
down
quick
as
the
abv
is
a
mere
4
4
kinda
nice
for
a
long
relaxed
brew
session
in
some
ways
i
prefer
to
the
yuengling
lager
also
at
1112
bucks
a
case
easy
on
the
wallet
d
okay
this
is
a
very
reasonable
aka
super
cheap
1314case
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
nice
and
refreshing
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
yuengling
a
bland
unappealing
lager
with
a
particularly
unpleasant
finish
no
different
from
any
typical
bmc
product
stick
with
the
traditional
lager
if
you
can
this
stuff
is
pretty
bland
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
2
finger
fizzy
head
that
settles
quickly
slightly
hazy
when
held
to
the
light
smell
is
fairly
nuetral
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
coming
through
a
slight
scent
of
something
metallic
taste
is
decent
nothing
crazy
or
unique
but
extremely
clean
classic
american
pale
lager
flavor
mild
light
malt
flavor
with
just
enough
hops
for
balance
no
major
offflavors
here
mouthfeel
is
fluid
and
crisp
this
went
down
quickly
and
i
am
not
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
fan
for
what
it
is
its
done
well
d
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
summertime
beer
i
just
very
recently
drank
a
metric
shit
ton
of
their
trad
lager
down
in
the
fl
keys
and
that
is
nowhere
as
enjoyable
as
this
i
understand
that
this
sells
for
about
12
for
a
24pack
you
cant
beat
that
d
this
is
better
than
bmc
but
i
much
prefer
pbr
if
i
am
forced
to
drink
an
massproduced
american
lager
d
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
over
and
over
again
d
this
beer
is
quite
sessionable
cheers
very
easy
to
throw
back
but
if
youre
gonna
get
yuengling
you
should
just
get
the
traditional
lager
this
is
like
the
pbr
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
of
yuenglings
family
id
rather
just
drink
a
schaefer
yuengling
premium
beer
was
a
much
lighter
color
with
a
decent
head
there
wasnt
much
in
the
way
as
a
smell
and
the
taste
was
okay
there
were
no
strong
flavors
that
stood
out
and
there
really
wasnt
a
srong
hoppy
taste
but
no
yuengling
really
has
this
it
taste
pretty
similar
to
thier
traditional
lager
and
that
included
that
slightly
stale
taste
even
though
its
light
and
has
a
weak
taste
i
really
wouldnt
enjoy
having
more
then
1
or
2
overall
its
a
very
average
beer
better
then
alot
of
other
stuff
you
could
buy
but
you
can
pick
up
yuengling
premium
beer
for
a
pretty
cheap
price
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
lively
white
head
only
fair
retention
and
little
to
not
lacing
evident
aroma
is
comprised
of
chiefly
grassy
and
straw
elements
interestingly
spot
on
actually
this
comes
across
pretty
close
to
a
traditional
pilsner
on
the
nose
it
could
probably
use
a
little
bit
more
malt
to
balance
it
out
the
taste
has
a
pleasant
straw
and
grassy
character
with
good
moderate
bitterness
there
is
a
touch
of
a
plastic
and
grain
to
it
but
the
flavors
are
mostly
hitting
the
mark
here
for
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
and
for
the
price
yes
indeed
again
light
bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
drinks
fairly
well
this
is
a
beer
id
like
to
have
available
for
the
days
when
a
less
expensivecomplex
brew
is
in
need
very
drinkable
md
mouthfeel
is
weak
but
not
surprising
i
would
call
this
very
drinkable
if
you
were
looking
for
a
lawnmower
beer
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
yuengling
yuenglings
offerings
are
among
my
favorites
a
fingerplus
of
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
col
or
was
a
lemony
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
if
nothing
else
it
looked
like
sunshinesummer
in
a
glass
nose
had
a
solid
lager
sweetness
none
of
that
adjunct
b
s
mouthfeel
was
full
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
scrubbing
away
all
of
the
b
s
on
my
tongue
as
i
swirled
it
around
taste
was
light
but
clean
again
this
was
more
like
a
real
lager
than
their
own
lager
it
had
a
refreshingly
mild
sweetness
along
with
a
palatable
flavor
i
think
that
i
was
poisoned
as
a
kid
when
when
i
heard
adults
sneer
about
it
as
coal
country
beer
while
swigging
rolling
rock
what
was
that
steel
country
beer
woulda
been
arn
ya
jagovs
how
would
yinz
have
characterized
rolling
rock
back
inna
day
coal
shmoal
it
is
a
decent
lager
hey
take
this
to
the
beach
in
place
of
tenfidy
and
youll
only
be
thanking
me
i
still
want
to
have
lord
chet
in
a
can
before
i
make
my
final
pronouncement
from
on
high
in
candom
come
finish
was
lager
sweet
but
sans
adjunct
flavors
a
nice
simple
germanstyle
lager
from
pa
i
am
starting
to
doubt
my
own
prejudices
the
feel
is
easy
drinking
just
smooth
enough
to
be
a
pleasure
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitterness
that
comes
through
as
it
goes
down
edit
2
years
later
right
up
there
with
pbr
and
other
slightly
sweet
brews
need
to
buy
the
porter
soon
so
i
can
transform
this
back
into
a
black
and
tan
i
still
prefer
the
60s
formula
schlitz
as
the
goto
macro
all
said
and
done
give
this
a
moment
and
it
will
deliver
a
delicate
kiss
of
hops
after
the
thankfully
dry
sweet
notes
fade
fast
does
this
come
in
a
bottle
i
cant
remember
whatever
it
will
be
great
after
a
2
hour
romp
on
the
singlespeed
29er
or
a
40
minute
cyclocross
race
d
great
session
beer
for
eleven
bucks
a
case
at
my
local
distributor
the
sweetness
in
my
opinion
holds
it
back
slightly
reminds
me
somewhat
of
drinking
a
soda
still
will
have
no
problem
finishing
the
case
very
quickly
drinkability
is
real
good
a
great
lawnmower
beer
solid
yes
i
love
my
victory
lager
brooklyn
lager
and
my
saisons
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
i
still
keep
some
yuengling
premium
in
the
fridge
as
well
old
habits
die
hard
d
i
couldnt
drink
anymore
after
this
one
its
not
bad
but
its
not
good
d
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
due
to
the
fact
that
back
in
the
day
this
is
the
only
thing
me
and
my
budies
would
drink
im
glad
we
got
out
of
that
i
rarley
buy
it
any
more
but
if
its
on
tap
ata
weding
or
someone
has
a
case
at
a
party
i
will
surley
take
it
over
the
miller
or
the
coores
had
a
bottle
at
volpes
in
emmaus
pa
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
this
to
yuengling
lager
theres
a
similar
but
toneddown
malt
sweetness
that
actually
tastes
like
pale
barley
not
corn
still
a
bit
watery
overall
but
the
bar
was
hot
and
this
was
refreshing
worth
a
try
if
youre
curious
about
what
else
yuengling
makes
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
crystal
clear
bright
yellow
color
with
about
half
an
inch
of
quickly
fading
off
white
foam
the
foam
settles
into
a
thin
layer
within
seconds
smells
and
tastes
of
super
bready
grains
crisp
fruitiness
mild
corniness
crisp
and
thin
in
both
body
and
carbonation
itll
do
in
a
pinch
around
here
drinkability
well
i
guess
its
drinkable
based
on
the
other
factors
as
in
you
could
pound
a
few
of
these
without
any
trouble
but
i
personally
wouldnt
do
that
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
orangy
amber
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
aroma
is
malty
slightly
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
flavor
is
satisfying
if
not
complex
malty
with
an
undertone
of
apple
sweet
hints
and
a
touch
of
hops
texture
is
smooth
and
nicely
tingly
not
great
but
ok
o
premium
is
a
great
summer
beer
drink
it
when
cutting
the
grass
or
working
on
the
car
to
quench
your
thirst
one
of
my
favorite
macros
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
and
pours
a
slightly
darker
than
usual
color
aroma
is
a
little
metallic
but
very
subtle
the
best
quality
in
this
beer
is
its
taste
is
more
complex
than
your
average
macro
the
downside
to
this
often
overlooked
brew
is
that
it
is
only
served
in
an
odd
number
of
states
ohio
is
not
one
of
them
so
we
sometimes
have
to
cruise
over
the
border
to
sharon
pa
to
get
our
hands
on
some
of
it
d
pretty
average
drinking
not
bad
given
the
style
but
pay
the
extra
dimes
and
get
the
traditional
lager
d
drinkability
pretty
much
mirrors
mouthful
premium
drinkability
is
very
high
very
light
beer
goes
down
great
easy
tailgate
beer
notes
it
could
have
been
a
lot
worsebut
i
tried
this
because
a
few
friends
told
me
they
were
really
feeling
this
beer
and
i
said
i
would
give
it
a
chance
if
i
were
at
some
stadium
and
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
a
bud
its
a
bud
all
the
way
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
choices
for
a
macro
lager
has
something
special
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
makes
it
stand
out
to
me
from
other
macros
while
there
are
definitely
some
hints
of
corn
as
an
adjunct
ingredient
it
has
some
nice
grainy
and
floral
aromas
and
a
bitter
sharp
and
dry
flavor
profile
i
group
it
with
good
ol
pbr
as
far
as
macros
go
high
above
the
big
three
this
is
a
favorite
of
my
pennsylvania
friends
and
i
usually
have
some
when
im
in
the
area
bought
in
emmaus
pa
at
shangys
beer
heaven
for
12
99
a
case
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
taste
and
aroma
are
like
most
macros
this
beer
has
a
decent
fresh
taste
with
nothing
offensive
a
decent
brew
that
is
perfect
for
summer
outings
or
sunday
football
games
i
would
have
no
problem
buying
this
again
poured
a
light
gold
with
minor
head
that
receeded
with
lacings
a
little
a
husky
grainy
smell
with
some
minor
earth
tones
from
hops
a
lightbodied
beer
with
a
sharp
bite
from
the
hops
and
a
little
citric
notes
in
the
taste
but
not
much
not
well
balanced
as
it
seemed
a
little
dry
for
my
liking
it
is
like
a
pale
ale
but
wo
the
distinct
taste
and
more
like
a
real
bitter
cheap
macro
never
understood
why
yuengling
makes
this
beer
unlike
the
lager
which
is
immensely
popular
and
on
tap
in
almost
every
sw
bar
in
pa
the
beer
is
almost
unseen
and
unliked
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
smell
is
kinda
hoppy
with
a
little
malt
presence
to
balance
it
out
taste
is
just
bite
of
a
tin
can
with
a
little
bit
of
beer
mouth
is
crisp
and
carbonated
for
a
refreshing
drink
not
the
best
beer
but
not
the
worst
i
have
this
beer
offten
and
i
like
it
very
much
it
is
more
to
my
taste
then
their
lager
i
really
dont
care
for
their
lager
i
have
had
it
on
draftbottle
and
can
and
it
awalys
has
a
nice
grainy
smell
it
pours
pale
yellow
and
has
a
small
head
and
light
lacing
on
the
glass
to
me
it
tastes
great
smooth
and
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
they
made
their
fortune
on
this
one
way
back
you
can
sit
down
and
drink
a
few
and
not
feel
full
or
like
you
had
too
much
in
your
mouth
it
gives
a
nice
refreshing
feel
and
you
can
enjoy
a
few
of
these
doing
stuff
like
the
lawn
whatever
and
each
one
is
enjoyable
till
your
done
no
after
taste
if
you
have
never
tried
this
one
give
it
a
try
d
not
an
easy
drinker
i
certainly
would
not
buy
it
and
would
probably
would
only
drink
it
if
i
was
desperate
however
this
one
was
rather
refreshing
and
enjoyable
although
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
the
top
rated
beers
on
the
site
it
servers
its
purpose
and
does
it
well
if
youre
mowing
the
lawn
or
out
on
a
boat
with
noncraft
beer
friends
there
probably
isnt
a
better
beer
although
you
can
probably
find
another
aml
thats
almost
the
same
recommended
in
its
place
pours
a
cleanclear
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
huge
white
end
that
dissappears
quickly
to
some
islands
basically
not
sticky
lacing
on
this
one
the
nose
is
maltyhoppy
rice
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
maltyhoppy
rice
light
body
i
would
not
buy
this
if
it
was
available
here
in
utah
nice
to
try
it
once
though
eric
if
you
have
this
against
other
macro
brews
take
this
one
its
not
great
but
its
very
good
for
the
style
dont
drink
and
review
this
one
of
those
macro
smackdowns
that
is
a
battle
of
attrition
rather
than
a
glorious
victory
followed
by
a
tickertape
parade
yuengling
premium
although
nothing
even
remotely
special
is
the
winner
by
virtue
of
its
classic
flavor
profile
and
its
lack
of
offflavors
amazingly
its
still
better
than
just
about
anything
youre
likely
to
find
clogging
up
the
coolers
at
your
local
quickie
mart
a
light
colored
lager
with
some
hop
kiss
nice
drinkability
refreshing
smooth
a
session
beer
at
its
best
had
this
among
others
this
weekend
and
to
be
honest
this
is
the
one
i
kept
coming
back
to
over
the
course
of
my
weekend
this
has
a
more
complex
malt
taste
than
a
lot
of
the
other
lagers
offered
out
there
and
a
nice
little
hop
bite
compared
to
most
macro
lagers
i
would
say
that
if
youre
going
to
be
drinking
macro
lagers
this
is
in
my
opinion
close
to
top
of
the
list
an
average
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
for
hot
dogs
and
burgers
on
the
grill
nothing
to
try
and
go
out
of
your
way
for
a
slightly
above
average
choice
in
a
field
of
weak
beer
this
isnt
completely
undrinkable
but
there
is
an
astringency
not
found
in
many
other
macrotypes
unimpressive
even
for
style
while
there
is
a
hop
presence
it
is
too
bitter
and
the
corn
smell
and
taste
just
interferes
without
adding
flavor
or
lightbodiedness
so
what
is
the
point
well
it
is
cheap
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
in
this
case
didnt
really
prefer
this
beer
much
from
the
bottle
and
was
hoping
for
better
off
the
tap
but
while
is
south
carolina
it
was
the
most
seviceable
beer
to
wash
down
the
jambalaya
the
beer
was
severy
very
cold
but
once
it
warmed
it
shows
some
malt
caramel
flavors
and
aromas
above
a
timid
body
and
colalike
appearance
seemed
to
go
down
fine
with
a
mild
grain
flavor
and
sticky
feel
in
the
finish
certainly
prefered
to
an
amber
bock
or
the
black
and
tan
id
recommend
it
to
the
yuengling
fans
for
its
half
of
the
ingredients
to
your
almighty
black
and
tan
they
use
the
premium
and
porter
for
that
not
bad
at
all
and
a
nice
backyard
bbq
brew
cheers
my
ba
friends
overall
an
easy
drinking
macro
not
too
bad
ice
cold
bottom
line
this
is
a
thirst
quencher
and
in
my
book
totally
inoffensive
i
like
it
my
thanks
to
jwc215
for
sending
me
this
one
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
i
could
hit
it
hard
if
i
had
to
a
much
better
choice
than
a
typical
bmc
would
be
pours
very
pale
gold
with
almost
no
head
retention
or
aroma
its
better
than
most
macro
lagers
i
have
tasted
theres
actually
some
bitterness
trying
to
come
through
i
think
but
still
not
anything
to
write
home
about
im
pretty
sure
theres
corn
in
this
too
cheers
clear
mediumpale
yellow
with
a
small
white
creamy
head
with
good
retention
smells
grassy
and
grainy
light
but
not
too
bad
taste
is
of
weak
grain
and
hops
that
dont
really
balance
all
that
well
some
light
apple
and
a
bitter
finish
with
a
touch
of
citrus
rind
it
has
a
mediumthin
body
dry
texture
and
low
carbonation
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
nothing
id
ever
really
have
again
by
choice
anthor
good
environment
but
it
wasnt
the
best
beer
ever
pale
limp
kinda
unimpresive
but
it
had
a
deffinate
drinkability
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
but
didnt
love
it
but
it
was
pretty
ok
this
was
a
brew
bought
with
some
anticipation
but
didnt
live
u
the
hype
my
brother
gave
it
it
was
fair
enough
but
if
something
ese
better
is
on
tap
take
it
it
tasted
balanced
a
little
corn
flavor
maybe
but
maybe
i
was
imagining
it
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
ball
game
but
nothing
to
savor
at
home
even
though
the
classification
of
american
macro
lager
can
be
like
a
figurative
scarlet
letter
id
have
to
say
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
im
a
born
and
raised
philadelphian
that
grew
up
on
this
stuff
which
can
be
seen
from
my
various
yuengling
apparel
bottle
openers
and
glassware
so
even
though
i
have
and
will
continue
to
encounter
stronger
and
more
flavorful
brews
ill
always
have
a
desire
to
pick
up
some
of
this
every
now
and
then
musings
this
is
a
lager
i
drink
in
the
summer
quite
a
bit
hence
my
interest
in
the
cans
its
not
a
terrible
brew
actually
for
the
price
point
it
is
right
up
near
the
top
however
it
does
have
the
whats
that
taste
characteristic
to
it
that
needs
to
be
explained
from
a
one
quart
stubbie
on
steroids
bottle
pours
out
to
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
of
foam
that
quickly
calms
to
about
18th
inch
no
lacing
medium
to
medium
high
levels
of
carbonation
aromas
are
light
some
floral
hops
and
malt
smells
fresh
taste
is
mediocre
some
malt
grain
and
a
definite
whisky
like
flavor
toward
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
uninspiring
yet
not
dead
as
the
carbonation
keeps
things
alive
on
the
palate
fair
drinkability
i
think
i
like
regular
yuengling
better
but
this
bottle
is
badass
thanks
goes
out
to
maltygoodness
for
the
sample
i
had
high
high
hopes
for
this
beer
when
i
tried
it
yuengling
premium
it
must
be
a
step
above
the
traditional
right
how
awesome
would
that
be
well
i
guess
well
never
know
from
the
yuengling
brewery
that
is
because
this
is
definately
not
a
step
above
traditional
it
is
a
step
below
it
turns
out
that
premium
is
a
euphamism
for
macro
thats
what
this
is
yuengling
brewery
doing
a
macro
style
beer
as
opposed
to
traditional
which
is
well
traditional
thats
amber
american
lager
it
was
a
style
which
was
a
much
bigger
preprohibition
staple
in
america
anyway
the
color
is
a
sort
of
cleargold
not
nearly
as
deep
as
say
urquell
but
noticably
more
amber
than
most
macros
compared
to
the
traditional
its
lighter
and
clearer
smell
is
pretty
boring
a
little
sweet
grain
and
a
lot
of
hops
the
hops
are
kind
of
hard
to
describe
i
guess
id
call
them
metallic
or
typical
macro
if
i
found
them
objectionable
but
i
dont
theyre
pretty
bitter
but
leave
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
theyre
clean
and
surprisingly
strong
for
the
style
but
still
not
too
interesting
i
guess
the
best
way
to
describe
them
would
be
typical
macro
hops
if
typical
macro
hops
weret
disgusting
they
are
balanced
by
light
malts
that
are
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
all
about
carbonation
maybe
this
would
feel
thin
if
not
for
all
those
bubbles
but
i
honestly
cant
tell
you
i
could
taste
the
beer
fine
but
carbonation
was
all
the
mouthfeel
i
could
get
drinkability
is
fine
you
could
definately
drink
these
all
night
the
hops
dont
get
in
my
way
the
taste
isnt
bad
nothing
is
wrong
with
this
except
that
no
store
or
bar
exists
that
carries
this
unless
they
carry
the
traditional
lager
as
well
so
why
bother
this
is
obviously
what
yuengling
brewed
to
catch
the
budweiser
crowd
and
the
result
well
it
splits
the
difference
it
definately
kicks
budweisers
ass
by
not
being
the
least
bit
nasty
or
looking
anything
like
urine
but
traditional
lager
in
turn
kicks
its
ass
by
looking
the
way
real
beer
should
look
and
packing
a
lot
more
taste
uses
serving
to
my
friends
who
when
i
tell
them
my
favorite
beer
say
yuengling
thats
like
liquid
bread
or
wow
thats
really
strong
beer
this
would
be
a
good
compromise
for
them
maybe
even
a
good
gateway
to
discovery
of
the
fact
that
there
are
more
than
3
breweries
in
this
country
i
would
call
this
the
best
macrostyle
out
there
except
who
the
hell
wants
a
macrostyle
beer
from
a
regional
brewery
even
if
they
do
a
good
job
the
traditional
owns
this
and
the
easily
outsells
it
besides
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
with
a
one
figne
frothy
white
head
which
went
down
quickly
streams
of
bubbles
arose
from
the
bottom
smell
was
malty
taste
consisted
of
light
malt
which
became
fuller
throughout
a
slightly
sweet
quality
was
also
detected
as
was
a
metallic
quality
to
the
beer
light
in
the
mouth
but
not
too
watery
an
okay
brew
definitely
not
as
good
as
yuengling
lager
imho
rating
beer
is
ike
rating
pies
or
sandwiches
you
cant
compare
dutch
apple
to
pumpkin
if
youre
not
a
pumpkin
fan
which
i
am
by
the
way
likewise
a
pbj
will
never
measure
up
to
a
blt
unless
you
truly
prefer
peanut
butter
yuengling
is
going
out
on
a
limb
to
call
this
beer
premium
but
in
the
realm
of
comparing
similarly
priced
adjunct

macro
lagers
id
consider
this

drunk
straight
from
the

i
have
to
dock
this
a
point
for
appearance
the
aromas
are
of
faint
hops
it
also
maintains
a
thin
surface
covering
for
some

and
as
such
is
kinda
thin
and
whimpy
all
in

this
beer
aims
for

comes

a

this

designed
to
be

o
a
good
go
at
a
yellow
lager
much
better
than
an
adjunct
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
whirl
as
a
malthead
id
have
liked
a
little
less
grass
and
a
little
more
biscuit
but
i
know
im
in
a
minority
in
that
respect
cheers
o
wow
not
what
i
was
expecting
appearance
and
aroma
is
soso
but
the
flavors
are
sharp
bold
and
crisp
very
flavorful
for
5

great
crispness
and
im
honestly
blown
away
by
the
strength
of
flavors
given
that
this
is
lower
abv
and
is
not
a

bomb
or
a
sour

really
impressed

this
one
from

an

i

doesnt
go
overboard
with
the
flavorings
this
is
a
beer
when
you
are
looking
for
something
fresh
on
a
summer
night
wont
weigh

and
overall
is

i
would
have
again
love
the
marketing
as
a
lawnmower
beer
the
beer
you
should
enjoy

mowing
the
lawn
well
said

encapsulates
a

of
what
this
beer
is
poured
into
a
dogfish

pint
glass

a

golden

with

carbonation
that
keeps
a

in

of
sweet
pale
and
biscuit
malt
with

and

hops
finishing
with
a
mild
cream
corn
and
lingering
pilsner
style
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
a
well
made
light
lager
that
has
a
nice
hop
bill
that
is
complemented
by
the
full
biscuit
malt
body
not
an
exciting
style
but
as
usual
for
pretty
things
nicely
made
and
great
to
drink
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
hooking
me
up
with
yet
another
wonderful
beer
this
guy
deserves
a
medal
better
than
your
average
summer
type
lawnmower
beer
this
is
sweeter
richer
and
far
more
malty
its
nose
and
smell
match
its
color
wheel
pinpoint
where
yellow
just
begins
to
melt
into
brown
dim
but
lively
heady
and
lacy
and
fit
for
some
white
summer
wedding
the
smell
and
taste
are
decadently
malted
and
only
bittered
on
the
hop
front
its
definitely
a
lager
too
with
a
bready
and
dry
quick
finishing
yeast
that
hints
at
old
school
european
stuff
grassy
hops
round
it
out
but
yeast
and
sweet
malt
are
whats
memorable
for
me
here
my
critique
of
this
beer
and
it
is
indeed
substantial
is
the
7
alcohol
by
volume
such
strength
is
not
useful
in
this
style
makes
it
heavier
and
honestly
sacrifices
some
of
the
better
properties
of
a
good
lager
to
pursue
such
strength
the
beer
works
in
flavor
but
bomber
is
a
tough
dose
when
you
are
flying
solo
and
when
you
want
to
jump
around
beers
and
styles
this
gets
a
little
chewy
but
its
a
cool
brew
i
just
wish
for
reduced
residual
sweetness
and
booze
not
that
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
i
can
feel
it
and
with
all
the
sugar
thats
still
in
this
beer
it
gets
a
bit
terminal
that
said
these
guys
are
clearly
brewing
some
of
the
best
beer
in
mass
and
i
am
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
one
not
really
late
december
beer
but
nevermind
that
this
right
here
is
the
great
american
lager

what

lacks

one

its
greatest
strengths
that
sweet
cornsyrupy
taste

have

it

of
an
american
lager
but
never
find
with
the
big
boys
wow
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
all
that
surprised
that
this
brewery
could
spit
out
such
a
heady
ode
to
the
best
bohemian
pilseners
out
there
they
surely
do

i
should
have
known
this

nothing

here
but
this
is
a

session
beer
i
like
a
lot
of
lighter
beers
though
this
style
is
kind
of
blah
for
me
but
this
is
a
very
good
lager
and
it
tastes
good
in
the
can
too
which
is
a
plus
not
everyone
gets
canning
right
but
these
guys
do
its
just
a
bit
heavier
than
a
session
beer
but
you
can
still
do
that
without
much
trouble
really
well
crafted
for
sure
a
really
basic
single
hop
lager
with
no
frills
about
it
they
did
a
great
job
of
keeping
and
imperfections
in
this
basic
beer
just
a
crisp
lager

light

so
drinkable
almost
a

by

standards
but
not
quite
still
i
could
enjoy
putting
away
a
few
cans
of
this
craft
lager
and
not
feel
guilty
upslope
is
a
solid
brewery
in
my
book
this
beer
works
decently
for
style
but
for
such
a
simple
lager
the
quality
and
balance
have
to
be
almost
perfect
to
really
set
it
apart
while
a
notch
better
it
really
doesnt
stand
out
far
enough
many
of
the
macro
lagers
on
the
market
easy
to
drink
and
potentially
sessionable
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
for
me
there
is
a
mineral
and
sulfur
like
character
that
is
a
bit
off
putting
though
not
enough
to
kill
the
beer
maybe
not
something
i
will
reach
for
first
in
the
future
but
not
a
bad
second
tier
option
taste
mimics
the
nose
with
a
good
moderate
dose
of
saaz
hops
providing
earthy
spicy
notes
plus
a
little
bit
of
lemon
light
bready
malts
lend
a
slight
sweetness
this
is
a
flavor
profile
everyone
is
accustomed
to
from
mass
marketed
pale
lagers
but
pay
close
attention
and
youll
notice
the
hop
bill
has
been
ratcheted
up
a
little
here
and
things
are
overall
more
refined
nice
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
easy
without
being
too
boring
overall
the
right
notes
are
there
but
it
is
too
light
for
me
however
i
think
they
accomplished
their
goal
of
making
a
light
and
unoffensive
lager
its
an
outstanding
beer
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
as
it
subsides
can
says
they
use
saaz
hops
in
this
one
nose
is
sweet
mildly
skunky
and
herbal
tastes
very
bready
corngrain
has
some
sweetness
and
very
mild
bitter
back
end
this
would
be
excellent
to
take
fishing
or
to
pound
after
some
summer
yardwork
mouthfeel
is
crisp
light
and
refreshing
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
lager
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
is
super
drinkable
and
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
overall
a
tasty
little
lager
that
i
will
keep
in
mind
for
my
next
party
awesome
to
see
another
craft
brewer
go
wild
and
brew
an
american
lager
and
upslope
went
right
for
it
the
retro
flavor
is
there
and
it
drinks
very
easy
the
only
missing
factor
is
that
it
does
not
come
in
the
tallboy
format
not
a
problem
knocking
a
few
of
these
back
a
thanks
to
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
malty
taste
is
crisp
malts
some
grains
none
of
the
sweetness
in
the
smell
kind
of
on
the
mild
side
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
brew
overall
an
excellent
clean
refreshing
canned
lager
the
crack
revealed
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
and
so
it
was
time
for
an
inverted
glug
now
before
i
proceed
i
need
a
disclaimer
as
a
native
pennsylvanian
i
know
how
hard
it
can
be
to
use
lager
yeast
and
since
we
have
centuries
of
experience
pa
lagers
are
some
of
the
finest
outside
of
germany
and
the
czech
republic
imho
that
said
i
tend
to
be
hard
on
craft
canned
lagers
i
got
a
finger
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
from
my
pour
color
was
a
pale
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
lightly
grassy
leading
me
to
wonder
what
happened
to
those
lovely
hops
along
with
a
very
characteristic
honeylike
lager
sweetness
sofa
sofa
so
good
because
when
i
can
smell
the
honey
characteristic
of
the
malt
it
means
that
no
adjuncts
were
involved
mouthfeel
was
medium
about
right
for
the
style
and
i
got
grassy
hops
on
the
tongue
but
not
as
prevalently
as
i
might
have
liked
finish
was
both
grassy
and
slightly
metallic
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
but
as
a
lager
it
was
found
by
me
to
be
lacking
keep
tweaking
this
one
fellows
othis
beer
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
there
is
a
decent
flavor
which
makes
it
a
decent
alternative
to
macroaaltype
beers
the
problem
i
have
is
that
for
the
same
price
you
can
get
significantly
more
flavorful
session
type
beers
so
unless
you
have
a
hankering
for
a
lightly
flavored
pale
lager
why
buy
this
over
say
sierra
nevada
pale
or
dales
pale
flavors
of
grassy
hops
minerals
light
caramel
crisp
refreshing
but
also
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
initial
bite
through
the
finish
conclusion
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
the
reviewers
on
this
site
are
still
in
their
craft
beer
adolescence
by
that
i
mean
that
they
want
simplicity
bold
and
easy
to
identify
flavors
and
constantly
are
seeking
to
oneup
the
beer
they
drank
yesterday
thus
a
mild
flavored
low
abv
easy
drinking
beer
such
as
this
will
score
low
what
if
upslope
intended
to
keep
everything
mild
mannered
and
if
so
why
is
that
mandate
a
low
score
i
digress
this
beer
could
almost
pass
as
a
kolsch
as
it
is
fruitier
and
slightly
sweeter
than
the
standard
lager
warmer
fermentation
perhaps
either
way
this
is
light
drinkable
and
quiet
tasty
this
is
a
very
nice
refreshing
lager
with
wellrounded
grain
hop
character
flavorful
enough
enjoy
a
few
in
a
row
and
with
the
low
abv
it
would
do
well
as
a
session
beer
o
just
a
great
craft
lager
in
the
german
style
i
could
see
hop
lovers
being
slightly
disappointing
here
as
malts
really
steal
the
show
i
really
enjoy
it
and
find
it
to
be
a
perfect
fishing
or
lawn
work
beer
from
the
12
oz
can
bought
at
grapevine
liquors
on
south
monaco
for
a
pale
lager
this
is
damn
good
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
2
inch
white
head
nice
and
thick
on
top
smells
more
malt
than
hops
but
some
bitter
notse
come
through
in
the
taste
from
what
appears
to
be
a
fairly
generous
hopping
for
this
style
mouthfeel
is
excellent
good
carbonation
not
too
too
light
on
the
body
and
a
crisp
finish
very
easy
drinking
and
interesting
enough
to
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
them
i
have
really
enjoyed
every
upslope
brew
ive
tried
so
far
and
this
one
was
no
exception
stood
up
well
to
some
hot
food
pretty
good
if
not
unusual
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
sweet
up
front
with
a
good
finish
as
far
as
a
little
pilsner
goes
above
average
for
sure
but
a
little
boring
i
wish
for
something
more
the
entire
time
drinking
it
id
have
a
dry
hopped
version
on
tap
someday
if
that
were
possible
i
laud
upslope
for
always
putting
out
a
solid
product
a
small
brewery
shouldnt
pull
too
many
punches
and
you
know
what
you
are
going
to
get
every
time
a
beer
that
is
true
to
style
a
bit
lackluster
in
creative
approach
but
solid
pours
a
golden
bright
color
nice
head
produced
from
vigorous
pour
light
czech
saaz
hops
on
the
nose
very
refreshing
taste
that
goes
down
easy
at
4
8
abv
this
will
be
my
new
summer
beer
i
love
that
upslope
has
expanded
their
portfolio
with
an
awesome
lager
cheers

a
six
pack
yesterday
at
argonaut
hadnt
had
it
and
the
price
was
right
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
of
bread
yeast
biscuit
and
light
hops
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
bread
yeast
and
light
hops
12oz
can
with
orange
accents
on
the
can
color
is
yellow
and
the
head
is
just
ok
smells
like
your
average
lager
beery
taste
is
not
bad
but
doesnt
wow
me
at
all
this
is
super
easy
to
drink
but
for
8
49
im
going
to
go
with
something
else
every
time
very
flat
tasting
just
not
my
thing
overall
this
is
a
fresh
brewery
for
us
they
certainly
advertise
this
brewing
company
across
omaha
locally
enough
but
we
are
kinda
happy
we
got
a
sampling
chance
on
this
visit
we
had
just
finished
pint
night
actually
at
a
local
beer
bar
and
were
coming
back
to
the
hotel
to
finish
out
our
night
in
the
room
in
passing
the
snack
area
of
the
hotel
lobby
we
came
across
a
beer
cooler
and
obviously
happily
selected
any
local
beverages
that
required
rating
including
this
one
this
as
we
expected
from
the
description
was
a
simple
lager
it
had
a
nice
drinking
face
to
it
but
the
flavor
just
wasnt
there
in
full
force
to
retract
the
flavor
and
nose
were
there
in
simplicity
but
didnt
make
you
want
to
drink
many
more
of
these
perhaps
if
youre
going
after
a
nonexclusively
craft
audience
then
its
okay
but
youre
not
going
to
sway
any
ipa
or
stout
seekers
with
this
one
the
job
is
done
and
one
can
move
on
from
there
overall
4
09
can
lucky
bucket
do
no
wrong
im
starting
to
believe
it
im
still
amazed
these
guys
have
such
mediocre
ratings
overall
ive
been
drinking
beer
for
awhile
and
their
brews
are
some
of
the
best
ive
had
period
this
is
most
certainly
the
best
prepro
lager
ive
had
by
a
mile
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
check
this
out
o
this
is
an
average
beer
nothing
to
complex
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
just
like
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
good
either
it
elicited
a
collective
meh
from
my
palate
i
was
not
expecting
much
and
it
lived
up
to
the
low
expectation
i
set
for
it
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
drink
it
but
its
worth
a
try
one
time
poured
into
a
nebraska
cornhuskers
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
reddishamber
color
with
minimal
head
takes
on
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
good
lager
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
this
style
hint
of
caramel
in
the
taste
with
a
malty
finish
a
quality
lager
indeed
this
beer
has
become
a
staple
around
omaha
barsrestaurants
as
well
as
popular
events
such
as
the
college
world
series
a
good
brew
to
enjoy
year
round
better
than
the
scores
indicate
here
an
amber
lager
in
color
with
a
little
more
depth
and
sweetness
than
most
clear
copper
color
short
lived
half
inch
of
white
head
a
nose
of
english
pale
and
caramel
malt
slightly
out
of
place
and
of
course
bready
fresh
lager
yeast
the
flavor
is
the
same
equal
parts
yeast
and
grain
im
missing
hops
here
well
structured
through
a
clean
but
big
and
semisweet
finish
more
body
than
the
standard
lager
but
also
a
bit
heavier
in
a
bad
way
filling
not
sessionable
as
it
should
be
carbonation
is
fine
and
even
with
a
moderate
metallic
aftertaste
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
sorft
of
a
fall
lager
with
a
little
more
heft
than
the
standard
issue
nothing
world
class
here
but
a
fine
local
beer
from
lucky
bucket
if
you
are
an
eastern
nebraska
resident
or
visitor
preprohibition
lager
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
dissipating
head
there
wasnt
any
aroma
from
this
beer
the
taste
had
crisp
malt
undertones
with
a
strong
overly
sweet
fruity
almost
apple
like
taste
hard
to
drink
and
way
to
sweet
overall
its
a
very
sweet
and
fruity
like
lager
overall
im
not
really
impressed
if
this
was
cleaned
up
a
little
it
could
really
shine
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
light
amber
color
and
poured
a
fair
head
the
beer
smelled
terrible
like
it
was
sour
or
something
whew
the
taste
was
not
sour
but
it
was
dry
and
hoppy
and
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
so
i
will
not
be
buying
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
nicely
flavorful
lager
that
is
a
serious
session
beer
this
represents
the
style
well
o
i
dont
generally
like
lagers
but
this
one
gets
my
seal
of
approval
consumable
interesting
and
goes
great
with
food
overall
pretty
average
but
not
bad
clean
malty
nose
with
light
spice
and
with
a
deep
breathe
a
hint
of
apple
underneath
smooth
and
full
bodied
the
spice
caramel
and
sweetness
jump
out
on
the
tongue
and
lingernot
typical
lager
characteristics
but
a
reason
why
i
like
this
one
refreshing
on
a
hot
daya
perfect
reason
to
drink
a
lager
overall
a
easy
drinking
fairly
nice
flavor
profile
makes
for
a
decent
session
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
overall
a
solid
serviceable
lager
from
lucky
bucket
drinks
easily
with
mellow
and
agreeable
flavor
a
perfect
companion
for
a
hearty
meal
this
would
go
great
with
a
loaded
burger
and
fries
overall
just
an
easy
drinking
lager
that
tastes
pretty
good
and
smells
even
better
for
what
it
is
this
beer
does
just
fine
as
an
easy
to
drink
refresher
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
like
the
lager
equivalent
to
an
american
pale
ale
as
far
as
hops
flavor
and
bitterness
just
that
it
has
a
malty
backbone
and
that
clean
lager
yeast
character
to
it
beers
like
remind
me
that
there
is
more
to
beer
than
ales
and
its
about
time
i
tried
my
hand
at
brewing
a
lager
d
an
honest
but
uninspired
attempt
not
something
i
would
drink
again
nor
recommend
even
at
the
highly
accessible
4
5
abv
im
not
sure
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
the
slightly
odd
flavor
is
a
killer
for
me
o
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
not
really
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
but
a
nice
one
to
have
and
not
think
too
much
about
tastes
great
less
filling
but
for
real
this
a
go
to
easy
drinking
beer
for
me
its
regularly
available
at
the
local
whole
foods
o
drinkable
but
not
memorable
this
tastes
nice
its
crisp
and
simple
but
its
not
quite
like
anything
ive
ever
had
before
its
sweet
but
not
agressively
so
not
particularly
well
balanced
but
thats
par
for
the
style
overall
its
a
good
beer
that
i
drink
every
once
in
awhile
i
dont
drink
it
a
lot
because
i
want
a
different
taste
in
a
beer
i
like
lbs
ipa
better
d
never
again
no
way
preprohibition
beer
was
like
this
if
it
were
no
one
wouldve
been
fighting
for
repeal
gross
overall
its
nothing
special
in
terms
of
flavor
but
at
the
same
time
it
serves
its
purpose
as
a
beer
and
gets
the
job
done
as
a
light
easy
to
drink
beer
albeit
a
very
average
beer
m
medium
body
lots
of
fizz
a
decent
lager
made
locally
so
bonus
points
for
that
haha
slight
aromas
of
malt
a
white
head
and
a
medium
golden
color
mouthfeel
is
light
which
makes
this
beer
an
easy
drinker
a
pretty
straight
forward
lager
clean
crisp
and
somewhat
dry
finish
nothing
special
but
nothing
to
complain
about
the
beer
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
just
a
wisp
of
foam
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
with
a
few
offfruity
notes
lingering
in
the
shadow
this
continues
onto
the
palate
where
the
sweetness
goes
awry
midway
through
conjuring
up
unpleasant
thoughts
the
off
flavors
are
strangely
sour
these
aspects
are
not
so
objectionable
to
make
it
undrinkable
but
they
are
noticeable
the
beer
finishes
with
a
whimper
whether
preprohibition
or
postprohibition
the
beer
is
not
historic
quite
solid
for
an
american
lagera
decent
example
of
a
fancy
lawn
mower
beer
if
you
will
i
just
wish
that
it
finished
a
little
bit
crisperas
it
is
it
feels
just
a
little
flabby
lucky
bucket
lager
pours
a
fat
head
that
collapses
pretty
quickly
into
a
disk
of
foam
over
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
brew
carbonation
is
slow
but
steady
the
nose
lager
yeast
funk
and
sour
apple
notes
flavor
is
mild
light
barley
malt
starting
slightly
tart
with
the
tiniest
bite
of
hebal
hop
off
the
back
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
bit
of
the
hop
and
barley
hull
coming
back
in
the
aftertaste
altogether
a
pretty
unassuming
brew
but
as
with
beers
like
new
glarus
spotted
cow
and
august
schells
nordeast
it
is
designed
to
be
a
step
above
the
macro
lagers
a
gateway
for
the
curious
drinker
used
to
beers
brewed
and
marketed
more
as
bulk
commodities
than
as
a
hometown
brew
overall
impression
this
beer
was
given
to
me
as
a
gift
and
i
dont
know
what
it
had
been
through
or
how
long
it
took
to
get
to
me
so
take
that
into
consideration
i
hope
to
try
a
fresh
one
someday
as
this
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
the
fruity
sour
tart
flavor
seemed
very
misplaced
and
it
reminded
me
of
something
someone
from
my
homebrew
club
to
bring
to
a
meeting
and
ask
whats
wrong
with
it
i
definitely
do
not
recommend
this
beer
based
on
the
two
bottles
of
it
that
i
had
o
you
know
this
is
a
fine
little
lager
it
is
what
it
is
but
its
balanced
and
refreshing
and
sessionable
overall
on
my
fourth
bottle
of
the
six
pack
perfectly
drinkable
and
lucky
bucket
did
a
fair
job
recreating
the
old
lager
style
it
certainly
has
the
taste
but
it
never
was
that
good
to
begin
with
was
it
great
balance
excellent
pad
de
deau
between
the
factors
ultimately
satisfactory
i
can
drink
this
thats
for
sure
as
a
nonlagerlover
im
not
ultimately
going
to
turn
to
this
often
but
its
fine
for
what
it
is
o
an
average
lager
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
light
caramel
with
hints
of
floral
hops
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
rather
strong
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
fuller
it
finishes
clean
with
a
mild
pale
malt
taste
that
lingers
for
a
few
seconds
then
goes
away
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
drink
this
again
without
complaints
but
there
are
better
beers
in
this
style
that
i
would
choose
first
definitely
not
my
favorite
beer
and
though
its
quite
drinkable
the
dominating
sourness
just
isnt
my
bag
got
a
bottle
from
the
beer
of
the
month
club
the
beer
pours
golden
in
color
with
a
little
bit
of
haze
a
head
forms
but
retreats
quickly
the
smell
doesnt
strike
me
with
much
of
anything
the
taste
is
pretty
good
for
a
lager
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
kind
of
forgettable
it
tastes
like
a
pretty
good
lager
not
a
bad
thing
i
guess
but
if
you
are
on
this
site
you
look
for
more
a
step
up
from
bmc
but
not
aimed
at
the
serious
drinker
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
non
descript
hay
grass
sweet
taste
like
a
typicla
lager
light
and
easy
drinking
a
decent
all
around
lager
o
hmm
not
great
but
not
terrible
either
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
given
to
me
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
unless
my
other
options
were
bmc
stuff
o
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
beer
i
figured
itd
be
a
middleofthepack
lawnmower
beer
but
it
didnt
meet
those
expectations
maybe
i
got
an
old
beer
i
dont
know
since
there
wasnt
a
date
on
the
bottle
would
not
seek
again
clear
bodied
but
there
is
a
haze
small
white
head
darker
gold
pale
malt
nose
biscuity
taste
is
nice
pale
malt
light
hop
fairly
malty
for
the
style
maybe
a
hint
of
fruit
light
mouth
kinda
dry
i
guess
a
bit
more
malt
would
make
it
a
bit
better
but
its
certainly
not
bad
at
all
a
nice
summer
sipper
o
probably
fine
for
table
beer
or
for
a
social
event
i
think
the
sourness
might
catch
up
with
me
after
a
few
though
drinkabilitysee
mouthfeel
taste
a
great
straightforward
brew
for
drinking
on
a
summer
day
for
some
reason
i
really
like
this
beer
and
my
number
scores
i
noted
earlier
before
sitting
down
to
type
a
bit
confused
with
the
hop
profile
and
body
of
this
beer
im
gonna
let
this
review
stand
and
come
back
to
it
later
only
fair
its
a
good
thing
that
ipa
was
my
first
offering
from
lucky
bucket
and
not
preprohibition
style
lager
my
opinion
of
these
guys
is
still
mostly
positive
but
theyll
have
to
impress
next
time
out
to
keep
it
there
this
beer
finishes
clean
and
quick
good
drinkablity
i
suppose
something
good
can
come
out
of
nebraska
its
a
pretty
light
copper
color
with
light
carbonation
the
aroma
kinda
light
with
hops
and
a
touch
of
floral
the
taste
is
a
bit
light
also
with
some
citrus
flowers
and
honey
the
finish
is
a
bit
tart
but
lessens
when
the
glass
warms
up
this
isnt
too
bad
for
a
lager
definitely
better
than
many
of
the
style
ive
had
d
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
pale
lager
it
is
quite
tasty
and
could
be
very
sessionable
lucky
bucket
preprohibition
style
lager
was
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
beige
head
with
decent
retention
the
smell
was
light
malt
with
a
little
sweetness
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
upfront
and
some
light
hop
flavor
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
coming
through
towards
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
average
with
a
light
body
and
light
carbonation
drinkability
was
about
average
it
is
a
decent
lager
and
worth
a
try
the
body
is
light
er
carbonation
is
quite
crisp
at
the
start
and
leaves
a
slight
tingle
through
the
finish
i
say
this
is
an
average
beer
because
i
wasnt
the
fondest
of
the
flavor
if
the
flavor
hits
the
spot
for
someone
else
it
may
be
very
enjoyable
it
hit
me
on
the
2nd
bottle
that
this
is
basically
an
altbier
it
has
that
kind
of
sharp
worcestershire
taste
and
the
same
color
as
an
altbier
if
you
like
that
style
this
is
a
good
one
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
small
head
not
too
much
lacing
the
smell
has
a
very
faint
grassy
flavour
but
very
mellow
taste
was
quite
mellow
as
well
carbonation
level
was
pretty
much
on
for
the
sytle
a
pleasant
enough
beer
but
i
didnt
find
it
a
ton
better
than
some
macro
lagers
passable
lager
gotten
in
trade
some
malty
aroma
some
white
head
on
light
golden
colour
a
tad
light
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
pure
example
of
style
a
bit
of
hops
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
not
overall
exciting
but
thats
the
style
the
kind
of
beer
that
was
craft
available
in
the
late
seventies
ah
we
pine
for
the
days
before
all
that
prohibitive
nonsense
dont
we
just
as
we
pine
for
the
fjords
whilst
preening
our
lovely
plumage
yup
this
guy
pours
every
shade
of
auburn
from
a
tiger
eye
from
the
darker
amber
on
top
to
a
pale
straw
at
the
base
with
several
gradients
in
between
with
a
minor
bubbly
head
imagine
a
closeup
photo
of
a
tiger
cubs
left
eye
the
right
looks
different
we
think
its
some
sort
of
genetic
defect
the
nose
is
faint
with
hints
of
light
wheat
and
what
i
struggle
to
perceive
to
be
caramel
luckily
hey
that
bucket
worked
fuck
that
dirty
ol
rabbits
foot
the
taste
has
more
strength
to
it
with
notes
of
wheat
slightly
darker
than
in
the
nose
random
grains
raw
corn
or
as
the
indians
call
it
maize
and
a
very
mild
bitterness
the
body
is
quite
smooth
and
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
why
cant
more
lagers
be
this
solid
i
guess
were
just
gonna
haveta
hogtie
peabody
jack
his
wayback
and
rock
our
way
to
the
days
before
those
damn
early
progressives
caved
to
pressures
from
whoa
curse
these
historians
impulses
d
easy
drinking
abv
is
well
within
sessionability
lightly
filling
at
times
malting
is
pretty
assertive
leaving
a
sweet
finish
d
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
and
a
nice
gateway
to
craft
brews
there
are
no
off
flavors
but
theres
not
much
to
this
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
friend
that
isnt
into
craft
beer
but
not
to
a
veteran
overall
im
very
impressed
for
this
first
offering
from
this
upstart
brewery
a
little
history
the
brewery
was
started
by
the
former
brewmaster
of
upstream
brewery
a
local
brewpub
zach
the
head
brewmaster
here
has
his
masters
in
brewing
and
has
hit
the
ball
out
of
the
park
very
nice
zach
cant
wait
to
see
whats
next
picked
this
up
because
it
is
local
brewed
in
nebraska
interesting
style
choice
for
a
small
craft
brewer
i
guess
they
were
trying
to
pull
in
bmc
drinker
because
there
is
not
a
lot
here
for
most
dedicated
craft
drinkers
will
i
get
it
again
at
the
typical
price
i
see
it
of
6
99
no
if
it
were
cheaper
maybe
if
im
in
the
mood
to
pound
lagers
lucky
bucket
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
probably
something
id
prefer
in
the
summer
but
im
impressed
in
december
too
very
drinkable
one
to
keep
stocked
in
your
fridge
in
the
summer
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
in
cans
d
very
drinkable
could
easily
have
many
of
these
at
once
a
good
first
effort
from
a
local
nebraska
brewer
good
rendition
of
a
full
flavor
extra
hoppy
lager
a
little
tinny
id
buy
again
if
i
wanted
that
style
but
didnt
feel
like
an
aal
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
sticky
so
not
overly
refreshing
might
be
better
ice
cold
an
excellent
session
beer
overall
to
each
his
own
but
i
find
easy
to
drink
beer
with
great
taste
very
appealing
o
good
easy
drinking
and
satisfying
i
came
across
a
12pack
variety
of
new
belgium
and
decided
to
try
the
pale
lager
i
havent
been
entirely
impressed
with
these
types
of
beers
from
other
brewers
but
from
new
belgium
it
was
very
good
the
pale
lager
has
a
dark
tinge
with
a
beautiful
white
and
puffy
head
along
with
really
good
lacing
the
best
ive
seen
in
quite
some
time
i
was
also
impressed
with
the
wheaty
scent
along
with
the
distinctive
ipa
smell
and
the
other
plus
for
me
was
there
was
none
of
the
over
bitterness
that
comes
with
an
ipa
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
ive
got
a
few
more
to
go
through
had
this
one
in
a
can
good
flavor
and
a
slightly
different
version
of
the
usual
pale
not
superhoppy
as
some
of
their
newer
offerings
tend
to
be
and
i
could
taste
a
bit
of
the
fruity
flavor
that
is
advertised
its
a
little
atypical
for
this
brewery
and
im
glad
they
took
a
chance
to
make
this
style
pours
a
very
nice
dark
golden
color
very
nice
carbonation
twofinger
creamy
white
head
which
leaves
tons
of
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
a
nice
touch
of
malts
some
citrus
very
slight
yeast
note
the
taste
is
very
nice
hoppy
with
some
maltiness
nice
touch
of
citrus
medium
body
with
a
nice
bitterdry
finish
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
would
buy
again
aroma
of
hoppy
fruits
apricots
or
apples
honey
and
pale
malts
lots
of
bready
aromas
taste
has
a
bright
upfront
fruity
taste
with
a
lingering
malty
finish
minimal
bitterness
crisp
and
tasty
good
addition
to
nb
lineup
pours
a
clear
bright
yellow
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
foamy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
good
3mm
or
so
after
a
bit
a
good
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
almost
rings
the
aroma
is
nothing
real
special
just
of
some
grains
with
a
light
hint
of
sulfur
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
fruit
and
citrus
zest
in
the
mix
as
well
does
have
a
tad
of
a
hoppy
finish
lighter
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
brew
overall
refreshing
with
a
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malts
very
fruit
beer
with
a
slight
tartness
though
something
was
out
of
balance
here
o
a
quality
american
lager
with
zero
adjuncts
no
real
faults
and
its
very
clean
and
refreshing
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
one
mostly
that
the
taste
is
a
bit
metallic
or
something
i
dont
know
but
im
not
all
that
impressed
by
this
new
belgium
thats
not
to
say
its
a
bad
beer
or
that
i
would
turn
one
down
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
a
pale
ale
not
the
cleanest
and
most
refined
of
lagers
but
definitely
a
lot
of
flavor
in
a
refreshing
beer
slightly
disappointed
i
just
have
the
one
can
of
this
one
would
be
curious
to
see
how
it
strikes
me
on
another
day
overall
this
offering
almost
transcends
the
category
for
me
it
would
be
a
great
beverage
for
a
plethora
of
meals
overall
disappointed
there
are
many
better
lagers
available
at
much
lower
prices
beer
golden
color
no
distinct
flavors
but
hints
of
wheat
honey
vague
malt
and
citrus
very
vague
i
dont
know
if
i
taste
much
of
anything
here
still
it
has
a
nice
taste
strange
but
totally
enjoyable
a
lingering
taste
golden
amber
pour
with
a
bright
white
a
frothy
head
this
beer
is
crystal
clear
with
lots
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
lacing
is
fine
but
irregular
but
does
stay
with
the
glass
the
aroma
is
classic
lager
biscuit
and
grassy
mild
hops
there
are
hints
of
tropical
fruits
but
they
are
illusive
at
best
the
body
of
this
beer
is
heavier
than
expected
from
a
lager
but
the
difference
is
welcoming
the
palate
is
crisp
and
clean
with
nice
malty
notes
balanced
nicely
with
a
piney
hop
bitterness
the
hops
continue
through
the
finish
and
linger
for
a
good
20
seconds
overall
a
very
well
done
lager
and
a
fantastic
sessionable
beer
i
am
copying
these
notes
over
from
ratebeer
it
does
not
require
as
long
of
review
i
tasted
this
some
time
ago
so
i
cant
add
anything
o
bleh
one
note
kinda
beer
just
is
grainy
and
malty
home
tasting
16oz
can
into
pilsner
glass
22814
a
rather
good
amalgam
of
styles
very
altbieresque
fruity
vinous
and
pretty
enjoyable
i
hope
to
see
the
canned
version
available
up
here
by
summertime
overall
decent
beer
has
a
nice
sweet
citric
flavor
mixed
in
with
pale
malts
i
guess
the
only
knock
about
the
beer
is
none
of
the
flavors
jump
out
at
you
and
you
are
left
feeling
a
little
unsatisfied
great
price
and
its
in
cans
so
its
worth
a
drink
for
sure
pale
golden
fresh
cut

flavor
perfectly
complex
drinking
lager
all
malted
barley
goes
along
way
with
flavor
biscuit
malts
bring
a
bready
resilience
with
the
herbalmineralcitric
notes
coming
from
the
hops
very
clean
snappy
finish
those
hops
stick
around
more
than
the
average
end
of
shift
lager
that
this
country
knows
all
too
well
i
saw
it
labeled
for
16
99
a
12
pack
which
i
didnt
jump
on
however
i
did
grab
about
four
cans
for
1
69
just
enough
to
wet
the
whistle
crisp
even
carbonation
perfect
mouthfeel
semi
dry
finish
linger
hops
accent
the
breadiness
perfectly
its
a
true
american
lager
thank
heavens
for
new
belgium
overall
i
will
definitely
grab
more
of
this
class
expression
of
true
drinking
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
this
brewery
at
least
that
make
it
to
my
area
i
cant
do
their
flat
tire
too
sweet
too
beech
nut
tobaccoy
and
too
biscuity
and
could
really
use
some
hops
this
provides
one
reason
why
most
of
my
ratings
are
on
the
high
side
i
dont
like
to
drink
beer
that
i
dont
like
cheers
fellow
imbibers
o
overall
a
really
nice
lager
especially
to
be
had
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
grassy
straw
notes
and
a
bit
spicey
with
resined
lingering
bitterness
for
the
mouth
very
solid
beer
and
burger
beer
and
a
nice
drinker
at
cooler
temperatures
the
bright
tropical
fruit
notes
fade
a
bit
and
this
becomes
more
herbaceous
and
green
in
its
hop
character
but
that
sauvignon
blanc
like
grape
character
also
starts
to
come
out
which
wasnt
noticeable
previously
i
definitely
like
this
on
the
warm
side
of
cool
55f
or
a
bit
warmer
is
better
for
this
particular
beer
this
is
certainly
a
bit
atypical
for
a
lager
a
decent
session
lager
and
worth
going
through
every
once
in
a
while
pours
brilliant
gold
with
an
offwhite
twoinch
creamy
head
settling
to
a
1inch
pocketed
head
hops
and
cut
grass
in
the
nose
crisp
forwardness
with
a
light
malt
palate
fresh
bright
and
delectably
sharp
with
cereal
notes
corn
flakes
however
this
is
all
malt
my
palate
must
be
at
odds
with
reality
today
modest
carbonation
broad
belgian
lace
forms
it
is
very
nice
may
not
seek
it
again
but
would
not
decline
if
offered
shift
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
white
head
there
is
a
sweet
and
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
also
very
sweet
malty
and
almost
has
a
sugary
flavor
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
feel
but
too
sugary
overall
its
a
very
okay
beer
not
horrible
but
a
bit
too
sugary
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
nothing
about
it
is
particularly
special
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
o
the
most
interesting
pale
lager
ive
had
in
a
long
long
time
pours
a
yellowy
golden
with
a
off
white
head
a
hoppy
and
earthy
aroma
of
some
straw
some
grass
some
sweet
fruit
and
some
malt
taste
was
grainy
a
little
caramel
malt
fruity
and
grassy
mildly
bitter
a
active
but
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
probably
the
lone
beer
in
their
regular
lineup
i
like
even
if
this
isnt
the
most
well
constructed
beer
out
there
makes
for
a
nice
easy
drinking
summer
session
beer
and
as
a
sucker
for
just
about
anything
to
do
with
nelson
sauvin
hops
this
one
is
right
up
my
alley
o
as
it
opens
it
becomes
a
bit
bitey
and
dry
but
it
is
well
lagered
with
the
malt
a
little
soft
the
hops
come
through
and
grow
in
bitterness
more
than
flavor
but
some
woody
hop
notes
start
to
add
a
bit
of
depth
as
it
opens
i
have
not
been
a
big
fan
of
new
belgium
but
a
friend
suggested
i
try
this
one
i
am
glad
i
did
it
is
one
of
their
better
efforts
at
least
to
me
it
is
drinkable
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
o
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
for
the
style
and
also
easy
to
drink
o
easy
to
drink
and
pairs
well
with
most
foods
a
little
more
interesting
than
the
average
american
lager
as
there
is
a
light
to
moderate
presence
of
hops
beer
is
light
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
enough
carbonation
to
gently
foam
the
beer
completely
upon
the
palate
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
soft
foamy
and
somewhat
creamy
closes
mostly
dry
with
little
residual
stickiness
hanging
on
the
palate

overall
very
pretty

good
very

like
a

of
their
brews
like
a
band

every
song
in
the

key
overall
3
5
good
basic
beer
i
guess
the
shift
thing
is
new
belgiums
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
common
man
with
this
beer
while
i
find
that
condescending
and
a
bit
insulting
nonetheless
the
brew
itself
is
pretty
good
certainly
not
a
prizewinner
but
that
is
true
of
most
beer
coming
from
the
selfimportant
and
i
suppose
this
goes
hand
in
hand
wind
powered
brewery
atmosphere
is
very
nice
great
head
and
tons
of
lacing
plenty
of
persistent
effervescence
too
nose
is
bready
and
nutty
with
a
little
spice
very
wellbalance
and
pronounced
flavor
an
equally
wellbalanced
combination
of
bread
spice
and
some
punchy
hops
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
a
pretty
average
beer
that
has
a
few
things
going
for
it
its
a
reasonably
priced
beer
that
comes
in
a
can
cans
are
perfect
for
the
summer
and
it
has
just
enough
character
to
keep
things
interesting
perhaps
the
strangest
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
was
the
highlight
although
this
beer
is
uneventful
and
inoffensive
i
imagine
anyone
could
enjoy
this
on
a
warm
day
its
lager
and
perhaps
even
a
bit
adventurous
for
the
style
all
around
a
good
beer
and
i
know
later
this
summer
when
im
heading
to
the
river
i
will
grab
a
couple
of
these
overall
this
one
is
a
winner
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
in
the
summer
when
i
want
something
lighter
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
has
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
im
glad
i
only
picked
up
one
of
these
not
a
fan
and
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
not
a
style
i
visit
much
but
certainly
seems
like
a
good
representation
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
not
as
crisp
as
i
would
have
liked
the
lingering
yeast
notes
are
a
bit
of
a
distraction
as
well
overall
a
bit
muddled
and
would
like
more
lagerpils
notes
and
less
yeastesters
overall
a
favorite
of
mine
this
is
what
bmc
wish
they
could
have
been
a
refreshingly
dry
pale
lager
overall
overall
a
realy
good
drinkable
beer
like
i
can
pound
theese
all
day
wile
my
bmc
buddies
drink
there
light
lagers
lol
i
was
hopeing
for
a
lil
more
i
had
the
sam
adams
double
agent
yesterday
and
i
was
hopeing
for
something
close
but
this
was
way
diffren
a
lot
of
corn
taste
in
this
not
bad
at
all
just
hoped
for
a
lil
more
going
on

extremely
smooth

a
very
enjoyable

refreshing
offering
d
good

i
would
have
another
o
what
i
expected
a
drinkable
lager
which
is
a
good
substitute
for
those
crappy
light
lagers
you
are
looking
to
throw
back
on
particular
evenings
o
its
a
decent
brew
certainly
one
that
id
recommend
to
someone
looking

overall
i
have
been
on
a
bit
of
an
emotional
rollercoaster
with
this
beer
since
i
bought
a
four
pack
and
then
a
subsequent
case
6
x
4
pack
about
a
week
or
two
ago
the
first
sip
of
the
first
can
was
an
explosion
of
nelson
sauvin
hops
and
i
immediately
declared
this
beer
my
new
favorite
after
a
couple
more
cans
over
the
next
couple
of
days
i
was
fighting
to
detect
that
strong
nelson
sauvin
hoppiness
i
so
love
and
cherish
especially
in
a
beer
like
bulletproof
tiger
but
since
then
i
have
been
literally
pounding
this
beer
on
a
near
daily
basis
it
is
just
so
damn
drinkable
balanced
and
great
tasting
read
lots
of
flavor
for
a
low
abv
lager
if
not
delicious
very
satisfying
from
the
can
or
in
a
glass
this
could
possibly
be
my
session
daily
drinker
beer
for
life
when
sierra
nevada
summerfest
is
out
of
season
the
only
knock
is
the
somewhat
high
price
i
calculated
that
this
works
out
to
about
a
40
standard
case
as
opposed
to
30
for
summerfest
in
my
area
i
would
love
to
see
more
brewers
doing
more
with
nelson
sauvin
hops
my
new
favorite
hop
alongside
saaz
with
citra
running
a
close
third
i
love
seeing
breweries
come
out
with
a
fresh
flavorful
lager
for
a
change
lots
of
malt
character
in
this
one
adds
heart
to
the
brew
tasty
refreshing
and
highly
sessionable
comes
in
a
pack
of
4
cans
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
cans
looked
a
lot
like
red
bull
overall
a
super
tasty
session
ale
that
has
enough
hoppiness
to
please
the
hop
snob
like
myself
but
approachable
enough
for
those
of
you
not
buying
into
the
hop
craze
this
beer
tastes
about
the
same
pretty
average
i
suppose
for
a
pale
lager
im
just
glad
this
style
is
making
a
name
for
itself
compared
to
other
lagers
this
brew
is
a
bit
hoppier
its
a
good
thing
too
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
warm
weather
beers
or
just
a
beer
to
enjoy
and
not
be
too
serious
about
it
is
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
but
it
is
worth
trying
final
thoughts
not
bad
average
average
brew
but
nothing
too
interesting
i
think
they
were
going
for
a
session
beer
and
basically
accomplished
that
goal
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
i
did
not
enjoy
the
abundance
of
corn
that
i
was
tasting
it
wasnt
awful
but
it
wasnt
enjoyable
either
lackluster
beer
overall
there
are
many
better
pale
lagers
out
there
hell
id
probably
take
a
pbr
over
this
uninspired
and
blah
this
is
a
very
solid
lager
consistent
with
the
high
quality
and
drinkability
of
most
beers
from
new
belgium
o
very
solid
pale
lager
big
flavor
for
the
5
0
alcohol
this
is
a
must
try
and
ill
try
it
again
taste
is
spicypeppery
bit
with
hints
of
citrus
up
front
while
faint
yeasty
juiciness
and
faint
honey
breadiness
with
light
minerally
quality
join
later
it
has
lingering
light
pepperyspicy
bitterness
with
hints
of
resiny
citrus
rind
grapefruit
its
good
but
a
bit
thin
and
flat
in
character
and
a
bit
too
sharply
bitter
with
that
element
lingering
a
little
too
much
without
anything
else
o
every
american
pale
lager
made
by
the
big
three
should
be
embarrassed
that
they
dont
taste
like
this
beer
if
you
have
shied
away
from
the
pale
lager
style
due
to
the
abuse
it
has
received
try
this
to
be
pleasantly
surprised
not
a
bad
beer
overall
especially
for
a
lager
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
okay
im
normally
rather
unimpressed
with
new
belgiums
standard
offerings
but
this
is
pretty
good
this
is
what
a
pale
lager
should
be
o
glad
to
see
a
decent
solid
lager
from
these
guys
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
and
would
order
another
a
nice
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
im
glad
nb
is
now
in
mi
overall
a
tasty
easy
drinking
lager
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
who
likes
beer
sometimes
simpler
is
better
and
new
belgium
get
it
with
thier
shift
lager
its
a
golden
colored
beer
leaving
a
good
proportion
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
nofrills
but
does
the
job
bringing
floral
crackers
and
bread
to
the
mix
and
while
the
taste
may
also
be
nofrills
to
some
theres
something
about
the
way
this
beer
seduces
me
that
i
cant
help
but
like
its
taste
is
lead
by
honey
bready
and
floral
flavors
and
pair
that
with
the
flavors
having
harmony
with
one
another
it
wins
light
bodied
and
moderately
crisp
this
lager
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
without
boring
your
palate
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
slightly
varied
lager
that
still
fell
flat
but
got
a
unique
beer
thats
well
worth
the
price
overall
this
is
a
surprising
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
is
a
sessionable
hoppy
lager
and
though
this
one
was
reviewed
from
a
glass
i
can
attest
it
drinks
very
well
from
the
tallboy
can
overall
this
is
a
tasty
pale
lager
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
it
still
has
some
of
the
drawbacks
that
almost
all
in
the
style
have
and
just
wont
be
able
to
stand
up
to
the
broad
complexity
of
pale
ales
but
still
if
you
are
not
in
the
mood
for
to
much
body
and
want
something
to
wash
down
some
lunch
this
would
be
a
great
choice
shift
was
great
out
of
the
can
and
in
a
glass
and
the
name
is
quite
fitting
as
this
is
a
perfect
quenching
beer
to
throw
down
after
any
shift
outstanding
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
and
always
be
happy
flavorwise
this
is
definitely
an
easy
drinker
its
lightly
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
i
get
some
hints
of
the
hop
character
on
the
end
but
again
its
there
and
then
gone
this
beer
aint
half
badbut
next
one
i
have
will
be
to
finish
a
round
of
drinking
rather
than
the
one
that
gets
the
fresh
palates
attention
and
for
the
price
theres
better
options
definitely
not
my
stlye
of
beer
but
i
appreciate
this
one
a
lot
for
what
it
is
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
wheat
beer
color
with
an
active
white
head
that
lasts
a
few
minutes
before
fading
down
to
froth
it
smells
very
malty
without
much
hops
to
speak
of
the
flavor
is
distinctly
czech
as
far
at
the
malt
profile
goes
its
dry
and
biscuity
sturdy
for
such
a
light
brew
it
also
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
little
more
hops
than
the
nose
suggests
with
a
bittering
conclusion
mouthfeel
i
like
it
has
more
body
than
most
beers
from
this
genre
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
stays
bubbly
even
as
it
warms
although
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
quickly
refreshing
and
appropriate
in
any
season
this
is
a
pretty
decent
can
of
beer
although
i
liked
the
mothership
wit
that
it
replaced
a
lot
better
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
lager
new
belgium
seldom
disappoints
i
cant
wait
for
them
to
come
to
ohio
nice
and
easy
drinking
with
some
decent
light
wheat
and
hop
flavor
nb
does
it
again
o
i
enjoyed
it
a
nice
addition
to
the
already
great
beer
selection
we
enjoy
here
in
mi
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
a
slight
haze
and
soapy
ring
crisp
aromas
of
light
grainy
malt
floral
hops
and
white
wine
grapes
love
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
taste
is
similarly
crisp
with
mild
hops
light
malt
grass
orange
peel
and
grapes
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
yes
again
with
a
mediumthin
body
and
solid
carbonation
overall
a
lovely
session
beer
and
solid
addition
to
the
new
belgium
lineup

orange

lemon
green

in
the
nose
the
body
is
crisp
but
thins
out
on
the
finish
could
use
a
little
more
snap
to
it
nb
comes
through
with
big
bitter
hops
as
expected
they
couldnt
just
brew
a
simple
refreshing
lager
no
this
beer
is
like
a
mipa
mild
ipa
the
bitter
character
is
shortlived
though
and
theres
not
a
lot
else
here
its
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
other
than
the
oily
hops
this
was
decent
but
not
what
i
expected
canned
lager
great
that
craft
breweries
can
get
their
slice
of
the
pie
pricewise
id
pass
on
this
it
is
a
heavier
take
on
a
lager
with
a
good
balance
but
not
even
nbs
best
id
take
a
blue
paddle
over
this
any
day
session
beer
id
drink
more
if
if
it
was
a
little
less
expensive
m
medium
bodied
dry
finish
nice
session
beer
and
available
year
around
i
can
drink
this
without
hesitation
overall
i
liked
and
was
impressed
by
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
example
of
an
american
pale
lager
and
so
far
the
best
one
i
have
tried
it
had
really
good
drinkability
it
was
really
smooth
crisp
refreshing
and
the
flavors
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
taking
out
a
four
pack
on
a
nice
warm
summer
day
this
beer
is
pretty
much
the
definition
of
drinkable
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
how
nice
the
hop
aspect
to
this
beer
was
and
how
nicely
it
was
balanced
by
the
bread
malts
the
balance
is
really
impressive
and
the
drinkability
was
really
nice
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
would
want
to
change
with
this
beer
its
great
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
in
fact
i
already
got
two
more
four
packs
before
the
store
jacks
the
price
up
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
this
would
make
a
great
choice
for
someone
just
getting
into
craft
beer
all
in
all
i
was
flat
out
impressed
by
this
beer
and
it
could
be
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
ever
had
new
belgium
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
they
gave
the
people
what
they
wanted
a
lager
that
doesnt
suck
great
job
guys
this
beer
just
earned
a
spot
in
my
beer
fridge
bought
a
can
of
this
at
the
us
pro
cycling
challenge
before
i
realized
there
was
another
booth
with
ranger
cant
comment
on
the
appearance
since
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
can
so
ill
just
assume
and
rate
it
good
smell
is
sort
of
beery
typical
lager
smells
flavor
has
a
nice
grassiness
followed
by
malt
and
lager
yeast
this
must
have
been
pretty
fresh
honestly
though
i
would
never
but
this
beer
at
a
store
because
its
completely
overpriced
at
9
per
four
pack
this
needs
to
be
in
six
packs
of
12oz
cans
for
like
8
not
sure
why
anyone
in
colorado
would
ever
pick
this
up
over
ob
mamas
lil
pils
this
is
a
lightbodied
sessional
to
say
the
least
an
excellent
lawnmower
beer
worthy
of
several
pours
however
it
will
not
overwhelm
and
could
become
tiresome
after
a
few
still
a
pleasantly
drinkable
lager
and
one
worthy
after
a
hard
day
at
work
o
a
terrific
go
at
what
beer
can
be
to
those
folks
who
may
never
reach
for
a
barley
wine
or
an
imperial
stout
its
exactly
what
it
aims
to
be
a
tasty
beer
after
a
long
day
on
the
job
o
pretty
good
refrshing
and
easy
to
drink
down
o
good
beer
thats
really
all
i
can
say
after
the
first
taste
it
becomes
more
and
more
underwhelming
but
i
could
see
myself
session
this
for
a
while
this
is
a
pale
lager
that
id
liken
to
a
pale
ale
very
fruity
and
floral
altogether
quite
interesting
o
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
has
more
flavor
than
i
expected
it
to
have
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
a
solid
drinking
lager
it
has
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
it
has
the
same
drinkability
as
every
standard
beer
from
new
belgium
which
is
to
say
a
lot
clean
and
refreshing
shift
pale
ale
is
a
good
beer
the
beer
poured
golden
clear
with
frothy
white
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
smell
has
a
nice
malt
character
the
taste
includes
the
typical
new
belgium
belgium
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
with
good
carboantion
overall
i
like
it
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
nice
clean
lager
aroma
with
floral
hop
notes
and
a
hint
of
citrus
a
bit
of
yeast
and
bread
maybe
a
touch
of
biscuit
in
there
too
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
good
floral
notes
light
citrus
and
a
bit
of
grass
mild
yeast
and
esters
well
done
lager
o
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
a
good
alternative
to
macros
when
you
want
to
have
a
few
and
not
not
get
too
full
or
drunk
shift
is
as
i
reckon
it
was
intended
to
be
a
session
beer
when
you
want
something
simple
yet
interesting
that
you
can
consume
multiple
rounds
without
feeling
too
full
or
too
buzzed
pours
a
golden
yellow
lager
color
but
leaves
rings
of
suds
on
the
side
of
the
glass
unlike
the
typical
american
macros
the
aromas
are
my
favorite
part
chardonnaylike
tropical
fruit
from
the
nelson
hops
with
notes
of
lemon
peel
maybe
a
bit
of
crystal
malt
in
the
back
i
get
more
mango
as
the
beer
slides
over
the
palate
the
drawback
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
gives
this
beer
a
watery
feeling
still
i
like
it
and
would
definitely
bring
this
one
along
to
a
cans
only
venue
or
a
hiking
trip
added
bonus
the
blue
and
silver
can
looks
mighty
close
to
a
red
bull
can
this
might
make
for
a
good
street
sipper
or
road
beer
smooth
tangy
medium
body
slight
oily
very
soft
carbonation
o
passable
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
american
pale
ale
sort
of
taste
with
a
lager
body
nothing
special
though
pours
out
to
a
fluffy
everlasting
head
sexy
lacing
and
light
gold
color
aroma
is
grassy
and
spicy
hops
and
faint
grain
and
lemon
flavor
is
spicy
hops
with
lemon
coriander
and
pilsner
malt
in
the
backbone
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
rough
light
body
and
appropriate
co2
overall
another
beer
style
that
has
been
newbelgified
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
think
it
hit
most
of
the
notes
youd
want
from
a
pale
lager
definitely
worth
a
try
ultimately
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
beer
but
it
is
a
lot
better
than
many
lagers
around
it
was
an
easy
second
purchase
when
i
went
into
total
wine
and
saw
a
palate
of
4
packs
going
for
only
2
99
no
brainer
there
o
good
drinkability
though
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
or
so
pints
i
can
see
what
they
are
going
for
for
sure
but
i
would
like
this
to
be
a
bit
more
dry
crisp
and
a
little
less
sweet
shift
pale
lager
pours
a
crystal
clear
orange
with
some
tangerine
and
lemon
highlights
coming
through
theres
a
little
more
than
a
finger
of
white
foam
with
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
for
the
style
the
nose
is
a
bit
on
the
dull
side
but
there
is
some
soft
grainy
sweetness
apparent
along
with
a
light
aroma
of
melon
from
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
the
flavor
starts
of
similarly
with
lightly
bready
malt
notes
the
bitterness
that
flows
through
next
is
perceptible
but
just
barely
again
the
fruity
melon
finish
is
very
mild
the
craft
beer
hophead
in
me
wishes
is
was
a
bit
more
in
your
face

this
was
a
borderline
ipl
at
times
with
those
american
hops
really
adding
a

of
character
to
this
maybe
a
bit
too
much
though
as
this
got
really
herbal
feeling
as
things
warmed
up
i
recommend
having
at
this
one
while
its
still
fairly
cold
as
its
got
quite
a
flavorful
and
crisp
hop
bite
before
things
start

this

but
i
was
expecting
a

and
drinkable
for
a
long
night
or
day
im
sure
a
few
of
these
will
go
down
great
out
on
the
lake
or
chilling
this
summer
but
this
is
a
little
too
stripped
down
for
me
give
more
hops
or
malt
please
i
doubt
this
will
even
make
my
summer
canned
beer
rotation
this
year
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
love
the
hops
but
i
sure
feel
like
im
drinking
a

a
couple
drops

in

o
highly
drinkable
bonus
points
for
the
whole

thing
very

i
like
their
slogan
about
finishing
a
shift
at
work
and
popping
one
of
these

has
some

some

dried

a
crisp
finish
with
a
punch
of

very
drinkable
clean
lager
which
is
actually
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
during
work
there
isnt
a
ton
going
on
with
this
brew
but
it
would
be
great
for
sessioning
this
could
potentially
be
a
good
gateway
beer
from
bmc
heard
good
things
about
this
poured
from
can
to
pilsner
glass
the
beer
arrives
a
translucent
orange
copper
yellow
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
good
retention
and
good
lacing
the
nose
is
a
little
light
but
not
bad
consisting
of
a
light
floral
earthy
hop
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
flavor
improves
on
the
nose
with
a
light
but
pleasant
hop
earthy
flavor
and
mild
bitterness
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
and
light
pilsen
malt
finishes
crisp
and
clean
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
good
this
will
be
enjoyed
more
and
more
as
the
temperature
heats
up
all
in
all
its
not
all
that
bad
very
sessionable
and
for
its
style
its
something
id
reach
for
on
a
hot
day
if
it
were
lying
around
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
lemons
some
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
tart
citrus
some
hops
more
pale
ale
like
than
lager
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
lager
im
impressed
i
could
see
people
taking
this
good
canned
beer
on
camping
trips
etc
o
the
american
pale
lager
style
doesnt
lend
itself
to
complexity
and
this
beer
wont
win
any
prizes
for
that
however
its
an
easy
to
drinkable
likeable
beer
overall
this
is
essentially
a
helles
but
with
new
world
hops
surprisingly
i
enjoy
this
almost
as
much
as
surly
hell
i
also
think
that
other
than
the
lips
of
faith
series
this
is
the
best
standard
new
belgium
beer
along
with
belgo
very
happly
surprised
by
this
i
think
its
safe
to
say
nb
came
out
flat
on
this
overhyped
brew
if
they
tried
to
brew
a
bud
light
clone
using
a
slightly
different
recipe
well
they
succeeded
there
is
zero
complexity
to
this
brew
this
brew
never
quite
shifted
my
gear
to
become
recommendable
its
far
from
craft
and
closer
to
macro
drinks
great
from
a
can
and
very
poor
from
a
glass
give
me
an
avery
joes
this
is
a
really
solid
pale
lager
it
has
a
great
hop
character
and
great
balance
and
flavor
for
the
style
this
would
be
a
great
trade
off
for
the
usual
bmc
drinker
thanks
my
personal
bias
is
that
id
rather
see
someone
make
a
good
american
helles
instead
of
all
of
these
hopforward
lagers
featuring
unusual
hopping
to
me
this
is
an
ale
brewer
making
a
lager
and
as
a
result
you
get
similar
strengths
and
weaknesses
hop
heads
might
like
this
but
i
wonder
if
its
enough
to
satisfy
them
either
its
an
odd
one
but
who
knows
maybe
this
could
be
a
huge
conversion

does
what
it
says
but
it
reminds
me
of
eating
white
cake
flour
at
times
with
a
yeasty
bent
but
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
new
belgium
but
this
is
a
pretty
easy
going
and
enjoyable
brew
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
clear
medium
golden
with
a
a
thinner
white
head
that
didi
leave
a
few
broken
rings
of
lace
as
it
settled
caramel
sweetnesslightly
toasted
grainand
a
decent
shot
of
herbal
hops
in
the
back
end
caramel
induced
sweetness
upfront
on
the
palate
with
mild
grainy
notesand
again
a
shot
of
herballeafy
hops
in
the
finish
its
not
a
clean
lager
its
actually
a
little
sweet
but
the
hop
profile
is
niceabove
average
but
not
great
pours
light
amber
lots
of
white
billowed
foam
earthy
hops
and
reserved
amber
malts
nice
nose
for
a
session
imo
some
corn
pops
up
front
some
malts
and
some
hints
of
wood
meh
thin
bodied
and
hi
carb
as
expected
has
a
semi
dry
finish
i
would
say
this
is
great
for
80
degree
weather
honestly
not
that
bad
but
not
that
great
slightly
sweet
appearance
is
a
slightly
dark
golden
color
awesome
some
grassy
notes
cereal
some
hops
initial
tasting
slight
bitterness
not
much
sweetness
can
taste
some
hops
and
grain
carbonation
bubbles
on
the
tongue
very
easily
drinkable
could
put
back
the
whole
4
pk
of
pints
on
a
hot
day
off
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
light
crispy
pleasant
clean
fresh
tasting
very
light
lager
maybe
not
the
best
value
but
worth
a
try
if
you
want
to
mow
the
lawn
in
style
this
is
a
pretty
simple
review
for
a
simple
beer
but
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
perfect
for
a
hot
day
and
as
they
have
noted
perfect
for
after
a
shift
of
work
very
well
balanced
and
slightly
better
than
other
lagers
due
to
their
interesting
and
zesty
combination
of
hops
this
just
proves
that
even
the
simplest
of
styles
can
still
come
out
on
top
o
definitely
a
step
above
most
american
pale
lagers
if
this
were
in
the
same
price
range
as
bmc
this
would
have
gotten
5s
across
the
board
ah
well
you
get
what
you
pay
for
overall
a
good
lager
it
does
have
that
new
belgium
signature
burnt
sugar
trace
in
it
toasty
mlats
earthy
a
little
musty
hops
finish
is
toasty
and
a
little
tinny
and
earthy
hops
so
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
going
on
my
session
list
its
a
damn
good
beer
id
even
say
its
the
best
pale
lager
ive
ever
had
though
thats
probably
because
it
tastes
like
anything
but
if
taking
a
pedestrian
style
and
showing
what
it
can
achieve
with
the
proper
effort
was
their
aim
then
they
succeeded
and
i
only
have
one
suggestion
a
high
gravity
variant
called
overdrive
o
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
but
now
i
regret
that
i
have
3
more
in
the
fridge
i
cant
recommend
this
one
o
very
drinkable
smooth
and
creamy
pa
im
trying
to
figure
out
if
i
need
to
have
this
in
my
regular
rotation
once
the
weather
gets
more
predictable
at
8
something
a
4
pack
for
shift
schlitz
70s
formula
and
olympia
95
malt
are
about
as
good
though
different
and
a
lot
cheaper
o
a
tough
style
to
rate
may
not
be
the
best
beer
ever
but
within
the
pale
lager
category
this
one
is
excellent
this
is
definitely
a
summer
beer
that
has
good
flavor
and
is
still
light
and
refreshing
has
all
the
right
qualities
d
very
drinkable
a
solid
session
brew
its
light
in
feel
and
carbonated
id
have
it
again
on
certain
moods
or
if
its
really
hot
outside
excited
for
future
outdoor
events
of
all
kinds
but
mostly
praying
this
appears
at
the
ballpark
at
some
point
for
backpacking
ill
still
go
with
dales
pale
ale
for
a
smaller
size
but
cant
wait
to
bring
a
fourpack
of
these
to
my
next
carcamping
trip
all
3
5
overall
im
quite
conflicted
about
this
if
their
goal
was
the
ideal
tailgating
beer
they
hit
this
out
of
the
park
i
can
really
see
myself
taking
this
camping
grilling
tailgating
bike
rides
anytime
i
need
a
solid
beer
that
is
going
to
taste
good
for
several
cans
and
might
be
ok
if
it
warms
up
a
bit
on
the
other
hand
the
beer
didnt
really
impress
on
the
whole
scale
of
things
i
wish
they
could
have
shoved
a
bit
more
abv
into
it
or
made
it
a
bit
more
flavorful
overall
while
this
isnt
my
favourite
taste
to
find
in
a
beer
for
the
style
is
very
well
done
those
who
enjoy
strawhayherbal
flavours
mixed
with
noble
hops
will
surely
enjoy
o
an
exceptional
beer
that
you
must
try
well
done
new
belgium
o
hellooo
tailgating
beer
well
constructed
and
flavorful
shift
offers
a
simple
but
tasty
marriage
of
malt
and
hops
for
a
summer
beer
that
will
refresh
wonderfully
appealing
to
all
masses
the
triple
hops
brewed
crowd
will
shift
gears
with
this
great
gateway
beer
while
craft
drinkers
will
reach
for
its
clean
lager
characteristics
and
smooth
flavor
overall
the
beer
is
better
than
average
but
not
great
a
little
heavier
than
expected
but
nothing
that
makes
it
exceptional
served
from
can
into
a
new
belgium
globe
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
purewhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
fruit
metallic
and
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
fruit
metallic
citrus
hop
skunk
skunk
hop
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
while
the
flavor
on
this
one
was
quite
complex
as
far
as
things
going
on
it
just
didnt
fire
on
all
cylinders
for
my
palate
however
there
was
a
definite
metallic
characteristic
going
on
in
this
one
not
sure
if
it
was
a
part
of
the
brew
or
from
the
can
itself
but
this
wasnt
overly
appealing
worth
trying
if
you
are
curious
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
personally
oi
excellent
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
ive
had
if
macros
could
make
this
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
o
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
reminds
me
of
most
other
new
belgium
brews
i
e
better
than
average
but
nothing
world
class
quite
a
sessionable
beer
16
oz
although
i
dont
understand
tall
cans
i
would
rather
have
two
12
oz
cans
i
like
that
the
brew
is
5abv
though
hops
were
nice
but
not
present
enough
for
my
liking
probably
wont
be
returning
to
this
beer
unless
offered
for
free
as
i
feel
that
it
is
somewhat
easy
to
forget
i
also
dont
like
the
serving
type
does
this
mean
that
2013
will
be
year
of
the
lager
and
new
belgium
is
just
ahead
of
the
curve
on
this
one
the
did
get
it
right
with
opting
for
tallboy
size
and
at
5
0
it
is
still
within
the
sessionable
range
very
well
balanced
and
great
use
of
hops
here
which
makes
this
one
of
the
most
interesting
pale
lagers
on
the
market
today
anyone
rating
this
beer
poorly
clearly
missed
the
american
lager
labeling
on
the
bottle
this
is
supposed
to
take
like
a
macro
adjunct
and
i
think
its
a
fantastic
take
puts
yuengling
to
shame

not

i
think
this
is
geared

the
budweiser

in

as
such
it
succeeds
i
will
not
however
order
this
again
enjoyable
and
easy

those
not

this
was
an
interesting
beer
which
had
a
lot
of
complexity
going
on
lots
of
different
flavors
and
aromas
and
such
however
i
dont
really
know
if
it
all
meshed
together
great
it
wasnt
a
bad

just
seems
like
nothing

appearance

leaving

smells
like
an
american
lager
with
corn

taste
has
a
fuller
flavor
than
traditional
american
lagers
leaving
it
a
bit
smoother

this
was
originally
10

but
got
it
for
7
77
and
glad
i
did
what
makes
them
think
its
worth
10
99
i
dont
know
for
something
that
i
thought
would
be
terrible
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
nice
smooth
lager
from
guiness
overall
i
think
at
what
they
were
aiming
for
was
a
big
miss
but
i
love
yeasty
beers
so
im
gonna
give
this
one
a
thumbs
up
and
probably
buy
more
not
a
bland
lager
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
for
both
flavor
and
aroma
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
have
not
been
a
huge
fan
but
like
the
straw
ruby
color
crisp
aroma
from
the
mosaic
and
willamette
which
leaves
a
nice
bite
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
are
really
dry
giving
fresh
life
to
the
guiness
tradition
i
actually
think
this
tastes
like
an
upscale
version
of
pabst
which
can
also
have
this
pungent
bite
on
the
finish
a
lager
with
some
flavor
overall
this
is
interesting
enough
to
merit
a
try
probably
my
favorite
among
the
lager
family
it
definitely
has
a
crisp
taste
and
would
go
well
with
summer
weather
and
since
im
not
much
of
a
stout
guy
this
is
a
great
guiness
alternative
but
not
the
classic
worth
trying
just
for
the
heck
of
it
how
can
anyone
say
this
taste
good
the
beer
taste
like
chalk
with
some
sort
of
flavor
just
disgusting
no
doubt
about
that
obviously
i
dont
like
it
ill
stick
to
my
foreign
extra
stout
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
good
great
beer
to
be
honest
aftertaste
is
identical
to
semi
sweet
iced
tea
with
lemon
not
a
bad
drink
after
popping
the
discovery
series
cap
it
pours
in
to
a
proper
guinness
pint
glass
forming
a
2finger
head
of
cream
colored
foam
the
beer
has
a
striking
goldenorange
hue
with
impressive
clarity
fantastic
staying
power
on
the
lumpy
sudsy
foam
pale
malts
biscuit
and
light
citric
hop
scents
greet
the
nose
hints
of
berry
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
buttery
diacetyl
are
also
present
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
odd
surprising
its
a
strange
blend
of
malty
cracker
goodness
with
a
bizarre
unique
quality
perhaps
from
their
traditional
guinness
yeast
strain
its
a
little
funky
but
compelling
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
with
a
faint
lemon
citrus
and
traces
of
earthy
minty
hops
somewhat
incongruous
but
distinct
the
body
of
the
beer
is
moderate
with
assertive
carbonation
that
lends
a
creamy
effect
this
one
is
a
bit
of
an
enigma
its
like
stripping
a
guinness
stout
to
the
bones
to
accentuate
the
unique
flavors
that
the
yeast
imparts
i
found
this
one
oddly
appealing
the
mosaic
hops
certainly
shine
through
in
the
aroma
the
combination
of
mosaic
and
willamette
hops
also
give
this
beer
a
strong
finishing
bitterness
the
malt
character
is
pretty
subdued
although
one
can
readily
detect
some
nice
toasted
grain
flavors
perhaps
a
bit
too
dry
in
some
respects
but
not
a
bad
choice
if
one
wants
to
take
a
walk
down
the
lager
pathway
ive
always
hated
guinness
i
was
in
a
kroger
so
there
werent
a
lot
of
options
for
good
beer
so
i
decided
id
give
this
a
try
because
i
was
in
the
mood
for
just
a
drinkable
lager
when
i
poured
it
there
was
virtually
no
head
on
the
beer
however
when
i
took
a
swig
i
was
extremely
surprised
carbonation
is
great
it
basically
tastes
like
a
decent
nondescript
lager
just
your
normal
caramellymalty
taste
for
a
drinkable
beer
that
you
can
sit
there
and
enjoy
a
6pack
its
great
mouth
feel
is
exactly
what
i
want
nice
and
crisp
with
very
little
aftertaste
pours

that
recedes
to

leaving
only
a

producing

a

mouthfeel

moderate

crisp
clean
smooth
very
standard
lager
nothing
amazing
or
unique
exactly
what
youd
expect
from
guiness
attempt
at
an
american
beer
the
way
an
american
beer
should
be
brewed
not
that
good
front
taste
is
not
there
after
taste
not
horrible
but
not
good
very
enjoyable
pale
lager
with
super
smooth
drinkability
i
actually
enjoy
this
more
than
their
stout
although
the
appearance
aroma
scores
wont
contribute
to
giving
this
a
higher
score
than
its
worth
good
lite
summer
on
the
deck
drinkable
brew
not
a
regular
in
my
frig
its
alright
to
me
could
drink
it
again
its
crisp
but
too
fluffy
definitely
a
little
too
much
spritz
to
the
light
body
it
could
use
a
little
cleaning
up
in
the
finish
too
not
bad
though
its
an
okay
brew
nice
head
of
about
onehalf
inch
that
dissipates
slowly
the
taste
is
rather
full
bodied
and
very
drinkable
to
me
overall
i
might
buy
another
six
pack
from
time
to
time
if
it
was
cheaper
i
might
actually
make
it
my
lawnmower
beer
no
wow
factor
but
easy
to
drink
had
it
on
tap
which
may
have
helped
it
recommended
by
a
friend
not
too
shabby
personally
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
smooth
and
creamy
with
that
slight
distinct
guinness
taste
very
bready
undertones
overall
pretty
drinkable
and
theres
none
of
the
lingering
chemical
aftertaste
that
you
might
expect
of
a
lager
made
by
a
giant
brewery
i
could
see
putting
down
a
lot
of
these
in
the
right
setting
good
tasting
beer
went
down
smooth
something
different
from
my
normal
intake
of
ipas
id
buy
it
again
very
enjoyable
and
a
huge
surprise

you
pick

in

it

guinness

did
a
nice

i
would
buy
this

again
just
as
awful
as
the
black
lager
no
taste
no
smell
absolutely
dreadful
you
know
i
was
quite
impressed
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
wasnt
bad
at
all
pretty
spicy
as
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
adjuncts
of
course
but
there
are
better
american
lagers
available
waste
of
time
and
effort
guinness
blond
was
a
surprising
beer
i
expected
something
much
lighter
good
color
and
pretty
good
flavor
not
a
bad
attempt
at
trying
to
make
a
good
american
lager
exceptionaly
drinkable
very
smooth
and
light
not
bad
for
first
try
just
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
lager
not
impressed
with
this
attempt
at
an
american
brew
this
one
wasnt
much
more
than
an
average
low
end
beer
that
we
already
get
in
america
in
fact
it
was
disappointing
that
it
is
part
of
the
guinness
family
of
beers
had
to
try
it
at
least
once
and
once
was
enough
for
me
just
an
incredibly
boring
offering
not
sure
why
this
was
necessary
boring
mixed
this
in
with
a
brewmaster
six
pack
last
of
the
six
tried
sucked
wouldnt
buy
again
zero
lacing
minimal
head
no
flavor
or
scent
meh
at
best
kind
of
meh
overall
drinkable
not
terrible
not
great
not
much
aroma
or
flavor
but
no
real
off
notes
either
light
dry
finish
an
american
style
lager
more
than
a
blonde
no
bitterness
no
lacing
on
the
glass
and
very
little
taste
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
drink
to
get
drunk
with
when
playing
drinking
games
or
something
not
a
beer
you
enjoy
had
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
while
out
of
more
curiosity
than
anything
i
shouldve
left
it
on
the
shelf
ill
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
if
its
given
to
me
but
i
doubt
if
i
buy
it
again
ill
take
harp
or
newcastle
over
blonde
mixed
six
christmas
gift
from
uncle
mike
very
smooth
very
drinkable
this
could
be
a
very
refreshing
summer
time
beer
o
good
mid
range
blonde
not
my
favorite
but
not
my
least
favorite
either
light
enough
to
be
able
to
drink
several
of
these
at
a
time
3
55
this
was
a
disappointing
take
on
a
larger
from
guiness
there
was
really
no
head
or
flavor
ive
had
better
mouth
feel
from
light
beers
just
not
a
good
beer
looked
forward
to
trying
this
highly
disappointed
looks
like
a
decent
lager
but
the
smell
was
very
foul
puke
like
for
lack
of
a
better
description
tastes
a
bit
better
than
it
smells
thankfullyfruit
like
sweetness
with
a
thick
sticky
mouthfeel
halfway
through
there
is
no
head
at
all
and
it
looks
like
apple
juice
it
does
finish
ok
crisp
with
a
touch
op
hops
overall
this
isnt
that
good
at
all
and
this
will
be
my
first
and
last
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
nothing
stood
just
real
grainygrassy
with
a
minor
sour
aftertaste
sulfer
smell
but
otherwise
a
great
beer
no
smell
of
a
bad
adjunct
it
is
a
awesome
larger
very
good
taste
smell
and
look
very
drinkable
smooth
without
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
mosaic
my
reason
for
the
low
score
is
mainly
due
to
the
marketing
ploy
claiming
this
beer
is
hopped
up
with
mosaic
and
willamette
it
tastes
like
an
average
adjunct
for
the
price
of
quality
craft
if
im
in
the
mood
for
an
average
lager
ill
grab
a
12
pack
of
bud
for
the
price
of
this
6
disappointing
poured
a
nice
blonde
could
just
taste
the
hops
just
could
be
a
littler
hoppier
crisp
with
some
back
bite
overall
i
could
drink
several
of
these
at
one
go
overall
a
pretty
standard
lager
overall
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
but
by
no
means
a
flavor
powerhouse
just
a
decent
brew
overall
overall
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
its
just
a
mess
on
the
other
hand
guinness
stout
is
a
mess
as
well
but
weve
learned
to
love
its
quirkiness
shifting
gears
given
the
sweetness
of
it
and
the
implied
caramel
that
it
has
i
fear
that
this
might
be
intended
to
go
up
against
yuenglings
traditional
lager
well
im
not
a
fan
but
id
take
that
over
this
any
day
of
the
year
thumbs
down
pours
a
nice
light
amberrich
golden
color
has
a
strange
sour
or
hopp
aroma
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
and
it
slightly
affects
taste
i
like
the
dry
hippy
finish
though
i
like
it
about
what
i
expected
and
maybe
a
little
more
they
should
figure
that
smell
out
though
interesting
beer
has
all
the
appearance
of
a
good
american
lager
tastes
bad
and
smells
even
worse
has
a
sour
taste
and
smell
i
would
put
it
below
a
pbr
really
now
i
have
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
the
other
five
in
my
fridge
i
thought
this
beer
was
terrible
sour
off
taste
that
was
just
not
good
i
will
not
ever
buy
this
beer
again
thats
for
sure
the
beer
poured
a
nice
head
and
was
frothy
but
the
head
dropped
really
fast
beer
smelled
sour
also
a
horrible
product
from
guinness
this
beer
is
what
i
expected
it
to
be
was
impressed
with
the
look
of
the
beer
but
the
aroma
is
not
pleasant
taste
was
ok
better
than
a
bud
or
coors
but
barely
the
two
finger
head
calms
down
to
a
film
of
foam
that
retains
through
the
glass
the
color
is
sunset
yellow
or
golden
grainy
with
floral
and
savory
hop
character
and
a
lightly
bitter
finish
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
tarnished
gold
with
a
white
12
finger
head
plenty
of
nice
carbonation
with
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
predominantly
sweet
with
fruity
sour
belgian
yeast
a
hint
of
banana
bread
and
grass
nicely
crisp
up
front
with
the
american
hops
providing
a
short
burst
before
yielding
to
more
belgian
sweetness
thats
pretty
much
all
there
is
to
speak
of
as
the
beer
takes
on
a
very
standard
lager
personality
with
a
semidry
finish
im
not
a
lager
aficionado
but
this
is
definitely
drinkable
and
certainly
not
offensive
i
would
say
that
it
is
superior
to
full
sail
session
lager
and
also
to
budweiser
overall
an
ok
beer
but
the
black
lager
is
better
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
an
average
forgettable
beer
this
is
what
you
give
to
people
who
like
bud
and
miller
but
want
to
act
like
they
are
drinking
something
special
without
actually
having
to
do
so
very
pedestrian
overall
a
decent
take
on
an
american
style
light
lager
nice
notes
of
biscuit
and
caramel
i
expected
to
find
the
classic
guinness
in
there
somewhere
but
no
thinking
nope
nothing
still
it
was
definitely
unique
and
enjoyable
enough
refreshingly
crisp
mainly
bitter
with
a
faint
tail
of
hops
ive
found
it
to
be
quite
nice
when
paired
with
spicy
foods
tart
lager
clear
clean
finish
i
feel
like
blonde
ales
are
usual
nonoffensive
beers
with
not
much
going
on
holds
true
to
this
one
easy
to
drink
non
offensive
but
probably
wont
knock
your
socks
off
i
could
see
this
being
the
best
option
at
a
place
with
a
subpar
beer
list
glad
i
tried
it
so
i
know
its
a
good
option
different
than
what
ive
had
taste
is
in
the
name
guinness
but
blonde
tastes
a
lot
like
budweiser
but
with
a
chemical
backend
taste
thats
not
so
pleasant
drank
one
and
gave
the
rest
away
great
beer
its
a
bit
fruity
and
slightly
hoppy
but
i
honestly
forgot
what
it
tastes
like
since
i
had
some
tuna
half
way
through
the
drink
notes
no
bottling
date
serving
type
bottle
balanced
hoppy
lager
great
on
draught
i
was
drawn
by
the
sale
price
and
the
fact
they
advertised
a
lager
with
mosaic
and
willamette
hops
pours
a
light
coppery
tone
with
a
persistent
white
head
very
long
retention
on
that
part
aroma
is
fruity
much
more
in
line
with
british
pale
ale
with
notes
of
toffee
and
cereal
grains
not
very
lagerlike
to
me
the
bottle
mentions
they
use
guinness
ale
yeast
so
is
it
even
lagered
ive
had
singlehop
mosaic
beers
before
and
i
dont
remember
these
characteristics
mid
palate
is
syrupy
and
then
finishes
with
a
bitter
quality
that
does
not
mesh
with
the
attack
all
in
all
much
more
of
a
blonde
ale
than
an
american
pale
lager
regret
the
six
pack
as
im
not
really
drawn
to
this
one
ive
had
worse
but
i
dont
want
to
drink
another
overall
a
very
good
lager
not
outstanding
but
nothing
bad
about
it
either
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
not
a
big
winner
here
guiness
should
stick
to
what
they
know
best
irish
stouts
and
draught
not
american
lagers
i
had
one
and
wouldnt
recomend
it
to
anyone
if
this
is
no
1
in
the
discovery
series
they
need
to
step
up
a
bit
closer
to
the
plate
for
the
next
one
1st
one
great
second
one
tasted
like
yeasty
straw
with
a
vanilla
aftertaste
i
think
shiner
makes
a
better
product
from
tx
btw
red
stripe
is
brewed
in
latrobe
too
shame
on
arnie
overall
it
lacks
a
good
aroma
and
a
balanced
flavor
profile
tried
it
once
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
good
to
sip
on
tastepale
malt
subtle
fruity
hop
note
quaffable
decent
lager
offering
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
it
definitely
is
a
gorgeous
looking
beer
in
the
pint
glass
a
perfect
dark
golden
color
that
is
so
appealing
to
the
eyes
it
had
a
better
than
average
scent
not
your
typical
lager
smell
feelwise
was
good
as
well
not
too
carbonated
i
enjoyed
the
rich
more
flavorful
i
e
not
so
watery
tasting
lager
overall
i
found
this
to
be
your
better
than
average
lager
a
great
offering
from
guinness
clear
golden
color
with
a
tight
white
head
very
grainybready
aroma
oh
god
but
the
taste
is
putrid
a
little
like
sour
dough
with
a
splash
of
misused
hops
gives
off
this
clashing
of
american
citric
bite
and
acidity
drinkable
but
not
good
at
all
after
taste
is
has
some
mild
pleasantness
with
some
lingering
fruity
hop
flavor
and
bread
crust
but
the
two
dont
sync
up
at
any
point
just
an
ok
everyday
drinking
beer
tastes
more
like
a
honey
amber
ale
than
a
crisp
american
lager
overall
if
anyone
out
there
likes
this
and
wants
a
few
free
beers
hit
me
up
this
will
be
in
my
fridge
for
a
long
time
and
not
in
a
good
way
o
doesnt
feel
or
taste
like
a
lager
seems
like
it
is
an
ale
in
construction
there
is
nothing
very
exciting
about
this
beer
and
the
bodymouthfeel
is
a
touch
too
much
for
the
style
i
wish
there
was
a
slightly
more
pronounced
hop
flavor
and
aroma
and
a
cleaner
mouthfeel
typical
lager
taste
with
a
curious
after
funk
do
not
want
to
have
again
horrible
as
good
as
guinness
has
been
on
their
other
beers
they
went
horribly
wrong
with
this
it
almost
has
no
taste
and
what
taste
it
has
is
horrible
i
will
never
drink
this
again
pours
with
a
thin
sticky
head
almost
insignificant
aroma
is
faint
mostly
grain
with
little
to
no
hops
taste
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
it
lacks
the
crispness
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
lager
hops
are
really
subdued
as
the
flavor
is
mostly
grain
with
a
honey
like
sweetness
doesnt
live
up
to
all
the
hype
that
guinness
has
been
giving
this
brew
my
curiosity
has
been
satisfied
and
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
theres
much
better
lagers
out
there
full
disclosure
i
tried
one
of
the
taste
batches
for
this
beer
it
was
a
lot
more
drinkable
and
a
lot
cleaner
with
more
of
a
pronounced
mosaic
hop
flavor
this
simply
tastes
like
an
amber
ale
with
a
smidgen
of
hop
flavor
does
not
come
across
well
at
all
imo
bring
this
one
back
to
the
drawning
board
the
potential
is
there
was
there
and
they
should
not
be
afraid
to
make
a
bold
statement
in
the
us
market
tasted
similar
to
an
ipa
not
iimpressed
i
wont
buy
another
i
would
not
have
pegged
this
for
a
lager
at
all
more
like
a
light
saison
but
very
crisp
rjt
this
beer
is
almost
interesting
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
does
not
trail
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
faint
the
taste
was
mostly
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
on
the
end
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
and
found
the
beer
to
be
bland
and
forgettable
o
nothing
about
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
try
it
again
overall
whats
the
point
of
a
discovery
series
this
bad
for
the
record
i
love
well
made
lagers
the
bartender
said
its
called
an
american
blonde
lager
because
they
decided
to
use
american
malts
and
hops
even
though
they
kept
their
european
lager
yeast
its
de4cent
overall
i
enjoyed
and
would
recommend
this
quality
lager
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
honey
some
grains
taste
is
clean
malts
some
honey
sweetness
a
bit
of
grains
highly
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
smooth
session
beer
overall
guinness
took
a
decent
shot
at
the
american
lager
style
they
could
have
done
better
but
also
a
lot
worse
the
inclusion
of
mosaic
hops
was
interesting
and
adds
a
unique
spin
on
the
beer
that
isnt
too
gimmicky
guinness
blonde
is
at
least
worth
a
try
with
that
said
there
are
other
american
lagers
i
would
prefer
in
this
price
range
this
is
an
enjoyable
easydrinking
brew
within
style
its
a
good
beer
go
figure
guinness
makes
a
blonde
american
lager
so
many
things
wrong
with
that
if
you
are
a
traditionalist
but
i
guess
they
need
something
to
compete
with
the
other
macros
and
crappy
imports
read
heineken
and
stella
the
packaging
says
there
is
mosaic
hops
in
here
which
really
has
me
curious
didnt
know
supply
andprice
point
worked
for
such
a
big
brand
with
that
varietal
but
apparently
it
does
not
much
of
that
new
zealand
fruitiness
to
the
hops
though
i
can
only
barley
get
the
mosaic
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
a
shade
darker
than
its
new
rivals
not
yellow
but
brassy
golden
and
it
has
a
lot
of
body
too
compared
to
those
which
makes
it
better
than
them
for
me
its
got
some
hops
in
the
finish
but
mostly
bitterness
and
a
salted
buttery
cracker
malt
base
that
actually
tastes
like
something
other
than
adjuncts
frothy
feel
too
with
expressive
carbonation
and
a
longer
finish
in
the
context
of
what
its
competing
against
i
think
its
a
great
success
actually
in
the
context
of
craft
lager
though
no
its
not
real
great
for
a
macro
i
think
it
has
every
reason
to
do
well
i
was
expecting
this
to
suck
but
its
surprisingly
very
good
solid
malt
character
cant
detect
any
adjuncts
leafy
hop
character
excellent
balance
light
to
medium
body
very
well
carbonated
crisp
finish
drinks
exactly
to
way
any
quality
lager
should
well
done
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
several
choices
better
than
this
beer
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
thirst
quenching
and
easily
enjoyed
over
and
over
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
showed
an
awesome
2
finger
dense
snow
white
head
sitting
atop
a
beautiful
copper
golden
clear
brew
sweet
malt
smell
hits
the
nose
and
is
followed
in
the
taste
very
well
what
starts
out
with
malty
sweetness
and
a
smooth
and
refreshing
middle
ends
with
a
slight
and
welcomed
bitter
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
that
supports
the
style
and
is
a
solid
brew
overall
i
for
one
like
to
explore
all
the
styles
and
new
offerings
with
an
open
mind
and
wont
be
swayed
by
the
popular
vote
i
like
what
i
like
and
rate
it
as
how
true
to
the
style
a
beer
is
and
my
take
on
the
taste
of
the
beer
as
true
as
i
can
be
this
is
a
winner
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
sweet
bready
caramel
malt
aromas
with
a
fleeting
hint
of
floral
hops
bready
caramel
faint
spicy
hop
flavor
meh
not
bad
i
could
take
it
of
leave
it
o
i
dont
know
took
me
a
bit
to
peg
it
but
going
sheerly
on
faint
memories
this
tastes
like
a
fairly
bitterer
lions
head
lager
did
they
bitter
with
mosaic
here
what
exactly
were
they
going
for
rich
and
delicious
does
not
adequately
describe
this
id
honestly
each
and
every
time
prefer
pbr
or
piels
over
this
o
i
was
hoping
the
mosaic
hops
were
going
to
shine
through
more
so
that
was
a
bit
disappointing
it
did
meet
expectations
however
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
particular
one
again
but
i
do
plan
on
trying
all
of
the
beers
from
the
discovery
series

the
flavor
is

a
hint
of
tropical

and
a
mix
of
very
slight
heat
and
tart
in
the
finish
pours
a
pretty
amber
in
color
with
about
a
12
finger
of
a
offwhite
thick
creamy
head
that
settles
down
fairly
quick
to
just
a
very
thin
layering
mostly
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
of
hops
and
yeast
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
more
complex
with
some
light
fruit
in
there
as
well
really
didnt
go
down
all
that
easy
and
there
was
a
bitter

that
lasted

it
could
have
sucked
but
it
just
doesnt
pretty
much
meh
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
on
this
one
its
nice
to
see
them
trying
something
new
here
but
it
compromises
too
much
thin
light
unimpressive
rushed
aroma
on
the
nose
like
a
cheap
lager
flavor
is
flatchested
mouthfeel
is
open
and
drinkable
perhaps
the
best
feature
its
a
beautiful
copper
colored
beer
with
that
classic
foamy
meringue
colored
head
when
i
stick
my
nose
in
it
i
get
sweet
aromas
and
fruity
ones
such
as
pear
i
take
a
sip
and
sweet
malts
play
their
part
with
that
fruity
pear
taste
in
the
finish
as
well
as
some
grassy
notes
it
goes
down
the
hatch
like
a
cheap
adjunct
watery
im
neither
offended
or
impressed
by
this
keep
in
mind
i
reviewed
this
after
drinking
a
ten
fidy
so
i
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
beer
with
a
clean
palate
ha
no
head
a
little
dark
for
a
pale
ale
nice
bit
of
honey
flavor
otherwise
fairly
plain
not
totally
unenjoyable
but
pretty
simple
stuff
the
beer
is
fucking
garbage
theres
your
outlier
reasoning
im
not
sure
why
it
has
all
the
poorer
reviews
maybe
i
just
got
a
really
fresh
batch
if
you
like
light
pilsners
and
you
are
in
florida
id
say
give
it
a
chance
hope
you
agree
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
a
little
to
over
the
top
flavor
wise
for
me
overall
bragg
or
pilsner
this
beer
personally
wasnt
for
me
correction
orange
blossom
pilsner
is
a
5
5
abv
beer
not
6
5
like
listed
god
for
very
hot
weather
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
tourist
beer
for
something
th
really
reflects
interior
florida
without
bittiness
ladies
who
i
have
shared
it
with
who
are
not
normally
beer
drinkers
are
fond
of
it
an
ok
beer
no
off
flavors
but
not
overly
flavorful
refreshing
and
remember
if
youre
gonna
drink
dont
drive
but
if
you
have
to
drive
then
do
us
all
a
favor
and
dont
drink
o
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
there
are
so
many
better
lagers
for
the
same
price
the
flavor
is
very
minimalistic
you
get
a
decent
amount
of
funk
in
there
you
also
get
some
very
plain
pilsner
presence
there
is
nothing
exceptional
going
on
here
this
looked
different
and
i
wanted
to
try
more
local
florida
beers
i
wasnt
sure
if
id
like
a
fruit
beer
but
this
one
surprised
me
it
wasnt
overly
fruity
at
all
the
honey
taste
is
there
but
its
very
subtle
and
compliments
the
rest
of
the
beer
nicely
its
a
darker
beer
and
had
a
nice
slightly
heavy
after
taste
worth
a
try
o
a
very
interesting
beer
with
an
almost
perfumelike
smell
to
it
a
little
too
sweet
and
orange
for
me
i
had
to
try
it
since
i
was
in
fl
and
it
was
a
local
beer
but
it
seemed
a
little
bit
kitschy
to
me
felt
more
like
something
from
a
bmc
company
than
a
craft
brewery
im
a
sucker
for
something
different
and
i
thought
thats
what
i
was
going
to
get
here
pours
and
looks
like
a
macro
not
a
watery
macro
but
more
along
the
lines
of
coors
banquet
real
strong
taste
of
honey
upfront
i
could
even
taste
some
light
green
tea
like
flavors
think
a
cup
of
ice
green
tea
with
three
teaspoons
of
honey
i
was
feeling
it
but
after
awhile
it
got
a
little
cloying
which
contradicts
the
fact
that
it
has
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
either
i
would
try
it
again
on
a
hot
day
or
even
if
i
had
a
sore
throat
because
the
honey
in
this
beer
would
probably
soothe
it
id
like
to
make
a
note
that
the
abv
on
this
beer
isnt
6
5
unless
they
changed
it
because
it
states
its
5
5
on
the
label
of
the
bottle
i
had
this
is
quaffable
beer
but
its
not
all
that
good
flavors
are
weak
and
at
times
smack
of
a
macro
lager
poured
a
filtered
pale
orange
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
on
the
initial
pour
which
fades
to
a
light
film
and
a
thicker
collar
no
lace
nose
has
some
light
grass
a
general
stinkiness
about
it
orange
and
a
touch
of
some
honeylike
sweetness
some
sharper
macrolike
grainiess
taste
has
some
plain
pale
malts
with
a
slight
nod
to
the
orange
again
more
grain
and
adjunct
in
the
finish
medium
high
carbonation
a
little
rough
throughout
light
body
and
difficult
to
choke
back
at
times
not
horrible
but
something
i
can
imagine
being
a
little
more
desirable
in
the
hot
florida
setting
high
drinkability
if
you
like
the
basic
lager
taste
but
a
bit
dull
to
average
in
flavor
overall
seems
like
the
brewers
are
new
to
making
beer
as
this
was
all
over
the
place
and
not
even
close
to
a
fruit
beer
o
the
nose
is
by
far
the
best
part
of
this
mediocre
beer
i
wanted
to
like
this
more
because
of
the
nose
wanted
to
try
this
one
because
i
love
orange
blossom
honey
but
this
beer
doesnt
warrant
a
full
review
clear
pale
with
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
like
macro
corn
later
and
tastes
like
pbr
no
honey
character
to
speak
of
either
fail
its
a
marketing
gimmick
aimed
at
tourists
o
not
the
most
pleasant
drinking
experience
but
ive
certainly
had
worse
o
pass
there
are
better
brews
out
there
to
spend
your
money
on
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
at
daytona
pig
pit
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
two
finger
head
of
thin
foamy
bubbles
that
quickly
recede
to
a
white
film
malt
and
grain
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
orange
esssence
the
beer
has
pale
and
sour
malt
flavors
with
sweet
orange
undertones
that
balance
but
dont
overpower
crisp
and
light
you
get
a
sense
of
the
honey
sweet
in
the
body
and
the
finish
very
mild
sweet
aftertaste
makes
a
very
easy
quaffer
on
a
hot
day
d
it
is
refreshing
and
would
be
enjoyable
on
the
beach
nothing
wrong
with
this
but
nothing
really
right
either
the
extreme
orange
and
honey
sweetness
may
limit
this
ones
drinkability
overall
not
really
my
kind
of
thing
its
decent
for
noncraft
drinkers
but
not
my
thing
cheers
mouthfeel
was
good
very
light
bodied
the
sweetness
is
the
only
thing
that
would
hold
you
back
from
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
d
very
drinkable
but
on
the
sweet
side
d
whats
with
all
the
bad
reviews
i
found
this
to
be
highly
gulpable
and
a
guilty
pleasure
as
has
been
said
this
doesnt
resemble
a
pilsner
in
any
meaningful
way
the
base
is
an
unremarkable
pale
lager
this
just
isnt
a
very
good
beer
not
worth
seeking
out
had
to
try
this
at
a
bar
when
i
was
in
fl
it
looks
ok
it
a
pils
color
clear
with
a
small
white
head
smell
was
biscuit
with
honey
and
bread
taste
was
a
attempt
at
a
pils
with
honey
infused
its
average
it
almost
like
bmc
said
lets
make
a
pils
and
failed
mouth
feel
has
some
carbonation
but
its
dish
water
feel
with
infused
honey
saw
it
on
the
bottle
list
at
the
bar
but
really
not
worth
a
try
i
was
pouring
this
as
part
of
a
beer
tasting
at
the
liquor
store
i
work
at
poured
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
smallish
head
smell
was
faint
citrus
and
a
little
burnt
honey
taste
was
flat
and
thin
with
a
twang
of
orange
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
honey
finish
carbonation
was
mild
with
no
desire
for
another
drinkability
is
low
too
sweet
and
just
plain
doesnt
taste
good
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
if
you
like
this
you
need
help
d
eh
not
much
here
i
would
not
suggest
even
for
someone
looking
for
a
honey
beer
because
there
is
none
to
be
found
still
this
is
a
light
beer
and
maybe
some
could
put
down
a
few
i
find
it
hard
to
conceive
for
myself
due
to
lack
of
taste
i
guess
the
brewer
has
a
very
broad
definition
for
pilsner
put
this
up
against
your
typical
english
golden
ale
and
you
would
not
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
looks
like
someone
is
trying
to
pull
the
wool
over
the
consumers
eyes
with
lingo
and
talk
of
honey
give
this
beer
a
pass
pass
better
than
i
expected
as
nothing
was
bad
attractive
amber
hue
with
brilliant
and
frothy
head
which
dissipated
almost
entirely
within
a
minute
or
two
faint
aromas
of
candied
citrus
but
not
much
else
a
bit
washed
out
on
the
palette
but
otherwise
pleasant
and
inoffensive
clean
and
tangy
on
the
back
which
is
perhaps
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
that
it
washes
away
nicely
and
is
refreshing
you
could
do
worse
than
that
aroma
is
malty
and
rather
typical
but
the
undertone
of
honey
sweetness
adds
something
it
pours
an
uninspiring
clear
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
flavor
is
decent
malty
and
somewhat
sweet
enjoyable
if
not
outstanding
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
tingly
d
not
bad
bot
not
tasty
either
gimmicky
beer
why
is
floridas
honey
beer
made
in
south
carolina
overall
i
relearned
the
fact
that
curiousity
kills
the
cat
this
one
really
isnt
worth
checking
out
drinkability
goes
down
very
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
and
if
the
alcohol
were
a
little
lower
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
unfortunately
the
orange
and
the
honey
just
dont
come
through
and
without
those
flavors
its
just
an
average
pilsner
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
pale

yeast
grain
slight
hops
and
some
citrus
orange
does
not
seem
fit
the
style
of
a
herbedspiced

mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average

level
tastes
of

pale

slight

slight

faint

and
very
slight

overall
the
herbspice
is
supposed
to
be
honey
i
guess
but
its
flavor
is
not
preceptable
i
wouldnt
think
honey
by
itself
would
lend
a
beer
the
the
herbedspice
category
especially
at
the
levels
in
this
beer
gross
a
waste
thomas

makes
some
decent

but
this
didnt
cut
it
for
me

upfront
wich
is
a
turn
off
right
away
for
methe
orange
taste
is
nearly
cloying
and
overpowers
pretty
much
anything
else
just
not
my
thingi
think
ill
stay
from
the
double
version
of
this
as
well
on
tap
at
the
hunt
club
light
honey
flavour
waterish
mouthfeel
this
is
closer
to
a
carbonated
and
slightly
hopped
mead
than
a
pilsner
better
than
a
plain
honey
beer
nothing
to
look
at
a
tad
orange
aroma
the
pils
gives
some
balance
but
still
too
sweet
drinkable
once
drinkability
is
average
more
a
lawnmower
beer
than
a
session
beer
nothing
special
this
is
an
odd
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
ale
it
must
be
confused
with
its
pilsner
side
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
a
tad
spritzy
but
i
think
it
is
very
refreshing
for
this
style
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
and
some
faint
sweet
orange
finishes
with
a
semisweet
apple
taste
this
is
pretty
refreshing
and
plenty
quaffable
they
need
to
tweak
some
aspects
a
bit
but
id
have
it
again
sadly
i
bought
a
sixpack
based
on
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
and
i
hate
to
waste
beer
so
im
going
to
have
to
endure
more
than
one
of
these
overall
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
below
average
pilsner
almost
corona
like
i
will
not
search
this
out
again
i
did
not
get
much
of
a
taste
of
either
orange
or
honey
d
the
snifter
actually
turned
out
to
be
a
good
idea
since
this
is
pretty
much
my
dessert
for
the
night
its
too
sweet
to
be
consistently
easy
drinking
and
i
cant
imagine
downing
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
since
this
brewery
is
a
onetrick
pony
they
wouldve
been
better
off
using
a
maltier
beer
to
house
what
seems
to
be
pretty
highquality
honey
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
a
nice
crisp
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
a
bit
of
honey
an
slight
hops
the
taste
is
an
interesting
blend
of
the
usual
pilsner
hoppiness
and
honey
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
easydrinking
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
but
not
likely
one
id
try
again
the
drink
is
indeed
crisp
and
refreshing
as
per
the
labels
boast
but
is
only
so
as
a
result
of
a
thinnishmedium
body
with
mild
carbonation
not
bad
not
good
both
quaffable
and
completely
forgettable
d
this
is
really
an
average
beer
not
the
most
horrible
thing
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
doesnt
make
you
want
to
remember
it
i
would
drink
this
again
if
available
in
my
area
body
is
very
refreshing
and
thin
very
summery
beer
great
quaffer
in
the
sunshine
clean

goes
down

it
isnt

ill
have

bottle

as
floridas

bright
golden
colored
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
huge
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fruity
with
honey
and
a
bit
grainy
the
beer
tastes
very
sweet
with
lots
of
honey
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
background
its
too
sweet
almost
to
the
point
where
it
seems
a
little
sticky
interesting
and
defnitely
a
unique
brew
they
make
a
obp
squared
i
can
only
imagine
how
sweet
that
one
is
d
this
is
pretty
cool
to
drink
and
try
but
i
would
not
drink
this
one
a
regular
basis
light
beer
enthusiasts
would
probably
prefer
this
over
other
beer
drinkers
worth
a
shot
but
will
not
become
part
of
my
regular
lineup
overall
not
bad
not
my
favorite
but
surely
nothing
terrible
i
would
not
have
an
issue
with
trying
this
one
again
during
the
hot
months
give
it
a
try
as
its
an
understated
light
summer
beer
drinkability
is
meh
kinda
requires
faster
drinking
tends
to
flatten
out
as
it
warms
a
decent
beer
perhaps
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
would
be
ample
simply
due
to
the
sweetness
and
lack
of
any
refreshing
qualities
this
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
which
disappates
slowly
lacing
is
present
but
minimal
the
aroma
is
a
musty
smell
with
a
hint
of
sweet
the
taste
is
interesting
it
has
a
weird
candy
taste
to
it
its
actually
not
all
that
bad
different
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
and
highly
carbonated
which
was
evident
on
the
pour
overall
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
horrible
beer
its
as
i
said
before
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
not
undrinkable
but
this
one
needs
some
work
a
true
pilsner
or
an
allmalt
lager
would
be
the
better
direction
for
this
brew
scrap
the
orange
or
the
honey
how
bout
both
still
looking
for
a
great
brew
from
florida
im
editing
my
review
based
on
a
later
tasting
of
another
batch
it
still
sucks
very
astringent
no
good

by

malty
getting
some

drinkable
not
too
bad
would
still
take
it
over
the
big
three
this
was
recommended
by
my
firends
at
knightly
spirits
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
plenty
of
white
foam
and
a
meager
lace
the
aroma
is
definitely
earthy
a
bit
stank
and
skunky
not
real
inviting
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
encouraging
where
you
pick
up
on
the
honey
idea
but
it
is
only
vaguely
sweet
more
leaning
toward
bready
and
bisuit
with
this
over
riding
stagnant
water
affect
that
is
not
particularly
rewarding
it
is
kind
of
unique
maybe
worth
a
try
for
those
that
like
variety
personally
i
would
actually
like
to
have
more
of
a
sweet
honey
flavor
than
what
this
pilsner
offers
but
its
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
it
offers
an
average
mouth
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
easy
enough
to
drink
as
a
relatively
light
and
refreshing
beer
but
the
stagnant
water
idea
sort
of
turns
you
off
from
over
indulgence
it
is
somewhat
true
to
the
pilsner
form
so
proceed
accordingly
the
taste
is
a
big
mix
of
honey
and
orange
thats
slightly
pungent
thats
the
good
part
the
honey
i
think
is
over
done
and
drags
the
taste
down
with
its
earthy
semi
sweet
not
so
tasty
flavour
i
think
they
need
go
a
different
route
because
this
doesnt
work
too
well
hell
of
a
retentive
head
of
foam

12oz

poured

with
a
small
white

that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of

around

the

the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
honey
flavors
overall
this
brew
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
macrolager
with
some
honey
flavors
i
really
have
no
interest
to
try
this
again
clear
sharp
golden
yellow
color
with
more
life
than
normally
seen
in
a
pilsner
an
effervescent
crush
of
bubbles
right
on
the
pour
and
then
no
head
to
speak
of
a
light
bit
of
grain
in
the
nose
with
a
note
of
honey
that
is
expected
but
nonetheless
pleasant
and
authentic
unfortunately
theres
not
much
to
the
taste
besides
that
honey
complemented
by
a
hint
of
orange
the
underlying
grains
have
little
character
but
the
honey
at
least
doesnt
overassert
itself
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
is
partly
redeemed
by
a
nice
bit
of
crispness
in
the
finish
this
one
is
fine
for
a
fruit
beer
rather
a
onetrick
pony
but
not
so
overdone
as
many
fruit
beers
but
this
one
plays
it
too
safe
i
was
pretty
sure
i
wouldnt
like
this
and
guess
what
it
poured
a
golden
straw
colour
with
a
big
white
head
and
actually
looked
half
way
decent
smell
was
sickeningly
sweet
and
to
be
honest
there
was
almost
a
faint
smell
of
natural
gas
present
here
in
short
it
stinks
taste
is
kind
of
hard
to
pinpoint
there
is
a
faint
element
of
honey
here
and
its
a
little
bitter
but
to
really
describe
it
is
rather
difficult
mouthfeel
is
water
thin
at
the
very
least
now
i
can
say
that
ive
tried
it
totally
not
for
me
though

bright

something
nice
to

on

palate
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
make
there
are
so
many
crappy
american
ones
but
they
made
the
effort
and
came
up
with
one
worth
drinking
classic
golden
pilsner
appearance
i
also
think
the
can
itself
i
really
nice
looking
light
smell
pale
malts
some
sweet
floral
notes
not
really
bitter
but
hoppy
tasting
light
citrus
and
fruit
notes
and
some
candy
sweetness
crisp
and
easy
drinking
a
nice
summer
time
beer
for
hop
heads
i
love
the
bright
hoppy
flavors
paired
with
such
a
light
and
effervescent
pils
certainly
not
the
most
authentic
beer
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
hops
and
are
looking
for
a
refreshing
lowalcohol
alternative
to
ipa
like
most
light
lagers
it
is
a
bit
underrated
on
ba
because
too
many
people
have
hang
ups
about
this
style
just
because
something
is
in
the
same
family
as
a
pbr
or
bud
doesnt
mean
its
bad
o
this
was
a
fun
lager
style
beer
to
drink
that
has
some
distinct
and
unique
flavors
i
thought
that
they
all
came
together
really
well
and
could
enjoy
this
beer
any
hot
day
overall
this
is
a
super
tasty
pils
from
the
heart
of
mormon
country
mouthfeel
sharp
and
fizzy
sweet
aftertaste
on
back
of
tongue
subtlety
in
aroma
and
taste
is
the
key
with
this
lager
almost
delicate
in
character
yet
the
hop
bitterness
is
rather
robust
dont
look
for
any
massive
2x4
betweentheeyes
punch
but
rather
an
easy
drinking
lightbodied
beer
that
still
provides
plenty
of
sensory
enjoyment
nobody
told
me
this
was
a
lager
when
i
first
ordered
one
the
nose
didnt
give
it
away
either
light
fruity
hops
emitting
from
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
body
with
soapy
lace
all
over
the
place
bright
carbonation
is
evident
and
the
hops
are
so
pungent
they
trump
what
i
would
normally
be
able
to
easily
detect
as
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
a
little
less
cloaked
as
the
hops
aromatics
give
way
to
almost
pilsener
malt
lightness
like
a
fresh
baked
biscuit
getting
softened
butter
this
has
a
meal
type
grain
bill
even
though
its
so
light
in
color
nice
balance
towards
the
finish
not
as
well
hopped
as
the
name
suggests
it
should
be
but
it
is
fruity
and
clean
refreshing
excellent
carbonation
keep
up
the
hoppy
vibe
through
the
finish
and
the
light
body
and
abv
make
it
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
epic
is
doing
some
really
cool
stuff
and
i
love
this
one
as
a
lager
different
from
the
rest
this
could
have
been
a
jacks
abbey
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
denver
gold
color
looks
pretty
good
aroma
is
a
hohum
lager
all
malt
and
not
a
hop
to
speak
of
flavor
was
pretty
standard
lager
with
almost
no
hop
character
until
a
very
bitter
finish
which
i
just
didnt
feel
meshed
well
with
the
taste
another
bummer
from
the
new
brewery
but
hey
at
least
i
didnt
buy
a
bottle
right
appreciate
the
fact
theres
a
lot
more
flavour
than
is
typical
for
lower
abv
beers
but
this
is
definitely
a
lager
and
my
personal
preference
lies
with
ales
poured
from
22oz
bottle
into
tulip
well
its
a
lager
alright
clear
straw
color
but
has
a
nice
chewey

subtle
piney
hop
with
citrus
crisp
lager
aromas
taste
is
similar
there
is
a
bit
of
fruitiness
mixed
well
with
the
hops
its
crisp
and
chugable
but
its
no

food
in

case
ribs
a
great
example
of
a
usually
not
very
inspiring
style
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
the
utah
liquor
store
in
sugar
house
d
some
flaws
that
i
cant
really
overlook
any
lager
shouldnt
have
this
much
haze
and
i
cant
really
get
over
the
soap
on
the
nose
if
they
can
clean
a
few
things
up
this
would
be
pretty
solid
o
very
refreshing
lager
i
really
enjoyed
the
added
hops
to
this
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
spicy
hop
bite
up
front
that
provides
some
dry
bitterness
which
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
dry
finish
earthy
and
slightly
resinous
with
some
grassy
pine
flavor
followed
by
some
light
fruit
and
pilsner
malt
hints
of
hay
biscuit
and
grainy
cracker
give
this
beer
a
nice
pale
malt
backbone
that
counters
the
other
flavors
not
overly
complex
but
well
balanced
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
so
this
seems
less
like
a
syndrome
and
more
like
a
kersniffle
at
first
as
time
goes
on
though
the
beer
does
grow
on
me
and
i
appreciate
it
more
there
is
a
mild
fruit
tone
to
it
that
i
find
interesting
and
a
somewhat
herbal
and
oddly
minty
thing
as
well
but
overall
its
just
a
pretty
easy
drinkin
lager
with
nice
earthy
tones
i
would
have
loved
a
lot
or
a
little
more
hop
influence
or
something
that
makes
this
one
stand
out
a
bit
more
but
no
matter
if
i
were
out
id
probably
order
this
ontap
if
i
saw
it
this
is
a
really
nice
hoppy
smooth
lager
the
hops
are
intense
and
definitely
give
it
character
a
bit
more
balance
would
help
but
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
offering
would
buy
again
but
the
finish
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
o
an
interesting
new
lager
beer
its
a
weird
hybrid
of
bohemia
and
ca
and
it
works
pretty
well
the
malt
is
tough
to
find
but
the
hops
are
good
and
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
good
price
as
well
d
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
lager
with
a
good
bit
of
character
obviously
hopfocused
and
a
bit
more
yeast
character
than
usual
for
a
pale
lager
but
this
was
enjoyable
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
lager
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
hops
with
lightly
sweet
malt
base
is
very
interesting
taste
is
a
good
mix
between
some
floral
and
lightly
sweet
malt
base
with
some
fruity
hops
undertones
and
a
light
bitter
finish
body
is
above
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
this
is
something
i
would
drink
more
often
if
it
was
locally
available
a
good
solid
tasting
lager
ill
have
another
o
a
good
lager
although
not
my
favorite
if
im
going
to
reach
for
a
lager
ill
go
with
the
germans
i
got
this
as
a
gift
i
wont
be
seeking
out
another
bottle
but
have
no
real
criticisms
other
than
it
just
doesnt
excite
my
palate
good
beer
enjoyable
but
does
leave
you
wanting
more
i
brighter
hop
aroma
and
flavor
would
really
take
this
beer
to
another
level
if
this
beer
were
sold
in
six
packs
i
would
purchase
it
for
various
barbecues
or
other
summer
activities
the
bottle
size
is
not
the
most
my
favorite
for
the
style
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
somewhat
light
in
my
opinion
o
its
a
mildly
above
average
lager
with
a
little
bigger
hops
presence
interesting
hybrid
brew
from
epic
what
struck
me
first
was
the
greenish
tinge
when
poured
into
my
epic
logo
pint
frothy
white
head
with
larger
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
but
it
didnt
stick
around
herbal
almost
medicinal
aromas
wafting
out
of
this
one
increased
in
intensity
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
few
degrees
something
grassy
too
light
body
as
expected
with
a
dry
dry
finish
not
as
thirst
quenching
as
i
would
have
expected
those
american
hops
really
dry
this
beer
out
taste
is
like
a
german
pilsner
that
received
an
extra
dose
of
u
s
hops
i
suppose
thats
what
they
were
going
for
in
this
one
certainly
ok
but
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
find
another
overall
this
is
a
very
hoppy
bitter
lager
too
bitter
for
the
low
abv
and
light
malts
imo
quite
simply
there
is
not
enough
oomph
or
taste
to
back
up
the
bitterness
just
as
a
point
of
comparison
victory
prima
pils
is
also
very
bitter
but
has
the
necessary
taste
to
make
it
a
world
class
beer
a
very
solid
lager
all
around
the
hopping
is
obviously
the
showcase
here
but
the
maltiness
does
hold
its
own
very
drinkable
thanks
douglass88
for
the
opportunity
no
dating
on
the
bottle
but
the
description
the
label
and
the
big
greenhop
on
the
label
grabbed
my
attention
beautiful
looking
beer
its
almost
glowing
a
neon
lemon
slight
haziness
but
its
bright
looking
glistening
white
head
with
thick
layers
of
tiny
bubbles
filling
the
top
portion
of
the
glass
aroma
has
a
bright
lemon
citrus
quality
the
label
says
their
american
hops
with
american
yeast
and
german
pilsner
malt
the
smell
is
great
i
just
keep
smelling
fresh
picked
ups
with
green
herbal
bright
lemon
citrus
and
earthiness
jump
out
of
the
glass
flavor
has
a
clean
lemon
citrus
punch
that
brings
with
it
layers
of
grassyherbal
quality
dusted
with
some
yeast
nuttiness
and
pale
malt
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
hop
pellet
focused
with
each
sip
but
i
really
cant
hate
on
the
hops
this
is
a
delicious
hoppy
lager
that
is
their
5
relase
in
the
exponential
series
this
bottle
label
says
5
abv
which
is
still
right
in
the
sessionable
level
22
ounce
bomber
for
6
bucks
well
worth
it
for
my
tastes
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
slick
hop
oils
lubricating
the
palate
this
beer
is
actually
making
me
salivate
from
all
of
the
hop
additions
carbonation
is
dead
on
not
overdone
but
sturdy
enough
to
carry
it
all
through
with
each
sip
quite
the
enjoyable
creative
hopped
up
lager
that
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
light
body
but
not
too
thin
carbonation
is
good
if
it
was
hot
outside
this
may
hit
the
spot
not
very
interesting
but
not
terribly
flawed
o
overall
a
pretty
average
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
but
the
nose
is
very
muted
though
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
not
something
id
probably
seek
out
again
ps
this
is
release
4
o
i
struggled
with
this
one
and
was
glad
it
was
finally
gone
pretty
one
dimensional
and
boring
ill
pass
on
this
one
a
decent
beer
to
be
sure
but
not
one
of
epics
better
efforts
dry
slightly
skunky
and
light
bodied
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
here
and
what
is
happening
is
something
i
could
take
or
leave
better
to
grab
a
smoked
and
oaked
if
youre
looking
for
something
epic
o
def
drinkable
my
first
epic
from
co
experience
and
i
enjoyed
it
o
overall
a
crisp
offering
with
its
fair
share
of
hops
makes
for
a
great
summer
time
drink
the
hops
overshadow
the
fine
german
pilsner
malt
but
this
is
an
american
pale
lager
not
a
pilsner
so
much
can
be
forgiven
would
like
to
see
this
in
six
packs
very
good
drinkability
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
the
american
pale
lager
is
a
tough
category
because
it
is
dominated
by
the
big
boy
on
the
macro
market
many
craft
drinkers
will
hold
their
noses
up
as
they
walk
past
this
one
to
get
something
a
little
stronger
this
is
a
shining
example
of
a
beer
that
can
be
used
to
win
over
craft
converts
it
tastes
familiar
enough
to
them
and
yet
is
still
well
made
with
a
solid
taste
overall
a
nice
lager
though
not
as
big
and
hoppy
as
i
expected
from
the
name
and
packaging
i
was
thinking
something
along
the
lines
of
an
imperial
pilsner
not
bad
but
somewhat
overpriced
overall
easy
to
quaff
lager
that
is
mildly
refreshing
too
pretty
good
beer
after
doing
some
yard
work
and
you
need
to
quench
the
thirst
d
not
the
best
flavor
but
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
another
but
then
again
im
not
the
biggest
lager
fan
poured
strawyellow
slightly
hazed
with
a
thin
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
ringlet
noticeable
carbonation
clean
light
aroma
decent
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
citrusy
hops
basic
taste
of
grains
and
sweet
malts
lightly
hopped
for
a
good
balance
and
a
mostly
dry
finish
a
little
bitter
light
body
crisp
and
pretty
drinkable
not
bad
for
a
lager
overall
very
similar
to
an
above
average
euro
lager
with
a
little
more
hops
o
by
american
pale
lager
standards
this
is
near
the
top
i
would
gladly
pick
this
up
for
tailgating
or
as
my
beer
for
over
the
course
of
a
night
it
doesnt
push
the
boundaries
quite
so
much
as
it
advertises
but
it
still
tastes
good
and
thats
what
counts
o
this
particular
beer
in
the
exponential
series
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
hoppier
than
the
average
lager
but
compared
to
the
other
beers
ive
tried
in
the
exponential
series
from
epic
it
seems
out
of
place
yeah
its
hoppier
but
its
only
5
1
i
dont
see
how
this
would
be
classified
in
the
same
category
as
some
of
their
bigger
beers
maybe
im
missing
something
o
once
i
let
this
warm
up
to
about
4550
degrees
rather
than
the
colder
temperatures
lagers
are
traditionally
enjoyed
at
the
beer
became
more
than
just
your
average
pale
lager
yet
not
as
hoppy
as
advertised
so
good
for
the
style
but
falls
short
of
expectations
of
a
hoppy
lager
and
probably
my
least
favorite
epic
offering
as
of
yet
notes
excellent
for
the
style
torn
here
as
it
is
a
high
dollar
for
an
american
lager
but
it
is
a
truly
excellent
well
made
beer
and
definitely
satisfies
more
than
most
pale
us
lagers
a
worthwhile
buy
even
for
a
style
that
people
generally
dont
associate
with
high
quality
nonadjunct
laden
ingredient
bills
d
very
very
drinkable
and
bright
perfect
summer
quencher
no
surprise
for
me
here
with
jacks
abby
delivering
another
solid
brew
to
the
ma
market
calypso
and
citra
seem
to
compliment
each
other
well
bringing
plenty
of
fruit
but
also
nice
floral
and
herbal
notes
o
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
american
pale
lager
this
is
the
way
lager
should
be
done
its
light
and
flavorful
with
a
very
drinkable
bitterness
level
easily
my
favorite
pale
lager
to
date
which
i
am
following
up
a
few
days
after
having
kiwi
rising
also
by
jacks
abby
i
will
continue
to
support
this
brewery
for
sure
o
this
is
very
nice
essay
drinking
beer
i
think
it
lacks
a
little
in
the
flavor
department
but
its
crisp
refreshing
and
has
a
very
rich
full
mouthfeel
which
was
very
surprising
bitterness
to
it
but
smooth
on
tap
tropical
and
dank
very
nice
bottle
might
have
been
old
but
wasnt
impressed
with
the
flavor
everything
we
had
on
tap
from
jacks
abby
was
great
this
was
lacking
any
flavor
or
aroma
at
all
this
is
a
weird
combination
of
hops
that
creates
an
interesting
spectrum
of
fruit
flavors
i
definitely
like
it
and
i
would
try
it
again
overall
i
like
how
this
series
is
going
keep
it
up
boys
the
palate
opens
bright
clean
and
fruity
with
the
citra
hops
dominating
lending
their
tropical
and
pine
characteristics
along
with
the
more
delicate
melony
notes
pine
orange
lemongrass
melon
mango
and
papaya
are
all
present
light
in
body
with
a
crisp
crackerlike
malt
backbone
this
beer
has
moderate
carbonation
which
allows
the
hop
flavor
to
shine
supple
with
a
pleasant
oiliness
this
feels
great
on
the
palate
an
excellent
beer
raw
bitterness
up
front
through
the
long
aftertaste
quite
spicy
almost
like
red
pepper
flakes
full
bodied
had
a
draft
of
this
delicious
ipl
and
found
it
to
be
nicely
carbonated
well
balanced
and
not
overly
hopy
full
of
citrus
flavors
i
definitely
tasted
some
orange
in
with
the
lemon
and
grapefruit
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
some
o
overall
excellent
brew
from
jacks
abby
great
hop
flavor
without
the
hop
bitterness
usually
associated
with
this
much
flavor
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
hopstitution
series
this
is
a
crisp
clear
ipa
with
citrus
flavor
very
smooth
and
not
overly
hopped
enjoyed
this
very
much
complex
and
balanced
great
aroma
o
refreshing
dangerously
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
good
stuff
a
great
hoppy
lager
this
one
smells
amazing
and
tastes
pretty
good
i
poured
3
glasses
from
the
growler
it
did
get
better
the
more
i
drank
it
on
tap
at
new
york
pizza
pours
a
translucent
dark
yellow
with
an
inch
of
head
tons
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
big
whiff
of
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
some
light
malt
notes
too
but
mainly
its
the
fruity
hops
the
taste
is
bitter
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
upfront
toasted
malts
with
a
bitter
citrus
peel
finish
some
floral
and
grassy
notes
as
well
lots
of
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
an
oily
mouthfeel
overall
solid
hoppy
lager
ill
grab
again
owhile
not
one
of
their
standouts
this
is
another
tasty
treat
from
the
le
abby
de
framingham
overall
pretty
nice
about
what
i
expected
the
last
hopstitution
to
be
but
either
that
was
not
very
fresh
or
just
a
bad
batch
perhaps
as
this
seemed
more
like
what
they
and
everyone
else
described
quite
nice
enjoyable
good
hop
profile
nice
light
lager
base
with
dry
crisp
finish
that
lets
the
hops
stand
out
and
they
dont
got
overboard
although
the
finish
gets
a
bit
too
bitter
and
spicy
light
refreshing
pungent
delicious
smooth
finish
great
balance
well
done
o
overall
a
very
tasty
apl
here
like
what
the
calypso
hops
brought
to
the
table
with
that
underlining
melonpear
well
done
pours
a
light
straw
color
a
bit
hazy
and
a
nice
modest
head
the
smell
is
fantastic
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
so
strong
and
deliciously
hoppy
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
but
its
still
very
good
like
other
beers
ive
had
from
them
its
only
in
the
taste
that
you
can
tell
youre
drinking
a
lager
and
even
then
you
can
forget
this
tastes
like
a
great
ipa
with
a
bit
of
lagery
aftertaste
body
is
good
and
overall
a
very
solid
beer
id
drink
this
regularly
if
it
were
available
o
interesting
hop
combo
its
basically
a
citra
ipl
but
with
some
pear
poking
its
neck
out
here
and
there
it
adds
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
and
helps
keep
this
from
being
a
little
onenote
even
if
its
somewhat
subdued
compared
to
the
spiciness
and
tropical
fruitiness
of
the
citra
tasty
and
refreshing
my
only
real
knock
is
that
the
citra
dominates
a
little
too
completely
wonderful
hop
aroma
crisp
body
with
a
distinct
lager
finish
unique
take
on
the
expected
ipa
experience
obviously
whether
or
not
you
like
lagers
will
determine
how
much
you
will
enjoy
the
overall
taste
especially
the
end
when
the
malt
comes
on
strongest
and
lingers
after
the
glass
is
put
down
overall
an
excellent
easily
drinkable
yet
heavy
lager
cant
wait
till
ja
starts
distributing
in
rhode
island
liquor
stores
because
this
lager
will
vault
to
the
top
of
the
list
for
any
lager
purchases
ill
make
yummy
up
front
tropical
and
zesty
citrus
with
a
light
biscuity
underpinning
medium
feel
that
is
creamy
in
feel
but
finishes
crisp
refreshing
and
clean
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
they
are
changing
my
opinion
on
what
lagers
can
be
i
dont
get
the
ratings
this
beer
is
completely
lacking
balls
its
neutered
easy
drinking
pale
ale
barely
an
ipa
where
are
the
kahunas
pours
from
the
bottle
a
clear
amber
with
a
finger
of
white
head
nice
aroma
of
tropical
fruits
pine
and
malt
you
get
the
malt
first
but
then
theres
a
nice
transition
to
the
citrusy
hops
the
bitterness
lingers
without
being
overpowering
medium
mouth
and
very
smooth
this
is
a
great
ipl
much
better
than
sns

one
of
the
better
ipls
ive
sampled
standard
ipa
ipl
done
really
welli
get
a
nuttiness
from
the
hop
or
malt
bill
that
makes
this
pretty
interesting
poured
into
a
willy
glass
super
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
or
so
white
whispy
head
that
leaves
enormous
lace
aroma
is
not
real
prominent
but
i
did
pick
up
some
citrus
and
pine
taste
is
nice
super
clean
with
some
malty
sweetness
followed
by
pine
and
citrus
mouth
is
great
overall
a
really
enjoyable
hoppy
lager
i
mean
wow
this
is
the
ipl
that
all
others
wish
they
were
absolutely
fantastic
and
a
must
try
i
have
several
ipas
that
i
love
but
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
its
got
a
great
flavor
profile
and
i
find
it
slightly
creamier
than
the
ipas
i
typically
enjoy
every
time
i
have
one
im
pleasantly
surprised
and
im
now
buying
it
by
the
case
at
my
local
costco
this
is
a
truly
delicious
beer
that
i
often
recommend
overall
everything
i
have
had
from
jacks
abby
in
the
recent
past
has
been
a
nice
treat
this
is
no
exception
i
like
it
but
prefer
beer
with
more
zing
delicious
with
a
crisp
finish
one
of
my
favorites
very
clean
tasting
ipl
i
think
this
beer
rivals
a
lot
of
very
good
ipas
o
the
drinkability
of
a
lager
with
the
juicy
tropical
fruit
notes
of
a
west
coast
ipa
very
good
dont
understand
why
this
is
rated
so
high
very
very
solid
beer
if
it
were
around
in
chicago
it
would
be
a
go
to
surprisingly
good
beer
not
quite
an
ipa
not
quite
a
lager
very
nice
overall
taste
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
tasty
i
love
fact
how
they
made
this
beer
so
earthy
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
smell
to
me
almost
has
a
weed
smell
awesome
beer
and
good
buy
everything
i
love
in
a
beer
citrus
and
earthy
hops
nice
feel
unexpectedly
amazing
beer
great
hop
flavor
and
smooth
lager
finish
also
i
just
tried
to
the
sn
2015
spring
beer
camp
its
just
like
this
beer
so
i
was
inspired
to
add
this
review
when
i
reviewed
it
neither
is
better
than
the
other
honestly
these
two
beers
are
like
clones
cheers
dont
let
this
apl
fool
you
it
tastes
just
like
an
ipa
jacks
abby
has
found
what
they
are
good
and
perfected
it
to
its
greatest
quality
i
really
like
this
beer
but
for
some
reason
it
pairs
well
with
nothing
so
i
drink
it
when
drinking
i
love
this
beer
this
little
massachusetts
brewery
is
doing
wonderful
things
right
meow
i
think
i
had
the
wrong
beer
before
i
tasted
this
but
it
really
came
around
color
is
correct
but
a
little
clear
smell
wasnt
great
even
after
i
got
through
half
of
it
this
is
a
world
class
pale
lager
it
has
an
unbelievable
floral
aroma
but
not
overpowering
in
any
way
it
tastes
amazing
well
i
should
have
expected
the
super
bitter
hoppiness
but
it
seemed
to
far
for
me
for
a
hoppy
brew
im
not
too
turned
off
by
it
a
great
beer
indeed
pours
with
a
nice
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
not
too
strong
that
of
hops
and
fruit
lemons
maybe
a
slight
malt
kick
the
taste
is
just
an
absolutely
perfect
example
of
a
smooth
hoppy
pale
ale
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
strongly
resembles
the
nose
hops
on
the
initial
impact
and
a
nice
citrus
finish
the
malt
is
present
but
the
6
7abv
certainly
is
not
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
open
a
mindless
sudwater
drinker
to
a
world
of
well
balanced
fantastic
craft
alternatives
nothing
too
crazy
a
good
beer
for
almost
any
situation
overall
a
marvelous
beer
and
one
in
a
category
all
of
its
own
id
like
to
see
jacks
abby
be
able
to
preserve
the
lager
subtleties
but
add
solid
hop
flavor
in
a
low
abv
offering
such
as
a
traditional
southwest
german
pils
or
other
hoppierthanusual
lager
styles
however
for
now
if
i
want
a
hoppy
beer
thats
crisper
than
an
ale
ill
gladly
reach
for
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
would
highly
recommend
pours
into
a
pokal
an
orange
tinged
medium
golden
with
a
sticky
full

white

atop
tropical

over

place
in
the
nose
along
with
light
toasted

with
some
dry
toasted

linger
in
the
finish

6
7one
of
the
more
hopped
up
lagers
i
have
had
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
scent
is
full
of
pine
from
the
hops
the
taste
was
fantastic
with
a
focus
on
the
hops
but
with
a
nice
balance
with
the
malt
to
create
an
exceptionally
clean
finish
great
focus
and
execution
of
the
style
loved
it
right
away
its
excellent
but
just
not
my
favorite
style
they
do
sure
excel
at
lagers
though
sweeetness
doesnt
keep
the
dry
nature
of
this
beer
from
showing
in
the
feel
one
bit
if
anything
it
only
starts
sweet
and
ends
quite
dry
crispness
kicks
the
whole
time
off
a
soft
strong
carbonation
that
creates
lots
of
smoothness
bottle
as
an
extra
in
trade
thanks

im
a
fan
and
believer
in
jacks
abby
excellent
taste
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
lives
up
to
the
hype
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
tasted
this
summer
hazy
and
almost
no
head
as
to
be
expected
with
a
beer
full
of
hop
oils
smells
fairly
mild
for
a
beer
billed
as
an
india
whosawhatsit
hoppy
for
sure
but
nothing
compared
to
heady
west
coast
style
ipa
i
grew
accustomed
to
in
denver
the
flavor
was
another
story
the
malt
starts
things
off
pretty
mildly
with
predictable
toasty
sweetness
but
hops
quickly
take
over
body
is
there
as
is
a
gentle
carbonation
level
i
feel
like
id
be
more
comfortable
with
a
blast
of
soapy
pilsy
or
grassy
german
hops
but
the
american
hops
coupled
with
lagered
malt
cleanliness
is
unique
and
singular
to
this
beer
it
is
unusual
and
not
unenjoyable
especially
after
years
of
moar
hopz
west
coast
beers
think
of
a
fresh
bottle
of
urquell
poured
half
and
half
with
a
smuttynose
ipa
bizarre
but
delicious
its
really
good
but
id
still
opt
for
snpa
or
bells
two
hearted
ale
since
theyre
easier
to
get
and
world
class
outstanding
beers
if
i
saw
this
one
in
the
same
cooler
id
definitely
grab
it
for
a
change
of
pace
but
i
fail
to
see
it
as
anything
really
out
of
the
ordinary
in
terms
of
flavor
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
got
tired
of
hearing
about
and
tried
in
part
so
i
could
say
the
hype
is
wrong
well
i
failed
this
is
a
really
excellent
beer
one
to
seek
out
worth
sipping
and
enjoying
but
also
the
right
balance
for
cookouts
and
outdoor
goingson
o
for
the
style
there
really
is
nothing
like
it
those
who
purchased
it
thinking
it
was
a
standard
ipa
didnt
read
carefully
enough
and
shouldnt
hold
that
against
it
an
ipl
done
well
is
a
rare
thing
and
this
is
the
prime
example
overall
excellent
beer
satisfies
on
many
levels
tasty
refreshing
satisfying
this
could
easily
become
a
go
to
for
me
o
this
is
an
interesting
twist
on
a
lager
or
ipa
the
sweetness
helps
balance
the
hops
but
they
are
still
there
to
enrich
the
experience
there
is
no
sense
of
alcohol
at
all
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
will
seek
out
more
from
jacks
abbey
golden
straw
with
a
quarter
inch
head
and
good
lacing
some
grain
and
malt
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
of
citrus
notably
orange
and
the
presence
of
hops
good
carbonation
and
mild
bitterness
i
am
not
generally
a
lager
drinker
but
this
is
good
stuff
well
balanced
and
wonderfully
crafted
as
would
be
expected
from
jacks
abby
full
mouthfeel
semislick
finishes
tingly
good
beer
im
sick
so
it
probably
affects
my
tastes
considering
how
much
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
really
great
its
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
doesnt
hit
too
hard
overall
a
pretty
tasty
treat
from
jacks
abby
i
really
liked
how
well
the
hop
and
citrus
flavors
melded
and
flowed
across
the
tongue
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
this
beer
definitely
recommend
by
now
everyone
knows
the
quality
brewing
going
on
with
lagers
at
jacks
abby
and
the
locally
sourced
ingredients
fueling
their
beers
hoponius
union
has
a
nice
bite
at
the
beginning
but
mellows
out
with
subtle
sweet
flavors
resembling
grapefruit
mixed
with
almost
a
nutmeg
richness
its
easy
to
drink
23
of
these
at
a
sitting
a
nice
substantial
taste
but
not
overly
filling
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
overall
an
amazing
beer
one
that
i
am
happy
to
have
regular
access
to
i
made
a
solemn
promise
to
the
old
lady
last
summer
that
if
a
beer
in
any
way
indicates
that
it
is
bottleconditioned
i
would
treat
it
as
gently
as
i
would
her
the
fact
that
she
would
beat
my
ass
within
an
inch
of
my
life
if
i
ever
mistreated
her
notwithstanding
i
went
with
a
very
gentle
pour
i
have
said
before
she
is
as
tough
as
nails
which
is
part
of
the
attraction
for
me
i
got
a
brief
skim
of
bonewhite
head
across
the
top
of
the
beer
before
it
faded
into
mere
wisps
color
was
a
sunshineyellow
srm
4
with
just
the
faintest
of
haze
visible
in
the
glass
i
promise
you
i
was
extremely
gentle
but
there
may
have
been
something
in
suspension
nose
smelled
deeply
of
citrusgrapefruit
rind
hops
wow
as
a
lifelong
pennsylvanian
i
know
the
difficulty
behind
making
a
lager
and
to
make
one
that
comes
off
with
this
level
of
hoppiness
is
just
amazing
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
the
taste
was
all
hops
and
for
a
hophead
that
was
just
fine
by
me
i
cannot
say
that
i
would
have
identified
it
as
a
lager
of
any
stripe
but
perhaps
that
is
part
of
the
mystique
i
do
know
that
the
light
spritzy
mouthfeel
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
where
an
aipa
might
have
been
more
to
handle
the
finish
was
extremely
dry
and
i
really
had
a
tough
time
believing
that
this
was
a
lager
i
had
put
the
remainder
of
what
was
left
in
the
bottle
back
in
the
reefer
to
settle
and
when
i
went
to
pour
some
more
into
the
glass
i
noticed
that
the
haze
had
cleared
impressive
warming
i
got
some
of
the
honey
notes
that
i
always
think
of
as
characteristic
of
wellmade
lagers
but
the
hops
continued
to
carry
the
day
a
little
too
lageresque
for
me
but
it
is
very
nice
would
recommend
for
a
nice
hot
afternoon
its
93
here
now
the
beer
pours
a
nice
white
and
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
head
is
white
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
orange
with
some
brown
notes
the
beer
smell
has
a
strong
hoppy
smell
with
malt
sweetness
taking
the
edge
off
of
some
of
it
the
hops
are
a
nice
orange
citrus
which
mixes
well
with
the
bready
sweetness
from
the
malts
the
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
strong
hoppy
note
but
very
little
of
the
malt
present
in
the
smell
the
hop
still
a
strong
citrus
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
to
the
point
where
it
is
slightly
creamy
carbonation
medium
bodied
but
still
fels
light
overall
a
very
good
lager
and
worth
getting
i
enjoyed
greatly
and
most
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
quite
a
good
beer
a
wonderful
melding
of
styles
fizzy
and
chillhazed
yelloworange
in
color
like
a
lager
the
offwhite
froth
is
stagnant
citrus
hops
feature
prominently
aromatically
like
and
ipa
but
the
lager
yeast
is
noticed
veiled
and
just
behind
tastes
of
citrus
lemon
peel
and
grain
the
hoppiness
is
subdued
as
if
it
was
stopped
in
midsentence
while
trying
to
make
a
very
brilliant
point
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
body
is
crisp
with
a
bit
of
heat
in
the
finish
while
this
one
is
pretty
damn
tasty
im
left
ambivalent
wondering
if
i
would
rather
just
have
one
or
the
other
a
bottled
beer
from
woodychandler
yes
its
true
and
what
a
bottle
to
come
through
with
many
thanks
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
citrus
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
some
solid
hops
malts
citrus
well
done
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
high
quality
beer
o
really
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
refreshing
good
ipa
just
wish
it
had
more
malt
or
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
availability
yearround
o
outstanding
all
around
excellent
beer
that
i
will
revisit
often
once
i
try
it
fresh
at
the
brewery
i
may
change
my
mind
o
this
is
a
really
good
pale
lager
very
hoppy
but
incredibly
wellbalanced
and
has
a
very
classic
pilsner
finish
with
spice
and
grain
providing
a
very
crisp
refreshing
experience
i
love
this
beer
and
would
make
it
a
staple
in
my
fridge
were
it
available
in
my
part
of
the
country
overall
feels
like
a
more
crisp
american
ipa
with
a
german
malt
base
and
perfectly
balanced
hops
extremely
drinkable
watch
out
for
the
abv
and
tasty
surprisingly
my
first
taste
of
hoponius
and
i
certainly
wasnt
disappointed
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
in
its
color
not
the
hoppiest
smell
i
was
hoping
for
so
it
may
not
have
been
the
freshest
bottle
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
much
of
a
bite
but
thats
just
being
nitpicky
overall
really
loved
this
brew
o
a
great
session
beer
smooth
full
flavored
well
balanced
easy
drinking
clear
golden
pour
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
cap
of
white
head
nice
retention
and
some
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
very
light
notes
of
herbal
hops
and
biscuity
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
mostly
sweet
up
front
biscuity
malts
toffee
fruit
punch
giving
way
to
toasted
grains
and
a
lightly
bitter
herbal
hop
finish
lightmedium
body
moderate
carbonation
pretty
easily
drinkable
overall
decent
especially
for
a
lager
but
still
probably
not
something
id
go
for
again
just
another
great
beer
from
jacks
abbey
aroma
starts
off
with
a
big
burst
of
citrus
and
slight
caramel
malt
presence
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
bright
citrus
flavor
but
then
transitions
to
a
more
pungent
tropical
fruit
taste
such
as
mango
most
notably
not
alot
of
bitterness
on
this
at
all
and
sweet
caramel
malt
rounds
things
out
the
drinkability
and
taste
is
superior
to
the
slew
of
session
ipas
that
have
come
out
recently
this
is
a
must
try
beer
and
as
a
full
strength
ipl
i
personally
feel
this
is
a
much
better
alternative
to
most
session
ipas
93100
at
any
rate
call
this
beer
world
class
because
that
is
what
it
is
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
tried
to
compensate
for
some
lower
individual
marks
in
this
category
i
will
say
that
it
is
lagerlike
in
one
sense
it
loses
a
bit
of
a
appeal
as
it
warms
pours
a
more
or
less
opaque
golden
hue
with
a
generous
frothy
head
smells
strongly
of
citrussy
hops
orangey
floraly
and
mildly
piney
notes
west
coast
inspired
i
assume
defiantly
pick
up
on
the
yeasty
lager
components
here
citrus
hops
hit
first
while
the
piney
notes
come
in
the
background
not
an
overly
bitter
hop
profile
and
finishes
with
a
clean
and
refreshing
lager
characteristic
mild
alcohol
presence
carbonation
is
on
point
and
an
overall
very
clean
ipl
on
the
whole
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
ipl
that
certainly
makes
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
is
quit
drinkable
this
is
really
smooth
with
ever
the
smallest
bump
in
the
road
of
bitterness
this
makes
a
good
early
spring
beer
o
a
tremendous
hoppy
lager
big
bitter
hop
goodness
with
a
toasted
malt
body
bottle
poured
fresh
from
brewey
and
cold
into
a
glass
golden
with
semi
rushing
bubbles
a
spotty
off
white
legs
smell
strong
citrus
and
floral
accented
by
a
bit
if
earthiness
taste
and
feel
impressive
at
first
getting
a
pleasant
grapefruit
and
line
leading
into
a
the
lager
profile
which
is
a
bit
hard
to
explain
but
almost
a
toasted
bread
which
probably
is
the
yeast
or
spelt
overall
feel
depth
are
outstanding
with
a
unique
flavor
profile
welcome
change
from
the
regular
apaipa
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
it
comes
across
as
a
single
ipa
but
with
a
thicker
smoother
mouthfeel
very
hoppy
but
not
unnecessarily
so
i
like
this
beer
across
the
board
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
shaped
glass
appearance
is
great
big
head
goldencopper
lagerish
color
minimal
lacing
smell
is
goodish
lagers
never
smell
as
good
as
ales
imo
plenty
o
bubbles
great
taste
nice
and
fruity
no
bitterness
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
it
might
be
better
then
their
mass
rising
dont
approach
this
one
cold
some
small
talk
gentle
cradling
the
warmth
of
your
breath
will
be
required
before
you
get
what
you
want
namely
a
good
beer
o
pretty
solid
ipl
really
loved
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
subdued
and
mostly
tasted
malt
profile
and
bitterness
of
the
hops
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
hoppy
but
sessionable
by
my
standards
would
have
liked
to
have
experienced
more
hops
on
the
nose
not
sure
on
the
price
of
this
one
as
i
received
it
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
but
if
i
had
access
to
this
one
i
could
see
these
being
a
very
respectable
goto
beer
im
an
ipa
guy
not
a
lager
guy
but
bumping
the
ibus
to
65
seemed
to
work
real
well
i
would
choose
this
over
many
standard
ipas
out
there
draught
noho
brewfest
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
on
it
the
nose
is
good
piney
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
pretty
good
hop
bite
pine
and
resinous
hops
dominate
the
flavor
medium
bodied
this
tastes
really
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
mildly
hazy
body
the
color
of
honey
thick
head
tiny
patchwork
of
lacing
leaves
an
imprint
creamy
gobs
remain
in
the
glass
glorious
resiny
hops
with
slices
of
fresh
fruit
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
geared
more
to
the
fruit
side
of
hops
juicy
and
has
a
mineral
flavor
in
the
back
bitterness
is
sustained
yet
present
digging
almost
everything
these
guys
are
doing
indeed
the
only
difference
between
hoponius
union
and
a
westcoast
ipa
aside
from
the
fact
that
its
brewed
in
massachusetts
is
that
its
been
lagered
this
offering
only
further
reinforces
my
opinion
that
people
beer
educators
specifically
put
far
too
much
emphasis
on
the
lager
vs
ale
comparison
theres
obviously
so
many
more
important
factors
that
distinguish
a
beer
overall
a
wonderful
experience
for
my
first
jacks
abby
beer
of
course
im
a
bit
of
a
hop
addict
so
my
opinion
is
skewed
but
i
think
im
being
fair
when
i
say
that
this
doesnt
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
an
ipa
it
retains
the
bready
crisp
characteristics
that
you
expect
from
the
style
from
what
ive
heard
these
guys
know
their
way
around
lagering
and
based
on
this
first
example
im
inclined
to
agree
the
beer
is
super
refreshing
drinkable
and
clean
but
also
so
hoppy
orangegold
and
clear
with
a
short
dense
offwhite
cap
thick
lacing
and
great
head
retention
fresh
hop
aroma
lots
of
citrus
grapefruit
pith
slight
pineapple
really
well
constructed
with
citrus
hops
throughout
but
mild
malt
up
front
and
tropicalspicy
notes
in
the
bitter
finish
moderate
carbonation
on
the
creamy
side
while
still
retaining
some
crispness
nice
texture
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
bright
hops
all
the
way
through
yet
still
refined
and
refreshing
a
damn
good
hoppy
lager
in
a
class
with
victory
prima
pils
a
touch
too
sweet
to
go
nuts
for
my
personal
taste
but
there
is
not
much
wrong
with
this
beer
solid
in
all
fazes
of
the
game
i
definitely
would
have
this
on
tap
if
i
saw
it
unless
there
was
something
ungodly
on
the
other
taps
im
drinking
on
this
beer
as
im
writing
this
message
this
nice
golden
look
with
a
nice
hoppy
lager
smell
the
taste
is
unbelievable
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
you
can
smell
the
fresh
ipl
hoppy
smell
leaves
a
nice
taste
on
on
tongue
jack
abbys
continues
to
create
classic
beers
cheers
o
a
nice
ipl
the
palate
opens
with
a
clean
quenching
bitterness
mildly
resiny
and
extremely
citrusy
with
orange
zest
orange
juice
and
grapefruit
present
by
the
bucketful
a
mild
pine
sap
bitterness
is
present
as
well
the
midpalate
brings
out
the
hop
flavor
the
blend
of
floral
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
malt
character
is
minimal
with
just
a
little
bit
of
a
burnt
sugar
toffeehoney
sweetness
present
pairing
really
well
with
the
citrus
hops
with
the
classic
lager
smoothnessslickness
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
ridiculously
clean
and
has
a
nice
biting
bitterness
on
the
finish
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
excellent
on
the
palate
very
highly
recommended
in
the
pantheon
of
ipls
there
arent
many
that
better
this
o
im
impressed
with
this
beer
wish
i
had
ready
access
to
it
as
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
think
itd
also
be
a
good
beer
for
my
dad
he
enjoys
craft
but
most
times
when
i
let
him
try
an
ipa
he
smacks
his
lips
wrinkles
his
nose
and
says
grapefruit
juice
all
in
all
really
well
done
beer
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
craft
lagers
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
that
said
i
definitely
prefer
ales
to
lagers
od
ok
a
decent
craft
lager
but
way
less
hops
than
i
was
expecting
wouldnt
revisit
it
but
a
nice
take
on
the
style
o
very
good
hoppy
lager
not
the
best
out
there
but
still
in
my
top
five
lagers
overall
im
real
impressed
with
this
one
and
will
be
going
back
for
more
really
blurs
the
ale
lager
line
packs
some
serious
flavor
o
pretty
darn
tasty
and
it
certainly
makes
a
good
argument
against
the
lagers
are
tasteless
crowd
still
it
wouldnt
necessarily
be
a
goto
for
me
in
the
face
of
other
choices
there
are
a
lot
of
readily
available
ipas
that
are
just
plain
better
o
a
tasty
beer
and
probably
the
best
jacks
abby
ive
had
of
the
four
ive
tried
its
got
a
nice
hop
profile
and
isnt
overwhelming
at
all
a
little
bitter
for
my
taste
but
objectively
very
good
this
beer
kept
the
quality
of
a
lager
and
added
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
show
them
off
a
little
but
not
get
carried
away
extremely
food
friendly
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
this
beer
is
uncomplicated
by
the
hops
and
is
quite
engaging
bold
yelloworange
body
that
is
completely
translucent
with
a
crisp
finger
width
white
head
good
looking
beer
in
the
glass
some
pine
and
citrus
on
the
nose
aggressively
hopped
and
quite
bitter
with
a
solid
lager
base
the
lager
base
is
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
very
well
made
with
a
great
mouthfeel
the
hopping
is
a
bit
too
aggressively
west
coast
for
my
taste
it
is
certainly
interesting
with
the
lager
body
though
worth
a
try
for
west
coast
ipa
fans
indeed
this
is
light
to
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
sharp
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
overall
the
smell
is
just
fantastic
and
following
that
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
balanced
ipl
very
crisp
and
refreshing
incredible
value
as
well
definitely
recommend
trying
some
of
this
o
a
very
good
beer
i
just
didnt
find
any
lager
qualities
i
absolutely
love
jack
abbys
2nd
anniversary
lager
as
it
combines
lots
and
lots
of
quality
hops
with
the
clean
and
crisp
finish
of
a
lager
this
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
a
very
good
one
actually
great
tasting
beer
which
i
will
certainly
try
again
but
i
was
disappointed
in
not
finding
that
lager
crispness
still
highly
recommended
thanks
to
bostonsteve
for
the
trade
pours
a
golden
amber
with
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
lacing
aroma
is
all
about
hops
floral
citrus
pine
some
grassiness
a
very
nice
smelling
beer
taste
follows
nose
bitter
throughout
but
nicely
balanced
by
sweet
malt
backbone
a
very
quaffable
beer
smooth
with
a
lightmedium
body
and
effervescent
carbonation
overall
a
well
crafted
lager
ive
only
had
one
other
ipl
that
from
boston
beer
company
and
i
do
like
the
style
an
ipal
that
one
can
serve
cold
ill
be
looking
for
these
come
summer
overall
the
lager
flavor
mixed
with
the
strong
hop
profile
doesnt
completely
work
for
me
its
a
good
beer
and
very
unique
but
maybe
a
little
too
much
on
the
dry
side
i
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
a
second
one
glad
i
got
to
try
this
ontap
regardless
o
well
it
really
is
that
good
something
you
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
i
think
theres
also
some
great
examples
of
the
style
already
out
there
but
this
one
is
popular
for
a
reason
pours
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
small
head
that
persists
an
ipl
it
is
tasting
quite
like
many
a
great
ipa
while
having
a
lighter
body
and
clean
finish
reminiscent
of
a
lager
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
which
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
pack
a
major
abv
wallop
very
fine
beer
this
o
i
didnt
see
the
date
until
after
i
bought
it
6
days
after
it
was
bottled
great
beer
if
it
was
available
locally
i
would
drink
a
ton
of
this
o
nice
stuff
smooth
easy
drinking
with
mild
flavors
o
this
is
good
stuff
its
going
down
real
fast
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
good
style
of
beer
i
have
only
had
a
few
ipls
and
have
enjoyed
them
all
i
get
an
unusual
flavor
that
i
describe
as
metallic
that
may
not
be
the
best
descriptor
this
is
definitely
worth
buying
a
six
pack
of
more
a
classic
ipl
and
the
benchmark
for
the
style
imo
o
a
good
interesting
beer
pours
a
nice
bright
gold
with
a
big
puffy
head
a
light
cream
color
lots
of
lacing
very
good
retention
in
case
youre
curious
the
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
big
on
bright
citrus
with
a
little
tropical
fruit
in
the
mix
nice
floral
note
as
well
sugary
doughy
malt
underneath
all
of
those
hops
taste
is
similar
lots
of
hop
flavor
it
pretty
much
drinks
like
an
ipa
its
just
a
bit
cleaner
for
better
and
worse
the
hops
start
with
sweet
floral
and
citrus
flavors
but
get
a
bit
bland
in
the
finish
its
just
not
quite
as
juicy
as
id
like
nice
dry
finish
otherwise
light
mouthfeel
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
oiliness
very
good
beer
india
pale
lager
which
is
indeed
a
wicked
hoppy
lager
good
ipl
loaded
with
citrusy
hops
damn
solid
flagship
apa
erm
apl
it
stood
its
own
against
hfs
phenomenal
citra
thats
all
i
got
if
you
can
get
it
and
like
ipas
its
worth
the
purchase
o
super
enjoyable
and
refreshing
brew
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
a
lager
but
this
beer
i
could
drink
all
of
the
time
very
well
suited
for
the
warm
weather
overall
a
very
cool
beer
the
second
ipl
ive
had
and
this
one
is
the
better
of
the
two
lots
of
great
hop
flavor
with
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
couple
that
with
the
lager
maltiness
and
this
reminds
me
of
a
superhoppy
version
of
an
english
ipa
delicious
light
body
and
well
carbonated
an
interesting
beer
but
i
feel
this
bottle
might
have
been
past
its
prime
this
india
pale
lager
style
is
really
taking
off
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
but
i
hate
to
say
like
i
always
do
that
humulus
from
the
bruery
set
the
bar
impossibly
high
for
other
brewers
this
is
excellent
until
you
have
a
humulus
it
pours
a
nice
radiant
orange
color
with
an
inch
of
fading
white
fluff
a
nose
of
crisp
clean
pine
family
hops
with
a
pronounced
bitter
close
lager
yeast
is
evident
upon
the
first
sip
its
dry
but
not
at
snappy
as
some
it
lets
the
cereal
grains
come
through
a
lot
to
balance
the
hops
which
have
a
sort
of
punctuated
citrus
and
pine
bitterness
back
and
forth
going
on
the
beer
would
be
better
if
it
didnt
come
across
so
filling
bigger
malt
base
than
necessary
here
i
think
fuller
than
most
lagers
but
its
carbonated
well
and
the
bitter
finish
is
quite
dry
encouraging
quick
consumption
overall
a
great
beer
but
underwhelming
in
some
ways
especially
when
put
up

im

unfortunately
this

was
not

as
i

it
would

great

5
99
for
500
ml
bottle
a
surprising
ipl
that
drinks
like
ipa
but
at
lower
temperature
very
well
balanced
beer
that
should
grace
every
hopheads
list
im
lucky
enough
to
have
local
distribution
but
i
have
little
doubt
this
brand
will
go
national
before
the
next
presidential
elections
the
entire
lineup
is
quite
good
with
hu
and
framnghammer
clearly
the
most
popular
entries
o
clearly
from
the
other
reviewers
this
is
great
when
fresh
with
two
months
on
it
its
something
a
little
less
than
great
airy
light
and
crisp
kind
of
like
raul
likes
his
hinas
airy
light
and
crisp
fantastic
perhaps
the
best
iteration
of
this
style
ive
ever
tasted
o
grab
one
drink
it
rinse
and
repeat
the
taste
has
a
generous
pale
malt
and
herbal
start
and
the
earthy
hops
sneak
up
quickly
at
the
finish
leaving
a
semilingering
finish
citrus
notes
too
dry
and
biscuity
at
the
end
nicely
done
overall
pretty
solid
ipl
from
another
local
brewery
i
remember
trying
wormtowns
and
was
very
surprised
and
interested
with
it
good
to
see
another
local
brewery
bring
this
style
up
a
notch

o
best
lager
ive
ever
had
by
far
balances
fantastic
flavor
and
mildness
very
well
also
kudos
to
jacks
abby
for
sending
a
lowly
homebrewer
like
me
the
recipe
for
this
deliciousness
which
i
brewed
and
served
at
my
sons
wedding
everyone
was
amazed
i
was
quick
to
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
thanks
ja
o
a
very
nice
beer
the
lager
base
is
complemented
quite
well
by
the
plentiful
hopping
but
it
remains
central
to
the
character
of
this
beer
a
strongly
bitter
lager
to
be
sure
but
retaining
a
lot
of
the
drinkability
of
the
style
definitely
a
beer
id
be
happy
to
have
again
at
some
point
overall
not
as
good
as
it
warmed
better
cold
good
all
around
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
id
like
as
i
prefer
my
hoppy
beer
to
have
some
substance
to
them
but
this
certainly
nothing
to
be
too
picky
about
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
id
challenge
any
ba
to
correctly
identify
this
as
a
lager
in
a
blind
taste
test
pours
a
fairly
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
aromas
of
sweet
bready
malty
with
hint
of
spice
and
fruit
with
a
light
spicy
earthy
hop
aroma
to
round
it
all
out
the
flavor
holds
a
creamy
bready
malty
taste
with
lots
of
spicy
earthy
hops
to
balance
it
out
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
sweet
mouthfeel
another
great
brew
from
jacks
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
its
easy
to
become
seduced
by
thinking
of
this
beer
as
a
hoppy
lager
but
the
counterpart
could
be
taken
too
that
this
is
an
ipa
with
quivering
support
and
exposed
hopderived
astringency
i
loved
this
one
heard
a
lot
about
it
and
am
glad
i
was
lucky
enough
to
finally
get
to
try
it
pours
a
hazy
bubbly
goldenorange
with
a
large
lasting
frothy
offwhite
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
really
nice
aroma
is
fruity
and
hoppy
with
lots
of
citrus
hops
and
tropical
fruit
along
with
beady
malt
and
some
herbal
and
floral
notes
flavor
is
just
as
nice
lots
of
citrusy
hops
and
plenty
fruity
with
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
and
a
long
moderate
bitter
finish
surprised
that
they
would
dissipate
so
quickly
maybe
its
my
sinuses
maybe
its
the
beer
its
good
im
just
not
feeling
incredible
with
this
maybe
i
just
want
it
to
be
an
ipa
too
much
and
im
trying
to
make
it
something
its
not
overall
tasty
refreshing
and
wonderfully
creamy
bam
on
its
own
its
much
better
than
jack
brau
by
a
mile
and
but
not
in
the
class
as
say
victory
prima
pils
overall
an
extremely
enjoyable
hoppy
lager
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
had
from
jacks
abby
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
am
really
digging
this
ipl
style
jacks
abby
as
a
whole
seems
solid
so
far
will
have
to
continue
sampling
their
offerings
o
a
great
hoppy
lager
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
the
time
i
gotta
hand
it
to
jacks
abbey
here
the
only
other
hoppy
lager
ive
sampled
is
sam
adams
double
agent
ipl
this
is
much
cleaner
much
tastier
and
more
to
my
liking
ill
be
buying
more
in
the
near
future
o
very
nice
beer
this
is
something
that
i
would
drink
more
of
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
a
great
summer
beer
but
also
something
that
youd
want
all
year
round
solid
t
lots
of
grapefruit
and
pine
upfront
with
a
light
but
sturdy
biscuity
malt
backbone
finish
brings
a
touch
of
pine
resin
but
finishes
very
smooth
and
clean
this
beer
is
fantastic
why
cant
we
get
this
in
san
diego
why
lines
are
blurred
when
it
comes
to
traditional
styles
these
days
and
crossover
beers
seem
to
be
emerging
all
the
time
somehow
this
lager
bridges
the
gap
to
hopville
and
is
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
but
im
not
completely
floored
either
worthy
of
trying
for
both
ipa
fans
and
lager
fans
im
not
getting
the
world
class
ratings
on
this
one
good
but
not
incredible
o
another
homerun
from
jacks
abby
i
would
take
this
beer
over
most
ipas
out
there
o
finally
a
lager
with
good
ipa
qualities
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
this
over
and
over
again
not
quite
humulus
lager
but
better
than
sa
ipl
im
really
liking
this
ipl
trend
cheers
o
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
drink
im
not
a
lager
fan
but
these
hoppy
lagers
are
really
starting
to
do
it
for
me
what
a
fantastic
beer
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresher
as
i
could
only
imagine
what
the
hop
profile
does
then
the
fact
that
this
is
a
lager
makes
this
a
far
crisper
and
easier
to
drink
beer
than
its
hoppy
counterparts
and
as
a
result
really
sets
a
standard
for
making
more
delicious
hoppy
and
flavorful
lagers
in
the
country
i
seriously
want
to
see
more
beers
like
these
preferably
out
west
a
world
class
lager
ok
its
hard
to
really
determine
what
i
feel
about
this
beer
in
relation
to
any
others
of
its
kind
but
i
will
say
that
my
first
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
carries
the
torch
well
in
the
ipa
category
there
isnt
much
that
i
would
consider
delicate
about
this
beer
and
so
any
of
the
qualities
i
would
be
looking
for
in
a
pale
lager
are
essentially
hidden
that
said
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
certainly
try
it
again
o
this
is
a
great
ipalager
combination
if
i
did
a
blind
taste
i
would
call
this
an
ipa
the
only
thing
preventing
this
from
being
dipa
status
is
the
lighter
mouthfeel
and
alcohol
content
a
really
solid
beer
that
i
had
my
doubts
about
but
was
proven
wrong
very
quickly
i
would
grab
this
one
all
day
long
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
but
sadly
its
not
so
a
big
thanks
to
jageraholic
for
letting
me
expierence
this
great
brew
great
extra
cheers
to
you
my
friend
this
is
not
your
dads
apl
an
interesting
blend
of
styles
that
works
the
crisp
lager
flavors
compliment
the
hops
dry
crisp
low
end
with
juicy
tropical
up
top
this
is
a
winner
for
sure
this
brew
profiles
very
much
like
an
ipa
but
categorization
aside
the
hops
are
the
main
event
and
in
this
regard
this
beer
kicks
ass
at
the
outset
and
probably
510
degrees
too
cold
the
finish
was
a
little
thin
and
lacking
body
as
i
write
this
the
finish
has
filled
out
more
and
the
maltiness
balances
things
out
very
nicely
delicious
damn
it
i
thought
perfect
was
a
dream
this
is
one
of
americas
finest
beers
ive
imbibed
many
a
growler
from
the
brewery
in
framingham
and
hope
that
folks
elsewhere
will
discover
this
superfine
ale
a
hophead
delight
if
youre
in
the
area
visit
jacks
abby
knowledgeable
folks
and
brilliant
brewers
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
lagers
i
have
ever
had
to
date
and
clearly
well
crafted
and
the
recipe
must
have
been
tweaked
many
times
to
arrive
at
such
a
great
hihgly
drinkable
balance
high
marks
for
this
one
if
i
had
to
pick
on
this
beer
for
one
thing
i
would
comment
on
how
its
rather
odd
how
hard
it
tries
not
to
be
a
lager
but
it
is
and
its
tasty
the
oily
earthy
aftertaste
kind
of
tires
my
tastebuds
but
the
bottle
size
is
quite
ideal
definitely
worth
a
try
an
excellent
representation
of
an
uncommon
style
all
hopheads
should
seek
this
one
out
comparable
to
an
ipa
but
less
aromatic
and
a
little
more
modestly
flavored
yet
extremely
delicious
o
crisp
and
dry
a
well
hopped
lager
this
is
my
staple
local
everyday
drinker
for
sure
verdict
a
nice
hoppy
lager
from
jacks
abby
but
not
the
hop
monster
i
expected
it
to
be
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
bottle
and
if
it
was
a
local
beer
to
me
i
could
see
this
being
in
my
fridge
regularly
as
an
every
day
drinker
o
this
was
solid
but
it
was
definitely
hyped
up
in
my
head
as
being
the
best
lager
in
the
world
while
it
was
very
easy
drinking
and
i
would
have
again
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
the
upper
echelon
o
really
enjoyed
this
wish
i
could
stock
my
fridge
with
this
beer
this
summer
i
hope
to
get
to
drink
it
again
either
that
or
that
my
favorite
local
breweries
looking
at
you
pipeworks
would
start
perfecting
their
own
ipls
great
beer
o
its
a
great
example
of
a
ipl
a
style
i
wish
more
breweries
would
tinker
with
o
an
impressively
hoppy
lager
with
huge
aromas
of
citrus
and
a
crisp
balanced
taste
great
price
point
to
boot
more
than
worthy
of
a
purchase
o
good
beer
but
very
bitter
which
makes
it
more
dry
than
i
would
like
leans
more
towards
bitter
pine
grassy
notes
than
the
citrus
o
it
looks
and
smells
good
tastes
ok
but
has
no
body
it
needs
an
element
to
tie
it
together
it
is
a
light
tasting
lager
one
second
then
a
hop
bomb
the
next
not
bad
though

plenty

is

than
most
o
the
best
ipl
on

market
great
beer
and
a
must
try
for
all
beer
lovers
excellent
job
jacks
abby
oa
great
lager
beer
with
nice
ipa
characteristics
and
good
balance
great
drinking
beer
wow
very
solid
brew
here
it
doesnt
really
exhibit
the
normal
characteristics
youd
expect
from
a
lager
mainly
because
the
identifiable
yeast
flavors
are
mostly
covered
up
by
the
hops
you
could
easily
mistake
this
beer
as
an
ipa
the
only
real
telltale
sign
is
the
dry
crispiness
in
the
end
nevertheless
this
one
shows
exceptional
balance
and
great
execution
for
a
very
drinkable
hoppyass
brew
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
an
impressive
white
head
speaking
of
impressive
the
nose
on
this
lager
is
a
big
surprise
grapefruit
and
pine
a
plenty
a
nice

mouthfeel
that
has
adequate
carbonation
and
dryness

the
finish
paves
the
way
for
grapefruit
pine
and
floral
flavors
make
this
extremely
drinkable
lager
very
tasty
aroma
is
simply
amazing
i
was
not
expecting
this
crazy
cotton
candy
and
pine
hop
aromas
with
a
crisp
lager
clean
finish
taste
is
very
similar
sweet
candy
and
pine
hop
some
pineapple
there
is
a
certain
crispness
and
hearty
mouthfeel
must
be
the
lager
but
works
so
well
with
the
crazy
hop
presence
its
not
bitter
at
all
but
has
fantastic
flavor
great
great
brew
overall
this
was
one
refreshing
and
delicious
ipl
i
love
the
fact
that
it
has
the
smellstastes
of
an
ipa
with
light
body
of
lager
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
little
bitterness
on
the
back
end
from
the
hops
a
great
beer
that
i
recommend
to
all
and
i
cant
wait
to
enjoy
the
remaining
bottles
from
the
4pack

i
could
drink
this
beer
any
time
and
be
absolutely
happy
a
well
done
lager
which
should
be
a
model
to
others
in
the
style
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
some
of
this
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
humid
summer
day
here
in
chicago
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
had
it
with
my
dinner
and
it
has
enough
flavor
to
stand
on
its
own
against
a
nice
thai
curry
but
it
is
also
light
enough
that
i
dont
feel
full
after
drinking
it
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
jacks
abby
next
time
i
visit
relatives
in
the
ne

some

a

the
citrus
aroma
reminds
me
of
lemon
lime
hard
candies
get
the
malts
immediately
on
he
sip
then
a
huge
blast
of
citrus
more
grapefruit
than
the
nose
suggested
earthy
underneath
nice
hit
of
bitterness
not
overwhelming
tiny
bit
of
breadiness
or
yeast
slightly
toasty
flavor
hits
and
passes
quickly
and
grapefruit
and
maybe
mango
linger
just
a
bit
very
clean
and
refreshing
light
on
the
palate
finishes
dry
and
makes
you
want
more
the
carbonation
is
light
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
and
can
see
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
subtle
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
well
balanced
another
winner
from
jacks
abby
overall
a
very
tasty
lager
very
refreshing
and
super
drinkable
would
be
a
treat
on
a
warm
day
big
thanks
goes
out
to
msquared2
for
sharing
this
one
during
one
of
our
random
sunday
tastings
served
from
bottle
into
sweetwater
15th
anniversary
snifter
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
earth
hop
marijuana
fruit
hop
and
pine
resin
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
marijuana
pine
pine
resin
earth
hop
and
spicy
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
there
were
quite
a
few
different
components
going
on
in
both
the
nose
and
flavor
of
this
one
that
really
kept
me
on
my
toes
with
having
a
few
brews
from
this
brewery
that
night
i
can
honestly
say
that
they
have
aromas
pinned
down
with
just
a
little
more
robustness
this
could
definitely
be
a
standout
for
the
style
i
suggest
you
get
your
hands
on
some
of
these
or
other
brews
from
them
if
you
get
the
chance
you
wont
regret
it
o
this
is
a
really
nice
lager
its
crazy
how
these
guys
get
so
much
flavor
in
these
beers
youd
never
think
that
theyre
lagers
im
not
trying
to
badmouth
lagers
its
just
that
ales
tend
to
have
more
complex
flavor
arrangements
than
lagers
not
so
with
jacks
abby
a
major
plus
with
these
beers
is
that
they
still
have
the
nice
clean
refreshing
feel
of
a
lager
with
the
vast
range
of
flavors
of
an
ale
really
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
completely
understand
the
hype
my
only
gripe
is
that
a
lager
shouldnt
be
so
high
in
abv
when
i
chose
to
drink
a
lager
or
pilsner
i
do
it
usually
to
not
have
such
a
high
abv
beer
notwithstanding
that
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
incredibly
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
would
choose
over
most
ipas
just
fantastic
golden
mostly
clear
with
a
sticky
rocky
white
head
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
with
little
bubbles
clinging
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
really
like
the
smell
grassy
weedy
lemony
i
take
a
big
easy
swig
and
its
very
refreshing
earthy
crisp
and
bitter
this
can
quench
a
thirst
and
a
buzz
nice
finish
though
i
could
use
a
little
more
carbo
i
love
lagers
so
im
lucky
enough
to
live
in
the
distro
zone
seek
this
one
out
overall
this
one
smelled
fantastic
but
i
thought
the
taste
fell
a
bit
short
it
was
still
quite
good
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
fantastic
id
have
more
to
see
if
my
opinion
changes
overall
hoponius
is
the
first
india
pale
lager
i
have
had
and
it
was
absolutely
fantastic
the
crispness
derived
from
the
lager
yeast
certainly
make
this
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
around
it
was
40
degrees
celsius
today
and
this
just
hit
the
spot
i
would
kill
for
this
to
be
my
summer
staple
i
feel
like
this
level
of
crispness
and
refreshment
can
be
found
in
a
topfermented
ipa
theres
really
nothing
exclusive
or
interesting
about
this
beer
being
an
ipl
i
enjoy
it
its
wellmade
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
reach
for
a
lager
when
i
feel
like
drinking
something
more
traditionally
german
or
czech
when
i
want
hops
i
reach
for
a
local
dryhopped
ale
that
can
be
consumed
within
weeks
after
fermentation
not
months
if
i
lived
in
framingham
id
get
growlers
of
this
beer
and
be
slightly
confused
but
pleasantly
drunk
3
5
o
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
beer
as
ive
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
it
i
have
to
say
i
was
pretty
underwhelmed
by
it
ill
definitely
give
it
another
try
in
a
bottle
but
it
was
a
bit
too
thinbodied
and
dry
for
my
tastes
overall
these
lagers
jacks
abby
makes
are
some
of
the
greatest
beers
today
affordable
and
oh
so
delicious
the
hoponius
union
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
wish
i
could
drink
more
regularly
ill
be
blunt
and
open
with
the
end
of
this
review
hoponius
union
is
exceptional
jacks
abby
has
certainly
taken
a
step
in
the
right
direction
with
this
beer
and
other
breweries
could
certainly
learn
from
their
ideas
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
earthy
herbal
and
cheesy
with
plenty
of
bitterness
and
a
veggie
hop
flavoring
i
would
have
this
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
variation
of
style
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
substance
to
make
it
worth
pounding
down
for
a
whole
evening
so
i
guess
this
brew
is
an
apl
or
an
ipl
either
way
it
seems
to
be
an
ale
inspired
lager
thanks
to
cbeer88
for
sending
this
one
my
way
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
and
orange
fluffy
white
head
forms
and
retains
nicely
heavy
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
features
lemon
earthy
pine
and
grass
very
hoppy
with
notes
of
cracker
underneath
the
taste
starts
with
a
touch
of
malty
graininess
followed
by
a
touch
of
sweetness
then
comes
a
wave
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
form
of
grass
and
pine
it
finishes
off
with
more
cracker
and
bread
notes
very
nice
range
of
flavors
here
with
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
appropriate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
lager
i
could
get
in
to
definitely
one
to
try
for
the
hop
heads
out
there
o
big
fan
for
many
reasons
gratifying
and
very
pleasurable
beer
from
a
ma
brewery
with
some
ingredients
from
ma
thank
you
kellys
package
store
o
jackss
abby
knows
lagers
and
this
is
the
best
one
ive
tried
from
them
yet
takes
the
best
elements
of
an
indian
pale
ale
and
a
pale
lager
to
create
an
incredibly
delicious
and
sessionable
beer
o
despite
the
disappointment
of
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
drink
with
big
time
hoppiness
in
a
leaner
package
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
and
lagery
yellow
with
slight
amber
and
golding
while
appearing
very
clean
in
the
body
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
that
appears
creamy
and
soft
on
top
and
leaves
sticky
patches
of
splattering
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
carbonation
is
steady
but
not
torrential
and
this
beer
looks
nice
and
clean
with
the
just
the
slightest
hint
of
haze
appearing
in
the
beer
on
the
nose
this
beer
is
everything
you
would
want
it
to
be
big
and
resiny
with
a
smell
that
just
begs
for
the
nose
to
be
shoved
in
it
sticky
pine
melds
with
faint
lemon
citrus
mango
passion
fruit
big
grassy
notes
and
a
faint
light
hint
of
sweet
biscuit
bread
the
beer
has
a
great
smell
and
is
probably
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
smelled
on
the
taste
the
beer
is
superb
it
begins
surprisingly
malty
with
grassy
and
cereal
notes
before
opening
into
biscuity
malts
and
then
big
bitter
hits
and
snuggles
into
the
cavities
of
your
mouth
grass
is
huge
in
the
hop
flavor
providing
perfect
balance
to
creamy
malts
which
linger
in
the
sides
of
your
mouth
even
as
the
bitter
bites
pine
and
citrus
also
are
present
in
the
hops
and
provide
lovely
flavors
reminiscent
of
a
west
coast
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
slightly
crisp
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitters
to
kiss
the
tongue
even
as
the
beer
takes
on
a
creamy
feel
as
it
caresses
your
mouth
the
mouth
is
left
dry
and
bitter
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
on
the
tongue
while
slight
trickles
of
saliva
run
on
along
the
sides
of
the
mouth
overall
this
beer
is
superb
a
new
style
perfectly
created
i
have
been
hearing
so
many
calls
for
an
india
pale
lager
from
so
many
people
in
the
craft
beer
world
that
i
just
figured
it
wasnt
doable
and
yet
here
hoponius
union
sits
as
just
that
ipa
lovers
should
try
this
beer
lager
lovers
should
try
this
beer
and
everyone
should
try
this
beer
it
is
superb
and
represents
the
perfect
union
and
balance
between
hops
malts
and
the
cleanbeerfeel
that
lager
yeast
creates
just
like
this
country
is
the
perfect
union
of
all
that
other
stuff
try
this
beer
mouth
is
light
dry
and
somewhat
piney
staying
in
the
front
of
the
mouthtongue
actually
stays
there
for
a
while
without
being
resiny
or
oily
clean
overall
a
real
memorable
and
impressive
take
on
a
style
worth
trying
again
quite
enjoyable
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
overall
4
5
overall
id
say
this
beer
kinda
kicks
ass
i
dont
think
ive
enjoyed
a
lager
this
much
since
i
was
about
seven
deep
during
my
sophomore
year
and
that
was
for
entirely
different
reasons
it
brings
the
hops
in
a
very
clear
balanced
way
its
not
blindingly
bitter
but
has
plenty
of
hop
strength
and
character
enough
to
give
lots
of
hop
bombs
a
run
for
their
money
flavorwise
and
the
composition
of
the
hop
profile
is
excellent
as
for
the
malt
its
very
welldone
and
balanced
just
rightbready
crackery
not
sweet
by
any
means
but
solid
and
welldefined
and
finally
its
clearly
a
lagera
fantastic
one
that
fact
that
you
can
get
4packs
of
0
5l
bottles
of
this
for
about
11
is
almost
criminal
if
you
see
it
buy
it
and
drink
as
soon
as
you
can
damn
a
flavorful
hopdriven
lager
that
is
by
no
means
boring
for
beer
this
may
be
the
definition
of
refreshing
o
this
is
a
really
solid
hoppy
beer
and
definitely
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
o
hot
damn
this
puts
all
other
lagers
to
shame
an
excellent
twist
on
the
style
its
like
if
an
ipa
bred
with
a
pale
lager
this
would
be
its
super
offspring
all
you
lager
haters
out
there
this
will
change
your
mind
im
most
certain
cheers
to
jacks
abby
o
im
loving
this
brewery
this
beer
takes
lager
to
a
whole
new
level
definitely
a
lager
ipa
and
freaking
great
at
that
definitely
check
this
out
thanks
again
michael
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
youre
looking
for
heady
and
get
disappointed
in
the
chase
bm
me
and
ill
send
you
this
for
locals
instead
of
buying
the
world
a
coke
id
buy
it
an
hoponius
union
poured
into
a
squatters
true
pint
glass
a
very
nice
cloudy
dark
golden
yellow
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
onefinger

creamy
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
hoppy
malty
with
a
nice
citrus
note
the
taste
is
hoppy
nice
little
touch
of
malts
and
some
citrus
notes
medium
body
with
a
nice
slightly
drybitter
finish
overall
a
very
nice
brew
thanks
bill
great
beer
not
to
compare
to
others
but
i
look
at
this
beer
as
sort
of
a
heady
topper
jr
similar
hopping
and
flavor
just
not
as
big
in
any
aspect
i
prefer
a
bit
more
hop
assertiveness
in
my
brew
but
overall
this
is
a
nice
light
drinker
and
a
good
beer
cheers
o
very
impressed
with
this
this
is
my
first
beer
from
jacks
abby
and
im
really
happy
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
one
of
the
most
interesting
yellow
fizzy
beers
ive
had
jack
hendler
you
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
sir
a
constant
space
reserved
in
this
in
the
fridge
for
this
either
bottle
or
growler
d
much
more
drinkable
than
i
would
have
thoughtalmost
too
much
so
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
bite
still
if
youre
looking
for
a
lager
that
tastes
like
an
ipa
this
is
your
beer
from
the
chilled
bottle
into
the
big
tumbler
i
see
a
clear
golden
light
amber
colored
lager
with
a
decent
but
broken
fluffy
white
head
with
healthy
lacing
the
aroma
makes
itself
known
quickly
from
a
distance
with
a
decidedly
tart
citrus
hop
and
biscuit
base
very
impressive
and
unlike
any
lager
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
before
other
than
this
same
brew
on
tap
the
flavor
is
such
a
pleasure
with
more
of
the
same
biscuit
and
citrus
hop
blend
and
maybe
some
rye
grain
and
light
grass
ideas
its
peppery
tart
and
clean
with
a
light
but
lively
carbonation
that
offers
an
effervescent
feel
over
a
medium
body
more
grass
and
grapefruit
lemon
pours
over
the
tongue
with
quite
some
bite
especially
unheard
of
for
a
lager
but
as
the
label
explains
this
is
simply
a
lagered
ipa
and
the
unique
flavors
are
definitely
successful
and
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
hops
subtle
citrus
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
starts
slightly
bitter
up
front
with
huge
hops
following
the
flavor
finishes
bitter
and
sticks
around
through
the
aftertaste
a
solid
flavor
that
doesnt
have
many
complexities
and
doesnt
change
much
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
almost
heavy
like
chewing
on
hops
this
is
a
solid
ipa
definitely
like
sucking
on
some
hops
there
isnt
much
more
to
this
beer
than
that
but
that
is
ok
because
it
is
done
well
palate
this
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
an
ipa
albeit
an
unusually
clean
and
light
one
bitterness
is
mild
but
there
are
big
hop
flavors
it
leans
toward
the
floral
side
of
things
centennial
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
stone
fruit
theres
a
touch
of
coarse
grain
flavor
though
its
a
very
dry
very
hop
forward
beer
overall
within
the
ipl
style
id
say
this
is
a
notch
below
humulus
lager
and
probably
fathom
as
well
but
its
a
delicious
beer
nonetheless
and
id
drink
it
often
were
it
local
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
hoppy
lager
ive
been
pretty
impressed
with
their
beers
and
this
might
be
the
best
one
ive
had
so
far
tons
of
hops
and
fruit
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
6
7
abv
would
love
to
have
it
again
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
tremendous
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
a
very
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
and
plenty
of
floral
notes
to
go
with
it
there
are
some
pine
notes
to
it
as
well
as
a
light
grass
note
very
little
in
terms
of
malt
the
palate
is
on
the
dry
side
with
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
to
it
citrus
fruit
and
peel
lots
of
floral
notes
pine
and
a
hint
of
grass
just
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
cracker
malt
flavor
very
well
done
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
my
only
review
of
a
lager
yet
the
brewers
up
in
the
north
east
sure
take
brewing
to
a
new
level
best
lager
ive
had
notes
its
drinkable
and
the
citrus
notes
add
a
good
touch
cheers
clean
delicious
and
refershing
love
the
idea
of
an
ipl
its
almost
like
performing
without
a
safety
next
because
there
is
no
fruity
ale
yeast
esters
to
cover
up
any
inbalances
great
beer
and
would
buy
again
ah
yes
perfect
for
ipa
day
i
guess
it
is
an
ipl
but
whose
counting
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
a
near
perfect
example
of
an
ipl
great
style
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
highly
recommended
flavor
has
some
grainy
sweetness
though
light
theres
lots
of
citrus
here
with
a
hint
of
tropicality
too
mostly
though
its
piney
pithy
resiny
hoppage
hitting
the
palate
has
plenty
of
bitterness
but
finishes
dryly
would
personally
like
a
tad
more
balancing
sweetness
but
this
is
solid
nonetheless
prosit
1484
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fresh
hop
flavor
and
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
distinctive
taste
superb
when
warming
very
much
redefining
what
a
lager
can
be
lots
of
great
hoppy
flavors
typical
in
an
ipa
along
with
the
crisp
finish
of
a
lager
definitely
recommended
bites
big
and
juicy
in
the
front
has
that
pungent
well
pungent
taste
right
up
the
malty
middle
sort
of
cheesy
nutty
grainy
trails
out
with
a
familiar
but
pleasant
and
mild
grapefruit
pith
that
brings
you
back
for
more
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
and
feel
that
i
am
inadequate
at
sketching
out
here
slick
and
wildly
drinkable
just
great
i
cant
believe
ive
had
5
beers
from
a
place
ive
never
tried
and
ive
absolutely
loved
4
of
them
these
guys
are
hitting
hard
more
jacks
abby
o
you
got
to
try
this
the
appearance
and
taste
are
both
good
but
the
aroma
and
feel
really
bring
this
together
theyve
taken
the
best
part
of
ipa
and
best
part
of
lagers
and
combined
them
to
make
magic
3
a
pint
bottle
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
by
jacks
abby
interesting
yet
not
overly
complex
and
certainly
one
of
their
best
but
everything
they
make
is
pretty
solid
definitely
worth
seeking
out
also
a
great
brewery
and
great
people
get
out
there
if
you
can
overall
just
when
i
thought
i
had
tried
just
about
anything
along
comes
this
twist
on
a
lager
that
is
just
a
superb
drinker
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
is
very
enjoyable
but
pretty
much
drinks
like
a
good
tropical
danky
ipa
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
but
i
do
wish
lager
qualities
were
there
more
to
spice
things
up
o
clearly
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
but
just
a
great
beer
overall
well
done
jacks
abby
this
is
superb
overall
a
slam
dunk
keeper
in
my
book
flavorful
and
bold
yet
light
enough
that
having
a
few
in
a
row
wont
put
you
down
for
the
count
such
a
drinkable
brew
unquestionably
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
cervoise
pours
a
semihazy
straw
gold
with
a
bright
white
creamy
half
inch
head
nose
is
clean
light
and
bright
and
expresses
citrus
zest
a
slightly
earthy
character
and
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
addition
of
some
hops
bittering
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
pleasant
palate
cleansing
acidity
overall
im
not
sure
if
i
can
rate
this
beer
to
style
as
i
think
it
is
a
bit
more
of
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
nonetheless
this
is
an
excellent
and
extremely
drinkable
brew
i
see
a
trip
to
the
brewery
in
my
near
future
if
i
could
find
these
easier
it
would
be
my
everyday
beer
i
just
works
on
so
many
levels
it
rings
all
levels
on
my
palate
front
to
back
overall
i
will
be
seeking
out
this
style
during
the
warm
weather
months
i
am
really
impressed
by
this
east
coast
brewery
great
beer
500ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
ornage
color
with
an
inch
of
thick
frothy
head
lots
of
lacing
big
hop
aroma
grassy
and
citrus
hops
slightly
tropical
as
well
maybe
mango
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
the
aroma
but
its
still
hoppy
grassy
upfront
with
some
citrus
notes
hints
of
the
tropical
fruits
bitter
grassy
finish
orange
peel
aftertaste
creamy
crisp
mouthfeel
this
tastes
like
a
hopped
up
lager
overall
certainly
worth
having
again
do
im
not
sure
how
true
to
style
this
is
but
damn
its
tasty
thanks
4daloveofstout
o
i
was
not
expecting
much
as
this
was
an
extra
in
a
trade
but
it
blew
my
mind
crazy
good
and
highly
recommended
o
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
by
jacks
abby
and
boy
is
it
a
winner
the
use
of
the
lager
yeast
here
really
puts
the
raw
hop
profile
front
and
center
with
no
distractions
its
american
hops
as
youve
never
tasted
them
before
a
hopheads
delight
and
a
very
interesting
and
most
welcome
change
of
pace
o
not
my
cup
o
tea
just
too
hoppy
and
overthetop
to
enjoy
much
of
i
opened
a
pliny
the
elder
directly
after
this
and
it
seemed
to
be
more
balanced
and
enjoyable
then
this
beer
which
says
a
lot
to
me
right
there
this
is
an
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
lots
of
hops
but
enough
malt
to
balance
out
the
flavor
wow
all
around
this
beer
is
clean
tasty
and
full
of
flavor
but
not
so
overpowering
that
you
couldnt
session
a
couple
of
them
and
the
best
part
the
pint
bottle
runs
2
95
at
my
local
2
95
for
a
spectacular
local
craft
these
guys
are
a
bit
under
the
radar
right
now
but
not
for
long
get
in
now
so
you
can
say
you
were
there
when
o
great
brew
i
believe
the
hype
has
the
hoppyness
of
a
big
west
coast
ipa
great
body
complex
very
bright
tasting
never
had
a
lager
quite
like
it
get
some
fresh
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
with
a
medium
white
head
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
citrus
hops
combined
with
a
more
traditional
lager
aroma
very
interesting
but
doesnt
stand
out
the
flavor
however
is
a
different
story
the
blend
of
hops
here
is
absolutely
incredible
and
the
lager
base
really
supports
it
so
much
better
than
i
could
have
expected
its
a
great
citrus
hops
flavor
and
i
would
never
know
its
a
lager
flavorwise
as
it
tastes
more
like
something
along
the
lines
of
zombie
dust
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
incredibly
impressive
quite
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
before
the
best
hoppy
lager
ive
had
if
my
friend
can
get
me
fresh
4packs
this
beer
is
going
to
be
a
summer
staple
in
my
fridge
another
satisfying
jacks
abby
lager
great
west
coast
hop
profile
and
very
drinkable
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
steadily
carbonated
coppergolden
coloring
with
a
low
profile
thin
offwhite
filmy
coating
aromas
of
resiny
hops
with
basil
and
hemp
characteristics
as
well
as
a
slight
peppering
flavors
are
hop
forward
with
that
heavy
pepperbasil
combo
blasting
the
tastebuds
light
toasted
backbone
supports
the
hops
presence
and
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
in
mouth
great
cling
along
the
glass
as
you
go
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
bitter
with
a
slight
floral
highlight
resiny
bitter
finish
with
the
clean
feel
typical
of
a
lager
very
tasty
this
is
an
insanely
good
beer
that
lives
up
to
my
expectations
and
would
be
outstanding
on
tap
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again
considering
its
reasonable
price
local
availability
and
the
unique
style
it
offers
odabsolutely
love
this
beer
it
is
so
unique
but
does
not
sacrifice
incredible
flavor
in
order
to
stand
out
as
a
uniquely
crafted
brew
shockingly
hoppy
also
a
halfliter
bottle
comes
in
at
2
50
what
an
absolute
steal
jacks
abby
is
amazing
this
beer
really
made
me
happy
you
gotta
try
this
this
is
a
very
smooth
lager
with
a
strong
hop
bite
which
takes
this
beer
out
of
the
style
nevertheless
this
is
an
exceptionally
easytodrink
beer
the
aftertaste
is
a
long
lasting
bite
of
bittering
hop
the
body
is
rich
for
a
lager
but
the
carbonation
provides
decent
balance
i
liked
this
alot
with
the
traditional
style
and
the
hoppy
twist
very
drinkable
for
all
seasons
mouthfeel
is
also
great
light
crisp
body
with
moderate
to
full
carbonation
exceptional
brew
from
an
exceptional
brewery
get
it
if
you
see
it
m
light
leading
to
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
o
great
brew
its
like
one
of
the
best
ipas
i
can
think
of
but
it
has
the
smoothness
and
drinkability
of
a
lager
its
the
best
of
both
worlds
really
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
what
else
could
you
ask
for
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
it
didnt
say
it
was
a
lager
on
the
bottle
or
the
tap
list
when
ive
had
it
on
draft
i
would
think
it
was
an
ipa
or
a
highly
hopped
apa
it
drinks
very
clean
and
seems
to
have
no
room
for
error
the
fact
that
its
as
good
as
it
is
shows
the
craftsmanship
that
has
been
put
into
it
definitely
a
beer
ill
be
returning
to
over
and
over
o
this
was
definitely
an
interesting
brew
a
mix
between
a
lager
and
an
ipa
on
the
bottle
label
they
say
that
they
use
lager
yeast
fermentation
while
the
beer
is
cold
and
then
age
it
with
west
coast
ipa
hops
for
extended
periods
of
time
this
definitely
creates
an
unique
flavor
that
is
a
mix
in
taste
between
your
typical
lager
and
a
west
coast
ipa
it
smells
just
like
your
typical
west
coast
ipa
and
has
the
citrusy
taste
but
also
has
the
typical
lager
taste
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
was
too
excited
by
the
taste
of
this
beer
since
it
was
a
little
bit
different
then
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
and
by
the
end
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
would
definitely
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
and
im
sure
you
will
enjoy
it
o
shhh
this
lager
thinks
its
an
ipa
dont
tell
it
i
havent
had
a
lager
this
hoppy
since
fresh
southern
tier
krampus
never
heard
of
this
brewer
before
and
im
already
looking
forward
to
next
years
batch
very
unique
and
dialed
in
for
the
hoppy
ipa
heads
very
well
done
o
this
is
a
great
beer
if
i
had
not
know
it
going
in
i
dot
think
i
would
have
ever
figured
it
for
an
east
coast
lager
deffinatly
wouldve
taken
it
for
a
west
coast
ipa
and
a
damn
good
one
at
that
o
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
worth
a
buy
for
sure
so
glad
to
see
a
lager
with
that
citrusy
west
coast
hop
flavor
huge
marks
for
creativity
well
worth
seeking
out
o
loved
it
very
impressed
had
been
hoping
to
try
this
beer
for
sometime
and
jumped
at
the
chance
when
i
saw
it
on
tap
and
was
not
disappointed
pale
yellow
in
color
has
a
hint
of
hopcitrus
aroma
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
of
maltiness
bitterness
and
aroma
hops
the
citrus
hop
flavor
is
fairly
prominent
relative
to
typical
ipas
which
i
like
very
much
the
light
carbonation
made
this
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
good
overall
overall
a
nice
and
smooth
lager
this
one
is
a
lot
hoppier
than
others
in
the
style
better
as
a
beer
than
for
the
style
a
sipper
that
i
will
get
again
but
one
per
sitting
mouthfeel
clean
and
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
medium
carbonation
i
do
feel
that
the
beer
could
have
a
slight
bump
in
carbonation
level
i
love
the
dry
finish
which
really
helps
the
hop
flavors
pop
towards
the
end
the
beer
is
clear
and
golden
hued
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
sparse
lacing
on
the
tulip
lots
of
fresh
hop
character
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
this
drinks
much
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
german
lager
and
while
this
beer
is
tasty
it
does
lack
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
a
dortmunder
lager
the
body
is
light
and
the
finish
is
dry
offering
a
hint
of
lager
yeast
overall
a
tasty
brew
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
just
dont
expect
an
authentic
example
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
have
this
again

clear
golden

with
a
subtle

and
a
bready

finish
slight
fruity
sweetness
from
a
strong
hop
bitterness
not
quite
a
real
dortmunder
but
an
expectional
lageripa
hybrid
really
enjoyed
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
a
little
sweet
moderately
bitter
on
the
finish
and
quite
hoppy
in
the
midpalate
i
really
like
this
beer
very
good
id
have
a
lot
more
of
this
if
available
to
me
the
boys
at
jacks
abby
have
redefined
what
a
lager
can
be
this
beer
competes
with
and
beats
many
of
the
best
ipas
in
the
country
i
cannot
wait
to
see
what
these
guys
come
up
with
next
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
as
it
goes
down
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
brings
some
nice
tropical
fruits
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
resin
there
as
well
the
flavor
profile
is
along
the
same
line
and
is
really
fantastic
beautiful
fruits
and
a
nice
hoppiness
throughout
moderate
bitterness
throughout
and
a
dry
finish
body
is
fairly
light
finish
is
fantastic
this
is
a
very
very
impressive
beer
chewy
pine
resin
with
clean
floral
finish
makes
me
want
to
drink
another
a
very
fine
beer
it
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
and
its
actually
pretty
hard
to
tell
its
a
lager
a
touch
of
initial
sweetness
turns
into
a
manageable
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
very
well
constructed
this
was
smooth
and
flavorful
i
could
definitely
go
for
a
whole
lot
more
of
this
beer
surprised
i
never
heard
of
it
before
ill
have
to
try
to
stop
here
sometime
in
the
future
on
tap
at
stones
public
house
in
ashland
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
bright
yellow
color
nice
white
head
good
amount
of
carbonation
great
hop
aroma
for
a
lager
taste
was
surprisingly
good
well
balanced
hop
flavor
but
not
overboard
amazing
they
can
pack
that
much
hop
taste
into
a
lager
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
crisp
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
its
easily
their
best
offering
i
have
had
to
date
overall
this
is
the
signature
beer
of
jacks
abby
you
have
to
try
it
never
heard
of
jacks
abbey
until
the
bartender
told
me
had
a
great
time
at
bukowskis
me
jacks
abbey
and
a
live
santana
recording
i
know
this
beer
is
a
lager
but
come
on
this
beer
is
a
pure
resin
ipa
sans
the
ale
yeast
kudos
to
jacks
abby
for
showing
the
world
that
not
all
lagers
need
be
boring
macro
land
this
beer
easily
holds
its
own
the
best
california
resincitric
ipas
if
ja
takes
off
this
will
be
their
flagship
brew
jacks
abby
is
doing
some
great
things
but
this
beer
and
more
specifically
this
pint
was
just
ok
i
hope
to
try
a
growler
of
this
soon
and
with
any
luck
drink
a
more
representative
sample
very
good
beer
an
entirely
worthwhile
eastcost
hoppy
brew
overall
i
loved
it
clean
refreshing
yet
totally
flavorful
full
of
hops
but
doesnt
overwhelm
either
went
great
with
fried
pickle
chips
djust
an
awesome
beer
so
clean
and
yet
so
flavorful
i
would
not
only
drink
this
again
but
i
would
seek
it
out
d
its
a
slightly
smaller
humulus
lager
id
never
heard
of
jacks
abby
but
this
beer
is
for
real
we
obliterated
the
growler
in
record
time
i
would
order
this
all
the
time
if
it
was
local
i
loved
this
beer
its
huge
on
hop
smell
and
taste
and
very
modest
on
the
bitter
side
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
locally
brewed
beer
that
is
made
with
great
skill
quality
ingredients
and
an
adventurous
brewer
i
make
my
own
homebrew
and
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
this
beer
runs
rings
around
prima
pils
imo
seek
it
out
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
additionally
i
know
learn
the
brewery
is
in
framingham
since
this
is
the
next
town
to
where
i
live
i
am
quite
excited
ill
be
looking
to
try
more
of
their
beers
definitely
seek
this
out
overall
easily
the
best
most
well
rounded
beer
currently
offered
by
jacks
abby
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
one
is
the
favorite
of
the
brewer
himself
it
seems
very
well
crafted
and
i
can
imagine
the
recipe
was
tinkered
with
for
many
many
homebrew
batches
before
we
tasted
it
cannot
wait
for
their
wet
hop
lager
coming
out
soon
this
was
a
nice
treat
from
a
brewery
i
had
no
clue
existed
not
an
overly
hoppy
beer
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
my
rating
is
sort
of
a
balance
between
rating
it
a
hoppy
lager
and
an
ipa
i
guess
its
really
an
ipa
at
heart
i
doubt
many
people
would
think
it
was
a
lager
if
they
didnt
know
it
came
out
pretty
rad
if
rated
like
an
ipa
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
its
missing
that
extra
level
of
depth
in
hop
flavor
that
the
big
west
coast
style
ones
have
nevertheless
i
will
be
filling
up
my
growler
every
time
i
hit
up
the
natick
mall
for
some
fresh
kicks
going
into
the
metrowest
area
anyways
why
not
stop
by
a
brand
new
brewery
crystal
clear
and
a
vibrant
yellowgold
big
bubbly
head
about
twothree
fingers
high
nose
is
fresh
floral
hops
smells
like
i
just
cracked
open
a
bag
of
whole
flower
cascade
hops
light
grainy
malt
background
but
that
is
dominated
by
the
hops
flavor
is
just
like
the
nose
grains
are
popping
out
more
crackers
and
biscuit
but
then
the
hops
just
wash
over
all
of
it
fresh
flowery
hops
and
a
lot
of
lemonlime
a
sweet
tartness
but
overall
it
light
and
crisp
very
refreshing
they
called
it
a
india
pale
lager
at
the
brewery
overall
good
great
hop
flavors
but
overpowers
the
nice
lager
underneath
and
a
weird
finish
as
well
as
a
bit
astringent
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
very
nice
hoppy
beer
with
a
good
crisp
bitter
finish
if
youre
around
the
framingham
area
stop
in
and
try
this
one
and
their
other
offerings
plus
the
guys
are
super
friendly
o
very
impressed
this
is
hoppy
like
an
ipa
but
very
clean
awesome
job
on
dry
hopping
the
nose
is
fantastic
very
dank
and
awesome
navel
orange
smell
this
is
something
that
i
will
be
going
back
to
get
another
growler
of
until
the
bottling
line
is
in
place
next
year
medium
bodied
for
the
style
light
overall
finishes
dry
dangerously
drinkable
as
the
almost
7
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
an
excellent
session
later
that
i
could
drink
all
night
overall
this
is
very
nice
i
think
jacks
abby
is
doing
something
different
but
in
the
right
direction
with
this
beer
i
think
a
typical
bud
light
miller
light
or
coors
light
drinker
could
pick
one
of
these
up
on
occasion
and
be
happy
with
it
im
giving
the
beer
a
b
and
an

nice

with

hick
another
good
session
from
jacks
abbey
o
perfect

beer
would
be
fairer
to
label
it
a
light
lager
but
my
rating
reflect
the

otherwise

give
it

a

o
a
great

lager
with
high
drinkability
and
plenty
of
crisp
toasted
malty
notes
very
smooth
lager
flavour
with
fairly
sweet
yet
mellow
malts
and
slight
biscuit
and
nutty
flavours
more
citrus
hops
than
common
for
lagers
but
nicely
balanced
very
well
brewed
but
i
wish
they
had
given
us
a
little
more
overall
a
pretty
great
beer
and
one
i
certainly
would
enjoy
again
however
given
the
availability
of
cheaper
session
ipas
if
i
want
a
hoppy
low
abv
beer
ill
probably
reach
for
one
of
those
over
this
as
i
find
the
lager
style
adds
little
to
no
obvious
complexity
to
the
beer
as
the
lager
subtleties
are
drowned
out
by
the
hops
in
this
one
this
is
the
best
bottled
lager
ive
ever
had
also
its
consistently
delicious
the
tip
of
the
tongue
is
immediately
hit
with
crispness
that
softens
and
spreads
out
over
the
palate
it
gets
fluffy
and
stays
crisp
but
light
the
body
also
light
and
bitterness
adding
a
dry
and
in
a
sense
earthy
aspect
as
it
relates
to
mouthfeel
o
3
50
i
am
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
that
is
what
this
tasted
like
to
me
at
first
it
improved
as
i
continued
drinking
the
taste
got
sweeter
from
the
malts
i
have
really
liked
all
of
the
jacks
abby
beers
but
this
one
i
would
pass
on
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
it
seems
solid
but
it
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
beer
pleasant
and
different
slightly
sweet
o
very
refreshing
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
a
tasty
and
easily
quaffed
lager
availability
yearround
on
tap
at
new
york
pizza
pours
a
translucent
dark
golden
color
with
an
inch
of
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
some
lightly
toasted
malts
with
some
citrus
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
bready
malts
mixed
with
some
grassy
hop
bitterness
some
citrus
near
the
end
with
floral
and
grassy
hop
notes
the
finish
is
more
of
the
malts
with
some
light
bitterness
light
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
watery
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
this
would
be
a
solid
canned
session
beer
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
still
good
though
overall
not
the
best
jacks
abby
has
to
offer
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
strech
of
the
imagination
the
taste
is
very
good
with
lagerlike
malt
flavor
with
slight
dank
hops
which
are
herbal
and
the
toasted
grain
supports
this
combination
well
with
light
earthy
weed
hoppiness
and
low
sweetness
in
the
taste
with
a
dry
finish
and
light
resinous
aspect
that
adds
a
citrus
tanginess
with
gentle
yeast
in
the
finish
with
mild
caramel
quality
from
the
malt
overall
i
consider
this
well
above
average
for
the
style
very
good
hop
flavor
in
a
sessionable
lager
strength
with
a
slight
raw
hop
quality
looks
like
a
lager
and
tastes
like
a
lager
very
limited
bitterness
nice
bready
malt
sweetness
no
off
flavors
that
sometimes
pair
with
craft
lagers
this
beer
is
clean
and
crisp
and
very
enjoyable
on
a
warm
day
jacks
abby
makes
really
well
crafted
lager
bodies
which
show
in
the
smooth
mouthfeel
reminds
me
a
lot
of
new
glarus
lagers
which
is
a
good
thing
o
not
being
a
typical
lager
guy
i
may
have
just
found
my
go
to
lager
o
super
easy
to
drink
fairly
flavourful
for
a
pale
malt
no
offflavours
enjoyable
nailed
it
nice
deep
golden
color
ill
have
to
pour
the
next
one
so
i
get
a
good
look
at
the
head
cascades
on
the
nose
maybe
a
little
grapefruit
light
fruity
hops
up
front
clean
slightly
toasty
finish
there
is
that
grapefruit
again
nice
body
a
terrific
lager
o
very
nice
beer
again
sort
of
unique
tasting
the
combination
of
american
hops
and
german
lager
taste
is
interesting
and
tasty
i
would
order
this
again
easy
but
you
can
taste
the
quality
a
lager
not
a
pils
so
only
20
ibus
no
matter
what
i
want
it
to
be
yet
also
thin
and
underdeveloped
ive
had
this
idea
done
better
i
e
session
lager
bottle
picked
up
locally
enjoyed
from
a
jacks
abby
snifter
brew
pours
a
soft
transparent
yellow
orange
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
gone
quick
nose
is
subtle
pilsner
malt
with
a
hint
of
grain
taste
is
also
fairly
mellow
a
true
session
lager
but
well
made
malty
with
a
lager
bite
overall
hmm
its
hard
to
rate
this
one
i
think
they
really
hit
their
mark
with
making
a
highly
drinkable
sessionable
beer
id
like
to
have
more
out
of
this
beer
but
based
on
what
they
were
going
for
i
think
they
really
did
a
great
job
light
hop
presence
small
input
from
the
lager
yeast
moderate
but
light
malts
how
do
i
feel
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
out
of
a
random
100
beers
but
i
think
they
accomplished
what
they
were
going
for
and
for
that
i
say
kudos
overall
the
smell
was
the
best
thing
about
this
for
me
if
i
wanted
to
get
drunk
id
go
for
it
but
truthfully
might
go
to
other
mass
produced
american
lagers
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
definitely
the
jacks
abbey
i
like
the
least
so
far
although
i
havent
reviewed
many
i
really
like
great
lagers
this
just
isnt
one
great
beer
awesome
alternative
to
the
name
your
session
ipa
beers
completely
clean
fresh
and
packed
with
character
overall
a
very
enjoyable
apl
from
the
framingham
bros
this
is
going
to
be
a
good
warm
weather
beer
simply
put
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
wonderful
hop
aroma
of
citrus
tropical
fruit
and
freshcut
grass
weaves
beautifully
into
a
canvas
of
mild
cracker
and
bread
undertones
layered
with
very
light
bitterness
and
american
hop
notes
everything
is
balanced
extremely
well
which
beckons
one
to
quaff
as
many
pints
as
he
or
she
wants
to
if
this
isnt
the
epitome
of
a
worldclass
session
beer
its
damn
close
easily
beats
most
lagers
in
the
drinkability
category
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
flavor
coming
from
this
brewer
compared
to
some
of
this
brewerys
other
offerings
this
is
more
of
a
standard
munich
style
lager
but
its
one
of
the
best
renditions
ive
had
on
the
style
thus
far
in
america
i
could
easily
stock
up
on
this
during
the
warmer
months
in
spite
of
its
light
crisp
feel
in
a
world
propelled
with
breweries
trying
to
outdo
each
other
with
high
gravity
ridiculous
recipes
this
is
a
nice
breath
of
fresh
air
for
now
clear
light
gold
colour
with
a
thin
whitish
cap
good
head
retention
kind
of
sticky
bright
lemony
aroma
citrus
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
doughy
malt
really
nice
tangerines
up
front
toasted
malt
slight
greengrassy
hop
character
slight
spice
short
finish
with
minty
bitterness
lingering
on
the
palate
light
bodied
average
co2
offdry
quite
good
and
very
refreshing
the
flavor
follows
with
a
bit
of
citrus
but
mostly
grassy
lager
hops
it
has
a
substantial
bready
malt
in
there
a
well
made
beer
in
the
line
of
pilsners
and
helles
traditional
in
flavor
but
nothing
surprising
there
is
a
citrusy
orange
and
apple
taste
up
front
the
hop
finish
is
mild
hut
lingers
it
works
for
the
style
overall
this
would
be
a
great
deck
beer
in
the
summer
loads
of
flavor
with
a
low
enough
abv
to
enjoy
the
whole
sixer
on
a
warm
day
the
palate
is
what
youd
expect
from
the
description
a
really
nice
blend
of
bready
and
doughy
malt
with
a
touch
of
honey
this
is
pretty
refreshing
the
mid
palate
brings
the
hops
to
the
forefront
with
a
moderate
bitterness
and
mild
citrus
character
bready
on
the
finish
with
a
clean
lingering
bitterness
this
beer
is
medium
light
in
body
and
is
crisply
carbonated
the
carbonation
does
have
a
mild
acidity
that
doesnt
wholly
work
with
the
sweeter
malt
flavors
imo
a
delightful
little
beer
o
an
ideal
session
beer
exactly
as
its
label
suggests
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
modest
carbonation
a
very
clean
crisp
and
enjoyable
offering
that
i
could
effortlessly
throw
a
few
pints
back
without
getting
bogged
down
this
is
worth
seeking
out
o
so
this
is
what
a
very
good
american
pale
lager
can
taste
like
a
great
postlawnmowing
beer
or
one
to
have
when
youre
having
more
than
one
if
this
were
a
little
cheaper
id
buy
it
by
the
case
in
the
summer
if
it
finished
just
a
bit
more
crisp
then
i
would
be
completely
enamored
with
this
beer
as
it
is
im
still
quite
happy
with
it
sort
of
mix
of
helles
but
not
as
soft
and
a
pils
but
not
as
crispy
hoppy
lives
up
to
its
session
lager
goal
but
id
prefer
something
more
true
to
either
style
i
mentioned
o
excellent
lager
like
the
idea
this
is
a
session
at
4
5
one
of
the
better
craft
lagers
ive
enjoyed
if
you
dont
like
lagers
drink
this
and
you
will
solid

a

along

spicy
grassy
line
joined
by
some

clean
and
pretty
light
obviously
real
easy
to
drink
though
i
wish
the
malt
came
through
a
bit
more
nice
head
for
a
lager
about
an
inch
high
golden
straw

aroma
is
lightly

refreshing

consume
yes
sessionable
indeed
fresh
crackery
bread
malt
and
zesty
floral

in
the

fresh
simple
and
well
done
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
a
great
easy
drinking
session
lager
from
jacks
abby
their
flagship
i
believe
looks
and
smells
good
taste
is
too
light
you
could
chug
a
lug
a
lot
of
this
beer
without
a
heavy
taste
interfering
with
your
quaffing
very
lightly
hopped
the
hop
flavor
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
malt
good
for
a
lager
not
what
i
usually
drink
but
it
definitely
hits
the
spot
today
o
an
ok
lager
darker
in
color
and
slightly
tastier
than
the
average
mainstream
lager
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
still
really
liking
jacks
hoponius
union
ipl
and
2nd
anniversary
dipl
though
this
would
be
awesome
in
a
can
its
most
certainly
worth
picking
up
and
would
go
down
well
after
a
long
day
of
yard
work
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
solid
sheet
of
light
cream
foam
smells
of
grassy

with

flavor
is
cereal

slight

some

underneath
it
all
well

overall
flavorful
for
a
session
lager
but
not
all
that
flavorful
independently
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
is
perfectly
sessionable
o
light
session
lager
with
a
touch
of
hop
citrus
this
is
an
easy
drinking
well
balanced
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
one
sitting
had
to
down
grade
my
first
review
nice
aroma
and
color
balance
of
bitter
and
malt
is
very
goodnot
great
mouth
feel
is
the
issue
tastes
dissipates
too
quickly
and
is
watery
its
comparable
to
a
taking
a
lick
off
a
lollipop
there
are
better
and
cheaper
ipls
and
imperial
pilsners
out
there
this
lager
is
crisp
clean
and
smooth
with
a
burst
of
flavorful
floral
hops
and
citrus
up
front
that
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
a
nice
sweet
bready
taste
in
your
mouth
this
is
one
of
the
three
staples
in
jacks
abby
brewerys
yearround
brews
and
rightfully
so
at
4
and
a
half
percent
abv
this
is
their
session
offering
and
compared
to
their
heavy
hitting
black
lager
and
india
pale
lager
it
sure
seems
that
way
but
dont
be
fooled
into
thinking
this
is
just
any
old
regular
lager
because
it
has
the
character
to
prove
otherwise
o
i
only
wish
i
could
sit
down
with
a
friend
and
8
of
these
bottles
for
an
actual
drinking
session
havent
had
one
of
those
in
a

light

follow

make
for

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
take
on
a
style
that
i
otherwise
am
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
would
be
perfect
for
a
session
on
a
warm
day
worth
a
try
o
another
solid
brew
from
ja
doesnt
look
or
feel
like
a
light
session
beer
but
given
the
4
5
there
is
no
arguing
that
it
is
plenty
flavorful
and
very
affordable
get
some
oa
decent
session
lager
but
lacks
a
little
in
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
pinktinted
yellowgold
with
a
huge
head
on
top
that
sits
as
just
slightly
offwhite
in
color
with
some
creamy
and
soapy
bubbles
the
beers
body
is
really
quite
clean
with
a
slow
but
steady
flow
of
bubbles
traveling
to
replenish
the
head
the
beers
lacing
is
fat
and
poofy
like
little
clouds
leaving
a
patchwork
on
my
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
clean
but
surprisingly
layered
and
nuanced
for
this
style
of
beer
it
smells
like
spicy
wheat
bread
alongside
light
touches
of
citrus
and
pine
the
spice
in
the
smell
actually
reminds
me
of
rye
which
is
odd
but
quite
intriguing
the
grainy
wheat
bread
smell
has
lovely
light
nuances
of
caramel
and
cereal
grains
which
further
add
to
the
complexity
of
the
smells
on
the
tongue
the
beers
taste
follows
the
nose
and
adds
to
it
with
decadent
cereal
grain
and
wheat
notes
and
very
light
kiss
of
hops
to
balance
the
beer
out
this
is
what
a
pale
lager
should
taste
like
the
taste
begins
with
a
citrus
pine
bite
that
has
you
thinking
ipa
but
that
is
quickly
gentled
and
washed
away
by
sweet
wheat
flake
flavors
which
blossom
into
caramelly
and
cereal
flavors
with
a
touch
of
succulent
wood
flavoring
that
mellows
the
sweet
beautifully
underneath
everything
the
hop
bitters
continue
to
act
as
a
beautiful
stabilizer
for
this
beer
while
hardly
effecting
the
flavor
at
all
the
finish
stays
strong
with
the
wheat
flake
flavoring
stepping
beautifully
into
kellogzone
while
never
getting
too
sweet
and
remaining
remarkably
refreshing
the
aftertaste
is
clean
and
light
with
tasty
cereal
and
wheat
notes
on
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
lager
clean
lager
crisp
and
lager
refreshing
the
beers
body
is
light
with
just
enough
oomf
to
let
you
know
youre
drinking
something
tasty
the
wheat
notes
seem
to
add
just
a
touch
of
syrupy
body
to
the
beer
which
is
lovely
after
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
clean
with
a
light
sheen
of
saliva
that
invites
further
sips
overall
this
beer
is
amazingly
tasty
i
could
knock
this
beer
back
all
night
and
not
feel
bad
its
sessionable
and
its
tasty
which
are
not
always
the
easiest
things
to
marry
together
in
a
beer
yet
another
success
from
jacks
abby
this
beers
flavors
are
sure
to
woo
ale
fans
while
its
lager
characteristics
should
appease
even
the
acolytes
of
budheavy
try
this
beer
o
very
drinkable
lager
really
appreciate
this
one
not
enough
high
quality
american
lagers
like
this
being
made
these
days
jacks
abby
is
awesome
jacks
abby
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
out
there
breweries
they
have
lagers
dialed
in
this
one
is
flavorful
yet
incredibly
light
and
sessionable
before
i
knew
it
my
16
oz
was
gone
really
digging
something
under
5
that
has
actual
flavor
o
this
is
a
fantastic
lager
with
a
ton
of
flavor
for
a
session
beer
this
is
really
a
fantastic
beer
i
know
that
there
are
a
lot
of
beer
enthusiasts
out
there
that
arent
quite
sold
on
lagers
this
one
should
change
their
mind
o
real
solid
beer
for
what
it
is
not
great
but
for
a
session
beer
id
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
over
anything
a
big
brewery
can
offer
i
like
it
i
will
be
back
overall
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
spot
on
so
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
say
this
is
a
winner
ive
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
lagers
and
while
good
this
beer
really
isnt
very
flavorful
the
hops
are
muffled
and
the
malt
character
is
dull
clean
drinkable
and
solid
as
far
as
american
lagers
go
3
reviewed
from
journal
notes
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
session
with
for
a
very
long
time
overall
this
is
a
solid
session
lager
and
while
it
doesnt
necessarily
wow
the
tasetebuds
it
does
deliver
a
solid
drinking
experience
featuring
a
good
range
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
thus
provides
a
fantastic
and
certainly
far
superior
alternative
to
anheuserbusch
fare
o
a
tasty
and
unique
beer
very
sessionable
and
very
flavorful
craft
lagers
they
do
work
o
easy
drinking
sessionable
and
tasty
another
lager
done
right
by
jacks
abby
too
bad
the
macro
lagers
couldnt
be
like
this
they
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
ja
would
like
to
see
this
in
a
6
pack
as
apposed
to
the
4
pack
pint
bottles
it
comes
in
overall
again
a
great
beer
looking
forward
to
going
to
the
brewery
in
framingham
in
order
to
take
a
tour
and
get
some
brewery
fresh
beer
o
i
feel
as
though
the
coarseness
of
the
wheat
the
high
level
of
carbonation
and
the
slight
lack
of
smoothness
should
detract
from
the
drinkability
but
they
really
dont
not
much
at
least
perhaps
not
quite
as
refined
as
the
other
jacks
abby
offerings
but
still
more
than
worth
a
try
d
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
want
from
an
american
pale
lager
drinks
like
a
really
clean
blend
of
american
and
english
pale
ales
crushable
at
4
5
albeit
significantly
more
subtle
than
hoponius
union
this
might
be
a
good
way
to
win
over
lovers
of
fizzy
yellow
beer
taste
starts
with
sweet
quickly
overpowered
by
almost
skunky
hops
which
carry
through
the
close
which
has
ample
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
says
session
on
the
bottle
and
that
works
for
me
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smells
of
bready
pilsner
and
sweet
munich
malts
with
a
floral
and
earthy
hop
aroma
as
well
as
a
spicy
component
that
reminds
me
of
wheat
the
flavor
is
earthy
hops
up
front
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
beneath
it
middle
and
finish
showcase
some
earthy
spicy
wheat
and
hops
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
spicy
resinous
mouthfeel
this
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
just
the
same
jacks
abby
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
offerings
poured
into
a
squatters
true
pint

a
very
nice
dark

very
nice

many
can
be

almost
half
gone
in
a
matter
of
minutes
medium

like
the

sez
starts
off
hoppy
finishes
malty
with
some
slight
bitterness
overall
a
very
nice
brew
for
a
hot
day
thanks
bill
o
another
great
lager
from
ja
could
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
without
a
problem
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
of
bready
malt
and
some
nice
citrus
and
flowery
hops
though
the
hops
arent
nearly
as
overpowering
in
the
smell
as
hoponius
union
this
one
smells
a
lot
more
like
a
traditional
lager
the
taste
follows
the
smell
its
exceptionally
clean
and
crisp
but
has
a
finish
thats
a
little
more
bitter
than
your
typical
lager
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
the
fruitiness
from
the
hops
in
the
flavor
but
it
mixes
very
nicely
with
the
graininess
of
the
lager
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
out
there
and
maybe
even
a
notch
above
dortmunder
gold
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
sessiontype
lager
its
a
perfect
summer
beer
and
the
hops
give
it
a
nice
little
extra
bite
that
you
dont
find
in
most
lagers
but
its
far
from
overwhelming
if
youre
looking
for
something
more
traditional
from
jacks
abby
this
is
the
lager
for
you
damn
good
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
lager
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
a
while
between
this
smoke
dagger
and
hoponious
union
im
becoming
a
huge
fan
of
this
brewery
being
able
to
get
a
16
9
oz
bottle
of
this
for
2
50
at
the
brewery
id
be
there
all
the
time
if
i
lived
in
ma
insanely
drinkable
and
while
not
quite
as
hoppy
or
flavorful
as
hoponious
easier
to
drink
a
few
of
and
a
great
beer
highly
recommended
o
this
was
very
good
for
a
sessionable
american
pale
lager
lots
of
flavor
and
tons
of
nice
fruity
flavors
that
balance
very
well
with
the
pale
malts
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
and
114pack
of
500ml
bottles
you
definitely
cant
go
wrong
definitely
recommend
trying
this
jacks
abby
makes
some
great
lagers
the
pour
is
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
a
very
good
hoppiness
to
the
nose
citrus
and
floral
hops
dominate
up
front
sweet
biscuit
malt
comes
through
as
the
hops
fade
away
a
nice
mild
sweetness
on
the
palate
which
is
complemented
nicely
by
the
citrusy
and
floral
hop
profile
very
light
bitterness
and
just
a
very
good
beer
all
around
very
nice
session
beer
verdict
pretty
decent
beer
pale
lagers
session
beers
and
the
like
arent
really
known
for
their
exciting
flavors
or
provocative
creativity
but
this
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
thanks
to
rudzud
for
this
extra
appearance
is
a
bright
golden
color
with
two
fingers
or
white
head
its
nose
contains
pine
grass
some
hops
had
been
hearing
about
jacks
abby
for
some
time
now
and
was
excited
to
finally
try
them
take
a
sip
and
i
taste
malts
some
hops
a
little
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
finishes
crisp
with
some
more
of
that
bitterness
as
noted
on
the
label
this
is
a
session
beer
and
a
damn
fine
one
at
that
maybe
with
some
time
this
will
make
its
way
down
to
ct
notes
this
is
a
dam
tasty
lager
very
well
hopped
with
a
good
dry
finish
cheers
overall
a
worthwhile
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
well
call
me
a
fanboy
i
think
i
have
my
pale
american
lager
of
choice
its
sad
that
i
cant
get
this
in
12
packs
i
dont
want
this
in
half
liter
bottles
i
want
a
bunch
of
it
on
hand
at
all
times
all
the
summer
long
this
beer
sure
has
a
lot
more
going
on
than
your
average
american
pale
lager
the
boys
at
jacks
abby
have
once
again
taken
a
pretty
mundane
style
and
created
an
extreme
version
of
it
nicely
done
o
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
easily
one
of
the
best
that
ive
tried
another
fine
beer
from
jacks
abby
though
i
technically
enjoyed
it
less
than
hoponius
union
i
do
think
this
is
a
better
example
of
the
american
hoppy
lager
theyre
going
for
just
about
an
even
balance
here
with
good
characteristics
from
both
sides
definitely
legit
good
stuff
overall
given
the
style
this
one
is
very
good
it
is
a
nice
and
hoppy
lager
that
i
would
look
for
again
and
an
excellent
value
that
said
if
i
was
not
grading
to
style
my
marks
would
be
closer
to
a
3
5
while
this
is
clean
and
very
well
done
there
is
just
something
missing
that
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
overall
3
55
jabby
brau
is
definitely
decent
beer
perhaps
not
my
style
but
i
think
the
brewers
achieved
their
goal
of
creating
a
light
and
accessible
beer
made
for
summer
quaffing
you
could
definitely
throw
back
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
to
me
though
its
just
not
that
interesting
of
a
beer
while
any
beer
geek
can
appreciate
what
it
represents
few
will
love
it
o
this
session
lager
lives
up
to
its
name
i
would
enjoy
drinking
this
all
the
time
thanks
again

liked

the
more
i
drank
it
worth
a
try
surprising
and
different
and
very
obviously
well
made
o
its
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
break
from
other
more
popular
craft
styles
odi
have
been
dying
to
try
anything
from
jacks
abby
this
is
an
absolute
steal
for
2
50
per
half
liter
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
may
have
to
go
and
by
six
more
of
these
just
to
have
lying
around
gold
in
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
when
fresh
the
aroma
gives
off
a
touch
of
leafy
citric
hops
along
side
the
very
clean
dry
malt
faint
corn
its
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
in
that
you
notice
notes
of
leafy
hops
up
front
which
then
gives
way
to
slightly
sweeter
malts
that
taste
fairly
short
and
dry
smooth
especially
as
it
warmed
up
typically
one
might
think
a
session
lager
works
cold
almost
like
lawn
mower
beer
but
the
malt
profile
brings
macros
to
mind
when
cold
when
at
room
temperature
its
a
bit
more
interesting
and
smoother
i
just
wish
the
malt
backbone
wasnt
so
generic
i
wish
it
was
either
strictly
a
pils
malt
profile
or
something
a
bit
more
malty
i
really
wish
they
had
a
full
time
pils
in
economical
6
packs
overall
the
hop
notes
are
a
real
nice
touch
for
a
session
brew
like
this
but
when
it
isnt
under
2
months
old
its
a
bit
too
boring
characterless
because
after
the
hop
touch
there
isnt
much
else
to
get
excited
about
there
are
much
better
session
beers
out
there
overall
im
really
digging
everything
ive
had
so
far
from
jacks
abby
and
this
is
no
exception
i
love
having
a
beer
with
so
much
flavor
and
so
little
alcohol
a
great
session
beer
i
have
not
one
complaint
this
wasnt
horrible
but
kind
of
clunky
and
disjointed
for
a
drinkable
lager
mouthfeel
is
of
course
incredibly
light
extra
light
body
with
moderate
to
full
carbonation
a
little
resiny
but
pretty
negligible
good
session
beer
and
you
cant
beat
the
price
low
alcohol
but
plenty
of
flavor
and
a
very
affordable
price
of
3bottle
you
can
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
not
feel
it
in
the
head
or
the
wallet
it
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
drinking
and
one
i
look
forward
to
drinking
again
and
again
o
amazing
beer
for
the
style
simple
and
pretty
light
of
course
but
wow
great
balance
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
a
touch
of
wheat
and
its
just
perfectly
smooth
drinkability
is
off
the
scale
if
budweiser
tasted
like
this
the
craft
beer
movement
never
would
have
gotten
off
the
ground
another
great
beer
from
jacks
abby
very
sessionable
i
have
to
say
that
i
would
not
necessarily
go
for
this
as
a
first
choice
given
other
beers
that
jacks
abby
puts
out
so
i
cant
say
i
would
buy
a
growler
of
it
however
amongst
other
beers
in
this
category
its
amazing
this
is
what
a
pale
session
lager
should
be
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
o
deffinatley
not
my
favorite
jacks
abby
i
feel
like
this
brew
could
use
more
hops
and
less
malty
breadiness
really
nothing
spectacular
it
is
flavorful
for
a
session
beer
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
flavor
on
display
perhaps
its
because
im
not
that
huge
of
a
wheat
beer
fan
or
perhaps
this
is
just
not
my
thing
i
am
a
little
dissapointed
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
from
jacks
abby
i
prefer
their
big
juicy
hop
offerings
though
while
a
good
beer
its
no
kiwi
rising
poured
a
2
5
white
head
with
decent
lifespan
the
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
but
with
more
radiance
than
typical
it
smells
a
little
of
malt
and
a
lot
of
citrusy
piney
hops
already
much
more
to
this
than
your
typical
lager
the
taste
flips
with
a
little
citrusy
piney
hops
followed
by
a
lot
of
malt
nice
long
nutty
lager
finish
dare
to
say
this
brewery
claims
to
specialize
in
lagers
and
it
shows
and
yes
im
proud
this
is
a
local
brewer
to
my
state
the
aroma
is
citrusy
hop
while
the
flavor
is
more
blunt
with
some
fruitiness
up
front
and
strong
bitter
finish
i
also
detected
bubblegumthis
was
surprisingly
attractive
the
combination
works
i
describe
the
body
as
a
cross
between
oily
and
creamy
ill
be
honest
im
not
a
pilsnerlager
guy
and
even
when
it
comes
to
jas
beers
prefer
their
big
710abv
hop
monster
but
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
perfect
simple
session
lagers
out
there
this
may
be
the
first
beer
ive
ever
tasted
that
both
a
bmc
drinker
and
beer
snob
could
agree
on
as
a
great
beer
overall
delicious
maybe
their
best
yet
perfect
balance
of
pilsner
with
noble
hop
taste
and
american
hop
aroma
crisp
clean
super
sessionable
i
need
to
get
me
a
growler
of
this
i
really
hope
this
is
year
round
now
poured
from
the
bomber
into
a
pilsener
glass
a
golden
yellow
lager
with
creamy
white
head
somewhat
milkshakelike
with
a
pleasantly
assertive
hopforward
aroma
nose
is
floral
tropical
and
somewhat
spicy
with
a
subtle
backdrop
of
breadlike
malts
the
tropical
fruit
pineapple
guava
lychee
sweetness
builds
nicely
and
this
is
certainly
a
brew
to
enjoy
on
the
aroma
basis
on
the
palate
there
is
a
delicate
but
flavorsome
honeyed
breakfast
cereal
and
light
molasses
malt
background
propping
up
more
tropical
fruit
and
pine
flavors
along
with
gooseberry
white
grape
mustard
salad
green
melon
canned
peach
and
faint
citrus
rind
finishes
rather
bitter
and
medicinal
with
a
little
grain
husk
dry
i
am
always
a
tad
surprised
by
the
combination
of
a
fairly
thin
body
heavy
carbonation
and
assertive
hop
flavors
that
is
unique
to
an
india
pale
lager
one
keeps
expecting
to
taste
sweeter
malts
more
body
and
more
esters
and
instead
one
gets
naked
rather
delicate
hop
flavor
some
cereal
grain
and
a
residual
sweetness
that
you
just
cant
quite
grasp
this
one
showcases
a
solid
array
of
different
hop
aromas
and
flavors
relatively
unencumbered
by
the
malts
i
can
dig
it
not
as
a
replacement
for
the
usual
but
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
a
clean
hop
forward
malt
restrained
ipa
the
bre
is
a
moderate
golden
color
with
a
thick
lasting
beautiful
white
head
the
smel
is
soft
rounded
and
a
bit
hoppy
some
distant
malt
and
grain
but
it
is
a
lot
less
interesting
than
i
expected
the
brew
makes
yo
for
it
in
the
taste
however
which
is
huge
with
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
herbal
leafy
fresh
biter
and
spicy
nice
full
satisfying
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
again
very
clean
and
crisp
from
the
lagering
the
hops
do
have
a
slight
pinch
of
astringency
by
my
molars
and
there
is
a
lovely
dryness
to
this
beverage
i
like
the
simple
and
direct
flavors
but
wish
this
beer
had
more
of
a
hop
punch
still
a
fine
brew
and
worth
drinking
if
you
come
across
it
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
i
appreciate
the
lager
yeast
variation
but
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
poured
out
in
a
snifter
i
know
not
the
recommended
glass
but
i
felt
like
rebelling
tonight
this
beer
has
a
nice
semihazy
and
golden
body
moderate
carbonation
and
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
and
creamy
head
with
some
mild
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
light
but
the
hops
a
present
and
smelling
inviting
mild
apple
and
orange
come
through
along
with
a
mixture
of
citrus
fruits
at
first
taste
it
crisp
slightly
creamy
and
the
hops
are
the
first
flavor
you
taste
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
come
in
next
and
then
the
malts
kick
in
this
one
feels
more
like
a
lager
at
first
but
then
quickly
changes
into
a
nice
mild
ipa
the
aftertaste
is
all
ipa
the
hops
are
strong
and
the
alcohol
is
barley
tasted
but
none
of
the
flavors
overpowering
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
others
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
pine
sweet
malt
slight
caramel
malt
hops
slight
floral
and
a
hint
of
sugar
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
floral
hops
pine
sweet
malt
caramel
malt
hint
of
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
grass
overall
good
appearance
complexity
and
blend
this
works
pretty
well
the
flavour
could
be
a
bit
more
interesting
and
less
rough
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
particularly
toward
the
end
but
it
is
a
really
pleasant
enjoyable
beer
quite
drinkable
in
some
ways
it
waffles
back
and
forth
between
being
an
ipa
or
lager
and
this
indecision
shows
at
times
could
be
better
but
still
not
bad
within
the
style
this
one
is
a
real
standout
and
a
quality
beer
within
any
style
its
a
real
standout
and
a
high
quality
beer
highly
recommended
over
all
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
its
drinkable
i
know
its
supposed
to
be
an
ipa
style
lager
but
it
just
didnt
hit
the
mark
for
me
the
fruity
hop
character
of
citrus
up
front
is
quickly
sweetened
by
a
good
dose
of
caramel
lay
malt
flavors
some
more
bitter
hops
at
the
finish
over
all
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
i
am
not
sure
if
it
fits
the
beer
style
exactly
i
wish
there
would
have
been
more
carbonation
while
drinking
this
beer
it
was
quite
syrup
like
while
im
not
a
hoppy
beer
fan
i
think
this
beer
is
a
decent
brew
easy
drinking
nice
mouthfeel
good
creamy
taste
a
pretty
good
beer
for
a
barbecue
or
other
such
occasion
as
a
character
said
in
fargo
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
this

i
cant
imagine
it
still
seems
fresh
to
me
big
wheat
and
pale
malt
base
heavier
for
a
lager
with
some
pretty
solid
hopping
tangerine
or
orange
or
something
to
them
pale
hazy
dense
wheat
beer
color
yellow
and
orange
heady
bubbly
the
nose
has
a
lot
more
hops
than
the
conventional
lager
but
without
sacrificing
grain
character
the
malt
is
fresh
too
bready
or
crackery
with
a
touch
of
lady
finger
cakey
sweetness
minimal
bitterness
and
lots
of
hops
on
the
finish
grassy
and
orange
zesty
i
thought
all
the
body
and
the
big
carbonation
was
a
nice
feel
for
the
flavors
they
evolve
together
slowly
from
malt
to
hops
a
well
flavored
lager
anything
but
boring
but
it
lacks
in
the
session
department
for
me
a
handful
of
these
is
plenty
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
though
is
enough
to
make
me
want
more
a
thanks
to
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
malty
a
bit
of
lemons
taste
is
lemony
malts
some
grains
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
a
good
session
beer
o
a
great
take
on
an
otherwise
regular
lager
the
dryhopping
adds
more
complexity
and
balance
to
the
aromas
and
flavor
profile
this
one
youll
definitely
want
to
keep
on
drinking
c
overall
ok
mixed
some
nice
parts
but
that
one
bad
flavor
o
overall
i
this
was
okay
until
the
vegetative
notes
hit
a
shame
i
am
savoring
this
moment
which
has
been
a
long
time
in
coming
it
begins
with
a
loud
crack
revealing
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
followed
by
an
inverted
glug
i
decided
to
wait
a
moment
or
so
when
some
puffy
foam
began
to
extrude
itself
from
within
the
can
oooh
an
active
beer
when
it
showed
no
sign
of
relenting
i
proceeded
incautiously
resulting
in
three
fingers
of
dense
foamy
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishyellow
srm
7

suggesting
that
it
was
unfiltered
good
filtration
only
strips
away
flavor
and
i
am
not
a
fan
nose
had
a
nice
malty
sweetness
unencumbered
by
adjuncts
one
of
the
unintended
cansequences
of
the
canquest
tm
has
been
the
number
of
aals
that
i
have
had
to
cansume
so
i
know
from
whence
i
speak
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
flavor
was
hoppier
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
it
had
a
honeymalt
flavor
intermingled
with
a
minty
grassiness
and
if
i
had
been
asked
to
guess
i
might
have
gone
with
a
czech
pils
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
refreshing
i
might
enjoy
it
more
on
a
hot
humid
summers
day
than
on
a
literally
freezing
cold
morning
like
this
one
hence
school
being
closed
ymmv
overall
i
enjoyed
this
flavor
could
have
been
stronger
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
for
the
price
you
really
cant
go
wrong
what
a
treat
a
real
classy
lady
the
one
they
call
zoe
is
a
fantastically
hopped
lager
with
bright
citrus
and
flowery
esters
a
truly
bewitching
arsenal
of
aromas
the
palate
lets
the
drinker
down
slightly
but
remains
an
incredibly
easy
drinking
experience
calling
a
let
down
incredible
should
give
one
an
idea
of
just
how
good
this
beer
is
well
done
hops
grain
absolutely
great
job
on
this
one
a
truly
fine
pale
lager
and
a
top
notch
beer
in
all
respects
overall
ive
been
waiting
to
try
zoe
for
some
time
now
and
i
am
not
disappointed
when
i
think
of
a
lager
this
will
be
my
standard
to
measure
with
excellent
aroma
and
flavor
there
might
be
better
out
there
but
this
one
pleases
on
all
fronts
this
one
has
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
goes
great
with
anything
i
need
to
try
the
rest
of
their
lineup
this
beer
is
tremendous
o
overall
what
a
pleasant
surprise
this
one
was
wish
i
knew
this
was
hoppy
wouldve
jumped
on
it
right
away
but
even
with
some
time
on
it
quite
tasty
worth
checking
out
got
in
a
trade
with
cyde
12
ounce
can
into
lager
glass
no
canning
date
but
should
be
pretty
fresh
pours
lightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
fairly
dense
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
fair
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
big
tangerine
lemon
zest
peach
mango
pineapple
floral
grass
bread
light
caramel
and
floralyeast
earthiness
very
nice

with

balance
and
zero
cloying

after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and

with
a
smooth
and
lightly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
hoppy
pale
lager
style
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
is
it
just
me
or
does
the
one
they
call
zoe
sound
like
either
a
badass
western
or
a
badass
horror
movie
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightlyhazy
sunset
auburnamber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
toffee
very
light
biscuit
mild
candied
orange
peel
and
a
touch
of
grassy
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
eliciting
thoughts
of
amber
ales
and
the
like
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
beer
like
i
said
above
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
nice
amber
ale
than
anything
that
calls
itself
a
pale
lager
these
days
but
that
doesnt
hurt
its
enjoyment
any
i
could
easily
see
drinking
plenty
of
this
as
an
everyday
drinker
were
it
available
round
these
parts
o
im
enjoying
the
mix
of
american
and
german
flavors
in
this
beer
if
it
were
a
bit
drier
it
would
be
much
more
sessionable
but
a
solid
beer
overall
o
this
is
an
excellent
lager
that
i
could
drink
all
day
i
find
myself
going
back
to
this
beer
very
often
while
there
isnt
anything
outrageous
its
just
done
very
well
and
deserves
a
lot
of
recognition
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
it
theres
nothing
huge
or
outrageous
about
this
beer
it
just
does
everything
right
a
full
flavored
and
thirst
quenching
beer
that
puts
all
pale
lagers
to
shame
it
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
fruit
on
the
nose
the
taste
zips
on
your
tongue
with
citrusy
fruit
and
apricot
flavors
and
a
mild
bitterness
to
give
it
a
nice
dry
finish
very
crisp
and
very
refreshing
the
zoe
is
a
bountiful
beer
in
a
can
and
a
total
home
run
from
hops
and
grain
hops
and
grains
really
overachieved
with
this
beer
and
i
find
myself
still
thinking
about
it
long
after
my
sampling
was
through
its
the
best
hops
and
grain
beer
i
have
tried
so
far
and
i
enthusiastically
look
forward
to
trying
more

im
having
a
tough
time
thinking
of
a
better
hoppy
lager
than
this
it
is
super
delicious
thirstquenching
and
has
great
tropical
dryhop
flavor
im
already
on
my
second
sixpack
and
will
surely
buy
more
perfect
texas
summer
beer
aka
great
when
it
is
hot
as
hell
mothfeel
is
plenty
full
for
the
style
and
well
carbonated
awesome
beer
well
done
hg
well
done
indeed
i
get
a
crisp
piney
flavor
from
the
first
sip
onward
with
an
upfront
bitterness
which
gives
it
definition
tapers
off
with
a
light
touch
of
a
caramelmalt
finish
pleasing
effervescent
and
all
too
tasty
i
think
ill
have
five
more
an
absolutely
fantastic
and
highly
original
lager
this
is
my
favorite
local
beer
made
in
austin
it
has
a
tart
crisp
character
that
reminds
me
of
grapefruit
but
it
isnt
a
fruity
beer
at
all
it
has
wonderful
balanced
hop
characteristics
and
a
fantastic
finish
a
perfect
beer
i
only
buy
it
now
for
special
occaisons
because
i
literally
drink
it
too
fast
i
cant
sip
it
like
many
other
beers
i
open
a
can
pour
it
in
a
glass
blink
and
its
gone
m
light
to
medium
bodied
pours
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
heavy
on
euro
hops
pretty
tasty
overall
very
hop
forwarded
nice
soft
malts
a
little
sweetness
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
bubblier
for
me
but
its
solid
with
this
and
sympathy
for
the
lager
im
hoping
and
praying
for
a
trend
of
hoppy
canned
lagers
in
tx
i
gotta
hand
it
to
hops
and
grain
ill
be
drinking
a
ton
of
zoe
in
the
upcoming
months
this
is
an
excellent
session
like
lager
at
5
2
abv
it
is
just
a
bit
high
for
a
true
session
beer
but
why
nit
pick
one
of
the
better
new
to
me
texas
beers
i
have
had
so
far
this
year
highly
recommended
12oz
can
from
a
6
pack
i
got
at
specs
midtown
houston
tx
im
happy
to
see
hops
grain
here
as
this
has
been
an
austin
local
till
now
aggressive
pour
leaves
a
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
a
thin
white
line
with
little
lacing
as
the
glass
goes
down
i
love
the
smell
on
this
beer
right
as
a
pop
the
can
i
get
big
fresh
hop
scent
from
this
pale
session
lager
the
taste
is
much
more
mild
slightly
fruity
maybe
a
little
grapefruite
and
brown
sugar
i
can
see
myself
having
multiples
of
this
in
one
sitting
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
especially
for
the
hot
summertime
months
we
have
ahead
of
us
here
in
texas
i
am
very
thankful
that
this
is
available
to
me
now

big
body
for
the
style
with
a
medium

much
closer
to
a
german
pilsener
than
an
american
adjunct

light
in

and
very
flavorful
smooth

with
an
interesting
aftertaste
light

i
would
drink
this
on
a
sandy
beach
grainy
and
floral

flavor
is
grainy
and
floral
as
well
with
a
bready

theres
also
some
light

character
present
clean
finish
but
nondescript
crisp
clean
flavor
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
front
end
maintains
its
clean
taste
to
the
end
it
can
sit
with
you
and
is
not
bad
as
it
moves
towards
room
temperature
no
need
to
pound
these
the
taste
is
worth
taking
your
time
fluffy

hangs
around
for

of
honey
with

taste
is
biscuity
delicious
with
some
very

perfect

this

is
great
after
having
a
stout
or
porter
i
tend
to
not
drink
lagers
except
in
the
summer
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
extremely
good
beer
very
good
balance

highly
recommended
overall
3
25
is
given
to
bells
lager
of
the
lakes
bells
brewery
inc
a
very
refreshing
brew
i
may
pick
this
up
again
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
the
beer
pours
a
white
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
and
pale
gold
color
the
beer
smell
has
a
strong
sweet
malt
smell
the
smell
also
has
yeast
notes
and
a
bit
of
a
light
hop
profile
that
create
a
bitter
banana
smell
the
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
that
the
notes
are
stronger
and
that
hops
are
more
noticeable
than
in
the
smell
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
but
a
little
sticky
the
beer
has
a
very
light
body
and
very
smooth
it
also
has
very
little
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
getting
overall
a
pretty
unnoteworthy
lager
very
similar
to
new
glarus
totally
naked
not
a
bad
lager
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
i
think
this
is
a
very
underrated
lager
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
it
is
very
clean
and
the
flavors
employed
balance
out
very
smoothly
this
is
what
summer
brews
should
be
like
poured
on
tap
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
crystal
clear
straw
gold
coloring
with
a
sparse
filmy
white
surface
coat
nose
of
toasted
grains
subtle
berry
sweetness
and
floral
hops
flavors
are
fruit
and
floral
forward
with
a
tangy
caramel
nackbone
some
hops
resin
and
subtle
pine
notes
fruitier
than
i
would
have
expected
smooth
light
bodied
with
a
tangy
sweet
berry
fruit
aftertaste
smooth
slick
finish
for
what
it
is
its
enjoyable
this
pours
a
clear
light
straw
color
light
aroma
some
bready
and
lemony
notes
crisply
flavored
with
a
touch
of
breadiness
and
a
quick
finish
makes
me
burptake
that
for
what
its
worthbut
with
no
nasty
aftereffects
i
am
generally
a
fan
of
bells
so
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
when
i
was
in
chicago
the
great
lakes
area
if
not
actually
michigan
just
off
the
bat
i
love
the
elegant
label
and
the
name
the
beer
is
not
bad
at
all
either
it
tastes
crisp
and
clean
with
a
clear
hop
element
that
is
refreshing
not
overpowering
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
pretty
tasty
for
a
lager
easy
to
drink
this
lager
is
memorable
and
light
enough
to
warrant
a
second
try
o
not
a
standout
but
an
enjoyable
brew
with
enough
going
on
to
hold
my
interest
c
o
fairly
darn
tasty
overall
one
of
the
better
apls
ive
had
recently
what
bmc
wishes
they
could
be
bells
lager
of
the
lakes
3
55
a
delicious
beer
though
not
outstanding
when
compared
to
some
of
bells
better
known
ales
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
sharpness
on
the
finish
good
as
always
for
the
sun
but
a
lager
with
enough
zing
for
three
seasons
o
okay
but
unexceptional
lager
the
hint
of
soapiness
could
not
have
come
from
the
glass
which
was
thoroughly
rinsed
before
using
and
its
ongoing
presence
detracted
from
the
experience
this
beer
was
light
bodied
it
was
refreshing
a
workingoutsideinsummer
kind
of
beer
it
left
no
residue
but
ended
slightly
dry
full
sails
session
line
is
much
better
simple
and
straightforward
like
a
lager
should
be
great
for
summer
o
well
this
is
refreshing
nice
and
easy
to
drink
more
flavors
than
your
typical
macro
lager
and
the
flavors
that
are
there
arent
bad
at
all
it
goes
down
super
easy
reminds
me
of
back
in
the
day
when
i
first
started
drinking
i
could
easily
crush
a
ton
of
these
78
overall
if
you
live
in
michigan
and
drink
shitty
lagers
you
are
an
idiot
why
buy
bud
or
coors
when
you
can
get
this
for
cheap
what
a
lager
is
supposed
to
taste
like
just
enough
flavor
to
be
enjoyable
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
considering
that
adjunctlike
flavors
do
not
prominently
stand
out
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
good
lager
aroma
taste
round
crisp
beer
with
moderate
bitterness
and
an
average
duration
pilsner
style
with
some
bitter
hoppy
notes
mixed
with
some
toasted
malt
grains
round
full
beer
with
some
earthy
tones
to
it
this
lager
is
a
pale
brilliant
gold
it
smells
a
lot
like
apples
and
in
fact
tastes
like
them
too
the
front
of
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
appley
while
the
hops
bring
up
the
rear
for
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
front
of
the
taste
almost
reminds
me
of
a
white
wine
like
a
pinot
grigio
its
a
good
lager
for
macro
fans
to
try
but
doesnt
inspire
me
i
did
enjoy
it
but
a
lot
of
tasty
options
for
the
money
if
its
summer
your
outside
doing
something
active
would
be
a
choice
oa
boring
run
of
the
mill
lager
nothing
stands
out
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
and
malts
taste
is
crisp
lots
of
grains
some
malts
earthy
bitter
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
session
beer
probably
better
enjoyed
during
the
summer
overall
not
worth
the
price
at
10
a
sixer
this
is
as
average
of
a
beer
you
can
get
the
only
plus
i
can
give
it
is
its
easy
to
drink
3
overall
i
like
it
but
i
get
too
many
skunky
sips
its
really
a
good
tasting
beer
but
sometimes
it
just
goes
down
wrong
it
shouldnt
be
spoiled
as
it
was
bottled
a
month
ago
and
refrigerated
at
the
store
overall
a
fair
campinglawn
mowerbeach
beer
but
other
than
that
eh
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
something
that
even
warrants
being
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
smells
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
but
its
not
too
bad
as
a
whole
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
but
would
be
a
fair
choice
of
light
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
in
michigan
nothing
special
as
far
as
bells
goes
but
as
far
as
lagers
one
of
the
best
o
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
as
it
does
not
exhibit
the
sweetness
that
you
often
find
with
the
more
malty
beers
but
it
is
not
overly
hoppy
or
bitter
either
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
sessionable
o
decent
i
might
order
another
but
i
doubt
id
buy
6
its
not
bad
just
not
great
overall
nothing
i
could
session
or
find
more
than
one
got
this
in
an
ohio
run
but
its
a
fairly
balanced
and
tasty
lager
o
really
quite
good
its
simple
like
it
should
be
a
nice
and
drinkable
refreshing
pale
lager
what
more
could
you
ask
for
memorable
for
having
slightly
more
flavor
and
depth
than
most
american
pale
lagers
ive
had
but
thats
not
particularly
difficult
to
do
in
this
category
bells
never
seems
to
disappoint
that
i
can
recall
and
this
is
no
exception
as
a
lager
its
a
bit
too
rustic
for
my
personal
tastes
but
it
definitely
works
i
have
to
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
on
cask
with
the
character
it
is
presenting
regardless
this
is
another
good
beer
from
bells
this
is
a
decent
light
easily
drinkable
beer
it
is
brewed
to
style
so
there
is
nothing
that
jumps
out
at
you
its
just
a
refreshing
lighter
offering
that
is
rather
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
standard
lager
yellow
with
about
2
fingers
of
head
at
least
thats
what
i
had
gotten
out
of
it
the
smell
is
of
strong
citrus
and
i
mean
strong
an
appealing
citrus
though
the
taste
is
a
wee
bit
of
corn
flakes
with
an
ever
stronger
hit
of
citrus
coming
through
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
terrible
tastes
like
lemon
pledge
and
soap
suds
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
for
the
summer
so
long
as
you
can
actually
choke
it
down

oz

into

a
golden

yellow
body
small
white
head
settles
to
some
thin
edging
smell
is
sweet
bready
and
bland
no
hops
just
some
sweaty
off
flavors
nice
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
taste
is
identical
not
a
bad
lager
but
not
a
great
beer
o
nothing
special
o
this
is
better
than
any
bmc
offerings
but
i
dont
think
id
get
it
again
i
like
trying
craft
lagers
but
this
one
did
nothing
for
me
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
finger
or
two
of
white
head
moderate
retention
and
ok
lace
toasty
grainy
bread
on
the
nose
with
subtle
hopping
perhaps
a
bit
earthyvegetal
and
doughy
tastes
about
the
same
grainy
and
crackery
crisp
hoppiness
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
a
simple
beer
and
nice
for
the
style
id
take
this
over
their
third
coast
beer
pours
out
a
straw
colored
yellow
with
a
thin
white
fizzy
head
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
smell
to
it
at
first
very
clear
with
many
noticeable
carbonation
bubbles
smell
is
somewhat
bitter
and
hoppy
as
well
somewhat
grassy
with
a
slight
malty
graininess
to
it
has
a
nice
straight
forward
pale
grassy
bitterness
to
it
the
maltiness
is
more
earthy
and
grainy
going
along
very
well
with
the
mild
hop
bitterness
it
has
a
nice
strong
flavorfull
slightly
bitter
yet
balanced
finish
very
drinkable
and
very
awesome
if
your
not
quite
into
craft
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
it
is
just
a
perfect
all
around
lager
for
any
kind
of
beer
lover
and
very
sessionable
i
really
like
this
beer
for
a
lager
its
tasty
light
and
refreshing
i
could
very
easily
drink
an
entire
6er
of
this
after
a
day
in
the
yard
or
at
the
ball
park
3
5
d
not
bad
i
like
myself
a
good
lager
from
time
to
time
o
a
fantastic
lager
ive
been
craving
one
of
these
do
this
americanbrewed
lager
cultivates
preprohibition
imagery
in
the
mind
of
the
drinker
as
if
referring
back
to
an
era
when
american
lager
suggested
advancement
rather
than
surrender
strong
allaround
and
about
as
good
of
a
representative
of
the
style
as
one
can
hope
to
find
this
might
be
the
beer
that
boston
beer
co
had
in
mind
before
brewing
their
ponderous
alpine
spring
seasonal
balance
is
struck
here
with
easy
fluid
qualities
scaling
well
to
significant
hops
and
unobtrusive
yet
defining
malt
taste
is
similar
simple
grains
and
yeast
and
with
a
nice
hops
twang
at
the
finish
tasty
and
quite
sessionable
welldone
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutty
wheat
and
perfume
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
nutty
wheat
and
floral
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
aroma
was
a
little
offputting
on
this
one
as
the
perfume
at
least
how
i
would
describe
it
note
was
quite
strong
i
was
quite
concerned
that
this
would
be
an
overpowering
flavor
as
well
however
it
was
subdued
in
the
flavor
and
came
across
more
of
a
floral
note
than
anything
this
one
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
changeup
for
the
night
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
on
tap
o
overall
i
didnt
think
i
could
find
a
lager
that
i
would
dig
but
ive
found
it
im
now
really
excited
to
try
the
bottle
of
quinannan
falls
that
i
have
o
id
always
wondered
what
this
one
tasted
like
and
now
i
finally
know
id
definitely
have
this
again
preferably
on
tap
drinkability
this
is
an
allday
beer
we
quafed
them
down
while
sitting
at
the
pool
and
the
beer
was
close
to
perfect
for
the
occasion
value
was
terrific
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
a
halfdozen
sitting
in
the
refrigerator
right
now
the
beer
presents
a
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
with
a
decent
hoppy
finish
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
entertaining
friends
as
we
were
and
is
almost
a
west
coast
lager
but
barely
missed
the
sweet
spot
in
just
about
every
category
o
ill
go
on
the
record
as
say
the
american
pale
lager
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
o
nice
lager
light
aroma
of
cereal
grains
and
small
flowery
hop
in
the
taste
clean
lagery
flavor
cracker
like
malt
restrained
bitterness
and
a
clean
finish
actually
similar
to
alot
of
the
macro
lagers
but
more
unoffensive
than
most
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
decent
overall
bells
proves
they
can
brew
a
working
class
beer
standard
american
lager
with
no
frills
overall
a
pretty
solid
lager
nice
level
of
hop
bitterness
for
a
pale
lager
mouthfeel
refreshingly
crisp
carbonation
explodes
with
flavor
elements
settling
lightly
on
the
pallet
o
meh
taste
about
like
an
adjunct
lager
not
bad
if
you
want
something
simple
and
want
to
stray
away
from
a
bud
o
a
good
pale
lager
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
worth
a
shot
o
an
extremely
tasty
light
lager
great
for
a
day
on
the
lake
or
tailgating
when
you
want
to
have
multiples
but
not
buzz
too
much
i
will
buy
this
again
notes
the
subtitle
of
this
beer
on
the
label
is
lager
of
the
lakes
i
dont
think
so
i
think
that
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
is
closer
to
deserving
that
honor
the
flavor
is
okay
tastes
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
say
a
helles
lager
o
a
good
lager
crisp
clean
with
some
nice
subtle
tones
and
a
surprising
bitterness
for
the
style
o
for
a
pale
lager
its
ok
i
am
in
about
100
degree
weather
right
now
and
this
was
perfect
for
the
heat
o
this
is
likely
the
best
apl
that
i
have
come
across
a
pretty
boring
style
that
allows
no
flaws
this
is
a
great
job
of
balance
style
adherence
a
nobrainer
replacement
for
the
bmc
crowd
if
you
have
never
given
bells
a
chance
dont
let
this
style
be
your
first
im
probably
being
overly
harsh
but
this
falls
well
short
of
the
many
great
styles
to
come
from
this
michigan
brewery
overall
an
average
beer
not
a
good
pale
lager
not
a
good
beer
getting
a
little
tired
of
michigan
beers
not
living
up
to
their
states
great
reputation
this
one
pours
a
very
bright
and
very
clear
straw
gold
in
color
with
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
crisp
pale
malts
and
adjuncts
nothing
noteworthy
the
flavor
is
of
clean
and
crisp
pale
malts
it
has
a
light
bitterness
and
is
just
really
light
all
around
that
said
it
tastes
of
a
quality
lager
it
is
what
it
is
it
drinks
light
and
is
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
actually
really
good
for
the
style
im
a
fan
its
an
undervalued
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
o
a
decent
lager
not
great
but
very
refreshing
and
very
clean
tasting
would
be
a
nice
beer
for
out
fishing
on
the
lake
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
overall
not
one
of
bells
better
beers
seems
very
average
and
the
smell
wasnt
great
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
considering
all
the
other
great
beers
they
make
beer
is
thin
and
biting
it
gets
better
the
more
i
drink
it
but
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
is
a
little
harsh
i
dont
really
like
it
or
understand
how
this
could
really
be
the
10
lager
but
i
guess
it
is
an
indication
that
this
style
sucks
i
wont
have
it
again
i
semiregret
having
it
to
begin
with
this
is
a
great
looking
lager
it
pours
a
transparent
pale
gold
color
with
a
big
head
that
retains
quite
well
looks
very
refreshing
aroma
is
good
theres
some
nice
grainy
sweet
and
light
malts
over
a
bit
of
noble
hops
a
bit
watery
the
taste
is
that
of
a
very
clean
high
quality
lager
theres
a
solid
amount
of
bittering
hops
on
the
finish
theres
really
no
way
to
better
describe
it
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
crisp
at
first
but
ends
semidry
the
drinkability
is
also
good
overall
a
solid
wellorchestrated
lager
overall
i
was
very
happy
drinking
a
growler
of
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
worth
a
shot
reviewed
from
notes
yep
smells
like
a
lager
poured
into
pint
glass
a
golden
straw
color
wthin
lacy
white
head
being
a
fan
of
bells
i
was
interested
in
trying
this
one
however
i
was
surprised
the
bold
almost
bitter
taste
on
the
front
end
followed
by
an
average
to
underwhelming
finish
1st
impressions
as
the
rest
of
the
sixer
grew
on
me
however
i
would
by
other
offerings
from
bells
before
returning
to
this
crisp
yet
slightly
bitter
offering
worth
the
try
but
not
high
on
my
return
to
list
this
lager
is
a
well
made
beer
that
goes
down
easily
it
is
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
it
is
also
ultimately
not
that
interesting
to
me
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
but
also
not
one
that
i
would
avoid
overall
very
drinkable
very
flavorful
refreshing
a
knockout
in
my
opinion
my
favorite
lager
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
decent
lager
which
i
know
ive
had
in
a
bottle
before
and
if
memory
serves
is
much
better
on
draft
still
it
is
decent
at
best
have
it
after
youve
had
your
first
and
secnod
choices
of
the
evening
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
session
beer
but
def
worth
the
price
9
39
yea
american
dollars
overall
this
really
is
a
beer
of
almosts
this
is
so
close
to
a
world
class
lager
but
just
misses
the
mark
in
every
category
m
o
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
and
crisp
and
overall
it
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
nice
summer
weather
something
id
drink
again
im
just
not
going
to
go
looking
for
it
and
if
bells
were
on
the
shelf
im
sure
id
be
buying
some
of
their
other
stuff
pours
a
fizzy
gold
capped
with
a
shortlived
with
wisp
of
froth
this
beer
is
more
herbalhoppy
in
the
nose
than
an
average
apl
or
general
lager
but
otherwise
it
is
straightforward
as
they
come
pale
grain
faint
sweetness
light
earthy
and
floral
notes
and
a
refreashing
light
body
comprise
this
brew
not
bad
not
great
either
d
a
good
drink
but
nothing
to
blow
you
away
bells
took
a
what
i
think
to
be
a
boring
style
and
improved
it
a
little
i
give
them
extra
credit
for
doing
that
and
having
a
sub
5
0abv
if
you
enjoy
a
lighter
beer
id
check
it
out
overallthis
was
a
very
hard
difficult
to
review
would
i
drink
this
again
probably
not
id
definitely
prefer
other
sessionable
beers
but
for
the
style
its
good
clean
and
refreshing
i
would
like
to
give
this
to
my
dad
and
see
what
he
thinks
as
a
bmc
drinker
o
im
sure
this
beer
will
rate
a
little
better
when
i
get
my
hands
on
a
fresh
one
but
honestly
i
thought
this
beer
held
up
pretty
well
for
a
10
month
old
low
abv
lager
d
3
5
though
i
could
drink
plenty
of
this
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
couple
it
just
doesnt
have
that
much
going
for
it
rather
bland
for
bells
as
i
have
come
to
know
it
m
its
got
a
pretty
thin
mildly
oily
texture
thats
very
pleasant
with
the
substantial
carbonation
figured
id
start
the
drinkin
day
with
something
on
the
lighter
side
it
pours
a
very
lightly
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
lemon
zest
coriander
and
a
very
mild
touch
of
orange
sherbet
the
taste
musks
things
up
a
bit
dirtying
up
the
wheat
and
adding
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
which
in
these
surroundings
goes
a
pretty
long
way
according
to
the
label
this
isnt
an
outofdate
bottle
so
im
not
really
sure
what
to
think
here
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
pale
lager
though
im
not
too
big
a
fan
of
the
taste
profile
i
got
although
the
look
and
the
smell
werent
promising
bells
lager
proved
to
be
a
quality
lager
with
a
good
bit
of
hops
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
delicious
golden
lager
highly
sessionable
clean
nice
mouthfeel
moderately
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
better
summer
refreshers
ive
had
personally
i
have
bells
as
overrated
in
most
categories
but
this
is
a
knockout
for
the
style
when
im
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
drinking
great
tasting
brew
this
one
hits
the
spot
i
mean
why
drink
bud
when
this
is
around
will
purchase
again
it
pours
deep
yellow
with
a
white
short
lived
head
lots
of
bubles
on
the
nose
theres
some
burnsweet
like
scent
the
taste
is
pure
malt
it
leaves
a
bittersweet
taste
medium
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
feels
the
mouth
in
a
good
way
very
easy
to
drink
i
never
had
a
lager
like
this
before
light
blonde
with
cornsilk
highlights
and
a
stiff
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
fine
lace
on
the
glass
untoasted
grain
pale
malts
and
an
earthy
herbal
hop
aroma
light
and
well
balanced
with
a
nice
balance
between
grain
and
herbal
hops
light
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
good
stuff
one
of
the
better
lawnmower
beers
d
a
pretty
rare
miss
from
bells
at
least
in
terms
of
their
regular
lineup
aroma
and
flavors
are
grainy
and
earthy
from
the
noble
hops
slightly
nutty
with
a
musky
straw
and
a
corn
likenes
crisp
in
that
dark
earthy
sense
flavors
finish
clean
with
just
a
bit
of
residual
lingering
a
well
made
brew
that
would
appeal
to
others
more
then
myself
the
dark
earthy
aspects
are
probally
what
lowers
it
for
me
id
have
prefered
to
see
more
of
a
bright
balance
drinkability
its
a
good
daytime
summer
beer
where
you
can
easily
put
away
a
case
poured
a
bright
golden
amber
with
a
nice
frothy
and
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
faed
leaving
behind
simply
an
average
looking
macro
like
lager
the
aroma
was
full
of
grain
tons
of
it
and
that
was
about
all
there
was
a
hint
of
corn
in
the
back
but
a
predominant
musty
breadlike
aroma
the
taste
was
pretty
bland
to
be
honest
not
horrible
mind
you
just
terribly
average
lots
of
corn
and
grain
and
bread
again
this
was
your
typical
macro
kinda
lager
nothing
really
great
at
all
better
then
a
bud
light
but
i
think
i
will
pass
chris
drinkability
its
okay
nothing
special
better
than
some
lagers
ive
had
but
not
the
best
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
in
this
one
i
think
cuts
the
wrong
way
against
the
nice
crisp
start
of
the
beer
oh
well
not
a
waste
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
d
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
these
yummy
stuff
that
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
next
to
a
meal
or
a
snack
crisp
bite
with
some
ghostly
herbal
hop
flavor
appearing
in
the
background
grainy
and
simple
some
pilsner
malt
and
very
mild
hop
flavor
feels
a
bit
flaccid
but
the
crispness
saves
it
from
being
too
bland
pretty
clean
with
no
off
flavors
just
a
simple
straightforward
lager
more
of
a
lawnmower
beer
perfect
for
hot
weather
and
barbecues
drinkability
no
fancy
tricks
no
barrelaging
no
overthetop
hop
profile
just
a
fine
serviceable
quaffable
lager
exactly
what
i
needed
on
this
midafternoon
d
definitely
drinkable
not
a
great
beer
in
any
sense
though
but
that
is
an
issue
with
the
style
would
much
rather
be
drinking
these
all
night
than
an
massbrew
beer
but
would
expect
to
pay
the
same
price
for
it
overall
nothing
i
really
loved
and
kind
of
bland
d
it
fits
the
style
problem
is
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
d
overall
there
isnt
much
flavor
to
this
brew
but
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
very
light
it
was
very
nice
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
still
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
satisfied
d
this
beer
while
not
terrible
really
just
fades
into
the
fray
for
me
with
so
many
other
great
session
beers
out
there
im
not
quite
sure
why
you
would
pick
this
one
d
solid
pale
lager
do
your
bmc
friends
a
favor
and
introduce
them
to
this
they
will
thank
you
for
it
very
sessionable
this
is
not
amazing
just
a
nice
lager
for
a
hot
day
this
brew
pours
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
that
diminished
to
a
thin
skim
and
left
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
grainy
and
sweet
along
with
a
bit
of
clean
european
pils
yeast
character
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
flavor
is
initially
rather
malty
crackers
and
grain
with
just
a
little
sweetness
the
beer
transitions
to
moderately
bitter
with
a
pleasant
spicy
floral
hop
flavor
and
a
dry
crisp
finish
the
carbonation
is
appropriately
mediumhigh
with
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
well
made
very
tasty
american
pils
if
all
american
pils
had
always
been
made
this
way
the
craft
brew
revolution
may
have
never
started
satisfying
and
refreshing
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
so
far
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
is
a
very
smooth
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
bells
did
a
good
job
on
this
one
d
goes
down
easy
i
will
have
to
remember
this
one
for
the
springtime
or
summer
very
good
combination
of
flavors
and
mouthfeel
d
the
beer
is
decently
drinkable
but
for
what
i
expected
to
be
an
easy
drinking
lager
is
less
drinkable
than
expected
d
easily
the
most
sessionable
beer
ive
had
in
awhile
while
it
doesnt
have
much
going
on
in
the
aroma
or
taste
it
makes
up
for
in
sessionable
drinkability
it
is
simply
very
easy
to
drink
md
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
as
expected
the
beer
was
clean
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
an
excellent
alternative
to
a
bmc
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
some
floral
hoppiness
with
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
tastes
pretty
bitter
for
your
average
lager
not
really
a
characteristic
of
its
style
some
decent
malt
to
even
out
some
of
the
thick
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
nice
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
one
good
lager
i
always
knew
this
style
could
be
done
much
better
then
most
macros
and
bells
proves
it
this
beer
just
might
be
my
go
to
micro
lager
good
job
bells
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
a
thin
but
satisfying
grassy
hop
edge
balancing
out
the
end
not
too
complex
for
a
lager
it
has
a
great
mouth
feel
and
body
over
all
a
good
easy
summer
time
drinker
or
any
time
really
unpretentious
humble
and
worthy
o
great
stepping
stone
beer
sneak
this
one
to
a
reluctant
guest
and
see
what
happens
not
bad
at
all
crisp
clean
no
doubt
this
is
a
nice
lager
but
its
still
a
lager
and
as
such
not
something
i
would
drink
frequently
pours
very
clear
nice
head
i
cant
tell
if
its
a
dark
amber
or
a
dark
yellow
in
the
low
light
of
the
bar
ill
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
smells
grassyearthy
iits
got
that
much
odd
complexity
going
on
it
tastes
that
much
like
a
hayfield
only
while
great
all
malts
almost
magically
filter
out
everything
but
the
flowery
sunshine
of
a
hayfield
good
all
malts
let
a
few
allergens
through
after
all
the
roses
and
whatfor
theres
a
slightly
icky
aftertaste
that
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
but
doesnt
leave
a
good
impression
either
d
this
is
basically
a
basic
lager
nothing
to
get
to
excited
about
d
easily
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
although
it
should
be
noted
that
lager
is
perhaps
my
favourite
style
very
light
drinkable
and
pleasant
i
probably
wont
have
many
more
but
bells
lager
is
recommended
bells
has
crafted
one
of
the
worlds
great
lagers
heady
malt
and
floral
hop
aromas
are
mirrored
on
the
palate
there
is
a
magical
balance
of
hedonistic
flavors
and
delicacy
that
its
nothing
short
of
impressive
this
is
the
beer
worlds
answer
to
a
grand
cru
chablis
this
is
a
good
enough
beer
to
sit
around
and
drink
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
session
beer
but
not
much
else
drinkability
true
to
style
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
i
like
how
bells
usually
takes
ordinary
styles
and
does
something
extraordinary
with
it
here
i
do
not
get
that
same
feeling
perfectly
drinkable
but
nothing
i
will
seek
out
again
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
is
high
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
it
had
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
to
it
then
a
lot
of
others
in
the
style
which
i
liked
easy
drinking
relatively
flavorful
and
a
decent
beer
overall
d
refreshing
and
smooth
a
good
selection
any
day
the
beer
pours
a
brilliant
gold
with
a
just
off
white
crown
that
rises
initially
to
two
fingers
in
height
and
stubbornly
sticks
around
for
a
while
lacing
is
definitely
above
average
the
nose
is
of
sweat
slightly
bready
malts
and
herbal
flowery
hops
each
sip
brings
a
carbon
copy
of
the
nose
its
straightforward
but
very
well
executed
carbonation
is
fine
and
the
body
is
impressively
rich
for
a
beer
of
this
style
and
size
bells
lager
is
fairly
drinkable
beer
but
then
again
id
be
alarmed
if
a
4
5
pale
lager
wasnt
pale
lager
isnt
a
flashy
style
there
arent
any
bells
and
whistles
to
hide
behind
and
so
its
a
beer
like
this
that
really
highlights
the
talent
of
the
bells
brewers
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nice
step
up
from
an
adjunct
golden
color
with
plenty
of
bubbling
to
keep
the
white
head
at
a
millimeter
or
so
good
retention
and
a
little
lacing
very
bright
nose
has
some
grainhusk
earthiness
and
german
accents
that
are
interesting
and
add
some
complexity
to
an
otherwise
run
of
the
mill
affair
lots
of
munich
malt
flavor
fairly
light
in
general
toasted
and
pale
malt
dry
crisp
finish
with
some
bitterness
quite
snappy
overall
with
pretty
good
balance
and
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
much
better
than
others
in
its
class
poured
an
almost
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
never
had
too
many
craft
lagers
so
this
should
be
interesting
smells
very
sweet
and
i
get
a
light
mixture
of
bready
yeast
malts
grain
and
hops
the
taste
is
definitely
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
not
used
to
lagers
tasting
this
good
nice
sweetness
combined
with
the
hops
and
grain
to
make
a
very
nice
tasting
lager
great
for
this
hot
summer
weather
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
one
clear
straw
colored
brew
just
a
touch
of
haze
but
hardly
any
sizeable
white
head
good
lacing
scent
is
clean
and
sweet
pale
malt
sweet
malt
on
the
taste
with
a
fair
amount
of
grain
flavor
kiss
of
floral
hops
rounds
it
out
thin
mouth
fairly
acidic
very
refreshing
brew
judged
to
style
this
is
a
quality
offering
not
quite
as
complex
as
a
czech
or
german
pils
but
certainly
more
enjoyable
than
the
standard
euroamerican
macro
lager
inbev
grinds
out
drinkability
this
is
the
first
pale
lager
that
i
can
say
that
i
am
actually
fond
of
add
to
that
a
relatively
weak
abv
and
you
have
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
just
a
nice
lager
i
could
see
having
this
in
the
summer
but
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
bmc
drinkers
into
the
craft
beer
world
d
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
amazing
a
solid
czech
style
pilsner
almost
indistinct
from
pilsner
urquell
aside
from
the
different
grain
profile
good
but
not
mindblowing
good
lager
which
is
slightly
overpriced
10
a
sixer
in
dc
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
clean
but
might
not
leave
enough
of
a
presence
on
the
taste
buds
to
be
a
stellar
beer
solid
lager
with
a
subtle
carbonation
which
really
tickles
the
tongue
d
overall
solid
lager
which
drinks
rather
light
would
be
a
good
session
beer
d
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
quite
a
sessionable
brew
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
an
incredibly
clean
crisp
lager
i
could
drink
a
gallon
without
batting
an
eye
i
can
see
myself
grabbing
more
as
the
weather
warms
lager
of
the
lakes
is
a
great
pale
lager
that
works
as
a
great
stepping
stone
beer
do
you
have
a
friend
that
drinks
miller
lite
and
they
dont
like
the
stuff
you
bring
over
give
them
this
and
they
will
begin
to
see
the
light
not
too
much
flavor
but
a
nice
light
pilsneresque
taste
that
will
be
the
life
of
the
summer
party
for
your
uncultured
friends
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
dry
finish
highly
carbonated
which
gives
it
a
little
bite
but
the
unbalanced
bitterness
doesnt
lend
this
beer
to
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
d
a
fine
example
of
the
pils
style
sorry
ba
but
even
the
description
calls
this
a
pils
if
they
cleared
it
up
it
would
be
near
perfect
lager
of
the
lakes
has
become
my
favorite
bells
beer
this
has
all
the
great
qualities
of
bells
smoothness
full
flavor
and
obvious
made
with
care
quality
allaround
without
the
negative
qualities
the
chewiness
overdone
flavors
and
syrupy
aftertaste
of
the
heavier
amber
two
hearted
ale
best
brown
etc
this
is
a
straightahead
no
pretenses
beer
with
full
flavor
and
excellent
drinkability
refreshing
without
being
light
bodied
crisp
clean
and
very
enjoyable
its
kind
of
an
overlooked
bells
offering
but
for
those
who
just
want
a
great
no
nonsense
beer
this
is
it
they
also
have
a
third
coast
beer
which
seems
to
be
in
the
same
category
as
lager
of
the
lakes
not
sure
what
theyre
thinking
since
ive
tried
both
and
they
seem
incredibly
similar
except
the
lager
reviewed
here
is
better
tasting

i
could
make
this
a
go
to
beer
if
i
had
more
readily
available
ive
never
seen
this
one
with
all
of
the
bells
ive
drank
since
2001
ive
had
quite
a
few
different
brews
from
bells
and
have
not
had
anything
approaching
this
poor
i
have
to
imagine
that
i
picked
up
a
badly
handled
bottle
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
my
shaker
glass
the
lager
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
pillowy
off
white
foam
notes
of
toasted
bread
sweet
caramel
malt
fruity
apples
grassy
prickly
hops
and
some
biscuits
make
up
the
majority
of
the
nose
and
taste
here
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
session
lager
taste
reminds
me
a
lot
of
their
third
coast
beer
probably
using
the
same
hops
for
both
beers
nice
lingering
spice
from
the
hops
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
of
bready
malt
with
hints
of
spicy
and
fruity
hops
the
taste
is
more
balanced
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
nice
lingering
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
lighter
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
more
than
enough
going
on
in
the
tastearoma
to
keep
me
interested
yet
is
still
light
enough
to
make
it
very
sessionable
very
assertive
hoppiness
for
a
lager
overall
another
quality
product
from
bells
d
take
a
wild
guess
pours
a
perfectly
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
that
support
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
streaks
of
lacing
aroma
is
fairly
mundane
toasted
malt
typical
american
lager
light
hops
ho
hum
body
is
fairly
light
watery
in
the
finish
but
supported
by
strong
carbonation
and
a
hoppy
finish
strong
flavor
of
grain
and
toasted
malt
obviously
not
the
most
remarkable
bells
beer
but
a
very
flavorful
lager
compared
to
others
in
this
class
id
still
prefer
great
lakes
dortmunder
for
the
price
and
availability
for
this
class
of
beer
but
still
worth
a
six
pack
in
the
summer
all
around
a
great
beer
and
a
benchmark
for
lagers
larry
how
do
you
do
it
d
i
couldnt
but
someone
without
tastebuds
could
this
is
the
closest
microbrew
ive
had
to
a
standard
american
adjunct
lager
but
it
still
has
more
flavor
and
character
than
bud
or
mgd
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
used
to
those
beers
to
begin
branching
out
quaffable
light
summer
time
lawnmower
beer
d
very
drinkable
kickbackandrelax
kind
of
brew
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
which
i
did
but
i
guess
i
wanted
more
from
what
i
consider
to
be
my
favorite
brewery
right
now
a
very
drinkable
lager
for
a
craft
drinker
t
poured
a
maze
colored
haze
with
creamy
34
inch
head
lacing
is
nice
but
quick
smelled
like
a
jar
of
worms
grains
slightly
sweet
malts
come
through
piney
hops
that
finish
crisp
this
is
very
good
mouth
is
smooth
in
middle
and
sharp
bite
at
finish
overall
this
is
tasty
and
satisfying
great
beer
for

the
sun

touch

this
is

drinking
brew
with
enough
going
on
to
keep
things
interesting
its
almost
up
there
with
prima
pils
in
the
hops
department
and
id
say
it
is
pretty
comparable
to
that
fine
lager
ill
be
buying
it
again
nice
to
find
a

this

for

try
it
on
your

d
very
much
drinkable
a
straw
colored

that
releases
a

moderate
amount
of
foam

very
haylike
smell
tastes
very
crisp
light
with
some
toasted
malt
and
fairly
bracing
peppery
and
bitter
finish
quite
dry
a
delicious
lager
beer
a
little
more
refined
and
maybe
drier
than
the
third
coast
beer
which
i
think
is
an
ale
anyways
bitterness
coats
the
tongue
after
a
few
sips
very
nice
light
to
mid
body
adequate
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
i
would
drink
again
the
beer
is
poured
a
brilliantly
clear
pale
straw
colour
with
a
nice
big
fluffy
head
the
carbonation
in
the
beer
is
quite
evident
just
by
looking
at
it
because
of
the
clarity
when
smelling
the
beer
a
rich
malty
flavour
comes
through
but
its
mostly
grainy
notes
the
beer
has
a
fairly
assertive
bitterness
that
i
wasnt
expecting
with
a
nice
floralspicy
hop
character
backed
up
nicely
by
a
rather
subtle
grainy
flavour
the
flavour
is
very
good
the
crisp
balance
between
the
noble
hops
and
the
maltiness
is
grand
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
with
but
light
enough
for
the
style
i
dont
know
how
much
i
could
drink
of
this
even
though
its
pretty
damn
tasty
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
was
pale
yellow
color
crystal
clear
with
a
thin
wet
head
the
aroma
was
clean
neutral
no
real
flavors
beyond
light
malt
the
beer
was
tasty
but
the
flavor
is
not
strong
kind
of
muted
and
malty
medium
body
easy
drinking
definition
of
a

is
a

what
so
ever
nice

consistent

coming
up

a

a

with

will
have
again
this
is
a
very

and
a
good
offering
from
bells

is

not

5
as
ba
notes
d
definitely
drinkable
but
not
the
best
example
of

one
i
think
id
probably
opt
for
a
different

clean

fairly

i
may
have
to
give
this
lager
another
try
im
wondering
if
i
got
a
skunked

i
love
the

this

some

mildly

and
then
finishes
slightly
dry
with
just
a
bit
more
of
the
citrus

a
nice

drinker
d
well
i
paid
10
bucks
for
this
6er
which
i
would
do
anytime
for
a
nice
craft
beer
but
for
about
3
bucks
less
i
can
find
ray
hills
which
is
this
beers
equal
i
really
dig
this
beer
and
wanted
to
like
it
more
but
the
price
doesnt
allow
me
to
but
then
again
it
is
less
than
2
bucks
a
bottle
which
is
actually
not
bad
i
guess
confusing
but
would
buy
again
smoetimes
a
guy
just
wants
to
sit
down
and
have
a
great
refreshing
american
lager
md
the
mouthfeel
is
as
thin
as
the
taste
i
could
easily
drink
this
any
time
but
the
price
is
as
high
as
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
style
straightforward
but
delicious
bells
lager
is
one
that
would
be
a
very
good
session
beer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
almost
no
smell
is
present
maybe
a
touch
of
spice
the
taste
is
very
clean
not
much
going
on
but
good
overall
this
is
a
ok
lager
but
at
the
price
its
going
to
be
hard
to
buy
a
sixer
bells
lager
poured
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
small
head
with
ok
lacing
the
smell
was
strong
with
loads
of
citrusy
hops
taste
was
full
of
citrusy
hops
with
hints
of
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
drinkability
was
nice
this
beer
was
refreshing
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
a
little
lighter
then
some
of
the
other
american
lagers
good
beer
probably
more
meant
for
the
summer
but
a
nice
lager
would
buy
again
ddrinkability
is
good
it
was
a
refreshing
beer
which
made
it
very
easy
to
put
down
this
would
certainly
be
an
appropriate
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
cruising
on
the
pontoon
but
it
seemed
a
little
off
drinking
it
on
a
cold
january
evening
regardless
pretty
tasty
a
few
sips
into
the
second
beer
and
all
of
the
flavors
sort
of
came
together
perhaps
it
was
the
initial
hop
shock
of
the
first
sip
of
the
first
bottle
that
put
me
off
but
down
the
road
it
came
together
that
begs
the
prerequisite
for
this
beer
drink
one
of
these
before
you
have
your
first
one
of
these
what
does
this
mean
it
took
two
beers
before
i
started
liking
the
taste
maybe
its
more
of
a
toleration
factor
than
it
is
a
liking
ill
say
that
this
beer
is
a
unique
taste
experience
over
time
the
first
thing
that
caught
my
eye
as
i
poured
this
beer
was
its
haziness
i
give
it
props
for
this
unexpected
trait
in
a
lager
that
would
otherwise
just
be
your
typical
light
golden
brew
with
a
small
white
head
smells
very
grainy
with
a
honey
sweetness
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
bizarre
in
that
it
seems
slightly
sweet
and
mostly
zesty
on
the
palate
but
then
leaves
you
with
a
kinda
stinky
finish
that
just
ruins
it
for
me
i
tend
to
like
most
of
bells
styles
but
this
lager
is
one
of
the
exceptions
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
which
was
easy
to
drink
nothing
overly
rememberable
about
it
it
tastes
good
but
it
really
is
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
the
flavor
is
kind
of
like
a
pilsner
but
it
has
a
medium
body
to
it
realistically
its
a
good
meal
beer
you
can
drink
this
with
a
burger
because
the
flavor
wont
affect
the
flavor
of
the
food
a
decent
beer
overall
but
at
10
00
a
sixr
not
sure
its
something
i
would
consider
a
session
beer
d
the
lager
tastes
fuller
than
it
is
id
very
impressed
with
this
one
d
fuck
this
im
not
sure
what
bells
was
aiming
for
but
its
hard
to
fathom
that
this
beer
was
the
intended
product
im
having
to
choke
this
down
as
it
is
this
is
surely
destined
for
a
drain
pour
this
tastes
more
like
beer
on
the
way
back
up
md
overall
not
a
bad
beer
light
bodied
and
refreshing
a
good
drinking
beer
if
they
could
just
do
a
pilsner
like
lammsbraus
mmm
the
taste
is
firm
strong
grain
body
with
a
lot
of
herb
lemon
hints
of
pine
and
grass
again
it
is
a
very
flavourful
complex
interpretation
of
the
americanstyle
lager
clearly
within
that
tradition
yet
with
great
firmness
and
some
complexity
it
also
is
more
hoppy
and
bitter
than
usual
for
the
style
and
yet
clean
crisp
and
nicely
crafted
d
in
terms
of
flavor
this
beats
the
pants
off
of
most
other
american
lagers
in
this
style
but
the
bite
is
not
only
atypical
it
throws
the
balance
a
little
too
offkilter
in
my
opinion
it
seems
stuck
somewhere
between
lager
and
pilsner
poured
to
a
one
fingered
head
that
didnt
hang
around
very
long
beer
was
light
yellow
in
color
and
head
was
white
did
have
some
bubbles
around
the
edges
that
left
some
decent
lacing
smelled
of
hops
malt
and
maybe
a
little
grainy
tasted
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
that
had
a
slightly
dry
bitter
after
taste
this
wasnt
a
bad
thing
also
of
hops
and
malt
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
good
i
would
love
to
try
a
session
with
this
bells
product
alcohol
wasnt
real
high
so
i
think
this
would
make
a
good
all
nighter
as
lagers
go
its
a
little
dry
and
hoppy
for
sessioning
solidly
crafted
though
a
very
good
lager
slightly
hazed
pale
yellow
with
a
compact
soapy
white
head
aromas
of
earthy
grain
herbal
hops
and
some

the
smell

mediumlight

dry
and
crisp
not
too
shabby
d
fairly
drinkable
refreshing
brew
very
accessible
but
with
some
good
flavour
i
really
cannot
rate
this
beer
so
much
on
appearance
as
due
to
the
circumstances
i
had
to
drink
from
the
bottle
however
since
it
was
a
hot
summer
day
in
michigan
and
i
was
on
a
lake
that
was
perfect
with
me
i
will
give
the
bottle
props
as
being
a
mi
native
it
features
an
old
looking
map
with
some
symbols
of
michigan
things
around
it
the
smell
was
grassy
strawlike
with
a
biscuit
and
malt
smell
as
well
the
taste
was
about
the
same
grassy
and
earthy
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
and
dry
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
with
high
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
and
good
summer
thirst
quencher
i
could
see
this
beer
appealing
to
many
macro
lovers
taste
mouthfeel
pale
malts
up

bready
and
semisweet
theres
a
bit
of

as
well
but
not
to
the
extent
that
youd
find
in
a
pilsner
light
and
quaffable
but
still
full
of
flavor
this
is
what
american
macro
lagers
should
taste
like
theres
a
bit
of
soda
crackerlike
flavor
near
the
finish
followed
by
a
pleasing
dryness
with
firm
but
light

stuff
i
could
session

refreshing
with

carbonation
to
complement
it
all
an
easy

and
a
good
lawnmower
beer
without
giving
up
flavour
its
a
lager
which
is
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
does
seem
to
me
like
a
decent
lager
however
there
is
a
bit
of
bubbly
feeling
arising
from
drinking
this
beer
it
just
doesnt
agree
with
meif
you
sense
what
i
mean
i
really
all
allmalt
lagers
so
much
flavor
pours
a
pretty
golden
color
with
some
heavy
carbonation
thick

that
ever
quite
dissolves

slight

keeps
the
sweet
malts
in

thickens

the
beer
warms
seek
this
out
a
great
summer
beer
overall
a
good
hoppedup
pils
thats
great
with
grilled
foods
and
is
easily
drinkable
a
good
lager
thats
worth
trying
out
if
you
see
it
picked
up
a
6pack
while
in
indy
pours
a
dark
yellow
small
white
head
that
died
off
but
left
a
ring
around
my
glass
overall
well
carbonated
crystal
clear
malty
aroma
a
little
bready
and
a
hint
of
toast
munich
malt
dominates
the
taste
beer
is
fairly
bitter
but
well
balanced
hop
flavor
is
spicy
but
not
overpowering
they
say
the
amber
ale
is
their
flagship
brand
but
i
would
say
this
beer
gives
it
a
run
for
that
title
this
is
one
beer
i
could
come
back
to
time
and
time
again
but
they
dont
sell
it
here
revisiting
this
one
what
an
excellent

aroma
was
some

pale

but
almost
nonexistent
the
taste
was
quite
disappointing
barely
any
better
than
anything
by
bmc
the
beer
was
very
light
and
crisp
with
decent
carbonation
just
what
youd
expect
from
a
cold
budweiser
even
in
a
lager
i
expected
more
from
bells
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
and
that
ive
got
a
tulip
of
two
hearted
to
get
back
to
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
these
go
down
fairly
easy
quite
drinkable
md
very
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
a
very
drinkable
lager
pours
an
almost
unearthly
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
slight
head
and
great
lacing
the
smell
is
bracing
fresh
pilsnerlike
with
a
hint
of
lemon
the
flavor
is
honeylike
and
grainy
with
just
a
hunt
of
plum
and
a
whiff
of
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
thin
and
watery
just
what
youd
be
looking
for
on
a
hot

a
crisp

color
with
intense
carbonation
that
feeds
a
small
yet
impressive
head
good
lacing
smell
isnt
all
that
great
sweet
light
malts
and
perhaps
a
little
noble
hops
too
taste
is
kind
of
balanced
leans
heavily
on
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
refreshingly
crisp
an
american
pils
perhaps
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
the
smell
is
strong
on
the
malt
and
grain
not
much
else
going
on
maybe
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
not
a
whole
lot
is
going
on
here
the
taste
was
a
nice
surprise
considering
the
smell
was
not
very
powerful
the
taste
is
crisp
starting
and
finishing
somewhat
bitter
with
very
little
aftertaste
i
have
been
searching
for
a
lager
that
isnt
afraid
to
pack
some
flavor
in
and
i
think
i
found
one
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lighter
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
good
balanced
taste
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
not
very
overwhelming
but
still
delivers
a
great
lager
drinkability
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
dull
light
golden
with
a
nice
formed
but
quick
to
fade
white
head
leaving
no
lace
behindbready
malt
and
wet
grain
aromas
mainly
and
not
much
hop
presence
flavors
are
malt
tilted
very
bready
and
toasty
with
a
touch
of
honeylike
sweetness
with
just
a
light
smattering
of
floral
hop
in
the
finish
a
solid
malt
tilted
lager
here
not
wimpy
by
any
meanspretty
good
definately
drinkable
i
compared
it
to
henekin
but
its
a
little
better
than
henekin
if
my
wife
didnt
dig
on
it
so
much
i
doubt
id
be
buying
it
again
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
overall
a
remarkable
pilsner
one
of
my
favorites
i
do
enjoy
a
good
pilsner
urquell
when
i
can
get
some
on
draft
and
i
do
think
this
beats
it
unfortunately
it
is
a
8
99
a
6
pack
so
ill
have
to
enjoy
it
sparingly
id
recommend
this
beer
pours
a
sunshne
golden
yellow
with
slow
moving
small
bubbles
great
thick
merengue
like
foam
with
sporadic
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
slightly
funky
grassy
mlt
and
very
earthy
hop
aroma
the
the
earthy
hops
jump
right
up
front
to
the
palate
slowly
receding
to
grassy
malts
in
some
very
soft
water
the
finish
is
a
standard
light
hop
citrus
astringent
palate
with
a
well
balanced
hop
and
malt
bill
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
lager
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
light
bodied
lager
that
boasts
some
great
flavors
and
a
solid
profile
a
macro
body
with
a
craft
profile
nice
texture
with
a
crisp
smooth
taste
hit
the
style
there
light
on
carbonation
but
very
smooth
with
just
a
tad
residuals
i
guess
for
style
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
to
hoppy
for
style
but
still
good
easy
drinking
for
sure
d
solid
but
nothing
special
there
are
several
other
american
lagers
that
are
more
distinctive
and
enjoyable
d
forgettable
this
one
was
completely
average
bells
can
do
much
better
i
guess
if
you
didnt
want
to
think
about
what
you
were
drinking
this
wouldnt
be
bad
poured
a
light
honeygold
wthick
white
head
that
slowly
faded
into
a
think
cap
and
left
thick
traces
of
lacing
there
is
also
a
suspended
haze
smell
is
of
rich
grainy
pilsner
malt
light
hops
spice
and
faint
citrus
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
full
and
dry
with
nice
malts
and
slightly
discernible
rye
bitter
citrus
and
spicy
hops
and
faint
herbaceous
notes
i
really
enjoyed
this
lagers
simplicity
and
light
yet
rugged
character
oelergud
the
pour
was
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
it
had
a
citrus
smell
laced
with
a
hop
aroma
the
citrus
flavor
was
made
present
in
this
beer
but
hops
and
wheat
came
through
as
well
it
was
almost
like
a
bud
meets
a
rolling
rock
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
it
could
definitely
be
a
session
beer
for
many
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
it
was
lacking
something
that
should
have
been
there
there
was
no
bite
md
this
has
an
easy
drinking
feel
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
crisp
and
i
cold
enjoy
a
few
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
this
style
pale
gold
color
clear
except
for
some
whitish
particulates
that
are
floating
about
possibly
chill
haze
small
amount
of
white
foam
does
not
persist
long
although
the
beer
is
wellcarbonated
the
initial
whiff
presents
sulfide
which
gives
way
to
familiar
pilsner
malt
aroma
and
light
hops
that
are
both
spicy
and
citrusy
the
taste
is
gently
sweet
up
front
with
a
crisp
finish
this
beer
is
maltier
and
hoppier
than
american
macrostyle
lagers
making
it
an
interesting
option
as
a
thirst
quenching
spring
or
summer
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
its
balanced
flavors
and
moderate
alcohol
content
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
brew
a
personal
favorite
among
us
lager
types
pours
a
gorgeous
clear
sparkling
rich
golden
color
with
plentiful
brilliant
white
head
really
nice
tracing
as
well
trully
one
of
the
most
beautiful
lagers
ive
seen
aroma
is
mostly
coming
from
the
munich
and
pils
malts
a
slight
sulfur
touch
and
a
little
dms
it
finishes
with
some
hop
aroma
and
a
little
caramel
incredibly
bready
on
the
palate
malts
are
very
complex
ranging
from
whole
grain
crackers
to
whole
wheat
bread
to
fresh
biscuits
the
hops
are
certainly
in
there
not
so
much
in
flavor
but
with
a
quite
bitter
finish
stylistically
it
is
lower
in
abv
as
a
typical
dme
and
i
would
imagine
on
the
high
end
for
hop
levels
it
finishes
also
with
a
bright
citrus
flavor
coming
from
either
hallertau
or
styrian
hops
and
a
fruitier
than
normal
yeast
flavor
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
like
most
from
bells
given
its
strong
malt
backbone
and
bitter
noble
hop
bite
final
thought
not
worth
the
price
but
a
classic
example
of
what
pbr
can
become
if
they
substitute
more
malt
for
corn
overall
impression
hard
to
get
excited
about
this
style
its
a
hard
one
to
do
well
and
this
is
better
than
many
ive
tasted
its
pretty
well
balanced
eh
its
an
american
lager
a
light
taste
mostly
of
sweet
malt
i
didnt
pick
up
any
hops
since
it
is
a
lager
best
served
cold
i
didnt
let
it
sit
long
to
warm
up
which
might
reveal
some
more
flavors
both
good
and
bad
it
feels
light
with
adequate
carbonation
it
goes
down
fast
and
with
a
decent
taste
makes
a
6pack
disappear
quickly
but
it
is
sold
at
a
typical
bells
price
which
is
a
bit
much
for
this
beer
i
could
buy
2x
more
macro
product
that
doesnt
suffer
from
that
much
less
taste
a
good
beer
by
style
but
what
is
the
point
at
this
price
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
flat
maybe
it
needed
some
more
carbonation
im
no
expert
but
it
was
lacking
somewhere
in
the
feel
depaartment
i
dont
want
to
feel
like
im
drinking
pop
rocks
but
a
little
crisper
finish
would
have
been
nice
much
darker
than
macrobrews
but
still
relatively
light
moderate
white
head
that
goes
away
sort
of
quickly
theres
an
earthy
cereal
grain
kind
of
odor
that
dominates
the
smell
its
decent
but
theres
some
undescribable
strange
chemical
funk
that
im
picking
up
yet
i
dont
hate
it
its
a
decent
lager
way
better
than
your
typical
millers
and
budweisers
but
not
as
good
as
german
lagers
not
a
whole
lot
of
sweetness
either
nice
fizz
and
easy
to
drink
however
not
bad
review
revised
had
again
in
december
2009
much
better
this
time
with
a
nice
balance
of
malty
grains
and
floral
hops
may
have
had
an
older
or
bad
bottle
earlier
drinkability
this
one
had
session
lager
written
all
over
it
after
the
disappointing
appearance
and
aroma
i
had
my
doubts
that
this
wasnt
going
to
be
a
very
good
beer
but
it
made
up
for
itself
where
it
counts
not
one
of
my
favorite
bells
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
down
if
i
got
another
shot
at
it
overall
the
fresh
taste
would
make
for
a
good
summer
beer
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
great
i
can
drink
this
all
day
most
of
my
friends
dont
understand
my
obsession
with
beer
and
dont
like
most
of
the
beers
i
make
them
try
they
mostly
drin
bmcs
variety
of
beers
i
dont
understand
how
they
can
drink
those
and
not
stuff
like
this
clear
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
coarse
head
plenty
of
lacing
and
retention
aroma
of
mown
hay
wonderfully
represents
the
style
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
finishes
bitter
to
dry
all
in
all
very
refreshing

a
lager
you
can
really
taste
i
am
enjoying
it
as
a
stand
alone
but
it
begs
for
pizza
d
easy
easy
drinking
here
a
perfect
session
beer
highly
recommended
d
a
nice
beer
and
better
than
bmc
but
nothing
really
memorable
probably
not
worth
the
price
given
that
there
are
better
bells
beer
out
there
this
is
definitely
not
my
style
of
beer
so
this
is
hard
to
review
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
edges
nose
is
strong
on
grain
light
citrus
flavor
is
likewise
lots
of
citrus
some
niver
roastedness
offset
some
almost
bitter
grain
later
on
giving
it
some
added
complexity
compared
with
standard
macros
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
this
ones
definitely
a
step
up
from
most
lagers
out
there
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
bells
d
pretty
nice
i
was
washing
down
some
whole
dried
anchovies
with
slices
of
fresh
ginger
with
it
and
i
had
steak
with
it
the
night
before
this
beer
goes
good
with
food
i
give
her
a
b
nice
lager
from
bells
crisp
clean
hoppy
like
a
german
pils
golden
straw
color
nice
white
head
herbal
and
vegetal
notes
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
very
refreshing
dry
some
citrusy
fruitiness
plenty
of
character
a
real
sleeper
hit
recommended
refreshing
and
balanced
they
got
the
big
rep
for
a
reason
tasty
based
on
the
taste
of
the
first
bottle
i
was
ready
to
highly
recommend
this
brew
however
there
may
be
a
lack
of
consistency
with
this
one
which
is
surprising
coming
from
bells
12
oz
bottle
batch
7761
packaged
on
11107
it
pours
crystalclear
gold
with
a
few
floaties
light
carbonation
and
a
loose
white
threefinger
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
in
the
nose
there
is
lemon
citrus
rind
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of
malts
fairly
mild
but
you
can
tell
that
theres
some
good
stuff
down
there
and
the
flavor
is
where
you
can
tell
that
this
is
true
lots
of
lemony
grassy
spicyskunky
and
earthy
hops
deliver
a
medium
bitterness
backed
by
lightly
toasted
and
pale
malts
and
a
slight
seasaltiness
all
of
which
combine
to
impart
a
pleasant
lingering
finish
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
an
initial
crispness
that
is
quick
to
even
out
gliding
easily
across
the
tongue
drying
the
palate
a
bit
as
i
drink
damn
that
is
a
tasty
lager
it
is
a
supreme
session
beer
whose
taste
and
mouthfeel
combine
to
create
a
great
beer
experience
a
wonderful
example
of
just
how
delicious
a
plainold
american
lager
can
be
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
as
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
bells
is
a
brewery
for
which
i
carry
the
highest
regard
i
have
to
say
this
beer
is
the
least
distinguished
of
the
bunch
while
this
may
be
my
least
favorite
bells
it
is
a
very
drinkable
good
beer
for
a
crisp
summertime
brew
this
is
head
and
shoulders
above
rest
in
its
style
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
lager
yeast
and
german
hop
aroma
its
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
mild
hop
spiciness
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
crisp
pale
and
munich
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
and
refreshing
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
light
munich
presence
in
the
malt
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
an
above
average
lager
but
nothing
too
special
so
not
a
bad
beer
by
all
means
it
could
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
but
there
are
better
beers
from
bells
for
that
d
what
can
i
say
bells
knows
how
to
make
great
beer
and
not
just
the
dark
stuff
this
is
a
lager
that
provides
a
bit
of
hoppiness
that
can
be
savored
but
with
precise
balance
a
real
treat
in
the
lager
category
recommended
not
crazy
about
this
style
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
summer
thirst
quencher
pours
a
decent
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
taste
of
noble
german
hops
on
the
back
and
some
decent
hallertau
washes
down
clean
and
dry
pours
a
golden
color
a
little
steep
for
the
price
considering
it
is
a
session
beer
but
that
being
said
this
is
a
good
beer
i
will
buy
again
12
oz
bottle
this
brew
is
pale
straqw
in
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
bubbly
coat
over
top
with
a
few
stray
bubbles
cascading
up
there
is
a
moderate
haze
in
this
one
the
nose
is
mild
with
a
peppery
hop
spiceyness
a
touch
of
doughy
sweetness
and
kiss
of
grain
it
is
very
nice
and
crisp
the
flavor
is
moderate
grain
and
bready
with
a
moderate
spicey
hop
that
moves
to
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
is
rather
flavorfull
and
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
this
brew
is
very
easy
drinking
the
flavors
really
meld
well
it
certainly
transcends
what
i
expect
from
most
brews
in
this
style
mouthfeel
and
drinkbaility
id
say
that
this
beer
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
much
in
the
way
of
aftertaste
however
this
brew
is
a
great
session
beer
higher
levels
of
carbonation
really
accentuate
the
cleanliness
of
this
brew
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
as
i
said
before
its
a
great
session
beer
however
i
dont
know
if
ill
buy
it
again
without
trying
others
first
the
style
really
doesnt
interest
me
all
the
much
overall
very
good
for
the
style
a
nice
session
beer
pours
a
golden
straw

lace
remnants
linger
behind
as
the
beer
recedes
pretty
but
not
uncommon
among
lagers
i
am
not
a
fan
however
of
this
aroma
it
reminds
me
of
wilted
lettuce
or
worse
of
sour
honeyflavored
yogurt
im
not
sure
whats
going
on
in
this
beer
to
create
such
a
malodorous
aroma
here
but
it
really
is
unpleasant
and
it
worsens
as
it
warms
up
yet
despite
the
aroma
that
i
find
rather
offensive
the
beer
tastes
just
fine
its
crisp
and
clean
enough
and
maintains
less
of
the
aroma
in
the
mouthful
than
anticipated
that
it
cut
throught
the
nonsense
and
gets
to
the
heart
of
a
pretty
decent
lager
its
malty
and
a
tad
watery
but
good
enough
to
help
cool
off
after
a
long
hard
day
working
in
the
yard
to
the
point
but
not
spectacular
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
im
not
aware
of
any
other
beer
in
ba
that
ive
been
so
upanddown
about
in
my
rating
scale
over
a
bizarre
beer
this
lager
of
the
lakes
this
is
the
first
i
have
seen
this
beer
in
the
stores
i
frequent
in
columbus
so
maybe
they
were
scared
of
bells
making
a
lager
this
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
gold
color
and
formed
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
yeast
bread
and
slight
aroma
of
hops
the
flavor
was
of
bread
yeast
some
citrus
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
finish
was
light
and
crisp
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
guess
my
one
beef
with
bells
would
be
better
pricing
since
here
selling
the
same
as
more
potent
ales
like
oberon
or
two
hearted
means
i
wont
pick
this
as
a
session
beer
hey
most
of
us
would
prefer
other
bells
beers
theyve
made
their
name
on
big
assertive
delicious
ales
but
if
you
want
something
light
to
session
with
to
kick
back
with
on
the
deck
something
to
work
on
for
the
entirety
of
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
without
making
you
feel
surly
and
clutzy
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
better
pick
than
this
thanks
to
dekker0
for
this
one
glad
i
got
to
try
it
this
was
a
good
but
slightly
odd
tasting
beer
the
malt
and
yeast
profile
made
for
a
flavor
that
reminded
me
of
meat
maybe
roast
beef
still
theres
a
nice
toastedlike
barley
and
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
kiss
of
herbal
hops
i
could
go
either
way
i
think
its
a
good
beer
but
just
not

me

and
shouldve
waited
for
a
hotter
summer
day
for
this
one
but
not
bad
i
dont
want
six
of
them
but
one
was
fine
malty
all
the
way
toasted

notes
with
a
trace
of
sweet
caramel
thrown
in
for
good
measure
relatively
crisp
and
slick
across
the

refreshing
with
a
subtle
bitter
dryness
in
the
finish
hops
are
in
there
somewhere
you
just
have
to
search
for
them
a
bit
a
very
nice
one
from
bells
spring
and
summer
are
just
around
the
corner
and
this
would
make
for
a
fine
session
brew
if
its
available
to
you
a
nice
refreshing
beer
good
job
bells
brewery
this
brew
brings
out
the
best
characteristics
of
the
style
though
i
havent
read
any
other
reveiews
of
this
on
ba
yet
im
sure
some
will
slam
it
only
because
they
prefer
big
ales
and
the
like
but
this
is
a
wonderful
lager
i
forsee
a
lot
of
this
brew
thoughout
my
summer
drinkability
this
is
good
and
sessionable
pours
a
small
head
but
that
doesnt
go
away
right
away
it
leaves
a
good
28
head
and
has
a
clear
yellow
color
the
smell
is
a
nice
lager
smell
not
too
bad
its
bready
but
not
very
bready
it
has
some
good
flavors
too
the
taste
finishes
with
a
slight
bitter
of
hops
and
some
breadiness
like
a
regular
lager
but
this
is
the
first
one
i
have
ever
had
that
doesnt
make
me
cringe
i
like
this
one
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
with
some
crispness
overall
i
would
drink
this
instead
of
any
other
other
lager
any
day
definite
session
beer
here
not
dazzling
the
taste
buds
but
plenty
to
keep
it
occupied
would
love
it
on
tap
overall
this
is
what
an
american
macrolager
should
be
but
if
thats
what
i
wanted
id
buy
a
30
of
high
life
instead
drinkability
refreshing
and
wellcrafted
right
for
the
style
a
very
good
session
ale
very
complex
for
the
style
well
it
is
what
it
isa
lager
from
bells
the
name
is
plain
and
simple
just
like
the
beer
basically
average
on
all
flavor
profiles
but
with
a
well
formulated
recipe
and
precisely
executed
brewing
technique
the
balance
rises
beyond
just
average
the
aroma
look
flavors
and
feel
are
what
you
would
expect
from
other
very
good
lagers
but
with
no
identifiable
characteristics
is
difficult
to
praise
delicate
and
very
drinkable
beerone
to
drink
all
night
or
to
chase
a
pizza
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nice
body
thats
not
too
light
but
not
too
heavy
steady
carbonation
throughout
nearly
perfect
imho
drinkability
here
is
quite
huge
i
could
see
myself
taking
down
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
without
blinking
an
eye
a
solid
tasty
lager
from
bells
that
doesnt
fail
to
impress
me
with
its
subtle
nuances
if
i
could
get
it
again
in
il
i
would
the
smell
consists
of
pilsner
malt
with
a
hint
of
bready
munich
malts
also
has
a
nice
spicy
herbal
and
floral
noble
hops
bouquet
the
taste
is
just
as
i
would
have
expected
from
the
nose
has
a
nice
bitter
lingering
finish
very
crisp
and
clean
and
fairly
dry
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
i
could
drink
it
all
night
it
will
make
a
good

having
this

aroma
is
dry

notes

the
flavor
is
simple
as
youd
expect
with
a
lager
crisp
and
with
a
wave
of
bitterness
at
the
end
it
was
similar
in
the
mouth
sort
of
refreshing
and
clean
but
nothing
spectacular
it
was
relatively
easy
to
drink
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
overall
it
was
fine
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
thats
really
urging
me
to
be
it
again

its

overall
impression
first
off
i
would
have
never
know
this
was
a
bells
beer
not
only
being
a
lager
but
this
is
the
clearest
bells
beer
i
have
ever
seen
clean
fermented
and
you
can
tell
this
was
lagered
for
sometime
as
this
is
a
crisp
refreshing
thirst
quenching
beer
anheuserbusch
look
out
d
it
has
a
bit
more
character
than
the
average
lager
but
offerings
like
brooklyn
lager
just
make
this
not
worth
it
honestly
the
way
the
grassy
hops
mesh
with
the
metallic
taste
is
just
unpleasant
enough
that
i
would
likely
turn
this
one
down
in
the
future
if
it
was
offered
to
me
it
could
be
sessioned
but
id
rather
not
this
one
just
didnt
work
for
me
single
bottle
from
whole
foods
cary
no
batch
number
despite
my
intolerance
for
munich
malt
im
finding
that
im
feeling
better
about
bells
lager
as
the
ounces
disappear
theres
so
much
hoppiness
that
im
able
to
focus
on
that
characteristic
and
ignore
all
the
rest
in
fact
im
going
to
bump
the
flavor
score
to
the
more
deserving
number
from
where
i
sit
this
is
good
beer
that
could
be

if
nothing
else
this
is
good
beer
for
thought
light

than
anything

hoppiness
crisp

a
little
too
dry
in
my
opinion
not
one
i
will

out
again
d
i
think
this
might
be
about
as
drinkable
as
beer
can
get
every
sip
is
delicious
and
refreshing
without
diminishing
returns
this
could
be
an
absolute
staple
beer
for
sessioning
the
taste
has
a
reasonable
fullness
to
it
at
least
for
something
with
a
name
like
this
it
could
have
been
like
water
which
it
certainly
is
not
still
this
is
light
and
quaffable
it
has
a
dry
perception
to
it
that
is
driven
by
crackerlike
malt
notes
and
a
nice
contributing
bitterness
that
is
found
throughout
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
a
herbal
hop
character
is
also
quite
noticeable
and
almost
takes
on
a
minty
note
this
is
certainly
a
nice
beer
quite
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
i
was
expecting
i
will
admit
to
expecting
it
to
lean
more
towards
the
macro
side
of
things
nicely
quaffable
yet
still
has
a
certain
fullness
to
it
that
allows
the
malt
to
stick
to
the
palate
in
fact
the
lingering
notes
that
stick
to
the
mouth
are
that
of
caramel
and
a
hop
bitterness
this
beer
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hop
throughout
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
it
definitely
has
a
lot
more
body
than
most
lagers
clean
crisp
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
a
very
nice

drinkability
very
high
i
mean
not
to
pan
with
faint
praise
its
quite
a
fine
lager
problem
is
im
just
not
moved
by
them
no
mater
how
good
they
are
though
this
hits
it
and
i
really
hope
they
have
success
with
it
certainly
would
be
my
choice
if
a
gun
were
cocked
and
set
next
to
my

and
i
was

i

version

this
is

lager
only
marred
by
a
yeasty
nose
which
is
initially
offputting
but
thankfully
overpowered
by
hops

we
took
some
on

as

might
consume

somewhat
d
this

has
all
the

a
bright
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
decentsized
head
the
aroma
is
light
but
gives
off
hints
of
citrus
and
bread
the
taste
is
very
good
there
is
a
breadlike
taste
to
this
beer
which
combined
with
a
nice
dose
of
hops
finishes
off
with
a
slight
bitterness
its
not
quite
in
the
vein
of
a
eurolager
but
reminded
me
of
pilsner
urquell
meets
larry
bell
with
larrys
crew
putting
their
touches
on
it
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
not
bad
but
there
seems
to
be
some
off
flavors
here
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
but
the
soft
citrus
is
nice
overall
bells
was
on
the
money
here
its
too
bad
this
isnt
available
more
often
because
it
flat
out
rocks
oreally
enjoyed
this
delicious
flavorful
lager
o
could
drink
this
all
day
great
lager
medium
bodied
wih
a
crisp
hop
bite
that
lingers
over
the
pale
malt
and
sweet
fruit
notes
into
a
dry
finish
bitter
and
dry
with
grass
straw
and
subtle
pine
needle
followed
by
bread
biscuit
apple
and
pear
theres
also
a
weird
adjunct
like
metallic
graininess
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
which
lingers
after
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
with
nice
dryness
but
a
weird
and
unpleasant
aftertaste
clear
yellow
with
almost
no
head
stinky
leafy
oily
hop
aromas
along
with
pineapple
herbs
and
lager
yeast
similarly
hoppedup
flavor
lightly
sweet
pine
resin
dankness
earthyspicy
hop
medium
bodied
with
a
firm
bitterness
and
pleasantly
crisp
a
nice
pungent
hop
presence
allaround
making
for
a
unique
very
enjoyable
pale
lager
quinannan
falls
lager
has
eluded
me
for
quite
a
while
it
has
been
on
tap
numerous
times
at
places
near
me
though
somehow
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
finally
try
it
but
better
late
than
never
this
stuff
is
outstanding
and
probably
my
favorite
hopped
up
lager
it
showcases
an
ipalike
hop
bill
while
retaining
the
discernible
qualities
you
expect
from
a
lager
great
balance
of
hops
malt
and
yeast
and
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
quinannan
falls
lager
is
most
definitely
exceptional
people
need
to
try
this
overall
probably
my
favorite
of
this
style
thus
far
but
still
has
a
way
to
go
to
be
near
my
favorites
o
a
very
good
go
at
this
usually
often
dreadful
style
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
satisfies
through
and
through
worth
the
hunt
andor
stop
in
kalamazoo
to
try
this
beer
warning
though
it
is
not
always
on
draft
there
d
and
o
probably
one
of
the
better
traditional
american
lagers
i
have
ever
had
i
think
its
great
maybe
not
quite
typical
of
the
style
but
the
hop
addition
was
welcomed
and
went
nicely
with
what
would
otherwise
be
going
on
o
bells
absolutely
nailed
this
one
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
nothing
extraordinary
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
poured
clear
with
a
champagne
color
a
nice
small
head
adn
great
lacing
aroma
of
pears
and
elderflower
and
a
bit
of
floural
hops
tastes
of
a
clean
crisp
nicely
hopped
pilsner
with
a
bit
of
fruit
essence
palate
is
dry
and
crisp
carbonation
is
perfect
overall
it
is
a
wonderful
pilsner
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
wet
finish
mildly
bitter
on
the
end
hop
bitterness
good
hop
bouquet
in
the
middle
one
of
the
finer
lagers
ive
had
recently
i
would
buy
it
by
the
keg
if
possible
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
white
head
that
has
a
decent
stay
and
lace
nose
is
fruity
hops
crackery
malt
and
fruity
peppbles
wout
milk
taste
is
in
balance
but
the
fruity
hops
seem
to
come
out
winning
and
take
over
a
bit
they
even
seem
to
create
a
bit
of
sweetness
not
overhopped
but
you
can
really
see
how
euro
hops
work
in
a
traditional
lager
by
contrast
no
spicy
grassy
zippy
here
well
defined
mediumlight
body
at
first
but
the
sweetness
and
oilyness
of
the
hops
takes
over
and
coats
my
palate
after
a
few
sips
which
ruins
some
of
the
definition
and
elegance
overall
a
fun
experiment
that
blurs
the
line
between
pale
ale
and
lager
and
really
showcases
the
powerbeauty
of
pac
nw
hops
the
beer
is
transparent
appearing
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
cap
nice
aroma
of
citrus
hops
fruit
biscuits
subtle
malt
nice
refreshing
flavor
hop
forward
with
abundant
citrus
notes
exhibiting
a
lot
of
pale
ale
characteristics
lingering
bitter
finish
pretty
dry
overall
a
really
solid
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
average
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
nose
is
mainly
citrus
lemon
and
hops
excellent
for
the
style
taste
is
grapefruit
lemon
hops
and
a
little
spice
feel
is
light
hoppy
and
dry
very
easy
to
drink
overall
theres
a
reason
this
is
number
one
in
the
style
it
rocks
cheers
o
overall
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
lager
some
nice
citrus
and
floral
hops
and
super
easy
to
drink
if
they
sold
this
in
6
packs
i
would
definitely
buy
it
and
would
be
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
looking
forward
to
having
again
o
overall
an
exceptional
take
on
the
style
i
look
forward
to
the
day
when
this
is
a
readily
available
yearround
offering
from
bells
o
a
decent
easy
drinking
lager
its
got
a
bit
more
than
your
standard
pale
lager
its
worth
a
try
the
aroma
was
light
lots
of
light
grain
and
bready
malts
abound
here
small
light
fruit
notes
and
an
overall
light
profile
taste
was
more
of
the
same
light
grain
light
fruits
small
doses
of
grain
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
profile
glad
i
got
to
try
this
at
the
blue
dog
tavern
served
from
growler
into
a
houblon
chouffee
pilsner
poured
a
golden
pale
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
pine
and
wine
cooler
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
subtle
fruit
pine
and
pine
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
nose
was
a
little
offputting
for
me
with
picking
up
on
the
wine
cooler
but
somehow
it
worked
with
the
combination
of
the
other
aromas
given
off
here
the
flavor
was
where
this
brew
shined
with
a
nice
healthy
dose
of
piney
goodness
pine
is
usually
quite
abrasive
to
my
palate
but
this
one
managed
to
bring
this
flavor
across
in
a
delicate
manner
well
done
on
this
on
bells
well
done
o
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
very
well
done
easily
sessionable
and
would
go
great
with
food
like
pizza
o
this
one
gets
an
a
for
sure
if
the
rumors
are
true
and
this
is
going
into
12oz
bottles
i
can
understand
why
great
summer
beer
o
really
liked
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
even
at
6
4
i
would
def
have
again
if
im
looking
for
something
easy
to
drink
with
some
complexity
o
definitely
a
different
take
on
a
lager
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
soft
balanced
clean
would
absolutely
get
this
again
if
possible
a
delicious
beer
that
almost
imperializes
the
standard
bells
lager
and
elevates
it
to
nearipa
balance
favorable
comparisons
are
drawn
to
dogfish
heads
my
antonia
except
with
lighter
body
and
more
rounded
hop
character
this
is
a
no
brainer
choice
to
start
and
finish
any
session
opretty
nice
beer
here
get
it
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
a
pretty
crushable
beer
very
clean
tasting
no
off
flavors
ive
had
a
selection
of
their
other
beers
before
served
into
plastic
cups
where
the
head
retention
was
way
better
dont
know
if
their
cleaner
effects
this
in
any
way
overall
nice
clean
crisp
lager
with
nice
hop
profile
but
nothing
super
special
very
drinkable
and
crisp
clean
finish
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
o
i
think
most
bas
have
a
soft
spot
in
their
hearts
for
a
good
lager
this
one
was
well
made
and
would
be
a
fantastic
get
together
family
holiday
beer
should
it
be
bottled
regularly
this
would
be
a
great
addition
to
bells
lineup
because
this
could
be
a
simple
pick
for
a
transition
beer
and
could
turn
legions
into
craft
had
a
glass
at
the
bells
cafe
on
a
sunny
saturday
afternoon
the
clear
yellow
lager
had
a
white
head
and
light
lacing
the
hops
character
reminds
me
a
lot
of
surlys
bitter
brewer
for
the
mix
of
juicy
apricot
up
front
and
herbal
dry
lemon
in
the
finish
there
was
really
no
malt
character
the
hops
were
the
star
here
and
damn
they
were
tasty
its
dry
hoppy
and
drinkable
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
overall
a
solid
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
would
love
to
see
this
in
six
packs
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
a
clean
finish
excellent
drinker
and
imparts
some
distinct
flavor
to
a
sometimes
boring
style
quinannan
falls
lager
goes
in
the
glass
a
very
bright
yellow
blond
look
with
a
whisp
of
bright
white
up
above
that
fades
and
leaves
no
sticks
looks
similar
to
a
bp
yellowtail
pale
ale
a
bit
of
mist
making
things
not
so
clear
smell
is
pretty
tame
but
consists
of
some
pale
malt
and
hop
earthiness
with
small
florals
some
bread
and
thats
about
it
taste
is
down
to
the
point
plain
and
crisp
with
pale
malt
galore
and
some
light
earth
with
slight
grain
and
lager
essense
it
is
what
it
is
simple
and
to
the
point
feel
is
light
as
is
the
body
with
a
light
punch
of
carb
with
bready
aftertaste
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
but
dont
see
myself
forking
over
the
money
for
one
of
those
750s
glad
i
found
it
on
tap
this
would
be
a
good
replacement
for
bells
standard
pale
as
that
needs
some
retooling
but
for
now
maybe
sixers
in
the
summer
time
would
be
nice
on
tap
at
capones
for
the
bells
event
pours
a
light
golden
color
smell
is
bready
with
some
great
hop
aroma
crispclean
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
nice
lingering
hop
finish
in
the
taste
excellent
hoppy
lager
in
my
opinion
kin
to
a
nice
pale
ale
despite
the
obvious
alelager
differences
another
great
bells
beer
had
on
tap
during
a
bells
event
at
capones
pours
a
light
pilsner
type
gold
smell
is
lightly
hoppy
the
taste
is
so
crisp
and
clean
this
is
a
beer
you
can
cozy
up
with
for
hours
mouth
is
nice
and
light
very
refreshing
on
the
palate
overall
my
favorite
lager
ever
one
of
my
favorite
light
bodied
lagers
pleasant
hop
presence
displayed
in
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
prefer
tap
version
to
bottle
with
that
said
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
a
six
pack
format
enjoyed
at
the
brewerys
tasting
room
a
hoppy
lager
very
good
for
its
style
dry
hopped
a
nice
lawn
mower
beer
and
one
that
would
replace
others
drunk
in
mowing
days
gone
by
very
good
drinkability
and
one
that
would
transition
many
a
macro
drinker
who
does
not
realize
he
likes
hops
medium
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
crisp
beer
i
enjoyed
the
peach
notes
easy
drinking
and
i
would
have
another
always
glad
to
try
to
a
new
style
and
i
think
bells
hit
their
mark
here
but
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
the
hops
were
a
bit
too
bitter
with
not
enough
malt
support
and
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
too
present
for
its
abv
solid
brew
and
definitely
recommended
for
something
unique
but
not
my
favorite
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
lager
i
have
encountered
thus
far
rumor
is
they
dry
hop
this
one
and
i
quite
enjoy
what
it
brings
to
the
table
i
highly
recommend
it
while
you
can
find
it
had
this
on
tap
at
ashleys
in
a2
and
was
intent
on
trying
new
beers
as
a
big
fan
of
bells
brewery
i
asked
what
was
on
tap
from
bells
and
the
bartender
recommended
qfalls
and
described
it
as
twohearted
had
a
baby
with
a
lager
and
he
was
right
on
not
usually
a
lager
fan
but
this
is
delicious
like
a
very
light
bodied
very
flavorful
apa
if
you
see
this
pick
it
up
great
blend
of
styles
drinkable
yep
pours
a
crisp
clear
golden
yellow
not
much
head
to
speak
of
hops
on
the
nose
but
nothing
too
strong
very
light
not
much
else
on
the
nose
tastes
hoppy
very
hoppy
for
such
a
light
beer
very
mellow
and
smooth
highly
drinkable
but
for
the
percent
its
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
me
dvery
drinkable
taste
gone
in
no
time
d
this
is
a
superb
session
lager
not
sure
what
else
youd
want
from
the
style
wish
they
sold
this
stuff
in
the
minikegs
d
this
beer
is
a
dominate
under
the
radar
beer
i
drank
many
many
pints
of
this
and
couldnt
have
been
happier
i
wish
bells
would
bottle
this
one
because
they
will
have
another
beer
to
add
to
their
onslaught
of
the
craft
beer
world
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
drink
this
all
night
and
i
wish
i
could
plan
on
doing
just
that
next
time
i
see
this
on
tap
first
off
i
have
to
start
this
off
with
wow
it
pours
a
bmc
like
dark
straw
yellow
with
no
head
at
all
it
look
no
different
than
a
bud
or
miller
lite
this
deception
leads
to
a
greater
finish
it
smells
great
it
has
this
gumballhead
mixed
with
ipa
aroma
to
it
it
is
very
piny
floral
has
hoppy
bitterness
to
go
with
subtle
sweetness
the
flavor
mirrors
this
it
has
the
flavor
of
gumballhead
mixed
with
an
ipa
to
feature
a
perfect
mix
of
the
two
this
is
by
far
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
it
drinks
very
light
and
smooth
the
content
is
very
deceptive
it
drinks
so
light
and
has
exceptional
flavor
that
this
beer
can
creep
up
on
you
it
is
excellent
absolutely
phenomenal
wow
its
disappointing
that
this
may
have
been
my
only
time
to
drink
it
what
a
beer
taste
was
great
flavors
of
ipas
with
tons
of
hops
and
citrus
but
way
lighter
mouthfeel
which
it
very
drinkable
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
carbonation
is
very
crisp
the
body
is
light
and
the
finish
is
mild
lingering
bitterness
with
a
dry
edge
just
a
bit
high
in
the
carbonation
almost
champagne
like
the
drinkability
is
high
with
this
one
if
it
were
bottled
i
would
certainly
enjoy
several
in
a
night
while
many
american
pale
lagers
go
the
lessismore
route
in
terms
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
this
isnt
afraid
to
go
big
hopslams
little
lager
brother
pours
a
pale
shade
of
yellow
with
a
bit
of
haze
several
finger
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
consists
primarily
of
a
really
nice
earthy
pine
scent
with
a
bit
of
a
floral
aspect
to
it
as
well
taste
isnt
quite
as
heavy
on
the
pine
and
adds
in
a
bit
of
mild
bready
flavors
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
dry
with
the
spice
although
a
bit
heavy
and
unique
in
the
flavor
to
be
too
drinkable
this
was
quite
good
poured
ontap
into
a
pint
glass
a
golden
lager
with
lots
of
lacing
going
down
the
glass
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
bready
malt
underneath
flavor
is
fairly
complex
with
pine
resin
citrus
and
honey
all
wrapped
up
in
the
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
a
small
hint
of
booze
surfaces
the
pine
is
there
all
the
way
from
midsip
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
solid
a
nice
little
hoppy
lager
here
d
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
to
drink
easy
to
drink
a
great
pale
ale
crisp
and
bright
on
the
palate
really
framing
the
fresh
hoppy
notes
definitely
more
substance
in
the
body
than
i
would
have
guessed
as
well
what
a
flavorful
and
drinkable
lager
if
you
get
the
opportunity
its
a
must
try
taste
starts
with
grainy
bready
malts
turns
sweetish
with
notes
of
honey

the
hops
take
over

clean

lingering

flavor
mostly
piny

with
a
nice

delicious
and
very
drinkable
please
bottle
this
and
again
forget
the
style
listing
this
is
a
german
pils
for
sure
dvery
delicious
lager
that
you
can
drink
all
night
overall
this
one
is
extremely
drinkable
it
has
a
lot
of
great
flavors
and
has
a
light
bodied
which
makes
this
one
a
great
session
beer
this
is
something
i
would
like
to
see
in
the
summer
more
often
from
bells
tasted
at
a
bells
beer
brunch
at
the
sidecar
for
philly
beer
week
2010
this
beer
arrived
at
my
table
a
pale
golden
color
with
only
a
small
bright
white
head
and
could
have
easily
been
mistaken
for
your
run
of
the
mill
macro
lager
one
whiff
and
all
of
my
preconceptions
were
shattered
this
beer
has
a
nose
that
one
would
expect
from
an
american
pale
ale
with
tons
of
citrus
zest
and
some
pine
though
it
lacked
some
of
the
fruity
character
suffice
to
say
i
was
intrigued
and
quickly
took
a
sip
i
had
never
tasted
anything
quite
like
this
beer
as
it
had
plenty
of
american
hop
character
with
citrus
pine
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
grassiness
it
also
possessed
very
clean
mild
malt
character
and
fairly
neutral
yeast
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
overly
bitter
though
more
bitter
than
your
typical
pale
lager
style
beers
it
had
a
light
body
that
was
thinner
than
i
generally
prefer
but
it
was
90
degrees
outside
and
this
hit
the
spot
just
right
clean
finish
if
not
a
tad
dry
this
beer
was
super
drinkable
and
a
revelation
not
the
best
ever
but
very
creative
i
hope
they
keep
on
making
this
and
others
follow
suite
probably
best
lager
ive
had
pours
a
clear
golden
color
lager
yeast
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
hoppy
yet
bready
and
clean
slight
bitterness
on
a
bready
not
even
buttery
but
lively
palate
crisp
clean
faint
citrus
and
husk
grain
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
crisp
this
is
a
beer
and
a
good
one
american
lagers
have
not
represented
imo
this
one
does
reminds
me
of
the
old
days
ie
old
style
in
keg
shaped
bottles
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
very
refreshing
and
a
solid
add

my
mix

worth
buying
again
o
an
ancient
ale
that
isnt
gimmicky
and
pretty
good
despite
its
rustic
limited
roots
beer
started
off
cold
tasting
and
smelling
as
probably
intended
as
it
warmed
the
aroma
became
awful
with
cabbagelike
dms
could
barely
finish
the
pint
wasnt
a
huge
fan
but
worth
trying
sort
of
an
ok
but
unremarkable
lager
but
with
more

character

was

have
been
a
factor
bottle
of
california
lager
drank
run
of
the
mill
lager
with
a
small
note
of
hops
o
this
beer
is
fantastic
its
malty
its
hoppy
its
crisp
light
drinkable
so
much
flavor
and
the
weird
hint
of
orange
something
is
a
twist
ive
not
tasted
in
any
other
brew
its
hard
for
me
to
call
it
orange
for
its
a
floralorangelemon
thing
bouncing
off
the
malt
that
is
truly
unique
a
beer
i
will
buy
over
and
over
and
over
a
new
stand
by
for
my
fridge
and

into
rotation
goes
right

shift
pale

and
session
lager
lucky
to
have
this
offering
in
my
local
smiths
grocery
store
i
like
to
pair
this
with
meats
and
spicy
dishes
has
a
dry
yet
interesting
finish
feels
like
a
pilsner
but
not
as
grassy
very
refreshing
and
not
boring
sessionable
and
enjoyable
well
done
anchor
quality
shows
just
now
getting
back
into
lagers
this
will
probably
end
up
being
a
favorite
a
solid
good
drinking
everyday
lager
o
overall
pretty
good
something
a
little
more
interesting
that
the
typical
lager
although
not
as
amazing
as
some
other
lagers
in
the
same
vein
not
bad
very
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
in
the
end
o
good
but
very
simple
the
taste
is
something
ridiculously
close

overall
i
highly
recommend
you
check
this
beer
out
if
you
like
the
yuengling
lager
or
even
anchor
stream
beer
youll
like
this
beer
the
major
turnoff
to
this
brew
is
its
9
99
a
6
pack
i
dont
think
for
what
you
get
its
worth
that
price
on
a
consistent
basis
ill
stick
with
miller
high
life
consistently
if
i
just
want
an
easy
drinking
cheap
but
very
well
made
american
beer
but
in
general
this
beer
is
worthy
of
your
time
good
crisp
light
colored
lager
i
had
never
drank
this
anchor
brand
before
but
i
must
say
i
was
impressed
its
so
much
tastier
than
the
macro
lagers
i
particularly
enjoy
the
bite
at
the
end
of
a
mouthful
not
too
bitter
but
just
enough
to
remind
you
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
it
holds
its
head
and
carbonation
fairly
long
and
like
all
beers
it
is
much
better
when
poured
into
a
glass
i
hope
to
find
this
beer
in
a
bottle
next
time
instead
of
a
can
ill
bet
its
even
tastier
this
one
was
a
very
nice
anchor
offering
not
their
best
by
any
means
but
certainly
not
their
worst
either
a
great
pale
lager
that
comes
out
miles
ahead
of
the
runofthemill
macro
crap
the
clean
and
crisp
taste
with
the
hints
of
citrus
were
excellent
and
the
beer
was
a
very
easy
one
to
drink
a
beer
well

had
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
my
fourth
anchor
review
not
usually
a
big
lager
guy
but
i
was
in
the
mood
and
this
one
wasnt
bad
i
must
say
the
color
is
a
clear
golden
dark
for
a
lager
though
limited
head
but
good
lacing
for
a
lager
the
taste
was
malt
and
biscuits
definitely
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
mild
aroma
nothing
too
exciting
decent
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
this
one
managed
to
have
more
flavor
and
more
of
a
body
while
still
keeping
those
nice
crisp
and
clean
lager
characteristics
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
very
crisp
fairly
clean
a
little
prickly
just
slightly
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
they
might
start
to
get
just
a
little
filling
if
i
really
start
to
session
it
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
i
liked
how
they
managed
to
give
this
beer
a
bigger
body
while
still
keeping
it
very
lager
like
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
a
single
aspect
that
i
didnt
fit
into
the
style
and
theres
nothing
that
i
would
change
since
its
good
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
good
lager
and
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
tasty
lager
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
its
now
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
and
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
beers
that
anchor
makes
good
job
guys
this
was
one
tasty
lager
keep
up
the
hard
work
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
its
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
has
that
classic
lager
aroma
with
a
little
lemon
and
slight
banana
esters
taste
had
a
slight
tang
which
i
didnt
fault
it
for
it
was
malty
and
finished
clean
but
i
definitely
didnt
note
it
for
any
complexity
a
versatile
beer
thats
refreshing
any
time
i
would
like
it
except
for
that
bitterness
a
nice
fullbodied
lager
beer
different
in
flavor
from
german
style
lagers
such
as
becks
or
st
pauli
girl
initially
tasty
and
refreshing
dont
really
like
the
after
taste
overall
crisp
crackery
and
somewhat
moderately
hopped
for
a
lager
this
is
a
nice
summer
time
brew
with
a
good
flavor
but
having
a
quite
refreshing
taste
and
feel
medium
light
body
medium
to
medium
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
flavors
of
toasted
malt
and
caramellike
sweetness
the
only
knock
i
have
against
it
is
that
to
my
taste
theres
a
touch
too
much
hops
i
much
prefer
anchors
steam
beer
over
this
one
hop
heads
should
really
like
this
one
though
overall
great
beer
i
really
enjoy
it
great
drinkability
light
nice
balanced
flavor
its
just
great
4
165
overall
a
really
good
beer
from
anchor
not
as
good
as
their
anchor
steam
or
porter
offerings
but
worth
a
try
a
super
historical
salute
a
great
pale
lager
hopped
just
right
and
a
tribute
to
anchors
diversification
love
the
cans
though
id
suggest
doing
away
with
the
red
background
making
it
gold
and
keeping
the
crest
red
12
oz
bottle
poured
in
glass
taste
of
hops
a
bit
of
a
lingering
malt
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
a
pale
ale
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
preprohibition
lagers
i
have
had
it
is
a
very
clean
beer
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
its
crazy
to
think
this
is
what
american
lagers
used
to
taste
like
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
sweet
taste
is
malty
light
hops
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
grains
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
lager
and
good
session
beer
overall
too
thick
too
dry
too
hoppy
not
a
fan
overall
if
your
looking
for
a
smooth
lager
with
a
good
hop
bitterness
pick
this
up
love
the
label
with
the
bear
overall
its
easy
to
drink
and
quite
pleasurable
to
consume
i
recommend
at
least
a
six
pack
to
absorb
it
all
in
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
sensory
glass
the
label
art
with
its
retro
theme
is
really
apropos
it
feels
like
a
beer
rescued
from
an
ancient
cellar
wow
that
can
went
quickly
proof
positive
that
i
dig
it
o
a
good
and
sessionable
lager
fine
for
summer
cookouts
everyone
will
like
this
one
overall
i
was
expecting
to
be
underwhelmed
but
this
is
actually
rather
good
a
great
crossover
beer
to
bring
to
a
bbq
pours
a
golden
honey
in
color
with
a
good
12
finger
white
thick
head
that
lasts
the
whole
drink
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
clings
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
as
well
more
going
on
with
the
taste
actually
as
the
malts
crackers
biscuit
and
grassy
hops
comes
together
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
crisp
and
clean
with
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
perfect
carbonation
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
pale
ales
but
this
one
is
very
good
o
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
uncomplicated
clean
and
pretty
well
balanced
a
unique
tasting
lager
almost
to
simplistic
but
so
clean
and
enjoyable
for
the
summer
not
my
favorite
lager
but
already
growing
on
me
more
as
i
finish
the
bottle
something
i
really
enjoy
and
will
revisit
overall
4

this
in
my
opinion
is
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
hitting
all
the
right
notes
while
still
incorporating
some
distinct
flourisheslight
but
not
too
light
refreshing
but
not
without
character
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
etc
awesome
beer
and
even
better
that
its
in
a
can
very
clean
true
barley
grain
flavors
with
a
moderate
bitterness
level
low
in
hop
flavor
with
some
light
grassiness
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
with
balanced
flavors
carbonation
and
light
body
a
little
different
from
other
good
lagers
not
necessarily
better
but
different
m
great
amount
of
carbonation
to
this
style
goes
down
well
and
one
of
the
only
lagers
you
can
drink
slowly
and
enjoy

ive
been
spending
a
lot
more
time
with
this
beer
and
have
upped
my
ratings
a
bit
i
now
consider
this
my
personal
favorite
lager
produced
in
the
us
it
possesses
all
the
cleanliness
crispness
and
breadthdepth
of
flavor
of
the
finest
german
lagers
but
is
quintessentially
100
american
i
will
usually
have
6
or
8
different
brands
and
styles
of
craft
beer
in
my
fridge
all
great
brews
but
when
the
ca
lager
is
amongst
them
i
almost
always
find
myself
instinctively
reaching
for
just
another
one
of
them
until
theyre
gone
an
absolute
gem
of
a
lager
that
stands
up
to
anything
produced
in
the
world
today
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
with
tall
long
lasting
fluffy
white

and

piney
hops
and

is

and
crisp
good
amount
of
herbal
hops
balanced
by
biscuit
malt
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
and
herbal
nice
summer
brew
a
nicely
balanced
clean
and
crisp
lager
on
the
palate
with
a
bready
malt
flavor
and
a
floral
hop
note
coming
along
as
well
a
light
touch
of
bitterness
before
it
goes
down
oh
so
smooth
mediumbodied
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
an
excellent
goto
beer
that
shows
that
yellow
and
fizzy
pale
lagers
can
be
good
o
this
is
an
above
average
lager
thats
definitely
refreshing
after
a
long
day
of
work
paired
well
with
my
expertly
cooked
turkey
burger
i
can
see
this
being
a
great
summer
lager
i
only
picked
up
a
single
but
im
definitely
going
to
grab
a
six
pack
of
it
nothing
mind
blowing
but
its
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
lately
pours
clear
gold
color
with
a
ton
of
bubbles
racing
up
it
to
a
1
finger
snow
white
head
that
faded
and
left
minimal
lacing
and
a
thin
layer
on
top
typical
boring
lager
looks
smells
of
malt
grains
light
caramel
and
faint
floral
hops
smells
like
a
sweet
bready
lager
with
a
hint
of
fruit
pretty
cut
and
dry
nose
with
no
exciting
aspects
tastes
like
malt
grains
wheat
bread
crust
caramel
light
floral
hops
herbs
and
pear
with
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
the
finish
is
malty
with
a

zing
that
trails
off
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
light
carbonation
a
very
light
body
and
a
slightly
bitter
malty
finish
on
the
dry
side
an
above
average
malty
lager
but
not
one
id
run
out
to
get
again
anytime
soon
new
anchor
at
least
in
texas
it
forms
a
pale
gold
beer
in
the
glass
with
a
dense
though
small
head
the
nose
offers
mostly
grainy
malt
though
with
a
nice
floral
hop
underpinning
the
taste
is
decent
for
a
session
lager
some
nice
initial
bitterness
up
front
light
hop
flavor
and
clean
malt
thats
only
slightly
grainy
though
fairly
generic
it
is
pretty
drinkable
im
really
impressed
with
this
lager
any
drier
and
it
would
vaguely
resemble
that
carling
dry
i
had
a
few
weeks
back
taste
palate
i
am
picking
up
the
same
biscuity
and
white
bready
maltiness
its
dry
overall
and
finishes
with
some
mild
grassyherbalbotanical
hop
bitterness
the
palate
is
light
with
a
well
carbonated
feel
nice
color
good
head
nice
clean
hop
flavor
and
a
slightly
caramel
flavor
a
good
beer
if
drinking
just
a
few
but
may
get
a
little
heavy
after
several
just
sayin
anchor
beers
are
dependably
consistent
and
this
one
does
not
let
you
down
also
a
touch
of
breadyeast
head
maintains
and
dissipates
slowly
overall
easy
to
drink
lager
that
does
not
offend
nothing
particularly
complex
or
interesting
just
tasty
taste
this
is
a
great
tasting
lager
i
know
people
will
say
its
a
lager
nothing
special
there
but
this
one
is
a
better
than
normal
lager
a
california
lager
apparently
which
has
a
slightly
different
take
on
the
style
but
well
worth
the
pursuit
if
you
run
across
it
for
a
decent
price
which
i
did
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
5414
overall
a
simple
and
sessionable
lager
good
bitter
hops
in
the
taste
along
with
bready
malts
that
makes
this
an
excellent
choice
for
summer
o
this
is
a
very
good
confident
lager
from
anchor
its
not
a
very
sexy
style
at
the
moment
but
this
beer
is
executed
nicely
and
draws
you
in
sip
by
sip
well
done
i
am
someone
who
loves
all
types
of
beers
and
have
been
into
craft
beer
for
decades
in
general
i
believe
that
lager
beers
dont
get
the
respect
they
deserve
where
some
of
the
best
beers
on
planet
earth
are
lagers
dark
lagers
light
lagers
bocks
doube
bocks
pilsners
etc
etc
anyway
i
love
a
hoppy
pilsner
and
have
tried
them
all
but
this
anchor
lager
not
exactly
a
pilsner
but
simply
the
best
hoppy
lager
i
have
ever
tried
this
beats
victory
or
firestone
walker
by
a
mile
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
i
have
gone
through
like
three
cases
and
the
beer
stores
in
az
are
running
out
please
brew
more
and
ship
to
arizona
at
first
glug
all
i
could
think
of
was
how
much
this
resembles
anchors
purportedly
and
thankfully
distinct
steam
beer
trademark
duly
omitted
that
weird
yeastiness
bordering
on
some
sort
of
unwelcome
bacterial
action
and
an
everyman
pale
maltiness
colour
me
still
uninterested
yet
at
the
same
time
thankful
for
the
freebie
in
the
sense
that
i
didnt
blow
north
of
15
bucks
on
a
wasted
in
the
entirely
wrong
sense
of
word
sixer
i
wish
this
particular
beer
was
more
readily
available
in
my
region
we
seem
to
get
a
rather
limited
subset
of
the
anchor
lineup
to
date
i
had
yet
to
see
this
one
here
in
alberta
at
all
until
today
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
and
going
in
12
oz
tulip
glasses
coolness
you
know
a
brewery
is
shooting
for
historical
accuracy
when
they
singlehop
a
beer
with
cluster
which
is
surprisingly
still
grown
in
this
era
during
which
cascade
is
now
considered
oldfashioned
by
some
somewhat
unusual
color
for
the
style
a
golden
apple
juice
hue
that
is
just
darkening
into
a
coppery
bronze
with
maybe
an
inch
of
white
bubbles
on
top
aroma
is
rather
vinous
and
citric
evoking
white
wine
lemon
zest
fresh
grass
and
subdued
doughy
malt
tingles
the
nose
taste
includes
these
elements
as
well
with
extremely
crisp
and
dry
middle
and
end
sections
some
faint
grass
and
green
tea
notes
accompany
something
else
that
evokes
sour
fruit
and
tannins
think
quinine
from
tonic
water
perhaps
with
a
hint
of
butter
diacetyl
the
total
package
is
just
a
hair
thicker
than
the
usual
aggressively
carbonated
lager
leaves
a
nice
sheetweb
lacing
on
the
glass
if
this
could
be
found
in
bottles
here
id
gladly
pony
up
the
extra
dough
the
next
time
i
need
a
6pack
of
yard
beer
like
an
aal
crafted
to
have
more
floral
spicy
hop
notes
and
none
of
that
cloying
artificial
sweetener
character
youll
obviously
be
able
to
find
more
aggressively
hopped
lagers
if
you
are
so
inclined
but
this
take
on
an
american
classic
hits
crisp
and
refreshing
clear
out
of
the
ballpark
despite
a
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
overall
for
the
style
id
say
this
is
an
excellent
american
lager
and
certainly
worth
having
in
the
fridge
i
only
had
one
of
these
in
my
recent
mixed
case
from
craft
beer
cellar
ill
have
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
six
pack
locally

a

lager
overall
pretty

quite

if
not
extreme
or
amazing
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
was
better
than
expected
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
and
worth
a

easy

its
a

basic
american
pale
lager
12oz

the

of

thats
expected
overall
a
decent
easily
quaffed
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
lager
showing
there
was
much
better
beer
around
preprohibition
than
there
was
in
the
80s
worth
a
try
if
you
like
lagers
overall
ok
but
not
great
started
ok
but
got
a
little
syrupy
sweet
and
not
too
crisp
hops
are
a
little
stronger
than
expected
but
not
bad
so
a
decent
beer
overall
decent
but
much
fruitier
than
i
expected
i
thought
that
this
would
be
similar
to
anchor
steam
and
maybe
thats
where
the
problem
came
in
just
a
bit
too
grainy
and
appley
for
me
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
have
very
strong
aromas
or
flavors
so
it
seems
like
it
would
pair
well
with
lighter
fare
meals
notes
never
had
a
pale
lager
like
this
before
it
has
elements
of
a
pilsner
and
helles
this
is
a
unique
and
delicious
beer
i
only
bought
one
bottle
of
this
but
since
it
was
so
light
on
the
alcohol
i
could
have
easily
had
a
few
more
in
one
sitting
those
who
love
the
steam
or
the
seasonals
may
be
a
bit
disappointed
here
since
this
fell
just
a
bit
short
of
those
but
like
everything
else
they
brew
this
was
true
to
stylistic
form
and
enjoyable
in
a
subtle
way
that
increases
by
each
sip
overall
brisk
overall
brisk
clean

a
light

golden

with

the

mild

and
a
pleasant
light
neutral
hop
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
a
pleasant
low
key
lager
but
similar
enough
to
anchors
other
light
beers
that
i
cant
really
tell
them
apart
from
memory
a
nice
recreation
of
a
historical
style
but
maybe
ive
moved
on
since
the
1800s
o
a
competent
lager
and
a
nice
history
lesson
just
not
very
exciting
its
rather
boring
frankly
but
it
would
go
well
with
food
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
wellcrafted
lager
from
anchor
enjoyable
and
balanced
overall
easy
drinking
could
drink
a
whole
six
pack
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
grass
and
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
slightly
better
smell
to
me
overall
very
interesting
and
i
am
glad
this
made
its
way
to
maryland
only
problem
is
that
at
11
99
a
six
pack
i
wouldnt
make
this
a
regular
go
to
and
it
smells
almost
as
good
fresh
grain
like
really
good
middle
eastern
bread
or
a
sack
of
malts
or
caramel
corn
dandeliony
hops
give
the
slightest
of
nods
chewy
and
airy
balanced
and
zesty
a
lager
to
sink
your
teeth
into
it
is
first
and
foremost
a
showcase
for
pure
malt
flavor
i
involuntarily
picture
amber
waves
of
grain
when
i
take
a
sip
bready
and
substantial
with
a
rich
nuttiness
like
halva
the
hops
creep
in
along
with
the
bubbles
with
their
slightly
soapy
lemonlavender
flavor
to
whip
the
malts
into
shape
juicy
refreshing
balanced
full
of
character
superb
overall
drinkability
i
like
just
about
everything
that
anchor
puts
out
so
im
trying
to
be
objective
here
but
i
will
wonder
out
loud
if
im
not
capable
of
that
nicely
hoppy
with
a
different
hop
profile
than
all
the
other
hoppy
ca
beers
out
if
this
is
what
beer
was
like
in
ca
in
the
late
1800s
id
be
happy
if
this
was
all
there
was
i
do
think
it
would
be
better
with
food
and
im
thinking
some
stronger
tasting
seafood
as
one
is
enough
for
me
without
food
nice
at
the
end
of
the
day
but
im
not
wanting
another
right
now
another
tomorrow
yes
and
maybe
another
one
the
day
after
that
but
not
one
right
after
the
other
the
only
thing
i
didnt
quite
care
for
was
the
carbonation
but
lagers
are
supposed
to
have
a
bit
more
carbonation
i
think
its
just
me
wanting
thicker
and
less
carbonated
beers
lately
o
a
solid
recreation
of
a
classic
19th
century
lager
just
enough
flavor
and
aroma
to
make
it
appealing
and
highly
drinkable
for
the
classic
american
lager
fans
overall
a
tasty
session
lager
if
you
had
this
blind
you
wouldnt
believe
it
was
a
4
8
pale
lager
this
is
heavily
hopped
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
making
for
an
excellent
session
beer
it
seems
anchor
is
still
in
good
hands
lots
of
lagers
this
month
for
me
and
maybe
none
more
satisfying
than
this
one
all
things
considered
i
like
anchor
this
fall
bottling
or
at
least
distributing
a
few
new
ones
this
is
a
full
bodied
and
full
flavored
lager
caramel
in
color
and
boasting
almost
an
inch
of
just
off
white
suds
on
top
airy
but
patient
it
smells
like
it
should
slightly
rich
dry
though
with
a
complex
grain
engine
and
delicate
hop
accents
the
flavor
is
spot
on
not
sweet
at
all
not
bitter
not
thick
not
thin
not
sharp
and
muted
but
balanced
in
a
sense
of
the
term
reserved
for
the
best
of
the
best
definitely
malt
forward
but
there
a
lot
of
complex
subtleties
to
this
heavier
than
some
i
cant
drink
a
sixer
in
a
sitting
but
i
dont
need
to
be
able
to
in
order
to
enjoy
this
one
a
little
filling
a
lot
flavorful
well
done
again
by
the
brewery
that
can
do
no
wrong
a
lager
worthy
of
repeating
o
easy
drinking
and
with
the
low
abv
definitely
sessionable
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
would
desire
to
have
in
a
single
session
as
there
is
not
that
much
interesting
to
the
flavors
of
the
beer
probably
would
have
made
a
great
beer
for
enjoying
as
i
grilled
but
i
only
got
the
chance
to
sample
it
as
the
grilling
season
is
starting
to
wind
down
only
grilling
out
about
1
time
per
week
vs
23
nights
over
the
summer
when
it
is
to
hot
to
run
the
oven
in
the
house
anchor
california
lager
3
55
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
finishes
very
clean
perfectly
balanced
flavor
and
refreshing
this
could
be
one
of
top
all
malt
american
pale
lagers
i
have
had
ever
tasted
if
you
see
it
buy
it
after
my
first
round
of
tasting
this
lager
i
was
sure
it
had
at
least
three
kinds
of
hops
its
nicely
bittered
has
an
herbal
leafy
hop
flavor
and
it
has
a
very
pleasant
and
gentle
hoppy
aroma
to
my
surprise
i
learned
that
in
fact
this
lager
is
only
brewed
with
cluster
hops
this
beer
has
given
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
the
complexity
and
versatility
of
that
strain
ill
be
using
more
of
it
in
my
home
brews
in
the
future
i
highly
recommend
this
lager
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
o
this
beer
really
took
me
by
surprise
was
expecting
a
traditional
pilslager
flavor
based
on
the
aroma
and
appearance
but
then
wow
what
a
kick
but
in
a
good
way
love
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
would
not
hesitate
in
coming
back
to
this
beer
overall
smells
like
commercial
domestic
but
tastes
like
a
cradt
brewery
good
stuff
a
good
well
made
brew
o
definitely
worth
a
try
seeing
this
style
come
out
from
anchor
is
very
exciting
and
as
usual
they
did
not
disappoint
it
is
great
to
see
them
not
have
to
fallow
in
the
lets
just
make
a
insert
style
and
load
it
with
american
hops
like
both
craft
brewers
big
and
small
do
today
soft
and
supple
feel
biscuity
malt
light
apple
and
a
vague
herbal
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
smooth
and
very
drinkable
simple
but
still
flavorful
prototypical
example
of
the
apl
style
the
lager
is
surprisingly
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
as
it
shows
no
apparent
off
flavors
and
keeps
its
balance
well
in
tact
its
a
fabulous
beer
that
is
sure
to
fare
exquisitely
with
sushi
and
cobb
salad
overall
a
superlative
and
flavorful
lager
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
but
on
the
sharp
and
thin
side
i
like
what
they
say
is
a
historic
use
of
cluster
hops
maybe
this
is
a
good
niche
for
anchor
interpreting
classic
brews
from
the
past
that
dont
involve
babylonian
recipes
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
sparklingly
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
sticky
head
above
clean
simple
aroma
of
surprisingly
fruity
lager
yeast
and
a
little
floral
character
clean
yeast
slight
biscuit
and
cereal
grain
and
light
fruit
such
as
pear
and
grape
light
and
soft
with
a
satisfactorily
crisp
end
a
pretty
nice
neat
little
beer
that
i
might
pick
up
in
the
future
if
im
looking
for
something
on
the
lesshoppy
end
of
the
pale
lager
spectrum
excellent
label
pours
a
clear
vibrant
gold
with
a
nice
build
of
white
foam
cluster
hop
forward
with
its
dirty
spicy
rustic
flavor
malt
lends
a
clean
cereal
flavor
with
a
pleasant
faint
corn
note
that
gives
it
a
nice
old
school
american
lager
feel
firm
bitterness
on
the
finish
yeast
throws
off
just
a
hint
of
apple
and
sulfur
adding
complexity
surprisingly
full
bodied
anchor
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
a
great
example
of
an
historic
american
lager
that
still
holds
its
own
today
love
the
aggressive
cluster
hopping
and
sub
5
abv
theres
a
sweetness
i
never
expectedalmost
like
strawberries
good
hop
counterbalance
in
the
swallow
fullbodied
particularly
for
a
light
colored
lager
high
carbonation
not
necessarily
as
light
and
refreshing
as
youd
expect
from
a
pale
lager
it
truly
lands
like
an
ale
really
nicely
done
for
the
style
if
youre
a
budweiser
or
coors
drinker
you
could
do
worse
than
to
give
this
beer
a
try
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
poundable
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
i
could
do
one
or
two
of
these
then
it
would
be
time
to
move
on
to
something
with
a
more
agreeable
flavor
profile
was
hoping
for
more
from
these
guys
overall
this
is
a
craft
version
of
a
macro
style
lager
even
more
than
the
steam
beer
is
good
flavors
but
nothing
special
as
far
as
a
breakout
from
the
style
oeasily
one
of
the
better
american
lagers
ive
had
the
malt
worked
well
with
the
light
citrus
flavors
odnot
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
goes
down
quick
and
easy
during
a
near
100
degree
day
low
c
california
lager
it
seems
like
a
contradiction
on
terms
to
me
but
i
promise
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
as
i
do
for
every
beer
this
is
a
very
carbonated
beer
so
even
a
gentle
pour
seems
to
create
a
lot
of
dense
pillowy
frenchvanilla
colored
head
which
also
gives
the
beer
a
pseudocascading
effect
as
it
settles
color
was
a
deepgold
with
nequality
clarity
and
once
more
croesus
and
king
midas
were
fighting
over
it
now
joined
in
the
fray
by
mammon
i
have
no
time
for
their
antics
so
i
leaned
in
for
a
sniff
the
nose
was
clean
very
much
a
lager
with
a
grainy
maltiness
and
a
grassy
hoppiness
that
put
me
in
mind
of
a
german
pils
mmmm
mouthfeel
was
soft
i
mean
like
as
in
soft
water
and
the
taste
was
very
grassy
very
much
noble
hops
although
i
was
not
getting
the
malt
the
way
that
i
did
on
the
nose
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
but
i
kept
thinking
that
i
wished
that
they
had
allowed
the
malt
to
play
better
with
the
grassy
hops
not
bad
but
i
know
several
pa
breweries
that
make
lagers
that
i
will
stick
withto
at
least
for
the
time
being
as
a
fan
of
anchor
porter
and
lagers
in
general
when
i
saw
this
recently
i
had
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
unfortunately
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
one
it
smells
and
tastes
like
an
ipa
not
a
lager
the
grassy
hops
pervade
the
nose
and
leave
a
lingering
potent
bitterness
that
only
ipa
lovers
would
enjoy
yes
there
is
substantial
maltiness
up
front
but
it
is
quickly
overcome
by
the
strong
hops
if
the
hops
were
cut
to
about
a
quarter
of
the
current
level
this
would
be
an
outstanding
lager
its
not
bad
but
its
not
the
smooth
lager
its
building
itself
up
to
be
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
la
totally
naked
by
new
glarus
but
i
got
a
light
pale
ale
considering
anchors
bock
they
overhop
their
lagers
again
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
very
good
lager
especially
considering
the
billing
12oz
bottle
brilliantly
golden
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
holds
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lace
aromas
are
typical
for
the
style
lager
yeast
grassy
hops
biscuity
grain
tastes
are
fresh
crisp
grassy
hops
yeast
easy
drinking
creamy
lighter
body
moderate
carbonation
overall
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
good
to
see
a
world
class
brewery
presenting
a
standard
and
flavorful
lager
i
will
probably
have
this
one
again
this
summer
a
refreshing
and
simple
in
a
good
way
way
lager
that
is
true
to
the
style
could
be
an
excellent
crossover
beer
for
someone
nice
structure
with
this
beer
nothing
fancy
but
a
nice
clean
lager
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
and
that
can
work
well
with
food
these
guys
found
a
nice
summer
beer
here
overall
a
pretty
nice
lager
its
a
bit
too
thick
and
sweet
to
me
and
i
wish
it
was
more
crisp
clean
and
dry
tasting
still
a
pretty
good
beer
though
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
anchor
while
i
still
prefer
trumer
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
if
they
were
to
get
more
attenuation
or
just
bring
down
the
sweetness
in
another
way
then
this
would
be
a
great
brew
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
lager
o
id
like
to
think
this
is
what
a
true
preprohibition
beer
tasted
like
though
i
have
the
feeling
the
hoprate
is
a
little
bigger
in
this
one
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
thats
perfect
for
quaffing
every
day
has
a
good
though
mild
malt
character
and
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
be
paid
attention
a
damn
fine
take
that
ought
to
make
some
macro
drinkers
old
or
nuveau
take
note
i
really
enjoy
that
this
is
available
year
round
as
of
this
year
but
i
especially
love
using
this
as
a
replacement
for
all
of
the
rather
generic
summer
beers
that
come
around
this
time
of
the
year
i
could
have
a
ton
of
these
in
one
session
anchor
really
made
an
everyday
crowdpleasing
beer
here
but
its
quite
tasty
and
one
of
the
best
german
style
lagers
ive
had
in
america
in
a
long
time
it
pours
a
manila
tangold
color
with
generous
foaming
theres
a
light
honeyed
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
that
signature
anchor
steam
yeast
character
its
delicately
hopped
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
just
a
touch
of
the
hop
character
finishes
effervescent
light
overall
i
found
this
a
tasty
take
on
the
much
maligned
lager
paired
well
with
tacos
pours
what
some
may
refer
to
as
fizzy
yellow
beer
though
i
hate
to
associate
such
a
great
brewery
with
such
a
morbid
description
but
i
have
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
here
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
grassy
notes
in
there
as
well
taste
is
also
sweet
and
malty
slightly
herbal
and
mildly
bitter
finish
is
very
clean
lively
carbonated
and
a
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
has
moments
of
coming
across
like
and
english
pale
in
flavor
but
has
a
light
body
extreme
easy
drinker
great
session
beer
for
the
long
warm
california
days
of
summer
o
not
bad
at
all
the
missing
link
between
the
macro
swill
and
the
quitemalty
domestic
allmalts
ive
enjoyed
o
a
solidly
bitter
and
very
flavorful
light
lager
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
to
always
have
a
refreshing
beer
on
hand
o
this
is
an
excellent
drinking
pale
lager
well
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
cali
overall
its
a
great
lager
that
reminds
me
of
a
german
octoberfest
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
draft
as
a
comparison
this
is
pretty
much
what
ill
be
comparing
future
american
lagers
to
for
the
foreseeable
future
if
i
was
purely
rating
to
style
my
score
would
be
even
higher
this
beer
is
very
clean
light
and
refreshing
with
no
real
offflavors
on
top
of
that
it
doesnt
cheat
by
loading
the
beer
up
with
hops
and
comes
in
at
a
low
price
point
its
a
good
looking
lager
too
nice
bright
yellowgold
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
a
long
time
perfectly
transparent
the
aroma
is
so
clean
that
im
not
quite
sure
how
to
rate
it
theres
a
little
bit
of
sweetly
yeasty
doughy
malt
flavor
and
a
touch
of
floralherbal
hops
maybe
a
tad
bit
citric
the
taste
starts
sweet
with
squeaky
clean
fresh
bright
malt
quickly
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
combines
with
a
tart
yeast
flavor
to
dry
the
beer
out
the
finish
is
lightly
malt
sweet
with
more
hop
flavorbitterness
and
tart
yeastiness
it
reminds
me
of
a
toned
down
german
pilsener
with
that
refreshing
hard
water
crispness
the
finish
particularly
has
a
lingering
mineral
character
the
beer
drinks
very
easily
and
sits
on
the
palate
as
light
as
can
be
im
not
exactly
about
to
run
out
to
the
store
to
buy
more
but
if
i
needed
a
macro
lager
substitute
i
would
go
with
this
beer
o
good
beer
would
i
order
another
still
thinking
about
that
o
simple
and
straightforward
i
can
see
why
this
would
be
a
popular
beer
for
the
working
class
in
the
19th
century
while
this
isnt
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
its
good
to
get
some
perspective
on
much
how
beer
has
changed
in
the
last
100
or
so
years
in
terms
of
an
apl
how
can
this
not
be
close
to
perfect
for
the
style
beautiful
old
gold
sunset
with
the
slightest
crimson
hue
beautiful
clarity
with
a
billowy
cap
of
eggshell
foam
sticky
cobwebs
all
over
as
i
drink
this
one
down
nose
brings
cereal
cornflakes
some
graham
as
well
as
a
light
floralherbaceous
character
to
go
along
with
a
light
pleasant
bitterness
would
i
rate
it
as
high
compared
to
my
fav
stouts
and
ipas
no
way
but
i
am
rating
it
to
style
and
it
deserves
the
high
marks
expertly
crafted
and
extremely
drinkable
i
am
not
particularly
a
lager
drinker
but
this
one
would
rate
as
one
of
my
favorites
it
would
probably
be
my
go
to
lager
were
it
not
for
the
price
that
however
may
just
be
because
it
is
not
available
in
the
supermarkets
in
my
area
and
i
purchased
it
at
a
small
specialty
store
live
life
drink
beer
overall
a
nice
clean
lager
from
anchor
stream
something
lighter
that
is
well
suited
to
drink
with
lunch
i
think
anchor
has
got
something
nice
here
its
like
a
fancy
coors
ha
this
will
replace
a
lot
of
summertime
beers
for
me
tasted
from
draft
at
anchor
brewings
tasting
room
more
hoppy
than
a
typical
lager
which
is
appropriate
for
california
beer
if
atypical
for
the
style
pleasant
piney
taste
with
crisp
mouthwatering
finish
thin
lacing
pleasant
effervescence
crispness
makes
it
right
at
home
in
the
ranks
of
german
lagers
interesting
since
the
crispness
seems
to
come
from
hops
instead
of
water
minerality
ill
be
having
lots
of
this
while
i
visit
the
bay
area
my
staple
while
living
here
in
taiwan
a
good
macro
brew
slightly
sweet
but
v
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
nothing
wrong
with
this
overall
kirin
ichiban
is
not
number
one
in
my
book
when
it
comes
to
japanese
macros
i
find
asahi
and
orion
to
be
far
superior
in
flavor
both
in
japan
and
imported
into
the
states
no
disrespect
its
just
not
for
me
for
some
reason
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
its
not
a
good
beer
very
watery
beer
also
not
japanese
very
bad
japanese
beer
i
do
not
recommend
very
watery
lager
but
also
very
clean
not
terrible
by
any
means
would
prefer
this
over
american
macros
malt
is
there
not
much
else
light
flavored
american
style
lager
all
the
malt
and
taste
is
up
front
and
has
a
smooth
clean
finish
it
tastes
better
than
its
slightly
skunky
smell
good
japan
beer
brewed
here
sooo
to
date
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
drank
if
its
your
thing
i
say
to
each
their
own
based
on
my
memory
of
what
budweiser
tastes
like
this
is
that
yep
it
is
really
that
bad
surprisingly
tasty
and
thats
that
it
is
from
a
bottle
thought
it
was
a
decent
lighter
beer
smells
good
tastes
better
good
beer
pairs
ok
with
spicy
food
beer
flavored
saki
adjunct
madness
very
nice
for
mass
produced
beer
tried
the
original
japan
made
version
there
are
other
country
specific
origins
but
when
having
to
taste
review
do
the
original
more
of
a
situational
beer
if
youre
at
a
japanese
restaurant
it
definitely
adds
to
the
ambiance
a
good
clean
crisp
beer
smooth
i
liked
it
recommended
for
someone
who
is
looking
for
a
nice
light
beer
to
relax
with
as
far
as
japanese
beers
go
i
find
this
to
be
less
attractive
than
sapparo
but
better
than
asahi
overall
a
3
for
kirin
ichiban
kirin

i
may
buy
this
brew
again

doubt

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
this
brew
has
the
look
of
an
american
lager
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
grans
and
hops
so
far
the
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
but
it
has
a
smoothness
to
it
they
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
really
like
this
one
there
is
nothing
over
powering
in
this
brew
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
clean
and
crisps
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
this
was
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
i
thought
this
lager
was
really
good
had
a
fruity
taste
and
aroma
very
easy
drinking
beer
went
well
with
my
huhot
final
grade
3
43
a
serviceable
b
kirin
ichiban
is
certainly
not
an
interesting
beer
but
theres
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
it
i
am
rather
surprised
at
its
atrocious
grades
but
i
am
going
to
attribute
those
to
a
combination
of
the
difficulty
involved
in
finding
a
fresh
sample
of
this
beer
and
bas
not
really
liking
this
sort
of
style
in
general
probably
my
favourite
japanese
lager
to
date
keeping
in
mind
that
all
of
the
japanese
beer
ive
tried
has
been
contractbrewed
somewhere
else
enjoy
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
at
a
japanese
restaurant
in
calgary
label
indicates
100
malt
and
also
describes
the
contents
as
one
of
the
worlds
most
unique
beer
drinking
experiences
um
ok
i
will
concur
that
the
color
is
unique
for
the
style
an
almost
mango
yelloworange
with
a
light
spattering
of
white
bubbles
aroma
nearly
nonexistent
except
for
a
generic
graininess
tempered
by
just
a
dollop
of
breadlike
sweetness
taste
is
similarly
grainy
and
quite
astringent
faintly
sour
with
very
subtle
grape
and
custard
notes
some
buttery
yeast
peeks
in
and
out
as
well
rather
bitter
and
not
in
a
particularly
positive
way
the
hops
are
coarse
and
some
floral
notes
do
little
to
diminish
this
effect
ubercarbonated
of
course
what
tannins
are
present
at
least
serve
to
provide
some
flavor
ugh
it
is
perhaps
unfair
to
single
this
particular
brew
out
but
whenever
i
go
to
an
asian
restaurant
and
i
love
asian
food
i
feel
the
need
to
try
something
local
and
frankly
its
just
depressing
that
this
sort
of
thing
still
dominates
folks
beer
schemas
across
damn
near
the
entire
world
i
shall
have
to
bust
out
something
hitachino
this
weekend
to
restore
my
faith
i
got
this
because
i
found
i
dont
like
hops
very
much
and
this
says
100
malt
on
the
label
well
i
have
to
say
i
love
this
beer
and
im
surprised
you
can
get
this
taste
with
no
hops
at
all
ill
keep
this
in
mind
when
i
start
brewing
my
own
at
5
abv
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
and
it
has
what
im
looking
for
which
is
the
opposite
of
a
beer
called
hopalicious
i
usually
like
darker
beers
but
this
has
a
blond
pale
ale
look
the
smell
and
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
i
like
it
overall
im
pleasantly
surprised
and
look
forward
to
my
next
bottle
this
beer
has
almost
no
flavor
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
quickly
fading
head
if
i
had
wanted
yellow
water
i
would
have
drank
a
bud
light
definitely
not
worth
the
price
and
not
as
good
as
i
remember
the
taste
expresses
itself
a
bit
better
than
the
aroma
with
a
notable
barley
and
pale
malt
character
kicking
in
sweet
clean
crisp
finish
easy
to
drink
it
is
not
as
bad
as
all
that
a
very
mild
beer
very
light
flavour
and
mouthfeel
almost
watery
nice
crispness
and
pretty
fresh
it
went
well
with
semispicy
sushi
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
on
its
own
overall
a
decent
and
enjoyable
lager
but
not
outstanding
bright
yellow
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
short
bright
white
foam
that
maintained
fairly
well
light
bready
malt
and
earthy
grain
aromas
with
no
hint
of
hops
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
refreshing
fuzzy
carbonation
through
the
middle
light
biscuity
malt
flavors
up
front
with
a
light
bitter
tanginess
through
the
middle
finished
with
a
stale
bready
aftertaste
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
over
the
years
but
have
finally
gotten
around
to
trying
it
again
and
it
a
rating
not
much
to
say
about
this
brew
as
it
doesnt
entirely
impress
but
to
be
fair
its
not
altogether
that
bad
appearancewise
theres
no
head
or
lacing
to
mention
and
its
color
if
fairly
common
the
odor
is
not
bad
its
has
the
normal
scents
of
barley
and
yeast
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
was
mostly
carbonation
it
felt
a
bit
water
as
well
to
me
and
tastewise
it
was
okay
just
like
a
rated
it
and
i
gave
it
a
plusup
in
the
overall
category
since
it
did
taste
pretty
decent
o
nothing
special
in
this
100
malt
beer
would
like
to
see
something
special
for
the
exotic
beer
price
o
very
close
to
be
one
of
the
usual
pale
lagerswhich
is
not
so
goodbut
it
have
some
touch
of
decent
lager
overall
very
forgettable
like
most
other
beers
in
this
style
a
lightweight
allmalt
lager
that
just
doesnt
pull
anything
together
drinkable
but
pretty
nondescript
and
blasé
but
anyway
the
beer
itself
is
nothing
special
leaving
my
to
trust
the
debriefing
from
my
companion
a
nice
golden
color
to
give
no
doubt
to
its
claim
of
100
malt
that
distinctly
frat
house
smell
not
repulsive
but
certain
to
bring
about
memories
of
hangovers
past
a
smooth
passing
past
the
tongue
with
a
taste
of
relatively
little
other
than
a
slight
bittery
finish
i
doubt
i
will
ever
again
buy
this
beer
on
merit
alone
but
should
i
ever
find
myself
in
the
far
east
with
a
need
to
get
wrecked
beyond
imagination
i
will
certainly
know
where
to
turn
there
is
some
initial
sweetness
followed
by
a
very
pleasant
bitter
hoppiness
the
aftertaste
is
also
slightly
bittery
which
is
all
very
nice
and
enjoyable
a
nice
effort
no
real
reason
to
get
this
beer
there
is
no
taste
and
no
satisfaction
will
not
pick
up
again
probably
overall
this
is
beer
just
lacks
to
much
to
make
it
worth
while
to
drink
i
realize
i
grade
high
i
realize
i
need
to
adjust
my
ratings
cant
think
of
a
better
place
to
start
than
here
drinkability
that
is
hard
to
beat
thats
what
a
mass
driven
brew
could
be
to
please
all
sure
no
thrills
but
with
no
offflavors
great
session
beer
othis
beer
is
not
a
good
beer
but
it
pairs
alright
with
sushi
or
other
japanese
food
which
is
how
i
enjoyed
it
for
this
review
the
flavors
are
semisweet
and
bland
as
you
would
expect
for
massbrewed
swill
but
the
metallic
notes
are
turned
down
compared
to
many
macro
lagers
which
is
nice
not
a
beer
to
drink
standalone
as
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
in
all
facets
o
okay
at
best
fruitiness
is
a
little
much
for
this
style
supposedly
they
dont
sparge
the
mash
in
japan
but
who
knows
if
ab
follows
suit
in
the
us
id
like
to
try
it
overseas
grainy
aroma
ok
final
thoughts
i
cant
up
but
think
of
the
wrestling
curry
man
when
i
see
this
beer
because
curry
man
is
ichiban
although
seriously
this
was
a
disappointment
theres
not
a
lot
to
this
beer
nothing
outrageously
bad
mind
you
but
nothing
wondrous
pass
aftertaste
if
there
is
anything
to
write
home
about
here
its
the
aftertaste
if
i
did
write
home
it
wouldnt
be
a
long
letter
there
is
a
subtle
dryness
in
the
finish
but
its
a
dryness
that
leaves
me
wanting
to
drink
something
else
i
am
not
sure
how
big
the
craft
beer
industry
is
in
japan
but
they
are
missing
out
if
this
is
a
beer
they
are
known
for
like
i
said
this
pairs
well
with
food
but
thats
about
it
unless
you
are
eating
skip
it
you
can
thank
me
later
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
there
isnt
anything
to
recommend
this
because
there
isnt
anything
there
other
than
it
looks
like
a
lager
everything
else
that
makes
a
lager
a
lager
is
lacking
not
going
to
bother
with
a
full
review
here
very
mediocre
beer
with
a
faint
sweetness
that
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
beer
arrived
with
no
head
minimal
carbonation
and
no
retention
not
much
smell
here
at
all
sad
that
this
was
the
beat
option
available
the
feel
is
similarly
bland
just
a
touch
of
crispness
livening
things
up
in
this
lightbodied
brew
its
not
as
bad
as
a
lot
of
what
ive
read
pours
a
pale
goldyellow
with
minimal
head
and
nice
clarity
the
nose
comprises
of
faintly
sweet
malts
bread
corn
and
a
light
hoppy
grassy
bitterness
taste
is
again
malty
and
a
touch
sweetness
relatively
clean
flavor
for
the
style
no
off
putting
qualities
that
i
typically
find
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
to
pair
with
some
sushi
when
its
all
that
available
on
the
menu
but
im
certainly
not
going
to
seek
this
one
out
if
your
in
japan
youll
struggle
not
to
try
kirin
and
asahi
if
not
i
wouldnt
bother
a
solid
easydrinking
pilsner
which
works
better
on
keg
and
is
definitely
a
goto
when
not
much
choice
is
on
at
macro
establishments
id
like
to
have
it
off
the
fv
at
kirin
when
i
expect
the
offtastes
will
not
be
there
light
straw
appearance
not
much
aroma
tastes
like
a
fruity
floral
carbonated
lager
tastes
almost
like
a
light
beertastes
like
beer
remember
college
no
depth
at
all
finishes
as
it
starts
moderately
carbonated
pretty
much
no
real
redeeming
qualities
that
we
can
write
of
not
my
first
choice
of
the
foreign
imports
but
not
bad
theres
not
much
here
to
separate
this
from
the
other
examples
of
this
style
and
had
i
not
seen
the
bottle
i
would
have
never
have
guessed
that
this
came
from
japan
the
carbonation
must
have
been
deceptively
high
since
i
had
quite
a
bit
of
gas
as
i
drank
this
but
its
still
not
as
bad
as
the
big
massmarket
beers
i
wouldnt
pair
this
with
japanese
food
like
sushi
but
compared
to
its
north
american
counterparts
this
held
its
own
o
its
as
if
hirohito
pissed
in
a
vat
and
declared
it
beer
it
pours
a
clear
yellowish
color
with
only
a
slight
white
head
the
scent
is
sweet
with
malts
and
grassy
grains
the
taste
is
average
for
a
pale
lager
and
actually
better
than
i
would
have
ever
imagined
being
an
abinbevjapanese
brew
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
big
breweries
that
make
pale
lagers
with
cheap
ingredient
fillers
im
also
getting
some
sweet
hints
of
banana
in
the
taste
as
well
a
pretty
decent
brew
by
the
bud
guys
as
painful
as
that
is
for
me
to
say
lol
but
then
again
it
said
freshest
within
180
days
im
closer
to
400
days
so
maybe
thats
a
reason
why
its
better
overalli
was
ruluctant
to
rate
this
brew
because
i
knew
i
would
not
have
good
things
to
say
about
it
i
have
had
this
a
lot
especially
at
japanese
retaurants
objectively
speaking
it
is
good
when
travelling
through
asia
if
i
had
to
pick
a
beer
from
northeast
asia
it
would
be
this
one
or
sapporo
overall
this
beer
is
not
the
best
lager
and
there
are
many
other
good
lagers
out
there
meh
overall
an
ok
taste
of
japan
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
little
more
malty
than
i
had
expected
considering
the
style
and
lightness
of
the
beer
not
a
bad
flavor
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
traditional
offering
at
many
japanese
restaurants
so
i
will
eventually
have
it
again
but
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
o
this
beer
is
rather
malty
for
a
lightbodied
beer
but
theres
nothing
interesting
about
the
taste
o
ok
for
quenching
on
a
hot
day
i
would
not
seek
out
to
buy
this
though
pretty
good
a
fair
imitation
of
a
german
pilsner
pleasantly
dry
with
a
hint
of
noble
hop
character
to
give
it
an
edge
goes
down
easily
enough
and
would
quench
a
thirst
on
a
hot
day
worth
trying
overall
well
it
isnt
terrible
very
simple
and
therefore
drinkable
o
nothing
especially
noteworthy
but
it
was
a
good
thirst
quencher
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
but
i
would
drink
it
again
either
my
tastes
have
changed
or
the
tap
version
is
much
better
maybe
both
this
is
a
hrash
beer
the
metallic
bitter
warm
off
flavors
are
immensely
off
putting
there
really
isnt
anything
good
to
report
here
even
the
drinkability
is
slowed
by
the
off
flavors
despite
its
light
smooth
mouthfeel
ill
avoid
this
in
the
future
12
ounce

bottled

2012
the
bottle
says
freshest
taste
within
180

so
i
think
im
still
good
there
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
average
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
corn
and
not
much
else
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
it
is
light
and
goes
down
easy
for
the
style
of
beer
it
is
its
not
too
bad
worth
a
try
if
you
can
pick
up
a
single
bottle
somewhere
served
a
pale
straw
color
in
a
pint
glass
the
head
was
thin
and
very
fizzy
i
get
crackery
grains
and
crisp
lager
yeast
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
light
and
the
flavors
consist
of
pretty
much
just
pale
malts
bready
dough
and
lager
yeast
im
not
really
getting
any
hops
the
body
is
ultralight
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
and
watery
and
the
carbonation
is
very
fizzy
this
beer
went
well
with
the
fish
and
for
what
it
is
its
decent
but
i
would
never
drink
this
regularly
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
and
leave
no
lacing
aroma
of
corn
and
faint
hops
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
taste
is
fairly
clean
although
there
is
hop
bitterness
its
hard
to
make
out
any
real
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
overall
it
is
not
an
offensive
beer
and
easy
to
drink
there
is
just
not
much
there
somehow
i
think
this
is
better
than
many
other
asian
beers
on
offer
at
sushi
places
i
had
3
of
these
with
an
outstanding
dinner
at
nobu
in
las
vegas
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
but
very
very
thin
smells
light
malty
and
crisp
which
it
is
in
the
flavor
too
a
little
bready
but
balanced
off
by
some
generic
hopping
feel
is
average
too
extremely
light
body
with
medium
to
bright
carbonation
quite
drinkable
and
palate
cleansing
between
fish
courses
overall
this
is
far
from
a
great
beer
but
when
lined
up
with
many
of
its
asian
counterparts
it
is
one
of
the
most
tolerable
in
my
opinion
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
on
my
glass
it
has
a
medium
head
white
with
medium
retention
high
carbonation
taste
is
too
bitter
for
me
high
hops
presence
it
is
not
the
beer
i
can
drink
too
often
i
prefer
beers
with
less
hop
amount
it
is
nice
but
i
think
i
never
will
buy
it
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
isnt
much
o
this
tastes
very
similar
to
what
i
remember
sapporo
tasting
like
it
doesnt
have
much
taste
its
kind
of
watery
if
you
can
find
it
cheap
its
not
terrible
however
i
wouldnt
pay
a
lot
of
money
or
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
definitely
better
then
most
of
your
average
cheap
massproduced
beers
but
doesnt
compare
to
most
craft
beers
light
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
putrid
aftertaste
which
makes
me
wish
i
never
tried
this
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
if
it
usually
tastes
like
this
at
any
rate
not
good
mouthfeel
crisp
carbonated
stands
out
above
its
flavor
easy
to
drink
as
theres
little
going
on
had
this
with
my
dinner
at
a
chinese
restaurant
it
was
between
this
and
the
bud
family
so
i
gave
it
a
try
pours
a
very
light
straw
yellow
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
no
lacing
on
the
glass
to
speak
of
aroma
of
corn
and
rice
no
hoppy
smell
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
tad
bit
of
funky
bitterness
at
the
end
better
than
bud
but
thats
not
saying
much
not
as
good
as
i
remember
at
tachikawa
afb
but
i
would
drink
again
at
a
restaurant
but
would
not
buy
for
home
m
lighter
thin
body
with
a
pilsnerlike
level
of
carbonation
dry
finish
nothing
in
particular
has
gone
awry
in
the
mouthfeel
category
at
least
pours
a
translucent
straypale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
patch
in
the
center
of
the
beer
sweet
malt
perhaps
rice
and
or
corn
and
butterscotch
originally
i
thought
to
myself
while
smelling
it
this
is
not
too
bad
this
beer
will
probably
taste
ok
that
was
an
incorrect
assumption
the
taste
was
far
worse
definitely
a
lot
of
butterscotch
in
the
flavor
and
a
hint
of
breadiness
but
no
other
complexity
to
be
seen
light
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
with
no
lingering
after
taste
overall
ive
had
worse
light
lagers
but
i
certainly
cannot
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
o
weird
beer
i
guess
it
cost
a
lot
to
make
this
beer
because
they
have
to
use
more
malted
barley
due
to
the
fact
they
dont
sparge
the
mash
hence
the
name
ichiban
meaning
first
press
or
only
one
draining
of
the
wort
i
have
to
say
using
a
more
expensive
process
to
make
beer
fails
here
this
beer
was
a
little
better
than
a
budweiser
at
best
i
suspect
my
beer
brewed
in
the
uk
tastes
very
different
to
the
us
version
so
my
review
will
not
be
a
lot
of
good
to
most
ba
users
but
hey
ho
it
might
interest
one
or
two
who
read
it
o
i
would
drink
this
beer
if
given
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
as
one
of
my
musthaves
i
would
consume
it
at
the
hibachi
restaurant
as
part
of
the
japanese
experience
but
thats
about
it
its
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
thats
not
saying
much
and
with
that
im
off
to
the
super
bowl
party
go
gmen
overall
a
below
average
beer
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
in
this
category
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
two
finger
stark
white
head
which
gives
way
skim
there
is
thick
sheets
of
lace
left
up
and
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
bread
and
grassyness
the
taste
follows
suit
it
is
all
malt
the
taste
is
of
lager
yeast
and
grass
along
with
hints
of
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
overall
it
was
and
easy
drink
and
it
is
crisp
and
clean
but
there
is
just
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
on
doa
md
due
to
the
low
serving
temp
the
fizziness
doesnt
seem
to
bother
that
much
overall
refreshing
anyway
this
beers
promise
lags
way
behind
its
performance
im
afraid
albeit
adjunct
free
the
taste
and
body
dont
seem
to
benefit
directly
from
this
fact
while
the
alc
content
stands
out
where
the
flavour
wanes
which
is
a
critical
failure
in
terms
of
production
and
balance
imo
poured
a
2
white
head
the
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
and
exhausts
most
effervescence
on
the
pour
the
smells
is
mildly
of
malt
and
grass
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
with
malt
and
grain
theres
a
slight
fizz
in
the
mouth
in
the
finish
in
a
blind
taste
test
id
bet
id
have
thought
it
was
a
bud
relative
it
may
be
a
japanese
beer
but
my
sample
says
it
was
brewed
under
the
strict
supervision
of
kirins
brewmaster
by
anheuserbusch
inc
los
angeles
ca
could
that
be
why
overall
35
i
would
drink
it
at
a
japanese
restaurant
if
they
had
no
nigori
sake
but
would
never
buy
it
as
it
just
isnt
very
interesting
this
is
the
only
japanese
beer
ive
tried
unfortunately
i
hear
japan
has
a
burgeoning
craft
beer
scene
so
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
there
and
maybe
trying
kirin
again
fresh
o
slightly
better
than
the
average
massproduced
lager
interesting
malt
profile
ok
brew
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
was
hoping
for
yet
nothing
offensive
not
a
very
low
end
bmc
lager
but
is
still
just
a
tad
bland
as
far
as
hops
and
malts
go
o
not
that
bad
quite
drinkable
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
they
couldnt
pay
me
to
drink
it
again
d
for
the
style
not
bad
an
unremarkable
style
as
a
whole
this
is
a
very
average
example
overall
im
surprised
to
see
that
this
is
all
malt
ive
had
hundreds
of
these
and
have
never
gotten
that
impression
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
yebisu
for
example
overall
im
confused
as
to
why
the
site
says
this
is
a
pale
lager
but
the
bottle
says
100
malt
i
figured
this
was
a
malt
liquor
and
it
tastes
exactly
like
one
overall
an
insipid
lager
but
not
a
bad
one
overall
not
a
beer
i
will
chose
again
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
it
to
bmc
drinkers
because
it
is
no
better
and
probably
more
expensive
i
cant
think
of
any
scenario
where
i
would
recommend
this
no
wait
mortal
enemies
d
drinkable
yes
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
and
its
not
much
better
than
other
american
macrolagers
it
is
cheap
though
o
refreshing
simplistic
brew
not
great
but
not
terrible
o
one
of
the
better
basic
japanese
beers
easy
to
drink
and
compliments
japanese
food
perfectly
d
goes
down
like
water
but
nothing
really
sets
it
apart
from
adjuncts
in
my
opinion
not
a
nice
beer
at
all
o
its
decent
not
a
terrible
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
crisp
and
easydrinking
without
much
to
it
then
this
is
a
good
choice
as
long
as
you
know
what
youre
buying
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
my
dales
pale
ale
shaker
glass
looks
like
beer
generic
yellow
with
lots
of
bubbles
a
finger
of
head
that
dies
quickly
but
actually
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
like
beer
corn
veggies
barley
some
light
hops
tastes
a
littly
funky
vegetabley
but
otherwise
some
sort
of
generic
offering
of
light
biscuit
corn
sweetish
malt
with
a
really
bad
lingering
vegetable
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
bubbly
looking
but
very
thin
on
carbonation
when
it
actually
hits
your
tongue
i
would
never
pay
for
this
beer
color
is
medium
yellow
bland
taste
no
hops
to
speak
of
watery
at
least
it
doesnt
spoil
the
taste
of
the
unagi
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
japanese
beer
no
offense
to
their
people
but
beer
is
not
their
forte
i
picked
up
a
tall
boy
can
of
this
while
on
a
grocery
store
run
i
wanted
something
cold
and
mild
on
a
blisteringly
hot
day
just
a
little
something
to
tide
me
over
until
company
arrived
for
dinner
dinner
was
served
with
several
high
gravity
home
brews
so
i
wanted
a
beer
that
was
refreshing
and
wouldnt
color
my
palate
before
dinner
i
just
made
up
that
pretentious
nonsense
and
this
fit
the
bill
completely
average
in
every
way
but
sometimes
average
is
ok
i
would
never
buy
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
but
an
occasional
tall
boy
is
affordable
and
fun
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
w
a
small
white
one
finger
head
almost
completely
clear
in
appearance
no
carbonation
and
almost
no
lacing
smell
is
that
of
corn
malt
and
thats
about
it
taste
is
about
the
same
very
one
dimensional
and
not
that
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
not
much
there
overall
this
is
an
extremely
one
dimensional
beer
that
cant
be
recommended
inoffensive
and
bland
overall
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
unless
at
benihana
not
a
good
time
for
beer
at
all
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
19
2011
at
smokeless
joe
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
pale
yellow
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
the
aroma
was
grass
weak
hops
and
sour
stuff
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
sour
grains
weak
hops
and
bitter
t
its
just
like
a
soda
crispy
on
tonge
refreshing
flavour
is
so
flat
there
is
no
after
taste
pours
an
extremely
clear
light
yellow
with
a
2
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
random
patterns
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
sweet
grain
and
maybe
some
subtle
hop
aromas
taste
is
of
sweet
grain
and
a
grapelike
light
fruit
flavor
this
beer
has
low
carbonation
and
is
slightly
thick
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
with
a
bad
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
cheers
for
a
big
beer
this
one
is
surprisingly
decent
dont
tell
anyone
i
said
that
the
beer
poured
a
clear
light
yellow
liquid
with
a
pretty
big
head
but
it
dissipated
pretty
quickly
and
faded
into
a
spotty
cap
the
beer
gave
off
a
rather
light
corn
aroma
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
maybe
the
taste
on
par
perhaps
with
other
beers
of
its
stature
light
grainy
and
not
at
all
that
enjoyable
the
beer
had
a
light
fizzy
feel
to
it
probably
a
result
of
too
much
carbonation
overall
i
would
not
buy
this
again
as
there
are
other
beers
in
this
class
that
are
better
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
i
went
for
this
beer
for
an
afternoon
ballgame
drinking
opportunity
and
its
not
a
bad
choice
not
the
best
beer
but
better
than
a
normal
bmc
in
my
book
overall
i
got
this
when
i
mixed
and
matched
at
my
local
place
and
man
was
i
pissed
on
this
one
a
slight
side
step
to
typical
bmc
but
not
much
as
its
just
as
hard
to
keep
down
average
beer
at
best
overall
drinkability
cant
tell
if
its
infected
bottle
isnt
old
enough
to
taste
this
bad
will
have
to
rerate
another
time
overall
the
beer
is
not
offensive
and
its
fairly
drinkable
the
taste
is
well
balanced
and
although
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
also
wouldnt
turn
one
away
if
offered
tastewise
i
recognized
this
beer
as
much
heftier
than
tsingtao
which
ive
found
to
be
the
lightest
of
all
beers
ever
the
one
that
i
tried
at
least
it
was
malty
full
hoppy
and
flavorful
i
really
liked
it
i
thought
it
was
full
and
flavorful
but
in
a
white
rice
way
that
made
it
excellent
with
starchy
asian
food
and
the
hops
were
present
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
me
thirsty
but
not
without
need
this
beer
was
wonderful
with
japanese
and
thai
food
got
the
tall
can
from
the
store
so
my
expectations
werent
high
to
begin
with
was
a
thin
yellow
pour
with
minimal
head
and
the
smell
reminded
me
of
a
stinky
miller
lite
no
offense
giant
beer
company
the
taste
was
actually
drinkable
though
and
very
refreshing
id
say
itd
be
good
for
a
baseball
game
maybe
with
some
hot
dogs
or
something
not
a
beer
drinkers
beer
though
unless
youre
a
japanese
girl
no
offense
japanese
girls
was
thin
in
the
mouth
not
much
there
at
all
overall
its
drinkable
and
like
most
beers
of
this
ilk
a
good
drink
to
have
a
few
of
and
not
have
to
worry
about
having
blurred
vision
or
feeling
full
pours
a
thin
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
all
but
dissipates
mulched
grass
aroma
and
a
slight
sensation
of
hops
detectable
overall
skunked
but
crisp
to
the
point
where
it
doesnt
leave
an
unbearable
aftertaste
grass
and
stale
grains
light
thin
body
and
not
much
flavor
there
are
good
light
pale
beers
out
there
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
without
a
lot
of
positives
but
with
no
glaring
negatives
something
to
have
with
sushi
or
to
chug
as
a
first
beer
on
a
hot
day
o
really
not
a
good
beer
could
stick
with
typical
american
macrobrew
and
get
about
the
same
beer
brewed
by
ab
now
for
us
sales
jeez
too
bad
very
disappointing
encounter
with
japanese
beer
the
widely
available
macro
lagers
are
better
even
and
cheaper
dnot
bad
on
drinkability
but
this
could
be
the
blandest
beer
ive
tasted
so
far
overall
this
isnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
it
to
be
maybe
its
because
i
tend
to
like
japanese
lagers
still
not
super
impressed
and
id
still
rather
have
a
sapporo
i
have
never
really
tried
oriental
or
japanese
beers
the
only
other
japan
beer
is
sapporo
this
was
a
dark
beer
that
really
wasnt
all
that
fond
of
it
had
a
pretty
good
taste
without
a
lot
of
bite
or
bitterness
it
is
average
at
best
as
expected
it
was
very
dark
but
without
the
dark
taste
i
dont
believe
i
will
have
this
beer
again
unless
i
feeling
frisky
o
as
american
pale
lagers
go
it
is
o
k
i
change
my
ratings
up
for
the
simple
reason
that
very
few
light
or
lager
type
brews
can
still
hold
their
own
or
be
impressive
after
a
night
of
indulging
in
the
heavier
darker
side
this
beer
was
one
of
the
first
japanese
brews
i
had
although
this
doesnt
really
differ
from
any
traditional
lager
thats
made
anywhere
else
in
the
world
this
beer
had
a
big
rice
backbone
to
it
the
aftertaste
is
all
rice
the
beer
is
yellow
in
color
and
doesnt
have
much
lacing
or
head
it
looks
pretty
much
just
like
a
miller
lite
this
isnt
much
to
brag
about
here
pale
lager
is
not
a
style
that
i
nor
most
people
have
a
tough
time
appreciating
that
is
if
its
done
right
there
are
a
few
brands
of
pale
lager
that
comprise
some
of
my
favourite
most
frequently
drank
beers
but
they
resemble
nothing
like
the
diluted
corrupted
bastardized
examples
that
most
asian
breweries
put
out
kirin
ichiban
on
the
other
hand
as
much
as
it
surprises
me
to
admit
actually
does
dont
assume
too
much
about
this
one
pours
a
lite
golden
yellow
very
clear
whitish
head
soon
rings
up
smell
is
faint
and
biscuity
and
a
bit
of
mineral
and
bitterness
taste
is
decent
at
best
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
at
all
and
even
the
basic
profiles
were
just
lite
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
even
tho
my
bottle
was
fresh
the
beer
felt
a
bit
flat
overall
while
by
no
means
terrible
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
overall
wouldnt
buy
it
if
it
was
the
last
beer
on
earth
at
that
point
id
actually
consider
switching
to
wine
consider
is
the
key
word
id
more
than
likely
just
figure
out
how
to
brew
my
own
this
stuff
is
the
japanese
equivalent
of
budweiser
or
coors
though
somehow
worse
because
i
expected
better
out
of
japan
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
look
it
appeared
potentially
refreshing
or
thirst
quenching
and
light
enough
to
cool
off
with
on
a
warm
evening
the
taste
however
was
offensive
from
the
beginning
there
was
an
extreme
bitterness
to
it
but
not
describable
to
any
flavor
in
particular
it
was
bitterness
in
its
purest
obtrusive
form
other
than
that
there
was
little
recovery
in
any
aspect
to
make
up
for
its
initial
misgivings
d
i
thought
it
went
well
with
my
meal
at
p
f
changs
but
their
meals
are
so
salty
that
any
beverage
is
refreshing
i
had
two
but
again
long
day
dr
never
again
by
choice
is
this
what
they
forcefed
to
the
chinese
during
the
wwii
medical
experiments
given
the
choice
a
vivisection
might
be
preferable
it
should
be
said
that
its
probably
better
than
a
lot
of
american
macros
and
its
relatively
cheap
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
sodafizz
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aromas
are
subdued
and
simple
i
only
detect
a
faint
graininess
flavor
is
boring
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
but
neither
is
interesting
in
the
least
characterless
malts
linger
longer
on
the
finish
than
theyre
welcome
pass
rjt
d
a
beer

a
days
hard
labor
not
outstanding
but
fills

need
for
the
overworked

men
that
fill
this
land
summary
a
good
beer
for
beerpong
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
went
well
with
sushi
very
clear
straw
colored
bright
white
head
that
was
very
fizzy
with
little
retention
or
lacing
this
looks
like
a
macro
for
sure
several
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
the
aromas
was
corn
and
grain
some
malt
character
maybe
a
faint
biscuit
everything
was
very
faint
the
taste
was
of
a
cereal
grain
and
corn
some
minute
bitterness
not
a
real
pleasing
taste
tastes
like
a
macro
also
getting
a
stale
metallic
taste
too
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
it
is
refreshing
and
crisp
yet
i
will
only
have
when
dining
at
an
asian
establishment
drinkability
i
could
have
more
than
one
this
beer
compares
well
with
similar
beers
of
the
style
kirin
is
an
easytodrink
light
beer
and
would
probably
be
fine
alongside
a
nice
spicy
thai
noodle
dish
but
as
a
drinking
beer
this
one
fails
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
easily
and
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
much
to
it
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
better
than
i
had
expected
but
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
this
is
my
second
try
on
this
beer
and
the
first
only
got
a
score
of
2
13
this
score
will
probably
be
better
but
not
by
much
di
switched
after
one
but
its
not
offensive
so
many
could
be
drank
in
a
session
if
you
desired
to
do
so
drinkability
this
might
be
fairly
refreshing
if
it
was
110
degrees
in
the
shade
i
probably
wouldnt
want
this
under
any
other
circumstances
however
i
could
finish
it
which
is
always
positive
i
guess
does
have
a
cool
little
label
on
the
bottle
though
pretty
boring
yellow
with
a
white
head
pretty
good
retention
and
lacing
an
easy
beer
to
drink
definitely
refreshing
goes
well
with
a
meal
besides
that
pretty
unimpressive
taste
a
bit
like
an
american
macro
not
much
hop
flavors
though
malty
dryness
is
the
only
real
flavor
i
can
get
from
this
beer
pretty
simple
d
decent
drinker
good
for
a
couple
tried
this
for
first
time
lat
night
not
something
i
would
get
again
drinkability
served
ice
cold
it
has
the
potential
to
be
enjoyed
maybe
once
a
month
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
i
will
not
actively
seek
out
again
d
not
a
great
beer
but
again
enough
of
a
surprise
for
me
to
finish
it
decent
drinkability
if
youre
short
on
cash
and
dont
feel
like
driving
any
farther
than
the
local
grocery
store
its
worth
a
try
i
might
pick
this
up
again
sometime
in
the
future
what
a
mistake
i
was
eating
sushi
and
wanted
an
imported
japanese
beer
to
drink
with
our
meal
so
in
a
rush
and
without
first
consulting
ba
i
ordered
this
because
of
the
label
and
alas
it
was
very
disappointing
and
had
very
little
value
as
a
beverage
other
than
it
was
coid
so
this
american
made
drink
is
an
average
beer
at
best
and
something
i
hope
to
avoid
in
the
future
went
to
a
japanese
restaurant
in
san
francisco
so
i
decided
to
try
this
pours
a
straw
yellow
colour
with
very
thin
white
head
no
real
lacing
smells
of
grain
with
some
mild
grassy
hops
flavour
is
fairly
faint
carbonation
is
much
smoother
than
other
similar
lagers
which
was
nice
the
beer
wasnt
particularly
good
but
inoffensive
enough
to
go
well
with
sushi
overall
kirin
ichiban
is
a
wonderful
example
of
mediocrity
in
brewing
it
is
not
special
premium
nor
is
it
a
beer
that
anyone
should
keep
in
reserve
unless
it
is
to
refrain
from
drinking
it
i
will
in
all
likelihood
not
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
bottle
from
a
japanese
restaurant
i
saw
the
beer
in
the
book
300
beers
to
try
before
you
die
well
i
could
live
without
ever
trying
it
pours
a
straw
color
with
thin
head
aroma
is
light
with
notes
of
pine
hops
lemon
grass
and
biscuit
malt
light
body
flavor
is
light
pine
hops
some
citrus
and
sweet
malt
finish
is
long
but
barely
noticeable
on
a
plus
side
i
did
not
notice
any
adjuncts
but
it
still
tastes
like
a
pale
lager
to
me
drinkability
chug
with
your
sushi
its
not
a
beer
for
either
relaxing
or
having
a
d
an
ok
beer
to
pair
with
various
asian
cuisine
but
not
something
worth
drinking
by
itself
i
havent
had
many
of
this
style
so
i
cannot
say
if
being
this
tame
is
typical
but
this
beer
does
do
well
as
a
refresher
if
a
person
doesnt
want
to
think
about
the
beer
or
have
any
impediments
to
putting
them
down
fast
overall
this
seems
like
a
beer
to
chug
if
you
had
to
much
wasabi
otherwise
a
watery
introduction
to
rice
lager
its
like
beer
flavored
water
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
either
very
typical
for
the
style
if
for
some
reason
youre
in
the
market
for
a
japanese
beer
the
best
one
i
have
had
is
yebisu
and
i
have
only
seen
it
at
my
local
sushi
joint
not
impressed
with
the
drinkability
even
for
a
sushi
bar
offering
its
not
what
id
order
next
time
mouthfeel
is
pretty
bad
very
wattery
kind
of
sour
and
nothing
clean
about
it
not
very
pleasant
similar
on
the
drinkability
cant
completely
say
i
regret
trying
it
but
i
dont
think
id
get
it
again
d
not
bad
for
sessioning
at
a
baseball
gameget
it
only
for
the
times
that
call
for
watery
popped
collar
college
beerpong
league
kid
brews
will
i
get
this
again
abd
those
situations
are
becoming
more
and
more
rare
for
me
another
mediocre
pale
lager
drinkability
it
goes
down
without
a
problem
id
just
never
buy
one
again
atmosphere
is
okay
i
guess
at
least
in
t
part
the
appearance
is
not
bad
pure
golden
hue
and
a
giant
foamy
head
its
kinda
downhill
from
there
though
nose
is
very
nondistinct
just
not
much
there
flavor
is
really
really
off
a
weird
cloying
sweetness
and
it
seems
flat
or
something
overall
this
is
a
pretty
weak
quaff
d
eh
i
like
this
as
it
is
for
what
it
is
but
its
not
something
ill
probably
buy
again
getting
this
again
is
pretty
unlikely
unless
i
pair
it
with
some
sushi
but
my
favorite
sushi
bar
has
xingu
so
not
likely
average
but
just
not
that
great
started
out
ok
and
got
much
less
drinkable
as
this
warmed
nothing
horrific
but
why
even
bother
with
this
one
and
done
kirn
poured
a
bright
urine
like
yellow
with
no
head
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
though
there
really
wasnt
any
smell
taste
was
weak
a
bit
stronger
then
other
adjuct
lagers
with
a
bit
of
a
citrius
taste
that
was
a
bit
acidic
the
taste
was
very
weak
certinaly
cant
savor
after
a
sip
very
easy
to
drink
overall
an
okay
beer
not
too
bad
on
a
hot
day
had
this
one
at
a
sushi
restaurant
in
rancho
bernardo
on
my
recent
vacation
not
surprisingly
every
time
i
go
out
for
sushi
i
have
a
giant
bottle
of
japanese
bmc
this
time
was
no
different
along
with
plum
wine
distilled
sake
and
fiery
sushi
i
enjoyed
22
ounces
of
this
beer
it
was
golden
colored
cold
and
otherwise
not
nearly
as
memorable
as
those
jalapeno
rolls
i
indulged
in
i
would
say
if
youre
two
or
three
beers
deep
in
a
couple
hours
and
are
half
tipsy
the
beer
becomes
drinkable
other
than
that
stay
away
its
good
to
drink
this
i
guess
to
not
drink
all
your
good
beer
if
youre
really
going
for
it
at
the
cookout
or
whatever
other
occasion
you
happen
to
be
drinking
it
d
its
not
like
i
cant
drink
it
but
why
has
little
to
offer
d
its
a
japanese
take
on
american
macros
i
guess
its
a
fair
representation
of
that
if
youre
going
to
call
it
an
import
lager
though
maybe
not
up
to
snuff
notes
this
did
not
stand
up
to
the
other
beers
in
our
bracket
kalik
gold
red
stripe
stella
labatts
brooklyn
lager
fosters
and
pbr
the
best
way
to
describe
the
flavor
as
my
dad
put
it
so
eloquently
is
sour
dishrag
which
we
also
found
in
pbr
and
fosters
drinkability
easy
drinkability
very
good
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
this
one
as
it
is
fairly
smooth
and
fairly
refreshing
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
whenever
im
at
ph
changs
this
is
my
go
to
beer
its
light
straw
and
way
to
fizzy
the
aroma
is
lighte
with
a
hint
of
skunk
but
not
as
bad
as
much
macros
the
taste
is
a
little
skunk
as
well
with
a
bite
at
the
end
that
on
its
own
would
make
it
undrinkable
but
have
some
spicy
chinese
and
this
is
fine
to
drink
d
for
what
this
beer
is
and
the
meal
i
had
it
with
it
worked
quite
well
i
dont
really
think
ill
be
sitting
down
with
a
sixer
of
kirin
ichiban
all
the
time
but
its
a
nice
light
beer
tastes
again
not
at
all
bad
a
good
degree
sweeter
than
your
average
american
macromaybe
even
a
little
more
sweet
than
grain
beltbut
its
nearly
hopless
and
theres
only
the
tiniest
bit
of
generic
bitterness
near
the
backend
which
doesnt
do
a
very
good
job
of
balancing
things
out
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
was
really
good
paired
with
sushi
and
teppan
grill
chicken
and
shrimp
d
i
could
session
this
not
a
beer
to
drink
for
the
sake
of
drinking
great
beer
but
not
the
typical
cheap
offerings
either
drinkability
though
it
is
a
very
lowflavor
beer
its
pretty
light
and
refreshing
for
me
this
is
filling
the
bill
right
now
f
finishes
a
little
bleh
with
a
lingering
skunk
flavor
little
sticky
sweetness
light
lager
better
than
most
beers
of
the
style
but
not
great
the
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
rice
corn
and
some
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
i
get
a
lot
of
grass
along
with
some
corn
and
bready
malts
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
as
bad
as
expected
but
not
something
i
care
to
try
again
notes
looks
like
the
label
is
the
best
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
o
would
be
decent
if
it
was
cheap
now
that
it
isnt
i
would
choose
something
else
since
the
taste
is
nothing
speical
appearance
is
a
light
golden
straw
with
a
thick
crisp
head
and
surprised
by
the
lace
left
behind
smell
of
very
light
adjunct
grains
and
hops
taste
has
a
light
graininess
leaving
an
undesirable
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
good
spike
of
carbonation
ill
just
say
that
ive
had
much
better
japanese
beers
this
was
the
first
japanese
beer
ive
tried
though
its
brewed
in
california
and
is
very
similar
to
american
macro
lagers
pours
a
pale
strawcolored
thin
has
an
averagesized
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
taste
and
smell
is
not
very
pleasant
has
a
bitter
skunkiness
to
it
at
first
and
the
best
comparison
i
can
make
would
be
a
cheap
budweiser
or
coors
maybe
a
bit
of
rice
flavor
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
average
of
a
lager
a
bit
watery
drinkability
could
be
ok
for
someone
who
is
a
fan
of
this
stylebut
id
have
to
pass
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
appearance
pale
and
light
with
an
okay
head
inhale
the
scent
of
this
beer
and
you
will
unlock
a
lightstruck
mess
very
heinekenesque
the
taste
is
astringent
quickly
bitter
and
unpleasant
when
i
drank
this
beer
i
had
bought
to
bring
to
friends
houde
who
only
likes
light
crappy
beer
he
loved
it
i
hated
it
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
suffered
through
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
actually
has
more
body
to
it
than
i
expected
interesting
ive
had
a
lot
of
cheap
lagers
and
i
can
say
without
hyperbole
that
this
is
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
its
acrid
and
harsh
without
an
aftertaste
but
the
dry
finish
reveals
this
horrible
bitterness
from
what
i
can
only
assume
is
rice
and
corn
its
not
a
drain
pour
kind
of
accident
but
its
about
there
i
doubt
i
will
venture
into
the
kirin
world
again
d
poundable
due
to
light
mouthfeel
and
flavor
overall
see
drinkability
it
is
a
tasty
lightly
colored
lager
with
a
malt
palate
and
a
semidry
hop
finish
i
really
enjoyed
and
will
order
another
one
some
time
drinkability
quite
good
for
a
japanese
rice
lager
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
dry
finish
leaving
you
begging
for
more

drinkability
unremarkable
unmemorable
lager
though
it
does
serve
to
provide
a
modicum
of
refreshment
still
its
not
particularly
pleasant
and
one
i
dont
see
myself
revisiting
even
at
the
local
sushi
joint
as
i
tend
to
stick
to
the
sake
it
did
look
nice
but
if
that
was
enough
then
i
could
skip
the
beer
store
and
just
cruise
google
image
its
not
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
there
certainly
isnt
anything
memorable
about
it
just
so
so
drinkability
not
the
worst
beer
on
the
market
but
definitely
nothing
worth
having
often
it
goes
down
easy
and
isnt
that
offensive
in
taste
pretty
standard
macro
lager
in
my
opinion
overall
ick
drinkability
3
0
one
or
two
beers
could
definitely
be
consumed
in
one
sitting
but
it
would
probably
not
be
my
preference
however
i
do
respect
it
as
a
quality
brewed
beer
my
first
japanese
beer
nothing
to
special
but
worth
a
try
to
get
my
feet
wet
in
japanese
beer
i
might
try
a
few
more
of
these
d
reasonably
drinkable
with
decent
flavor
for
what
it
is
itll
pair
well
with
most
asian
food
and
thats
generally
when
i
have
it
definitely
sessionable
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
the
flavor
isnt
anything
special
but
its
not
disgusting
either
if
this
were
cheap
i
might
have
a
few
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
unfortunately
there
are
other
beers
out
there
that
are
far
superior
for
the
price
if
only
this
had
been
an
import
from
japan
it
would
at
least
lend
it
some
cultural
novelty
instead
its
just
another
american
macro
notes
taste
a
lot
like
a
macro
a
bit
more
sweet
and
grain
taste
than
other
macros
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
good
or
bad
thing
so
basically
imagine
going
out
and
eating
the
worst
food
ever
i
mean
like
rotted
eel
in
cambodia
having
a
horrible
intestinal
infection
shitting
all
over
yourself
for
a
week
letting
the
excrement
bake
in
the
sun
for
a
few
days
then
mixing
it
with
water
and
bottling
it
thats
pretty
much
the
taste
that
kirin
offers
ill
just
leave
it
at
that
pretty
drinkable
thisd
be
a
great
beer
in
university
if
it
was
really
cheap
not
too
much
to
it
and
goes
down
easy
as
usual
hardly
something
worthy
of
seeking
out
on
its
own
but
given
a
place
next
to
its
country
of
origins
food
especially
if
its
of
the
spicy
sort
these
kinds
of
lagers
seem
to
work
here
it
was
a
decent
enough
serving
for
one
when
used
for
washing
down
some
chili
tuna
maki
rolls
and
beef
tataki
id
call
the
kirin
ichiban
at
least
as
drinkable
as
budweiser
it
is
not
a
good
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
definition
but
it
is
not
offensive
either
d
it
is
on
the
better
side
for
macrobeer
but
certainly
not
anything
to
be
excited
about
passable
not
desirable
bottle
brewed
by
ab
in

us
a
clear
light
straw

pour
with
a
thin
fizzy
short
lasting
white
head
no

slightly
grainy
a
little
corn
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
background
faint

is
light
and
crisp
again
a
very
light
sweetness
with
some
faint
hop
notes
nothing
offensive
light
body
thin
watery
mouthfeel
typical
of
the
style
light
grainy
finish
sessionable
and
drinkable
a
good
try
but
probably
nothing
i
would
buy
again
meh
yet
another
disappointing
japanese
brew
anyone
know
of
anything
better
from
there
as
i
am
unwilling
to
write
off
the
whole
country
and
dont
say
hitachino
not
impressed
there
either
overall
another
soso
rice
lager
i
have
yet
to
try
an
example
of
this
style
that
is
unique
from
a
mediocre
light
macro
lager
this
example
however
isnt
even
brewed
in
japan
so
it
does
not
even
get
credit
for
being
a
culturally
interesting
import
drinkability
no
just
no
never
again
d
maybe
one
could
use
this
to
cut
through
japanese
cuisine
but
i
think
itd
actually
wind
up
hurting
the
dish
cant
really
recommend
it
on
its
own
but
if
youre
like
me
youre
willing
to
try
any
brew
at
least
once
right
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
did
not
stand
out
as
having
any
significant
flavor
or
mouthfeel
its
a
good
lager
for
a
warm
day
and
moderately
priced
d
fairly
generic
lager
i
dont
really
see
the
appeal
of
this
one
thin
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
clean
dry
finish
easily
quaffable
dont
let
the
mass
production
scare
you
away
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
kanpai
d
all
things
aside
it
was
very
drinkable
nothing
too
offensive
about
it
just
not
that
impressive
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
will
probably
buy
again
just
not
all
that
impressed
very
bland
truthfully
im
disappointed
its
not
as
i
remember
it
then
again
i
used
to
drink
crap
none
the
less
i
find
this
one
of
the
better
japanese
lager
offerings
d
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
far
fromt
eh
best
this
seems
as
i
would
epect
for
a
jap
rice
based
beer
not
bad
drinkable
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice
if
i
had
other
options
drinkability
i
am
not
against
the
style
but
i
could
not
finish
this
one
this
was
my
first
drain
pour
in
a
long
time
the
taste
has
some
bitter
that
is
very
off
putting
two
sips
are
sadly
enough
this
is
an
easy
brew
to
find
in
these
here
parts
by
japanese
standards
quality
and
pricing
its
a
reasonable
investment
if
youre
buying
in
bulk
oh
good
lord
this
is
bad
i
cant
even
remember
why
i
had
it
in
my
fridge
someone
must
have
left
it
there
so
this
might
not
be
the
freshest
example
but
i
honestly
cant
believe
that
would
make
a
differance
it
doesnt
look
as
bad
is
tastes
theres
a
positive
smell
is
hard
to
explain
like
grainy
vinegar
pickle
brine
soy
sauce
kind
of
thing
soy
sauce
that
expired
in
your
fridge
eighteen
months
ago
the
taste
is
similar
dry
bitter
in
the
worst
way
possible
not
a
hop
presance
just
burning
chemical
bitter
theres
a
very
unpleasant
metalic
aftertaste
i
get
that
soy
sauce
thing
again
to
quote
ralph
wiggum
it
tastes
like
burning
i
couldnt
come
close
to
putting
all
twelve
ounces
in
me
there
are
no
redeaming
qualities
to
this
beer
d
goes
down
smooth
and
isnt
too
heavy
so
you
could
have
quite
a
few
d
yeah
its
ok
to
order
a
kirin
at
a
sushi
bar
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
without
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
bit
of
grainy
sweetness
and
almost
no
hop
presence
the
taste
is
grainy
and
mildly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
in
that
it
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
to
really
bring
me
back
to
it
not
incredible
but
id
choose
it
over
other
asian
macro
lagers
maybe
not
yebisu
and
any
north
american
one
d
i
like
this
in
a
japanese
restaurant
but
otherwise
i
dont
really
drink
it
nothing
offensive
but
worth
mentioning
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
pretty
large
head
not
much
lacing
to
be
seen
here
faint
skunky
beer
aroma
to
it
taste
is
medium
bodied
pretty
surprised
as
i
was
definitely
expecting
this
to
be
lighter
than
ever
but
even
though
it
has
nice
consistency
to
it
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
non
existent
you
can
swish
it
around
your
mouth
for
30
seconds
and
all
you
taste
is
a
slight
tinge
of
hops
rest
of
it
just
a
watery
mass
just
import
swill
right
here
wouldnt
recommend
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
virtually
no
smell
here
some
hints
of
rice
taste
is
crisp
and
mild
finishing
dry
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
here
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
pretty
good
drinkability
overall
a
fairly
average
beer
typical
adjunct
macro
lager
but
not
a
beer
that
you
would
want
to
dink
for
the
flavor
alone
good
to
pair
with
spicy
food
but
it
cant
stand
alone
pours
effervescent
into
the
glass
with
a
burst
of
white
head
that
readily
dissappears
carbonation
starts
and
ends
with
a
flash
as
well
looks
typically
golden
yellow
and
clear
clear
clear
smells
of
adjunctbased
alcohol
and
little
else
flavor
agrees
with
the
color
and
the
smell
thinking
hard
enough
there
is
some
very
light
malt
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
covered
up
with
some
nonhop
bitterness
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
however
with
asian
food
of
course
or
anything
spicy
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
in
taste
overall
i
this
is
a
great
beer
with
oriental
cuisine
by
its
self
it
is
nothing
special
but
pair
it
up
with
some
sushi
or
thai
food
and
it
is
wonderful
d
worked
well
with
the
chinese
food
id
ordered
its
light
simple
and
not
much
else
my
favorite
of
the
big
three
japanese
beers
developed
a
nice
head
which
persisted
for
awhile
and
a
golden
color
aroma
was
like
an
average
pilsener
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
taste
was
unsubstantial
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
remarkable
in
any
way
not
worth
the
premium
price
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
a
very
anonymous
beer
with
little
aroma
and
taste
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
light
smell
of
grains
but
nothing
distinct
tastes
like
it
smells
nothing
special
just
some
light
grains
goes
down
pretty
easily
like
water
it
has
a
odd
aftertaste
that
pretty
much
kills
the
beer
overall
something
to
drink
when
there
isnt
any
other
option
available
just
slightly
better
than
a
coors
light
or
bud
i
liked
this
beer
goes
great
with
sushi
has
a
bit
of
a
rice
flavor
and
goes
great
with
a
wedge
of
lemon
crushed
into
it
finishes
pretty
clean
and
goes
down
smooth
when
it
is
ice
cold
and
the
outside
temp
is
in
the
90s
maybe
it
is
the
heat
outside
but
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
d
not
the
most
tasty
but
goes
down
okay
when
its
all
there
is
on
the
menu
at
my
sushi
spot
so
theres
a
time
and
a
place
for
every
beer
and
this
one
belongs
in
a
30
humid
japanese
summer
the
heat
somehow
takes
your
mind
off
what
you
are
drinking
and
it
actually
becomes
enjoyable
strangely
it
seems
to
be
being
replaced
in
some
joints
by
kirin
braumeister
a
slight
but
imperceptible
upgrade
the
bitterness
prevails
with
an
odd
aftertaste
not
very
nice
at
all
this
style
would
be
best
paired
with
heavier
sauced
dishes
andor
takeout
chinese
food
especially
cooked
veggies
or
light
game
but
i
seriously
would
advise
against
this
beer
especially
to
pair
it
with
anything
poured
a
fairly
deep
yellow
thin
soapy
bubbles
on
top
that
fade
to
nothing
in
minutes
i
remember
this
being
lighter
in
color
smells
faintly
of
grains
and
not
much
else
i
know
these
asian
rice
lagers
are
supposed
to
be
very
simple
and
dry
but
this
beer
is
too
simple
and
dry
theres
no
real
funky
flavors
that
you
might
run
into
in
a
cheap
american
lager
so
thats
nice
you
really
have
to
hunt
for
the
dry
husky
grainy
flavor
it
has
not
horrible
but
most
the
time
this
would
be
too
damn
expensive
to
pay
for
at
import
prices
i
could
really
knock
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
or
any
day
this
is
defitely
a
sessionable
beer
d
ok
drinkability
very
light
and
simple
tastes
good
with
sushi
pale
yellow
appearance
with
not
much
head
retention
almost
no
aroma
to
speak
of
flavor
is
very
malty
can
be
perceived
as
sweet
and
actually
very
pleasant
finishes
with
a
light
pleasant
bitterness
it
remains
a
very
nice
complement
to
spicy
tuna
rolls
the
adjuncts
are
hard
and
heavy
here
with
a
nasty
aftertaste
that
sits
on
the
top
of
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
fits
the
taste
well
i
dont
like
this
brew
but
it
is
refreshing
conceivably
it
could
pass
for
lawnmower
fodder
in
sweltering
temps
whatever
i
guess
with
alot
of
greasy
chinese
food
not
gonna
buy
this
one
again
d
notes
watery
and
boring
i
guess
this
bland
taste
would
go
well
with
sushi
and
other
japanese
cuisine
note
this
beer
has
recently
been
rereleased
the
new
ichiban
shibori
is
100
malt
i
was
so
gungho
when
i
first
read
the
news
however
this
review
is
for
the
old
style
ive
only
had
it
a
few
times
since
then
ill
add
the
new
type
ichiban
shibori
and
review
it
for
you
later
its
a
bit
different
overall
this
was
served
to
me
very
cold
in
a
21
oz
bottle
it
seemed
to
hit
the
spot
with
the
salty
sushi
an
average
rice
beer
here
you
probably
should
avoid
it
if
rice
isnt
your
thing
im
not
trying
to
be
funny
im
not
trying
to
be
mean
and
im
not
familiar
with
japanese
beers
so
i
dont
know
if
this
is
good
japanese
beer
or
not
but
i
am
saying
that
i
will
not
be
buying
kirin
ichiban
in
the
future
d
this
isnt
a
great
tasting
lager
but
it
still
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
run
out
and
buy
a
case
mouthfeel
is
thin
watery
and
fizzy
d
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
did
well
washing
down
my
popcorn
but
pbr
could
do
that
and
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
the
taste
offers
a
slight
improvementtheres
a
minimal
amount
of
hop
present
particularly
in
the
swallow
also
for
a
rice
brew
this
has
a
surprising
solid
body
it
also
has
a
very
high
carbonation
level
giving
the
mouthfeel
a
definitive
spritziness
thin
malt
flavor
overall
a
step
above
the
traditional
macros
barely
not
awful
for
what
it
is
and
in
hot
weather
its
not
a
bad
choice
out
of
a
22oz
special
reserve
can
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
strawgold
color
the
head
was
onefinger
and
off
white
the
retention
decent
the
lacing
mediocre
the
aroma
was
a
blend
of
dry
grains
and
pale
malt
just
general
macro
lager
the
flavors
were
crisp
and
refreshing
slightly
tart
a
simple
but
wellbalanced
blend
of
pale
malt
dry
grains
slight
hops
and
rice
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
carbonation
good
the
body
medium
similar
to
singh
and
a
great
choice
for
pairing
with
asian
food
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
12
inch
head
with
slight
lacing
and
slight

smells
of
the
cleanliness
of
a
lager
fits
the
style
has
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
there
was
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
mostly
of
a
clean
lager
a
little
more
body
and
less
adjunct
flavor
than
budweiser
type
products
overall
not
bad
compared
to
adjunct
lagers
but
otherwise
not
that
great
drinkability
overall
pretty
average
but
the
unnatural
rubber
taste
totally
makes
this
beer
one
to
avoid
i
like
the
drinkability
of
this
one
its
not
going
to
blow
anyone
away
with
a
huge
range
of
tastes
and
its
not
a
high
quality
beer
but
for
what
it
is
it
gets
the
job
done
drinkability
carbonation
can
be
considered
refreshing
right
off
the
bat
this
beer
has
an
odd
rubber
aroma
nothing
different
froma
a
bud
light
very
dry
beer
instead
of
being
heavily
sweet

is
what
it
is
i
find
in
some
oriental

it
is
very
difficult
to
find
a
good

sometimes
you
need

you

this
seems
to
be

you
may

your

personally
i

why
do

not
worth
the
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
experienced
not
the
worst
they
served
it
to
me
in
a
pilsener
glass
which
was
frosted
i
waited
till
the
glass
warmed
up
to
room
temp
it
was
a
clear
gold
color
on
the
pour
with
a
big
white
head
smells
of
malt
and
grain
that
is
also
what
it
tasted
like
lots
of
malt
not
enough
balance
a
very
sub
par
beer
by
itself
kirin
ichiban
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
in
fact
its
a
barely
average
beer
paired
with
sushi
or
okinawan
soba
and
its
found
its
niche
unzari
drinkability
i
only
drink
this
when
having
sushi
otherwise
why
bother
that
said
i
still
think
it
pairs
well
with
the
cuisine
imho
well
it
doesnt
compete
with
it
in
any
case
im
still
waiting
on
the
sushi
bar
with
a
kickass
beer
selection
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
body
topped
by
a
full
and
foamy
bright
white
head
that
holds
very
well
before
dropping
to
a
razor
thin
surface
covering
it
leaves
next
to
no
lace
about
the
glass
the
carbonation
is
quite
fine
leaving
thin
steady
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
steadily
to
the
surface
very
nice
appearance
the
nose
is
limited
to
a
generic
beer
aroma
with
some
lightly
grainy
malt
lowlevel
undiscernable
hops
some
lagerfermentation
sulphur
and
a
thin
thread
of
alcohol
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
gentle
carbonation
thats
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
delivers
a
clean
and
straightforward
grainy
malt
thats
delicately
touched
by
hop
flavor
but
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
a
mild
note
of
apple
or
dried
golden
fruit
pear
perhaps
adds
a
hint
of
character
to
it
it
finishes
short
and
dry
with
a
light
note
of
residual
malt
and
sublime
hop
bitteress
refreshing
note
more
than
half
a
decade
later
this
review
is
kind
of
embarrassing
but
its
where
i
was
as
a
fledgling
beer
drinker
so
ill
keep
it
for
historic
purposes
not
a
pleasing
beer
by
any
means
ive
had
worse
but
for
a
premiumimport
price
the
beer
shouldnt
taste
this
cheap
those
who
like
the
flavor
of
grolschheineken
might
want
to
give
this
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
else

something
is
definately
wrong
with
this
beer
poured
it
out
of
its
can
into
a
glass
and
the
color
was
i
guess
its
kinda
gold
with
an
eye
towards
green
this
doesnt
instill
confidence
figured
it
was
one
of
those
mythical
japanese
creature
things
yea
i
know
its
brewed
in
l
a
gave
it
a
sniff
and
it
smells
a
doctor
prescribed
it
for
a
heinous
infection
took
a
sip
tastes
like
it
could
give
me
a
heinous
infection
im
not
really
sure
this
is
beer
in
fact
id
be
prepared
to
just
label
it
a
byproduct
of
a
hollywood
facelift
lab
simply
a
nasty
foul
smelling
brew
pale
lightish
yellow
with
a
short
lsting
macro
head
of
about
15
seconds
of
gas
no
real
lace
generation
the
smells
are
understated
and
vaquely
vegetal
overall
similar
to
miller
high
life
flavor
is
thin
straight
sucrose
malt
countered
by
an
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
drying
but
lighly
metallic
hop
vaporlike
mouthfeel
not
a
lot
here
not
a
disagreeable
aftertaste
but
i
cant
see
choosing
this
over
others
in
ordinary
lager
category
ng
not
drinkable
to
me
at
all
even
with
sushi
ill
buy
sapporo
reserve
next
time
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
white
bubbles
that
quickly
disappeared
and
a
carbonated
weak
straw
yellow
body
it
has
a
strong
hop
aroma
and
a
fizzy
hop
flavor
without
much
character
this
brew
is
not
impressive
in
the
least
and
i
will
probably
never
buy
another
one
this
lager
poured
a
small
white
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
that
quickly
dissolved
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
observed
rising
to
the
top
the
body
was
gold
in
color
there
was
a
bitter
taste
and
an
aftertaste
observed
with
this
lager
this
lager
lacked
character
and
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
lager
once
upon
a
time
in
a
magical
land
far
far
away
i
used
to
actually
drink
this
stuff
every
once
in
a
while
and
didnt
mind
it
that
much
but
i
drank
it
iced
cold
and
straight
out
of
the
bottle
those
days
have
reached
the
point
of
folklore
by
now
if
you
want
a
japanese
lager
this
isnt
it
watery
lager
and
almost
like
miller
light
or
coors
light
clear
light
gold
with
little
flavor
ive
had
it
before
in
bottle
and
was
hoping
it
might
be
marginally
better
on
draught
but
no
luck
great
for
quenching
thirst
but
not
satisfying
as
a
beer
drinkability
yeah
you
can
drink
them
if
youve
got
nothing
better
to
do
nothing
better
to
drink
and
a
mean
streak
of
masochism
color
is
clear
yellow
with
a
gold
quality
but
a
vigorous
pour
produced
very
little
head
or
foam
smell
is
thin
malt
and
grain
of
rice
or
corn
taste
is
mostly
watered
down
malt
corn
and
rice
with
real
no
flavor
barely
sweet
feel
is
water
thin
weak
empty
nothing
have
a
glass
a
water
with
a
lemon
very
sorry
i
even
tried
it
whats
ab
doing
in
japan
anyways
ruining
more
of
their
super
awesome
and
very
old
culture
japan
gives
us
nothing
but
the
best
in
electronics
and
we
give
em
ab
for
shame
well
this
is
nothing
i
will
ever
drink
again
it
could
have
been
a
lot
better
and
just
a
little
bit
worse
i
paid
nothing
for
it
so
it
was
not
a
big
deal
very
little
flavor
and
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
just
a
bit
skunky
with
some
graininess
special
premium
reserve
that
will
have
me
laughing
for
ages
cant
say
i
expected
much
out
of
this
beer
and
it
held
up
to
that
expectation
it
poured
very
clear
and
golden
with
a
very
thin
and
quickly
dissapating
head
the
smell
was
entirely
pedestrian
almost
like
budweiser
on
contact
it
has
a
sort
of
cereal
taste
and
texture
to
it
im
also
noticing
a
little
bit
of
a
floral
background
it
finishes
bitterly
without
much
taste
this
is
not
a
great
beer
basically
a
glorified
budweiser
very
light
golden
color
here
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
there
is
almost
no
nose
here
with
a
barely
detectable
malt
and
hop
scent
that
would
be
good
if
it
had
more
presence
however
this
is
a
surprisingly
well
balanced
flavor
of
beer
here
the
hops
and
malt
are
very
good
with
a
minimal
amount
of
room
for
improvement
there
is
also
little
to
no
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
will
do
not
a
bad
effort
the
luxurious
single
wort
or
first
press
process
yields
a
unique
complex
flavor
with
this
gold
label
and
special
premium
reserve
appellation
ichiban
outclasses
and
outperforms
other
japanese
beers

this

is
japanese
for
dont
ing
bother
with
this
beer
this
was
my
first
asian
beer
and
i
was
not
impressed
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
last
smelled
like
wet
dirty
corn
the
flavor
what
little
there
is
was
metallic
i
might
have
tasted
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
end
but
i
was
probably
digging
overall
dont
bother
blah
no
flavor
golden
color
light
in
everyway
thin
taste
thin
body
thin
aroma
what
little
aroma
it
has
it
just
smells
like
beer
i
guess
saying
that
this
has
a
malt
dominated
nose
is
a
more
flattering
way
to
say
that
but
with
something
as
devoid
of
character
as
this
i
would
never
think
to
flatter
this
beer
as
the
previous
advocate
so
correctly
described
this
beer
as
one
dimensional
i
would
also
say
this
beer
is
exceedingly
boring
which
is
how
most
japanese
brews
are
there
is
however
a
pleasant
bitterness
to
this
beer
which
is
why
i
am
giving
this
beer
such
a
high
rating
depsite
its
defects
the
beer
has
the
typical
lagerpils
color
a
cloudless
golden
straw
with
a
pertinent
white
head
and
adequate
lace
malt
dominates
the
nose
the
start
lightly
sweet
the
top
skinny
in
feel
with
a
bitingly
acidic
finish
the
hops
detectable
dry
aftertaste
is
it
me
or
all
these
beers
one
dimensional
this
beer
is
not
awful
so
do
yourself
a
favor
smell
it
first

the
foil
labels
but
still
good
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
i
like
this
one
more
than
i
like
most
american
lagers
a
very
nice
refreshing
macro
lager
would
drink
again
maybe
its
not
the
most
common
choice
for
that
but
its
absolutely
my
favourite
as
its
good
enough
for
me
to
feel
that
i
am
not
wasting
or
drinking
garbage
and
its
price
is
still
good
enough
for
a
beer
to
buy
often
overall

i
was
really
impressed
here
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
i
like
it
a
lot
and
cant
wait
to
try
their
light
offering
much
better
than
youd
expect
almost
germanesque
i
took
a
trip
to
las
vegas
recently
and
one
of
the
casinos
on
the
strip
casino
royal
had
these
for
1
00
havent
had
a
michelob
for
years
and
to
my
surprise
it
had
a
nice
smooth
malty
taste
much
fuller
than
i
expected
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
i
was
in
complete
disbelief
that
a
domestic
beer
could
taste
this
good
i
generally
have
to
pay
9
9910
99
a
six
pack
for
the
really
tasty
stuff
but
this
is
a
nice
brew
to
pack
your
fridge
with
if
you
like
to
pound
down
a
six
pack
or
two
during
a
football
game
with
the
boys
give
it
a
try
one
of
the
worst
beers
on
earth
overall
the
taste
on
this
one
really
surprised
me
as
it
was
much
more
robust
and
flavorful
then
i
was
expecting
a
nice
unexpected
find
the
mouthfeel
and
smell
took
away
from
the
brew
overall
however
making
it
an
only
ok
brew
overall
its
the
full
body
american
pale
ale
that
set
the
bar
and
standard
for
all
american
domestic
beers
it
provides
a
beer
that
from
the
gold
clear
look
to
the
beautiful
aroma
and
refreshing
taste
makes
michelob
the
lager
to
emulate
overall
a
delicious
beer
by
far
the
best
ab
product
i
have
tried
p
s
you
sam
adams
guys
will
love
this
one
overall
better
than
most
cheap
pale
lagers
overall
three
things
strike
me
1
it
is
pretty
decent
for
what
it
is
7
506pack
2
it
is
not
going
to
win
any
awards
and
3
it
tastes
exactly
as
i
remember
it
as
a
youngster
taking
a
sip
of
dads
beer
snobs
everywhere
can
flame
on
but
i
like
this
casual
and
unpretentious
beer
it
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
michelob
is
one
of
the
best
anheuser
busch
beers
this
brew
pours
out
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
and
malts
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
and
malts
michelob
is
brewed
with
finest
grains
and
malts
this
brew
is
full
of
flavor
there
is
nothing
over
powering
in
this
brew
michelob
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
it
dose
not
get
any
better
than
original
michelob
i
would
take
this
over
any
other
beer
out
there
on
the
market
michelob
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
solid
5
out
of
5
othis
was
okay
its
still
a
poor
beer
but
its
a
good
poor
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
very
well
and
will
continue
to
buy
it
when
i
think
of
michelob
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
their
commercial
from
the
80s
featuring
genesiss
in
the
air
tonight
while
this
beers
heyday
has
certainly
come
and
gone
it
would
likely
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
or
night
one
can
hope
that
appearances
may
bode
well
for
a
beer
but
michelob
just
doesnt
deliver
its
rough
around
the
edges
for
a
lager
with
too
much
carbonation
in
the
feel
and
a
metallic
twang
and
bite
that
really
detracts
from
what
malts
are
used
in
the
grain
bill
complexity
and
depth
forget
about
it
well
had
to
revisit
this
one
since
i
havent
had
one
probably
in
several
decades
cant
say
ive
missed
much
of
anything
over
the
years
descent
but
missing
a
solid
scent
and
taste
profile
barley
malts
up
front
slightly
sweet
and
toasted
there
some
hint
of
hay
hop
bitterness
is
mild
towards
the
finish
spicycitrus
body
is
lightmedium
crisp
slight
dry
aftertaste
carbonation
is
soft
overall
a
good
beer
to
wash
down
barbecue
with
but
thats
about
it
not
something
i
would
really
seek
out
not
an
awful
beer
as
far
as
macros
goes
this
is
better
than
most
it
is
grainy
and
sweet
but
it
does
have
a
bit
of
hop
character
in
the
finish
overall
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
macros
o
i
could
think
of
a
number
of
worse
beers
to
have
say
any
bmc
light
lager
or
many
adjuncts
but
this
5
abv
allmalt
american
lager
is
just
a
pale
beer
to
kick
some
heat
or
wolf
a
bowling
alley
cheese
pizza
none
of
it
appeals
to
me
but
its
just
about
average
for
what
it
is
o
this
is
pretty
much
a
heavier
michelob
ultra
with
a
little
more
flavor
nothing
really
worthwile
unfortunately
still
its
not
outright
bad
and
is
probably
a
good
starter
brew
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
pale
golden
with
a
tall
frothy
white
head
plenty
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
lacing
is
not
left
on
the
glass
as
the
head
dissipates
only
a
small
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
surface
fo
the
beer
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
there
are
aromas
of
hops
and
pale
malts
it
smells
bready
sweet
and
clean
the
taste
follows
the
nose
theres
a
malty
sweetness
as
well
as
some
hops
on
the
back
end
its
clean
tasting
and
bready
the
body
is
light
with
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
an
excellent
lager
give
ab
credit
where
credit
is
due
for
making
this
one
well
they
didnt
and
after
all
these
years
and
all
the
different
and
expensive
beers
ive
consumed
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
is
still
a
halfway
decent
beer
and
one
of
my
on
occasion
favorites
its
laid
back
flavor
is
indeed
unique
which
is
something
many
beers
cannot
lay
claim
to
that
says
something
in
my
book
this
is
a
standard
macro
a
million
cheaper
beers
are
just
as
good
also
theres
a
saltiness
about
it
that
bothers
me
o
there
is
nothing
complex
about
this
beer
but
just
a
standard
decent
beer
that
can
pretty
much
go
with
anything
over
all
i
am
satisfied
and
will
try
again
in
near
future
a
note
it
was
very
cold
as
it
was
on
the
ice
and
i
believe
that
is
the
best
way
to
drink
this
style
avoid
this
beer
until
the
brewers
pull
their
collective
heads
out
of
their
rears
i
think
it
is
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
great
with
just
lounging
around
and
actually
wanting
more
than
just
one
with
this
brew
you
can
anyway
i
like
to
call
it
a
glorified
budweiser
because
same
taste
with
a
vamp
the
appearance
is
typical
of
this
type
of
lager
smell
was
nice
lot
sharper
than
expected
taste
blew
me
away
because
i
like
budweiser
as
a
daily
but
this
thing
is
bud
with
more
flavor
surely
note
a
hint
of
hops
that
is
not
there
with
my
budweiser
turn
one
up
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
overall
drinkability
comparable
to
budweiser
perhaps
not
as
complex
and
flavorful
which
in
this
style
isnt
saying
much
easy
drink
decent
in
style
pours
golden
yellow
not
much
head
despite
fizzy
bodytastes
malty
slightly
sweet
a
barest
touch
of
hops
perhaps
but
no
corn
or
rice
flavours
it
does
not
seem
to
be
as
i
remember
it
30
years
ago
it
may
have
been
more
bitter
then
overall
nice
for
a
mass
market
macro
overall
3
0
in
spite
of
my
negative
feelings
about
the
carbonation
this
beer
tastes
good
an
average
lager
and
one
that
you
could
depend
on
i
dont
understand
why
they
are
going
for
over
6
for
a
6
pack
in
georgia
but
there
you
go
i
have
been
pleasantly
surprised
with
some
of
michelobs
recent
offerings
a
higher
gravity
brew
and
the
addition
of
a
few
more
hops
might
make
this
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
not
much
aroma
or
flavor
typical
of
americanstyle
pale
lagers
tastes
and
smells
grainy
with
faint
metallic
hop
tinge
heavier
than
other
pale
lagers
smooth
and
drinkable
but
nothing
special
preferred
over
bud
and
others
but
its
usually
more
expensive
and
not
worth
the
extra
money
d
overall
it
was
very
light
flavored
very
light
bodied
a
mediocre
lager
at
best
but
not
bad
for
being
mass
produced
the
beer
that
started
it
all
for
me
smooth
to
drink
good
enough
balance
of
taste
so
long
as
it
is
cold
does
not
warm
quickly
and
is
easy
to
forget
how
many
of
these
you
have
had
easy
drink
to
have
regularly
nothing
special
but
then
again
you
never
forget
your
first
the
body
was
ok
a
touch
fuller
than
i
expected
and
was
smooth
and
even
drinkability
was
surprisingly
good
it
went
down
smoothly
and
easily
and
except
for
the
sweetness
was
pleasant
and
repeatable
overall
this
beer
was
better
than
i
was
expected
a
local
restaurant
sells
these
for
2
during
happy
hour
i
think
ill
keep
that
in
mind
during
budget
crunch
days
d
a
bit
of
flavor
to
it
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
standard
representation
of
style
its
got
a
little
more
substance
than
your
typical
ab
product
but
its
still
another
fizzy
yellow
beer
overall
for
all
of
the
bmcbashing
that
goes
on
you
have
to
figure
ab
does
something
right
in
this
beer
id
say
they
are
doing
something
headed
in
the
right
direction
and
something
that
at
the
least
can
start
to
compete
with
the
craft
beer
world
in
terms
of
flavor
better
than
bud
i
suppose
and
that
aint
saying
much
pours
a
pale
straw
color
very
carbonated
with
a
thin
head
of
quickly
dissipating
bubbles
light
aroma
of
pale
malts
skunk
and
old
corn
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
skunky
with
rotten
hay
and
stale
grains
leaving
an
acrid
aftertaste
to
be
avoided
i
must
admit
while
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
any
time
soon
its
really
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
i
certainly
wouldnt
call
this
a
distinctive
highquality
beer
for
connoisseurs
but
in
a
tight
pinch
like
the
one
i
was
in
when
i
bought
it
very
light
bodied
but
with
lots
of
mouth
filling
carbonation
makes
it
feel
a
bit
fuller
than
it
probably
is
this
is
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
its
been
many
a
year
since
i
had
one
it
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would

a
step
above
your
usual
macro
offering
but
theres
a
nice
balance
of
very
light
caramel
malts
with
small
amount
of
hops
that
make
this
a
decent
beer
maybe
abs
best
massbrewed
beer
theres
no
stinging
mouthfeel
like
a
lot
of
macros
pizza

they

its
a

brand
im
glad
ab
is
trying
to
do
something
with
it
no
lasting
imprint
upon
the
palate
nor
the
mind
to
be
kind
this
is
better
than
bud
light
though
it
is
roughly
on
par
with
bud
but
this
isnt
an
impressive
beer
outside
of
that
rough

which
is
why
i
most
likely
still
favor
this
over
any

ab
product
taipansmay
01
otherwise
not
much
else
taste
was
equally
unexciting
slight
malt
character
in
the
flavor
and
lots
of
sweet
lemony
notes
and
also
that
cooked
vege
taste
that
reminds
me
of
every
other
american
style
macro
lager
also
but
tastes
good
pours
out
a
pale
gold
to
almost
straw
body
with
a
thin
head
that
soon
becomes
a
ring
of
bubbles
bubbles
are
scant
in
the
body
smells
an
awful
lot
like
an
adjunct
lager
with
all
the
harsh
grain
in
the
nose
sweet
nose
faint
malts
taste
is
a
mix
of
malt
and
grain
with
grain
showing
more
muscle
there
is
a
faint
bitterness
in
the
finish
finally
i
get
some
halfdecent
bready
malt
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
kind
of
sticky
and
oily
in
a
way
pricks
the
tongue
too
much
considering
the
lack
of
bubbles
in
the
appearance
im
just
not
impressed
with
this
and
reminds
me
of
a
poor
mexican
lager
ill
take
a
bohemia
over
this
anyday
like
abs
other
attempts
at
classiness
this
one
is
rather
halfassed
taste
is
very
clean
short
lived
on
the
palate
slightly
sweet
maltiness
is
balanced
by
a
light
hoppiness
that
comes
out
in
the
finish
tingly
carbonation
seems
appropriate
for
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
between
thin
and
medium
actually
not
a
bad
brew
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
accompaniment
to
pizza
or
some
good
bbq
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
light
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
carbonation
remains
throughout
i
can
best
describe
the
smell
as
flat
taste
is
no
surprise
compared
to
any
other
american
macro
lager
light
to
medium
bodied
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
away
but
i
wouldnt
crave
it
either
good
summer
brew
when
your
mind
is
on
something
else
drinkability
more
drinkable
than
the
old
version
but
still
not
exciting
it
could
be
easily
drank
to
quench
your
thirst
in
the
summer
and
its
not
too
offensive
to
refuse
either
way
for
an
all
malt
lager
go
for
the
brooklyn
unless
you
are
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
go
for
some
palmetto
example
i
could
bring
a
case
of
this
over
to
my
broinlaws
house
knock
it
off
with
him
during
a
yankee
game
and
feel
no
pain
in
the
morning
clear
pale
apple
cider
tone
thin
off
white
head
that
has
no
retention
and
little
lacing
ability
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
and
just
a
little
adjuncty
taste
is
very
plain
nothing
bad
but
not
a
lot
good
about
it
either
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
or
after
a
salty
dinner
but
really
not
much
other
use
for
this
beer
what
flavor
that
is
there
is
clean
slight
impressions
of
malt
and
sweetness
spritzy
carbonation
weak
body
actually
a
decent
macro
but
nothing
id
turn
to
very
often
i
didnt
pay
for
it
and
i
never
will
but
certainly
not
the
worst
of
the
american
macros
remember
when
genesis
were
sponsored
by
michelob
on
the
invisible
touch
tour
crappy
beer
crappy
album
makes
sense
clear
golden
in
color
with
bubbly
champagnelike
carbonation
thin
head
that
forms
minor
traces
of
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
thats
about
it
a
crisp
delivery
of
grainy
malts
with
the
almost
atypical
ab
adjunct
paste
the
mouthfeel
and
palate
and
left
clean
and
somewhat
creamy
which
is
a
plus
finishes
just
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
certainly
not
one
of
the
best
lagers
yet
not
the
worst
lets
not
get
carried
away
though
ok
drinkability
not
the
worst
lager
ive
drunken
from
a
macro
brewer
but
save
your
money
on
spend
it
on
something
better
mouthfeel
is
as
bad
as
any
beer
ive
ever
had
way
overcarbonated
and
watery
just
gross
drinkability
well
id
rather
have
this
than
a
budweiser
but
thats
not
saying
a
lot
if
its
between
this
and
water
ill
probably
go
with
water
cheers
michelob
came
served
in
a
pilsner
it
was
a
typical
pale
yellow
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
well
it
didnt
smell
like
much
adjunct
predominates
taste
well
there
werent
any
off
flavors
as
such
just
nothing
special
decent
for
lawnmower
beer
not
really
much
to
this
beer
a
step
above
the
bmc
macro
big
ticket
beers
but
not
much
this
is
really
not
a
bad
beer
just
does
not
have
any
of
the
characteristics
that
i
have
found
make
a
good
or
great
beer
it
will
do
for
a
beer
in
a
restaurant
before
dinner
when
nothing
better
is
available
which
is
how
i
had
it
but
not
worth
buying
when
there
are
better
chioices
this
is
so
thin
that
i
would
have
thought
it
to
be
a
macro
light
if
i
didnt
know
better
its
not
completely
undrinkable
but
is
ridiculously
thin
and
almost
tasteless
definitely
drink
this
cold
as
it
tastes
better
that
way
i
i
was
at
a
wedding
recently
and
they
had
bud
coors
light
and
thisso
i
decided
to
go
with
this
slightly
better
than
bud
the
smell
was
slightly
fruity
and
the
taste
was
dry
good
amount
of
carbonation
ok
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
was
fairgood
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
at
a
wedding
when
the
other
choices
are
bud
and
coors
light
i
would
only
reccomend
this
to
someone
who
this
beer
is
beer
like
a
bud
light
fan
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
reccomend
this
to
any
real
beer
drinkers
eric
fairly
boring
macro
beer
not
offensive
but
nothing
unique
either
a
let
down
for
all
the
hype
about
it
being
a
super
premium
macro
that
is
long
gone
i
tend
to
rate
all
styles
together
so
thus
the
low
score
another
of
those
i
thought
id
already
rated
it
beers
any
review
of
a
american
macro
lager
must
be
done
in
context
of
the
field
against
which
the
beer
competes
i
wont
hold
mich
out
as
an
example
of
a
fine
lager
but
as
macro
lagers
go
it
has
more
body
and
depth
than
most
a
bit
more
emphasis
on
malt
than
most
of
abs
lagers
with
a
disconcerting
but
not
overwhelming
husky
nature
hopping
is
nondescript
but
noticeably
present
and
sufficient
presents
itself
as
a
premium
product
and
manages
to
be
adequate
which
perhaps
is
all
a
macro
lager
can
hope
for
poured
this
brew
into
a
goblet
and
the
head
was
firm
but
dissapated
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
yellow
golden
color
with
a
fisome
rising
carbonation
smell
is
like
a
honeydew
but
faint
taste
is
bittersweet
with
a
more
sweet
aftertaste
but
the
finish
is
fruity
and
passes
very
quickly
rather
bland
and
uneventful
i
can
drink
it
if
its
the
best
there
is
to
offer
however
if
weekends
were
made
for
michelob
ill
be
quaffing
my
brews
on
weekdays
decent
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
since
i
was
2
so
the
smell
is
deeply
ingrained
in
my
mind
it
pours
with
an
okay
head
but
this
stuff
is
completely
clear
and
shiny
i
would
prefer
the
chill
hase
be
left
in
myself
without
it
the
beer
looks
very
strange
dark
yellow
smells
like
your
typical
ab
lager
full
of
grain
of
some
kind
probably
rice
and
corn
god
ive
never
seen
a
more
translucent
beer
than
this
strange
mouthfeel
once
it
gets
beyond
the
front
of
my
mouth
it
doesnt
even
have
a
mouthfeel
no
real
aftertaste
to
speak
of
its
a
little
strange
to
spend
so
much
time
on
a
macro
american
lager
but
for
some
reason
the
image
of
bud
with
better
ingredients
seemed
interesting
plus
it
was
free
michelob
as
with
budweis
ab
steals
the
name
of
another
czech
town
this
stuff
is
so
boring
and
mediocre
i
had
a
hard
time
even
finishing
the
bottle
i
think
budweiser
might
even
be
better
the
paper
wrapper
about
the
throat
of
the
bottle
makes
one
feel
this
is
an
above
average
beer
its
not
this
is
reasonably
drinkable
if
not
reviewing
id
probably
have
just
consumed
it
straight
from
the
bottle
better
than
many
macros
but
nothing
a
beer
geek
should
actively
seek
out
d
not
a
horrible
premium
american
lager
it
missed
its
mark
totally
for
any
kind
of
substantial
flavor
but
that
is
what
a
macrolager
is
right
it
does
not
live
up
to
its
manly
advertisements
in
playboy
back
in
the
1970s
you
cant
mess
w
michelob
its
my
dads
drink
for
gods
sake
if
you
havent
had
one
get
one
immediately
it
is
what
it
is
but
please
try
it
gotta
love
the
michelob
no
need
for
a
real
review
it
has
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
and
can
have
a
little
bit
of
an
aftertaste
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
better
than
budweiser
for
gods
sake
pours
a
dull
but
crystal
clear
golden
amber
with
a
poorly
retained
white
head
tha
leaves
no
lace
whatsoever
mostly
a
moderate
grain
aroma
in
the
nose
with
very
subtle
hints
of
honey
and
alcohol
the
taste
includes
dissapointingly
mild
traces
of
caramel
grain
very
slight
alcohol
and
a
barely
detectable
hop
flavor
a
nearly
nonexistent
finish
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
very
little
carbonation
not
recommended
better
than
most
massproduced
american
lagers
in
that
there
are
no
offflavors
theres
not
much
good
either
well
by
the
time
i
drank
that
beer
i
was
too
far
from
the
beer
fan
i
am
now
it
was
very
nice
in
th
emiddle
of
being
a
dark
lager
but
it
was
not
annoying
after
all
that
is
what
counts
from
a
macro
lager
for
me
not
refreshing
at
all
but
you
can
have
a
good
time
with
it
no
aditives
being
bad
in
it
the
best
of
michelob
family
i
try
this
beer
in
its

aluminum

over
its

awful

is

to
drink
spring
water
drinkability
in
the
world
of
lagers
this
beer
is
quite
weak
but
compared
to
other
american
macros
this
isnt
too
shabby
and
probably
one
of
the
best
ab
brews
so
it
has
to
get
some
points
for
that
does
allmalt
beers
deserve
better
praise
that
their
adjunct
ladden
counterparts
anheuser
busch
thinks
so
with
their
michelob
brand
the
beer
begins
with
a
malt
profile
that
hits
on
light
bread
toast
caramel
character
and
does
a
better
job
of
balancing
out
the
sulfer
compounds
and
tart
astringencies
that
hinder
the
busch
and
bud
brands
however
the
weak
malts
come
across
a
bit
raw
with
a
touch
of
cola
and
bread
dough
character
hops
may
balance
the
sweetness
but
dont
offer
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
flavor
or
aroma
though
all
malt
an
over
spargedtype
astringency
comes
through
as
the
sweetness
fades
in
the
finish
perhaps
a
better
beer
than
the
more
pale
light
lagers
but
only
marginally
pours
golden
clear
with
a
thick
white
head
that
quickly
vanishes
before
your
eyes
rather
bland
nose
quite
unremarkable
very
unremarkable
appearance
it
looks
flat
very
slightly
bitter
with
the
faintest
hint
of
hops
and
malt
drinkability
is
average
typical
lawn
mowing
beer
overall
quite
unimpressive
though
unfortunately
i
have
had
much
worse
bud
light
in
the
can
springs
to
mind
so
essentially
its
got
no
head
no
nose
looks
flat
tastes
flat
and
basically
has
all
the
worst
qualities
of
a
macro
lager
i
would
avoid
this
beer
michelob
strikes
me
as
lousy
beer
even
for
a
macro
lager
i
remember
drinking
this
stuff
in
my
late
teens
okay
midteens
when
i
thought
it
was
a
special
treat
a
step
or
two
above
the
usual
well
it
isnt
in
fact
i
cant
even
pick
it
over
a
lesser
known
macro
with
a
big
red
bulldog
on
the
can
im
beginning
to
realize
that
i
prefer
miller
products
over
ab
products
however
its
only
in
a
lesser
of
two
evils
kind
of
way
drinkability
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
high
end
ab
product
vastly
overpriced
imo
ill
stick
to
bud
poured
a
medium
yellow
color
with
large
white
head
smell
is
slightly
of
hops
with
a
background
sweetness
taste
is
light
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
but
little
if
any
hops
detected
refeshing
in
the
mouth
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
if
you
want
an
american
macro
lager
go
cheap
this
costs
too
much
pours
golden
with
a
quickly
fading
head
has
a
slightly
malt
smell
and
thats
about
all
you
can
taste
as
well
but
not
overpowering
good
carbonation
and
lacing
so
its
fairly
drinkable
but
nothing
that
sets
it
apart
from
any
other
american
macro
poured
a
2
finger
white
head
over
a
very
pale
tan
crystal
clear
liquid
smells
faintly
of
munich
malt
but
mostly
of
metalic
floral
saaz
hops
tastes
creamy
sweet
with
some
mild
metalic
hop
bitter
pretty
mild
in
flavor
the
malt
sweet
is
crisp
and
clean
like
a
lager
a
hint
of
munich
malt
quality
im
actually
surprised
at
the
amount
of
floral
hop
in
the
late
swallow
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
macro
beer
light
body
and
light
carbonation
carbonation
is
good
for
the
style
as
it
does
not
add
any
acrid
foul
to
the
beer
that
needs
to
be
smooth
if
you
run
low
on
money
and
this
is
the
choice
between
bmc
go
with
this
but
not
if
you
can
help
it
this
may
very
well
be
the
best
brew
that
ab
makes
pours
out
to
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
few
moments
before
bubbling
away
medium
carbonation
and
scents
of
hops
and
barely
are
noted
flavor
is
of
your
typcial
lager
but
a
bit
strong
on
the
flavor
of
corn
finished
a
bit
watery
but
had
a
decent
aftertaste
of
malt
worth
a
try
but
there
are
far
better
lagers
out
there
at
a
fraction
of
the
price
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
with
a
twist
off
crown
served
in
a
standard
tap
glass
not
particularly
interesting
but
it
will
definitely
do
the
job
on
a
hot
day
with
just
about
any
food
today
im
trying
to
approach
this
brew
from
an
objective
point
of
view
its
absolutely
clear
a
brilliant
yellowgold
color
and
has
a
fizzy
white
head
it
sure
is
one
highly
carbonated
effervescent
beer
the
aroma
is
faintly
hoppy
grassy
and
grainy
theres
a
bit
more
hops
than
most
macro
brews
but
their
not
worth
getting
excited
about
its
crisp
carbonic
and
has
a
distinct
dry
taste
continental
hop
flavor
and
finish
the
brew
is
fairly
watery
but
other
then
that
theres
nothing
offensive
actually
its
an
uninteresting
everyday
brewprobably
a
little
better
than
most
but
id
grab
a
lot
of
other
brews
before
settling
on
this
one
overallwhile
many
macro
lagers
look
fine
and
taste
bad
this
lager
is
the
opposite
it
looks
bad
and
tastes
fairly
good
ill
take
the
latter
anyday
while
it
is
an
ab
product
and
a
macro
michelob
manages
to
have
much
more
flavor
than
most
macros
and
thus
when
at
a
substandard
bar
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
deserves
credit
for
its
flavor
and
while
it
wont
change
the
world
and
is
by
no
means
a
top
notch
beer
or
even
lager
its
passable
thanks
to
whomever
left
this
at
my
st
patricks
day
party
i
think
drinkability
suffers
from
that
grainy
harshness
with
a
touch
of
skunk
or
something
gets
worse
as
it
goes
down
but
it
is
what
it
is
like
a
5
bottle
of
wine
you
get
what
pay
for
and
at
4
99
for
a
6
pack
i
got
what
i
paid
for
good
for
a
macro
but
id
rather
be
drinking
something
else
this
is
a
decent
macro
lager
pours
a
slightly
darker
than
yellow
piss
color
close
to
a
cider
i
guess
decent
head
holds
up
and
some
bubbles
aroma
actually
has
a
hoppiness
to
it
and
a
strong
grainy
flavor
taste
follows
it
is
on
the
bland
side
but
ive
had
much
blander
macro
lagers
theres
no
real
off
flavors
and
the
finish
is
super
clean
theres
a
biting
acidic
kick
right
before
the
finish
and
then
nothing
too
clean
for
my
liking
not
worth
the
price
and
nothing
too
great
about
this
beer
but
its
better
than
most
other
american
macros
weak
very
very
weak
so
overall
i
have
to
give
michelob
a
thumbs
down
its
better
than
no
beer
at
all
but
thats
about
all
i
can
say
for
it
overall
impression
ugh
macrobrew
there
just
isnt
any
going
back
to
drinking
this
stuff
positive
notes
dry
crisp
and
although
i
dont
find
it
so
i
could
see
others
thinking
it
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
im
not
going
to
finish
this
one
however
i
have
to
admit
i
have
a
bit
of
a
bias
toward
michelob
as
it
was
my
beer
of
choice
through
the
last
half
of
the
70s
through
the
80s
and
well
into
the
90s
well
before
i
discovered
better
beer
i
drank
it
then
because
i
thought
it
was
smoother
than
bud
and
tasted
better
than
coors
the
fact
that
it
had
a
slightly
classier
image
than
the
other
mainstream
beers
probably
didnt
hurt
either
michelob
pours
light
gold
and
absolutely
clear
the
white
head
was
small
and
didnt
last
very
long
at
all
aroma
is
very
light
taste
is
lightly
malty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
a
tangy
aftertaste
nothing
offensive
and
no
off
flavors
body
is
watery
and
fizzy
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
and
have
on
many
occasions
tasted
121904
drinkability
wish
i
would
have
brought
my
own
beer
hey
at
leasti
get
to
rate
it
trying
to
figure
out
if
thats
bad
or
good
though
in
this
case
what
do
you
really
say
about
these
macrobrews
i
mean
who
wants
to
come
on
ba
and
check
the
reviews
for
michelob
anyway
beer
comes
out
at
a
light
golden
color
nothing
special
small
head
quickly
goes
away
body
is
fuller
than
bud
but
not
that
good
taste
seem
to
be
a
little
sweeter
to
me
like
corn
syrup
compared
to
other
macros
overall
i
think
ok
for
the
price
drinkable
to
get
drunk
off
of
plus
i
like
it
more
because
it
seems
to
be
less
popular
than
budweiser
coors
or
miller
yeah
its
drinkable
as
most
macros
are
but
there
are
many
macros
that
can
suit
this
purpose
at
a
lower
price
this
beer
pours
golden
and
clear
with
very
little
aroma
at
all
maybe
a
hint
of
its
claim
of
all
imported
hops
the
taste
is
lacking
everything
that
makes
a
beer
good
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
drinking
a
gingerale
you
would
be
better
off
drinking
one
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
bother
drinkability
for
anyone
whose
fallback
brew
is
something
with
a
decent
amount
of
body
and
flavor
which
is
probably
most
bas
this
has
a
drinkability
of
5
you
can
imbibe
this
like
bottled
water
not
something
ill
ever
purchase
again
though
when
im
in
the
mood
for
bland
macro
ill
take
pbr
or
high
life
any
day
of
the
week
thank
you
very
much
drinkability
not
bad
its
nothing
to
rave
about
for
sure
but
if
i
had
a
few
in
the
fridge
i
would
drink
them
good
lawnmower
beer
and
a
tad
better
than
bud
bought
this
on
special
for
2
50
at
the
silver
slipper
saloon
i
can
honestly
say
ive
never
tried
michelob
before
now
even
in
my
college
years
when
the
bartender
handed
me
the
bottle
i
noticed
all
imported
hops
written
across
the
top
hmmm
interesting
i
thought
once
i
sat
down
and
took
my
first
swig
i
was
utterly
unimpressed
if
there
are
indeed
imported
hops
in
this
beer
i
sure
as
hell
cannot
taste
them
maybe
they
are
imported
from
somewhere
where
the
word
hops
references
some
sort
of
shitty
cereal
grain
i
dunno
this
had
a
slightly
better
flavor
than
the
majority
of
the
macro
brews
but
i
would
not
drink
this
by
choice
ever
again
the
blatant
marketing
scam
on
the
bottle
is
ridiculous
and
it
pisses
me
off
steer
clear
unless
you
enjoy
crappy
beer
the
beer
after
its
extraction
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
an
unclouded
gold
with
a
moderate
sized
frothy
white
head
and
the
resultant
lace
a
thin
curtain
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
malt
dominated
slightly
sweet
crisp
and
clean
with
the
start
slightly
sweet
the
malt
profile
fair
and
the
top
light
finish
is
stinging
in
its
acidity
the
hops
standard
for
the
style
a
drinkable
beer
and
i
must
add
of
all
the
macros
this
is
my
favorite
a
beer
that
was
left
over
after
a
party
and
it
reminded
me
why
i
do
not
buy
this
stuff
this
stuff
is
bud
with
a
different
name
same
straw
color
nearly
the
same
grainy
smell
only
this
one
added
a
bit
of
malt
in
there
the
taste
was
full
of
corn
and
was
not
smoothe
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thick
and
cloying
not
recommended
if
the
bars
having
a
special
you
just
cant
pass
on
this
is
drinkable
move
on
to
something
with
substance
otherwise
having
a
born
on
date
is
also
a
plus
because
you
can
shop
for
the
freshest
beer
and
if
the
store
has
not
been
carefull
you
can
tell
if
its
too
old
thid
beer
has
a
fairly
thick
taste
not
what
you
would
expect
from
anheiser
first
tryed
it
with
a
coworker
wasnt
expecting
much
but
suprisingly
it
was
pretty
good
a
thicker
version
of
a
cheap
american
beer
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
beers
out
there
but
also
better
than
a
lot
too
the
taste
was
well
average
light
malt
some
hoppines
but
not
bitter
an
overall
average
beer
i
could
drink
more
of
it
but
only
if
it
were
the
only
thing
available
rather
go
for
a
good
ipa
though
or
even
a
medium
ipa
there
is
the
faintest
hint
of
the
finest
imported
hops
touted
all
over
the
bottle
but
otherwise
this
beer
mainly
delivers
alcohol
in
as
painless
a
fashion
as
it
possibly
can
it
is
described
as
bitter
by
millerlight
aficiandos
but
i
find
that
bitterness
to
be
fairly
elusive
on
the
positive
side
its
refreshing
when
icecold
and
washes
a
burger
down
handily
not
to
bad
from
ab
much
better
than
other
lagers
they
brew
smell
is
grainy
with
subtle
hops
to
speak
of
taste
is
of
rice
and
little
malts
hop
detected
but
very
faint
almost
cheerio
tasting
feels
crisp
but
light
and
is
actually
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
much
better
lagers
out
there
and
at
5
bucks
a
six
pack
id
rather
pick
up
some
birra
moretti
lots
of
fizz
pleasant
and
crisp
per
the
style
an
easy
beer
to
drink
given
the
style
its
a
pretty
plain
beer
but
no
major
faults
another
macro
guff
brew

michelob

czech
for
lawnmower

note
just
no
reason
to
buy
it
spend
an
extra
couple
bucks
on
a
nice
brew
poured
a
light
yellow
colour
with
a
modest
white
head
the
smell
is
light
with
a
slight
malt
and
hop
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
more
of
adjuncts
than
anything
a
lot
of
corn
there
was
a
fair
ballance
of
hops
and
malts
but
ot
wasnt
a
bad
beer
i
would
drink
it
if
placed
in
front
of
me
drinkable
by
being
mostly
nonoffensive
the
sweetest
beer
this
manufacturer
makes
light
feel
clean
and
crisp
not
good
way
too
light
but
not
a
horrible
macro
smell
was
lots
of
corn
and
some
malt
flavor
was
bready
with
some
more
of
that
corn
all
that
corn
isnt
so
bad
its
actually
ok
tasting
with
the
slight
malt
and
bready
flavors
that
are
also
in
the
beer
the
big
prob
is
that
it
keeps
reminding
you
that
youre
drinking
cheap
ass
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
the
common
macro
drinker
brings
to
a
party
in
order
to
be
different
they
dont
bring
bud
or
coors
light
etc
and
every
time
you
take
a
sip
of
it
you
ask
yourself
whos
the
idiot
that
tried
to
be
cool
by
bringing
this
crap
drunk
straight
from
the
bottle
a
golden
coloured
brew
aromas
are
of
sweet
malts
and
decent
german
hops
the
taste
is
quite
well
balanced
and
light
this
tastes
like
beer
but
it
is
much
better
than
a
bud
the
mouthfeel
is
mor
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
not
bad
for
an
ab
brew
this
beer
poured
a
clear
fizzy
yellow
with
a
thin
white
foam
head
that
settled
the
smell
was
minimal
with
hints
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
on
the
sweet
side
but
very
thin
some
malt
flavors
but
low
on
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
and
thin
with
medium
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
overall
not
really
offensive
but
not
big
on
flavor
or
body
stopped
for
a
slice
and
this
was
the
best
beer
choice
available
the
waitress
actually
brought
me
a
plastic
cup
i
asked
for
a
glass
and
she
told
me
they
dont
have
any
i
drank
it
from
the
bottle
years
ago
when
i
only
drank
macros
this
was
my
favorite
it
is
still
better
than
most
of
them
with
some
taste
and
mouthfeel
albeit
not
much
i
would
only
drink
this
under
circumstances
like
tonight
but
it
is
better
than
bud
corona
and
many
other
swill
lagers
not
worthy
of
beer
drinkers
attention
might
be
good
for
a
kids
drinking
game
the
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
weak
with
that
tradtional
clean
pale
malt
lager
scent
the
taste
is
good
it
is
a
clean
tasting
macro
with
decent
flavor
it
isnt
complex
but
the
masses
will
enjoy
it
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
like
most
macros
it
is
low
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
if
this
is
cold
enough
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
rather
enjoyable
for
those
large
party
crowds
can
you
tell
that
i
have
a
michelob
sampler
pack
in
my
fridge
right
now
average
that
is
it
better
than
extremely
cheap
beers
worse
than
expensive
ones
a
nonoffensive
beer
that
doesnt
take
any
chances
this
is
supposed
to
be
abs
premium
line
of
beers
i
wonder
where
all
that
money
went
if
you
dont
want
anything
interesting
to
drink
grab
a
michelob
surprisingly
enough
i
have
actually
found
an
anheuiser
busch
product
i
actually
like
other
then
michelob
ultra
this
beer
was
much
better
then
i
had
expected
it
really
did
not
have
that
much
of
a
bite
and
it
went
down
very
smoothly
as
well
i
drank
this
right
before
i
had
my
first
ever
sam
adams
and
i
have
to
admit
i
like
michelob
a
heckuva
lot
better
then
i
like
sammy
poured
in
the
typical
fizzy
yellow
beer
profile
head
was
nonexistent
within
15
seconds
i
counted
light
smell
of
malt
and
hops
can
be
barely
discerned
above
the
smell
of
air
surrounding
the
top
of
the
beer
good
hop
character
for
a
fyb
but
nothing
at
all
amazing
mouthfeel
is
thin
par
for
the
course
not
a
bad
rendition
but
no
reason
to
rush
out
and
try
it
i
bought
the
sampler
case
because
it
had
two
free
glasses
in
it
im
a
sucker
for
free
glasses
even
if
it
means
drinking
my
way
through
18
mediocre
brews
its
got
a
nuttier
fuller
flavor
than
most
of
the
cheap
american
macrobrews
i
still
have
trouble
drinking
the
stuff
if
im
going
for
a
cheap
beer
ill
usually
just
grab
something
that
has
no
flavor
instead
of
one
thats
a
little
more
expensive
with
mediocre
flavor
the
first
thing
that
i
noted
was
the
can
said
that
it
contained
all
imported
hops
i
thought
that
ab
grew
most
of
their
own
hops
in
washington
at
elk
mountain
remember
the
shortlived
brews
by
that
name
anyway
it
could
have
used
some
of
those
hops
not
very
aromatic
the
color
is
a
shade
darker
than
the
typical
macro
yellow
almost
golden
big
white
head
the
taste
is
a
malty
sweet
with
a
lighter
body
it
has
the
signature
michelob
sweet
aftertaste
that
is
typical
in
all
of
its
beers
at
least
it
was
cold
i
was
not
expecting
much
out
of
this
beer
but
it
did
show
me
that
its
taste
wasnt
half
bad
and
that
it
was
drinkable
it
didnt
look
or
smell
any
different
than
the
other
macros
but
it
did
taste
ok
this
is
probably
because
it
wasnt
the
light
version
not
a
great
brew
or
even
one
i
would
rely
on
just
a
decent
macro
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
and
good
carbonation
bubbles
present
the
head
that
was
produced
was
fluffy
and
white
in
color
some
last
a
few
seconds
then
fell
to
nothing
there
was
no
lace
present
the
aroma
was
veryvery
light
i
did
manage
to
get
some
sweet
malt
and
grains
from
it
but
that
was
it
the
flavors
were
also
fairly
weak
in
nature
i
tasted
some
light
malt
and
grains
that
was
it
no
hops
detected
even
though
it
states
that
they
were
imported
no
aftertaste
this
beer
is
crisp
and
light
it
managed
to
quench
my
thirst
and
that
was
all
i
was
looking
for
at
the
moment
over
all
impression
ok
i
guess
a
little
pricey
for
a
macro
six
pack
but
when
you
have
limited
choices
this
is
the
one
to
chose
average
pours
a
clean
golden
tone
with
a
nice
medium
white
head
some
carbonation
and
little
to
no
lacing
weak
wheatymalty
smell
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
hops
a
decent
taste
with
full
bodied
robust
maltyness
with
some
carbonation
enhancing
it
while
the
end
is
complimented
with
a
nice
and
easy
going
bitterness
it
preaches
all
imported
hops
this
all
provides
for
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
the
easy
it
is
to
drink
gives
room
for
a
second
that
makes
it
a
nice
lager


sorry
to
diss
this
one
i
was
wellintentioned
at
the
onset
after
looking
and
sniffing
but
i
hate
being
lied
to
i
tossed
this
in
the
freezer
for
half
an
hour
before
tasting
too
how
disappointing
to
be
honest
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
pours
out
to
the
standard
golden
color
of
its
style
slightly
sweet
with
a
nonoffensive
even
lightly
hopped
taste
acceptable
but
not
remarkable
better
than
most
of
the
ab
offerings
id
take
it
over
a
heineken
a
friend
of
mine
gave
me
a
bottle
of
this
to
try
wouldnt
buy
it
on
my
own
she
seems
to
like
it
a
fair
bit
but
also
drinks
it
from
the
bottles
i
however
can
smell
a
rat
the
moment
i
pop
off
the
bottle
cap
pale
clear
straw
colour
leaning
more
towards
the
anemic
end
of
the
spectrum
small
ring
after
head
quickly
fades
aroma
is
a
bit
caustic
grainy
but
not
much
else
flavour
rips
a
grainy
strip
across
the
tongue
leaving
an
unwelcome
aftertaste
in
its
wake
corn
adjuncts
abound
pehaps
i
should
have
stuck
it
in
the
freezer
for
half
an
hour
and
drank
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
nope
i
wouldnt
even
accept
this
for
free
next
time
yellow
fizzy
in
appearance
white
thin
head
quickly
dissipates
into
nothing
not
much
of
anything
going
on
here
just
american
beer
with
as
the
label
reads
all
imported
hops
aromatics
well
has
some
detectable
hops
going
on
here
just
a
touch
with
the
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
also
coming
through
with
sweetness
overall
unoffensive
to
passive
for
me
flavor
consists
of
a
sharp
sweet
adjunct
ridden
tone
with
the
hop
bitterness
coming
in
to
create
a
mediocre
american
light
lager
that
should
be
the
flagship
beer
of
anheuser
busch
when
compared
to
budweiser
not
bad
for
ab
but
lets
just
say
in
the
realm
of
lagers
this
is
on
the
bottom
of
the
pile
but
its
available
everywhere
and
more
drinkable
then
most
macro
products
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
bodied
no
texture
extreme
carbonation
like
a
soda
drinkability
give
me
something
worth
my
time
glad
i
didnt
purchase
this
one
in
conclusion
a
decent
ab
beer
that
im
not
ashamed
to
buy
and
it
probably
goes
well
with
a
burger
or
steak
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
but
if
you
see
it
and
thats
your
only
beer
choice
it
wont
be
the
worst
beer
ever
i
would
think
it
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
or
a
beer
to
have
when
among
non
baers
it
would
give
them
a
familiar
name
and
a
slightly
more
interesting
beer
basically
inofensive
no
offtastes
that
i
could
pick
up
on
pat
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
bland
and
uninspired
taste
consisted
mainly
of
watered
down
malt
and
some
mild
hop
bitterness
with
all
the
hoopla
on
the
label
about
the
imported
hops
its
a
mess
the
flavors
on
the
palate
are
light
where
have
ye
gone
michelob
out
of
a
normal
bottle
just
makes
the
nastiness
even
more
apparent
pours
the
standard
ab
piss
yellow
with
a
lovely
watery
taste
that
hints
of
rice
and
corn
perhaps
nothing
unexpected
here
overall
swallow
there
are
worse
but
weak
aftertaste
is
grainy
and
dry

it

quite

overall
this
is
quite
the
nice
treat
it
is
a
crisp
refreshing
simple
american
pilsner
that
is
flavorful
fairly
aromatic
and
quite
pleasant
on
the
tongue
it
is
very
well
executed
and
a
fine
example
of
a
classic
and
rather
hard
to
find
american
style
highly
recommended
nice
not
great
though
bottom
line
a
hoppier
pilsner
that
is
both
sessionable
and
enjoyably
complex
bold
tastes
much
more
here
than
your
avergae
pils
good
stuff
it
has
a
sharp
bite
to
it
it
does
have
a
floral
character
in
the
finish
that
gives
it
a
bitter
dryness
its
a
different
pilspale
lager
a
raw
pilspale
lager
more
hops
doesnt
necessarily
make
a
better
beer
even
still
it
was
interesting
a
fine
choice
for
a
hoppier
lager
perfectly
executed
balanced
and
utterly
pleasant
pilsner
though
i
was
expecting
some
extreme
hopping
a
pils
to
have
it
always
in
the
fridge
when
you
are
craving
the
style
i
would
not
trade
this
one
by
relatively
boring
traditional
pils
mouth
light
bodied
and
heavily
carbonated
refreshing
and
effervescent
i
think
this
can
may
have
been
slightly
overcarbed
as
it
foamed
when
opened
and
is
making
me
burp
a
lot
american
pils
that
wants
to
be
german
light
side
without
appearing
watery
a
bit
too
mild
but
highly
drinkable
just
the
same
avery
joes
premium
american
pilsner
45
pours
very
pale
golden
color
with
modest
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
layer
within
minutes
nose
is
light
but
a
little
herbal
clean
perhaps
floral
and
grainy
lighter
body
but
not
watery
sweet
soft
grain
comes
through
with
floral
hops
to
round
things
out
short
finish
far
superior
to
any
adjunct
lager
but
seems
a
little
uninteresting
even
for
this
american
pale
lager
style
this
is
a
craft
version
of
the
fizzy
yellow
pils
it
is
straw
colored
and
clear
a
thick
white
foam
that
recedes
but
persists
the
malt
comes
across
as
crackery
and
the
hops
have
some
herbal
and
floral
character
while
both
are
present
in
the
aroma
they
are
not
strongly
so
both
become
more
apparent
in
the
mouth
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
light
the
beer
leans
more
to
hoppy
bitterness
while
not
a
flavor
bomb
it
also
is
not
dumbed
down
i
find
it
tasty
to
style
and
quite
refreshing
a
tasty
pilsneresque
i
wonder
why
pale
lager
flavourful
and
easy
to
put
back
in
numbers
i
presume
just
a
bit
of
astringent
gasohol
despite
the
low
abv
does
well
to
bolster
this
impression
as
well
as
pour
water
on
this
whole
american
concept
of
claiming
ideas
as
their
own
o
pretty
good
take
on
a
pilsner
i
could
definitely
knock
a
few
of
these
out
i
will
rank
this
amongst
my
very
favorite
in
the
the
world
of
lagers
as
it
tastes
good
is
light
and
easy
but
holds
a
different
level
of
complexity
for
this
style
a
standup
job
i
must
say
there
are
few
beers
this
pale
a
color
that
i
enjoy
this
much
short
of
belgian
pales
and
american
wilds
light
but
sprite
so
sessionable
its
ridiculous
o
a
solid
pilsner
with
some
hops
bite
that
is
always
appreciated
o
pretty
impressed
by
the
hoppiness
and
complexity
of
this
beer
for
the
style
its
nice
to
see
craft
beer
companies
putting
out
american
pilsners
to
give
people
a
real
taste
of
the
style
aside
from
the
typical
commercial
garbage
pilasters
note
according
to
some
websites
the
date
code
on
this
could
very
well
represent
a
brewedon
date
of
june
2011
i
really
doubt
that
a
lager
could
hold
up
that
long
but
if
it
did
hell
yes
avery
next
time
im
in
town
ill
have
to
try
it
fresh
o
overall
the
laqueryvinyl
off
flavor
could
just
be
a
batch
oriented
occurence
but
was
very
noticeable
especially
upon
warmer
temps
may
be
just
a
bad
batch
but
otherwise
would
still
garnish
ordinary
results
from
me
a
pretty
good
pilsner
overall
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
super
drinkability
really
like
this
one
for
the
style
would
buy
this
again
during
the
dog
days
of
summer
which
will
be
here
in
about
3
weeks
p
poured
into
pint
glass
appearance
is
ridiculously
pale
a
few
shades
darker
than
water
frothy
white
head
forms
and
retains
leaving
splotchy
markings
on
side
of
glass
the
nose
has
firm
cereal
grain
profile
paired
with
light
herbal
hops
and
notes
of
lemon
rind
and
grass
taste
is
mild
up
front
and
has
a
grainy
backbone
that
shines
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
feather
light
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
simple
beer
with
mild
flavor
tastier
than
adjunct
lagers
but
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
refreshing
lager
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
finishing
sourness
is
a
little
offputting
this
is
alright
i
like
the
can
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
light
head
developed
which
lasted
a
short
while
and
some
modest
lacing
appearance
was
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
aroma
was
of
a
light
citrus
not
much
else
taste
was
a
slightly
bitter
citrus
with
a
slight
sour
on
the
back
mouthfeel
was
light
and
aftertaste
was
slightly
bitter
and
sour
pours
very
pale
yellow
color
but
appearance
recovers
with
a
full
creamy
head
head
lingers
well
throughout
consumption
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
pretty
full
pilsner
hops
floral
with
some
spices
flavor
is
milder
than
the
aroma
more
floral
and
some
spices
with
some
pilsner
presence
tastes
a
little
adjunctladen
corn
and
apple
kind
of
weird
excellent
refreshing
version
of
a
pilsner
the
best
lager
beer
that
ive
tried
the
appearance
is
clear
and
clean
in
the
glass
the
beer
is
smooth
enough
to
drink
from
the
can
the
aroma
gives
a
light
bitter
presence
the
beer
is
crisp
and
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
not
just
refreshing
but
more
satisfying
than
you
would
expect
it
is
slightly
richer
and
doesnt
just
wash
past
your
palate
a
couple
of
these
and
visions
of
summer
are
already
dancing
in
my
wintery
head
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsner
its
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
liking
easing
back
on
them
would
probably
do
the
beer
some
good
balancing
out
the
bitterness
with
the
malty
sweetness
still
its
a
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
due
to
the
offsetting
hoppiness
but
i
can
never
really
complain
about
using
too
many
hops
seems
like
a
basic
pilsner
style
beer
nothing
bad
about
it
but
not
of
the
outstanding
or
noteworthy
variety
either
overall
drinkability
a
very
interesting
take
on
this
style
of
american
beer
and
definitely
quite
hoppy
im
not
sure
if
it
is
as
drinkable
as
the
brewer
claims
but
i
could
see
this
beer
pairing
with
a
lot
of
american
dishes
as
well
and
i
find
it
enjoyable
enough
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
another
time
but
not
in
one
sitting
its
too
hoppy
and
not
light
and
refreshing
enough
a
good
beer
but
not
a
highly
drinkable
pilsener
as
described
on
the
can
overall
rather
flavorful
for
the
lighter
abv
but
retaining
a
nice
taste
profile
quite
nice
and
easy
drinking
the
color
is
pale
yellow
fluffy
white
head
it
is
a
b
it
cloudy
and
has
lots
of
carbonation
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
both
sweet
and
bitter
the
sweet
in
the
smell
is
the
citrus
hops
lemon
the
taste
has
only
a
small
hop
bite
it
could
use
a
bit
more
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
conversion
from
macro
beer
d
this
isnt
doing
much
for
me
im
all
for
craft
lagers
but
american
pilsner
as
a
craft
beer
style
just
doesnt
make
sense
to
me
preprohibition
style
or
not
its
bland
and
kind
of
harsh
and
in
the
end
it
just
isnt
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
one
has
a
lot
of
nice
flavors
they
are
just
all
understated
which
in
turn
really
helps
drinability
o
a
great
pilsner
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
a
long
time
great
drinkability
cheers
decent
brew
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
anything
special
hops
and
crispness
add
to
the
drinkability
and
the
overall
worthiness
of
this
offering

its
a

with

topped
with
a

faint
on
the

the

all
the
way
through
with
notes

on

a

avery
keeps
rising
in
my
estimation
they
brew
a
great
whit
and
fine
ipa
all
of
their
bomber
offerings
are
wonderful
this
pils
keeps
with
the
tradition
overall
this
is
a
sold
apl
beer
from
avery
a
nice
alternative
to
my
hoppy
and
high
octane
beer
drinking
this
was
enjoyed
very
easily
this
can
of
pilsner
poured
a
clear
medium
dark
golden
color
with
a
fine
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
citrus
pepper
and
grass
mixed
with
pale
malt
the
malt
more
than
sneaks
through
on
the
palate
with
clean
bread
and
biscuit
the
herbal
bitterness
speaks
to
the
noble
hops
this
is
a
clean

okay
nice
for
a
lager
but
nothing
seems
to
pop
no
flaws
in
this
brew
clean
lager
flavors
nice
light
decent
beer
overall
this
is
a
lager
that
has
a
good
taste
the
taste
that
separates
it
from
any
american
adjunct
lager
is
the
slight
spicy
and
hoppy
finish
its
real
thurst
quenching
and
refreshing
solid
flavors
got
a
can
in
clearance
for
0
99
but
did
pay
around
8
99
for
a
6pack
once
thats
the
beers
only
other
downfall
the
first
being
its
similar
in
flavor
profile
to
an
adjunct
lager
this
is
slightly
above
average
for
this
cheesy
category
but
when
its
so
hot
and
dry
it
has
its
virtues
from
the
12
oz
can
bought
at
grapevine
in
denver
opretty
decent
pilsner
nothing
fancy
to
me
at
least
notes
excellent
pale
lager
malt
flavor
is
spot
on
and
just
enough
hops
to
keep
me
interested
clean
and
quenches
my
thirst
great
beer
for
a
style
that
is
often
not
that
good
o
ok
not
worth
11
49
for
a
sixpack
thats
for
sure
but
inoffensive
and
easily
quaffed
can
enjoyed
at
star
bar
in
denver
slightly
hazed
straw
gold
with
sticky
white
foam
that
clings
to
the
glass
gobs
of
hops
all
around
resinous
herbal
peppery
with
some
bright
lemon
oil
firm
bitterness
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
lean
malt
body
assertively
hoppy
beer
that
manages
to
remain
in
balance
with
this
sub
5
abv
beer
this
is
exactly
what
i
expected
from
an
averybrewed
lager
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
out
in
the
sun
or
with
bbq
definitely
recommended
o
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
ive
experienced
smooth
with
excellent
flavor
and
fragrance
low
abv
but
strong
in
intensity
o
an
alright
pilsner
a
too
light
and
thin
on
the
flavor
o
an
impressive
american
pilsner
i
actually
like
this
quite
a
bit
super
drinkable
and
yet
complex
enough
to
really
be
tasty
check
this
one
out
and
enjoy
it
on
a
summer
day
d
just
got
back
from
a
long
bike
ride
and
this
hit
the
spot
i
imagine
any
sort
of
activity
you
need
to
cool
down
from
this
could
be
refreshing
its
so
light
and
easy
drinking
it
would
be
perfect
almost
anytime
overall
this
is
a
very
wellmade
pale
lager
and
it
might
be
one
of
my
favourite
goto
summer
beers
its
refreshing
clean
and
very
sessionable
well
done
avery
o
a
great
beer
perfect
for
after
working
out
in
the
yard
and
relaxing
highly
sessionable
and
in
general
just
a
great
lager
well
done
notes
drinkable
definately
great
for
a
warm
summer
day
cheers
an
american
pale
lager
with
a
good
measure
of
good
hops
in
it
very
nicely
done
o
drinkable
and
light
tasty
pils
not
my
1st
choice
when
in
the
mood
for
a
pils
but
worth
trying
once
again
ive
taken
too
long
to
try
a
beer
ive
seen
for
so
long
on
the
shelf
i
will
be
buying
a
lot
more
of
avery
joes
especially
with
the
warmer
weather
very
pale
yellow
color
with
half
a
finger
of
head
that
did
not
last
long
before
settling
to
a
thin
skim
a
few
bits
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
down
the
glass
pale
malt
aroma
with
some
bready
and
grainyness
not
picking
up
the
hops
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
flavor
with
a
faint
noble
hop
flavor
what
i
do
get
is
the
pale
malt
and
dry
bread
flavor
nice
and
dry
light
body
and
the
carbonation
is
far
from
lively
nothing
very
exciting
about
this
beer
but
it
has
nice
clean
dry
flavor
that
makes
it
very
easy
drinking
an
uneventful
pilsner
here
but
a
well
made
one
pours
a
nearly
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
smells
like
a
beer
some
lighter
german
style
malts
and
some
noticable
yeast
aroma
slightly
fruity
not
soapy
like
a
hefe
flavor
is
crisp
with
a
reasonable
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
feel
is
nice
very
very
light
and
good
with
a
big
heavy
greasy
meal
good
carbonation
as
well
overall
not
one
of
averys
more
remarkable
products
but
its
good
for
the
lighter
beer
drinker
in
you
life
overall
fairly
decent
though
i
preferred
the
recent
southern
tier
eurotrash
pils
over
this
overall
this
is
a
solid
pils
very
drinkable
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
i
could
slam
a
lot
of
these
joes
premium
american
pilsner
is
quite
good
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
this
white
head
that
is
leaving
some
lacing
the
smell
is
nil
common
for
the
beer
type
the
taste
is
really
good
very
well
balance
lager
with
nice
hop
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
very
good
and
definitely
sessionable
overall
to
be
fair
i
cant
drink
this
beer
without
comparing
it
to
oskar
blues
mamas
little
yella
pils
and
i
love
that
beer
the
joes
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
ill
drink
it
again
but
this
is
one
of
those
rare
occasions
where
oskar
blues
beats
out
avery
pours
a
nice
clear
yellow
it
actually
looks
exactly
like
hard
cider
with
a
finger
of
foam
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
light
lacing
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
kinda
piney
with
a
little
lime
zest
light
bitterness
that
coats
the
tongue
not
overwhelming
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
a
good
mouthfeel
light
perfectly
carbonated
overall
drinkable
i
could
dig
this
on
a
summer
day
o
a
pleasant
smooth
nice
little
hoppy
pilsner
pretty
good
all
around
o
this
beer
is
surprisingly
average
i
was
expecting
more
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
little
pale
lager
but
it
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
in
some
respects
it
just
doesnt
come
together
that
well
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
doubt
that
i
will
revisit
it
in
the
near
future
i
recall
having
this
in
a
can
a
year
or
so
ago
and
being
unimpressed
but
having
it
on
tap
makes
me
think
i
may
have
been
a
bit
premature
in
my
judgement
a
good
pils
example
i
think
i
know
the
guy
on
the
can
from
somewhere
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
very
mild
wheat
sweet
flowers
grass
and
the
smallest
possible
touch
of
minerals
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
flowers
may
come
off
a
bit
sweeter
here
not
enough
to
elicit
true
sugary
sweetness
or
anything
mind
you
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
decidedly
smooth
feel
and
a
very
clean
finish
overall
a
damn
good
pils
probably
one
of
the
best
american
takes
on
the
style
ive
yet
come
across
it
just
goes
down
so
smoothly
so
cleanly
so
nicely
clear
yellow
in
color
with
an
impressive
inch
and
a
half
of
head
slightly
sticky
lace
smell
is
of
typical
skunk
pils
malt
a
touch
of
citrus
pine
and
grains
taste
is
very
clean
of
a
pilsner
with
a
slight
bit
of
hopping
and
no
aggressive
grains
or
malts
clean
tasting
mouthfeel
is
light
but
very
drinkable
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
another
win
for
avery
since
its
a
very
tasty
pilsner
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
with
spicy
hops
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
the
aroma
with
the
malt
backing
this
up
there
is
a
nice
lingering
spiciness
that
i
really
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
dr
quite
drinkable
but
a
bit
boring
certainly
drinkable
but
far
from
exemplary
id
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
look
forward
to
it
too
much
overall
for
an
americanstyle
pale
lager
not
a
pilsner
helles
dortmunder
etc
this
is
definitely
the
best
i
have
ever
had
i
am
drinking
a
single
can
of
this
during
the
bitter
month
of
january
but
may
need
to
get
a
six
pack
come
summer
d
this
is
one
ill
be
coming
back
to
sessionable
high
quality
and
flavorful
without
being
overbearing
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
style
nice
use
of
hops
for
a
pilsner
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
ok
but
nothing
special
overall
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
to
drink
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
in
a
sea
of
mediocrity
it
still
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
one
all
this
coming
from
a
guy
who
has
drank
four
of
these
already
so
it
must
not
be
that
bad
if
you
drink
the
big
three
or
know
someone
who
does
this
may
be
a
good
stocking
stuffer
this
christmas
its
a
light
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
tons
of
carbonation
aroma
is
brightly
hoppy
and
the
taste
follows
with
crisp
malts
and
floral
hops
a
solid
americanstyle
pilsner
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
highly
carbonated
with
just
a
bit
of
drying
feel
the
drinkability
is
very
very
good
overall
a
great
beer
that
im
going
to
be
keeping
around
probably
going
to
be
rotating
with
noble
and
prima
pils
in
my
fridge
all
year
round
overall
i
personally
hate
to
sound
like
a
critic
but
few
pilsners
have
wowed
me
avery
does
make
incredible
beers
and
like
all
breweries
you
need
to
satisfy
all
types
of
clientelle
joes
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
personally
i
would
prefer
something
little
more
hoppy
and
little
fuller
taste
as
far
as
an
american
pale
lager
goes
its
pretty
good
in
terms
of
beer
overall
well
meh
its
clearing
a
very
low
bar
its
not
too
bad
and
i
like
that
it
has
genuine
hop
characters
to
it
but
its
certainly
below
par
when
it
comes
to
the
avery
measure
this
hoppy
refreshing
lager
is
ideal
after
some
heavy
eating
at
thanksgiving
though
i
prefer
the
more
traditional
style
from
the
can
marked
11245811046268
sampled
on
november
18
2011
the
pour
is
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
burst
of
fizzy
head
that
lingers
longer
than
other
pilseners
but
eventually
goes
to
a
ring
grains
malts
and
sugars
are
noted
in
the
aroma
right
off
with
a
clean
hoppy
character
too
the
body
is
thin
to
medium
which
is
just
about
right
grains
and
sugars
in
the
taste
are
followed
by
a
clean
hopped
ending
this
is
a
likeable
pilsener
and
much
more
conducive
to
the
style
a
decent
american
pilsner
a
bit
strong
in
the
carbonation
and
lemon
o
a
nice
drinking
pilsner
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
thus
far
the
overall
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
lacking
in
depth
but
perhaps
that
was
the
style
from
these
olden
times
that
this
beer
harkens
back
to
so
who
knows
overall
i
guess
i
expected
more
out
of
this
beer
could
use
a
little
more
sweetness
and
hops
do
reviewed
to
style
very
drinkable
with
just
enough
of
a
hop
profile
to
keep
it
interesting
for
the
style
would
recommend
to
a
bmctype
loyalist
grabbed
at
beerforia
in
boise
id
o
the
taste
is
the
main
area
this
beer
scores
and
its
mainly
due
to
the
creativity
glad
to
see
a
twist
on
a
traditional
style
id
recommend
it
to
a
friend
who
wants
a
fun
distinct
unique
and
drinkable
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
o
quickly
becoming
a
hot
weather
goto
brew
quite
a
nice
beer
at
the
end
of
a
long
weekend
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
certainly
not
exceptional
drinkable
and
starts
off
great
but
the
finish
is
lacking
indeed
im
glad
to
have
this
but
it
isnt
a
sessionable
beer
like
it
lays
claim
to
3
5
d
pretty
standard
clean
refreshing
pale
lager
good
flavors
but
nothing
too
impressive
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
2
inch
fizzy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
random
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grains
and
some
grassy
hops
taste
is
of
sweet
grain
and
some
herbal
and
grassy
hops
on
the
finish
medium
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
with
a
nice
hop
punch
but
nothing
all
that
special
moonlights
reality
czeck
cannot
be
bought
in
a
6pack
and
until
it
is
joes
premium
american
pilsner
is
the
best
6pack
american
yellow
lager
that
i
can
buy
and
dont
worry
i
didnt
forget
about
prima
pils
avery
didnt
pussyfoot
around
this
one
future
6pack
purchases
await
this
pilsner
is
an
absolute
delight
to
drink
ideally
formulated
with
the
well
exectured
malt
flavor
and
dryness
to
the
assertive
yet
restrained
hop
balance
and
then
with
the
clean
refreshing
finish
that
all
pilsners
require
an
exquisite
beer
on
all
levels
thin
but
creamy
bone
white
head
of
moderate
staying
power
a
minute
or
so
later
dissolves
off
to
a
dusting
across
the
surface
the
lacing
forms
a
solid
sheet
at
first
but
it
too
doesnt
stick
around
long
mild
cloudiness
to
the
otherwise
brightly
glowing
yellow
hued
liquid
scattered
tiny
bubbles
throughout
the
nose
has
a
sharp
profile
to
it
salt
and
pepper
along
with
sour
lemons
and
a
pinch
of
dried
lawn
grass
more
earth
than
dough
or
bread
barest
hint
of
apricot
but
no
real
fruit
presence
nor
is
there
anything
youd
really
call
sweet
per
se
deepens
into
the
nostrils
well
mediumbodied
highly
carbonated
but
tightens
up
into
little
pinpricks
as
it
progresses
through
the
palate
grains
grass
earth
minerals
and
iron
flecks
predominate
more
biting
and
bitter
than
fresh
although
does
invigorate
white
grapefruit
joins
the
lemon
citrus
and
a
slight
uptick
in
the
apricot
peach
red
apple
fruit
department
some
sourdough
to
rye
bread
notes
hard
to
discern
a
meaningful
sweet
malt
presence
certainly
very
active
and
energetic
however
not
a
beer
you
can
easily
relax
with
overall
a
very
relaxing
pilsner
for
sure
i
can
definitely
drink
these
at
a
football
game
nice
and
light
tasting
pilsner
love
the
look
of
this
beer
cheers
this
is
certainly
not
for
everyone
especially
someone
hoping
for
a
light
flavorless
adjunct
lager
american
breweries
suck
at
pilseners
and
it
is
a
joke
that
people
think
this
is
good
for
a
pils
sure
it
stands
up
to
a
bud
but
it
is
a
dud
o
very
dissapointed
with
this
brew
especially
after
trying
out
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
avery
i
definitely
will
not
revisit
this
one
and
will
steer
others
clear
of
it
im
really
not
a
fan
of
american
pale
lagers
but
this
was
advertised
as
a
germanstyle
pilsener
so
i
expected
something
quite
different
hopefully
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
and
its
not
as
bad
as
what
i
got
cheers
m
crisp
and
light
bodied
as
this
type
of
beer
should
be
above
average
finish
for
this
style
overall
a
very
nice
american
pilsner
overall
impression
if
gatorade
wasnt
around
this
would
be
the
thirst
quencher
of
our
new
generation
refreshing
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
go
for
many
more
of
these
the
beer
poured
from
a
can
appeared
a
nice
clear
golden
color
that
produced
a
nice
big
foamy
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
floral
and
earthy
with
a
hint
of
grain
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
good
a
wellbalanced
beer
with
both
the
grain
and
the
hops
present
the
beer
is
light
bodied
dry
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
possibly
a
second
choice
after
victorys
prima
pils
o
an
excellent
pilsner
delicious
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
any
time
you
want
to
drink
a
few
beers
but
not
be
hungover
because
of
a
high
abv
overall
this
is
a
strongly
sessionable
pilsner
of
which
i
am
sure
i
could
consume
a
lot
im
actually
quite
pleased
with
it
o
hard
to
believe
this
is
fresh
but
its
also
hard
to
know
the
difference
hint
hint
this
is
my
last
one
not
a
great
pilsner
but
definitely
a
good
one
made
for
summer
pleasures
with
the
sixpack
of
cans
fairly
simple
but
enjoyable
a
nice
everyday
beer
not
the
best
lager
i
have
had
but
a
good
summer
beer
overall
something
i
would
recommend
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
it
makes
a
nice
summer
drinker
o
as
pilsners
go
not
my
favorite
like
i
said
above
not
bad
but
not
great
hops
really
dominate
every
aspect
of
this
beer
and
as
a
result
becomes
a
bit
monotonous
imo
i
doubt
i
will
be
buying
this
again
quenching
and
suited
well
for
hot
weather
sessions
and
barbecues
plain
and
simple
this
is
what
i
want
in
an
american
pale
lager
well
done
avery
and
thank
you

excellent

offering
by

for
those
that
like
a
lagerpilsner
with
some
extra
ooomph
this
is
the
brew
for
you
this
brew
pours
up
a
vibrant
straw
colored
body
almost
like
mello
yello
and
a
nice
fizzy

that
tapers
down

filled
to

with
hops
if
you

then
you
will
like
this
brew
followed
up
with

slightly
sweet
somewhat
biscuitlike
flavors
and
finish
very
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
went
up
to
the
meretrix
release
saturday
afternoon
and
saw
this
one
offered
on
cask
id
never
had
a
cask
lager
before
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
poured
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
good
hoppy
aromas
lead
to
a
light
bodied
and
somewhat
hollow
palate
with
light
biscuit
and
hop
flavors
d
i
like
a
hoppy
pils
but
the
bitterness
should
pull
back
about
half
way
through
and
not
wear
out
its
welcome
still
very
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
this
pours
a
light
straw
like
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
of
floral
hops
sweet
malts
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
light
and
crisp
the
taste
is
good
some
bitter
hops
more
than
most
pilsners
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
malts
a
bitter
after
flavor
overall
a
decent
beer
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
compared
to
other
pilsners
and
for
a
session
beer
i
prefer
ales
anyways
not
bad
though
im
willing
to
try
it
again
the
summer
season
for
pilsners
kicked
off
this
year
with
averys
joe
pils
canned
for
your
camping
convenience
and
wrapped
in
aluminum
for
easy
chilling
in
your
refrigerator
a
stream
or
a
lake
wherever
you
take
this
beer
this
beer
takes
you
to
a
wonderful
and
cooling
place
crisp
and
lively
with
all
the
flavors
of
summer
the
head
is
light
and
fluffy
like
a
rolling
summer
cloud
with
an
intensely
cloudy
body
reminding
me
more
of
a
witbier
than
a
crystal
clear
pils
the
aroma
has
a
light
touch
of
hops
more
assertive
than
other
pilsners
light
and
crisp
and
refreshing
even
in
the
nose
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
sharp
carbonation
the
flavor
starts
with
a
bite
of
flowery
hops
carried
by
a
roiling
stream
of
carbonation
the
pilsner
astringency
is
well
matched
against
an
alcohol
bite
also
not
a
touch
of
skunkiness
or
sulfur
i
suspect
the
opacity
of
the
can
helps
here
but
whatever
the
reason
this
is
a
local
and
very
refreshing
take
on
a
classic
and
cooling
style
id
love
to
learn
more
about
the
classic
and
contemporary
elements
in
the
joe
pils
beer
summer
is
here
and
so
is
the
beer
for
it
this
is
a
great
hot
weather
lawnmower
beer
if
i
do
any
camping
this
summer
some
cans
of
this
will
be
in
my
cooler
tweak
the
flavor
of
this
a
different
kind
of
barley
ease
up
on
the
hops
and
you
have
a
good
craft
pilsner
as
it
stands
now
its
a
beer
i
want
to
like
but
fails
in
its
execution
o
goes
down
easy
very
tasty
not
filling
no
kick
pretty
good
representation
of
style
i
could
totally
hit
this
one
up
for
an
evening
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
nothing
flashy
or
too
exciting
but
it
works
on
many
levels
its
got
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
for
a
hophead
like
me
but
drinks
so
clean
and
easy
that
one
could
easily
finish
a
six
pack
on
a
nice
summer
day
would
definitely
recommend
for
fishingcamping
or
tailgating
crisp
yet
smooth
joes
premium
american
pilsner
makes
me
wish
my
grandfather
favored
beer
over
bourbon
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
should
be
so
lucky
to
stock
with
regularity
in
my
fridge
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
mostly
clear
with
gobs
of
carbonation
a
white
head
stays
low
and
patches
the
glass
nicely
smell
is
very
fresh
noble
hops
sweet
too
taste
starts
off
with
a
scoop
of
surprisingly
bready
malt
before
rising
up
to
the
tart
tight
hops
overall
a
very
green
tasting
brew
finishes
dry
and
crisp
feel
is
excellent
a
darn
good
beer
here
pours
a
light
straw
body
with
a
generously
apportioned
white
head
that
clings
nicely
to
the
glass
aromas
are
grassy
but
mostly
characterless
tastewise
this
beer
is
pleasantly
hopforward
from
beginning
to
end
in
a
way
that
makes
it
thoroughly
refreshing
and
palate
cleansing
to
an
array
of
vegetable
and
seafood
dishes
its
body
has
a
weight
that
i
didnt
expect
but
made
its
palatecleansing
properties
all
the
more
pronounced
this
is
not
your
typical
pisner
its
better
you
can
drink
this
stuff
like
water
its
not
really
my
style
but
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
very
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
highly
drinkable
very
sessionable
only
problem
this
beer
is
too
pricy
id
drink
a
handful
no
problem
crystal
clear
and
a
little
darker
than
straw
yellow
the
soapy
white
cap
lingered
and
produced

overall
pretty
good
refreshing
with
some
tasty
hops
fades
a
bit
in
the
feel
department
bit
of
a
citric
finish
and
with
little
to
speak
of
for
redeeming
pils
qualities
a
bit
of
a
watery
wanderer
in
the
end
d
definitely
a
hopped
up
pils
on
the
nose
and
on
the
start
of
the
palate
wish
it
was
backed
by
some
more
malt
too
watery
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slick
with
light
carbonation
a
light
body
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
a
very
tasty
session
beer
that
went
down
easy
an
any
timeany
where
beer
overall
this
is
a
fine
pilsner
the
beer
works
well
on
all
levels
giving
it
a
unique
drinkability
for
the
style
it
is
slightly
sweet
but
balanced
well
with
some
good
bitterness
the
beers
clarity
is
superb
and
a
good
drinking
beer
all
around
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
the
american
pilsner
style
this
is
a
nice
poundable
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
o
a
very
good
example
of
an
american
pilsner
this
was
great
overall
im
in
the
deep
south
so
theres
nothing
quite
like
a
crisp
hoppy
lager
on
a
sweltering
day
and
im
a
damn
sucker
for
em
when
i
find
em
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
pils
not
much
aroma
so
perhaps
a
good
candidate
to
drink
straight
from
the
can
good
beach
beer
a
little
expensive
though
drinkability
isnt
all
that
great
just
a
little
too
much
bitterness
here
o
pretty
good
overall
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
over
a
very
light
straw
golden
foam
retains
and
theres
good
lacing
aromas
are
big
bitter
hop
aromas
flavor
is
very
clean
bitter
florals
are
heavy
on
the
palate
the
hops
completely
dominate
the
malts
at
first
and
almost
through
to
the
end
of
the
glass
medium
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
incredibly
drinkable
a
solid
pilsner
its
dangerously
close
to
prima
pils
id
have
quite
of
few
of
both
in
a
day
if
i
could
this
was
a
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
take
on
a
pale
lager
with
that
alcohol
content
being
right
where
it
needs
to
be
to
make
sure
that
you
could
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
was
a
good
selection
by
avery
to
put
in
a
can
i
agree
with
others
that
this
beer
is
too
expensive
i
was
under
the
impression
is
costs
distributors
and
brewers
less
money
to
can
beer
than
to
bottle
an
excellent
lawn
mower
beer
to
be
sure
but
theres
just
not
much
here
definitely
not
a
top
of
the
line
pilsener
as
far
as
an
americanstyle
pilsner
goes
this
has
to
be
up
there
with
the
best
this
will
make
for
some
fine
beach
refreshments
this
summer
good
stuff
worth
trying
nice
drinking
beer
clean
and
flavorful
without
lots
of
carbonation
of
too
crisp
a
feel
nothing
wrong
with
that
just
a
nice
change
of
pace
as
an
american
pale
lager
this
is
choice
d
while
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
not
perfect
the
flavor
was
excellent
really
solid
beer
so
excited
to
see
more
and
more
craft
cans
around
this
area
especially
as
the
weather
warms
up
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
strawyellow
with
slight
haze
to
it
and
a
good
2finger
white
head
on
top
this
sticks
around
for
almost
the
entire
drink
and
leaves
plenty
of
sip
rings
in
its
wake
the
nose
is
pretty
basic
with
some
lemon
zest
pineapple
cut
grass
the
mouth
is
spritzy
and
palatecleansing
refreshing
feel
really
good
crisp
flavors
with
plenty
of
citrus
and
sharp
hops
on
the
finish
clean
and
refreshing
perfect
beer
for
the
upcoming
blistering
months
notably
thin
bodied
even
for
a
pilsner
the
flavor
starts
with
a
modest
grainy
malt
taste
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
are
very
bitter
for
the
stylelots
of
peppery
hop
high
carbonation
gives
t
his
brew
a
spritzy
feel
overall
it
is
head
and
shoulders
above
the
macros
but
it
still
has
some
of
those
elements
thin
bodied
spritzy
and
grainy
malt
the
hop
gives
it
a
dose
of
character
in
short
this
is
not
a
subtle
pils
o
this
is
delicious
and
refreshing
it
is
worth
purchasing
a
6
pack
of
this
lighter
body
with
good
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
well
made
beer
first
of
all
i
love
these
little
cans
and
the
brew
pours
a
very
light
see
through
yellow
dusk
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
two
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
only
average
with
hints
of
salamipale
malts
and
herbalgrassy
hopsit
has
a
light
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
that
has
tastes
of
pungent
floral
hops
firstly
followed
by
some
palebiscuty
malts
and
then
the
floralherbal
hops
come
through
again
and
you
can
tell
it
is
nicely
hopped
and
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
moreish
and
overall
its
a
brew
that
doesnt
really
rate
ultra
high
with
me
for
memorability
factor
but
i
would
love
a
sixer
of
this
in
the
fridge
just
for
its
drinkabilitysession
factor
and
i
will
buy
again
o
this
is
a
beer
that
could
easily
be
consumed
a
lot
over
the
summer
its
portable
balanced
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nicely
done
pilsner
by
avery
in
the
pint
averys
pilsner
looks
light
straw
gold
with
barely
a
whimper
in
terms
of
even
a
cap
on
tap
looks
rather
dead
no
stick
because
there
is
nothing
to
stick
smell
is
fairly
simple
earthy
with
noble
hops
out
the
wazoo
and
some
pale
malts
in
there
the
taste
is
str8
forward
simple

with
german
hops
and
american
abundance
of
volume
in
using
these
hops
in
a
word
alot
pale
malts
light
bodied
and
refreshing
after
a
brisk
walk
in
nyc
while
not
carbed
up
in
looks
this
beer
is
certainly
not
dead
crisp
a
great
simple
beer
overall
id
recommend
it
in
the
right
situation
i
think
itll
be
a
superior
refreshment
in
the
summer
and
good
for
cutting
through
the
heat
of
spicy
dishes
its
easy
to
enjoy
though
not
as
easy
to
remember
this
is
really
solid
pils
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
brewed
outside
of
pa
that
i
have
had
avery
is
consistently
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
this
is
another
solid
offering
tasty
and
drinkable
and
bonus
points
for
coming
in
cans
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
a
basic
pilsener
i
get
a
lot
of
pils
malt
as
well
as
some
grain
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
pils
malt
along
with
some
grass
and
orange
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
the
bitterness
is
low
to
medium
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
americanmade
pils
o
a
reasonably
nice
pilsner
overall
the
spice
is
strange
and
its
a
little
light
in
aromaflavor
its
a
little
soft
and
smooth
that
is
to
say
not
as
crisp
and
snappy
as
i
like
the
style
still
worthwhile
all
told
d
very
drinkable
this
could
be
my
favorite
pilsner
o
overall
a
nice
pilsner
from
avery
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
something
i
would
have
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsner
d
drinkable
beery
i
dont
know
if
id
want
to
drink
a
6
of
all
these
fairly
good
pilsner
highly
drinkable
especially
if
you
appreciate
the
bitterness
i
wish
there
was
more
flavor
in
the
middle
of
the
drink
the
nose
got
me
really
excited
for
what
this
could
be
wouldnt
pass
it
up
but
i
can
think
of
a
couple
colorado
lagers
that
can
top
it
overall
this
is
a
decent
take
on
the
pilsner
style
that
manages
to
be
something
different
than
its
czech
and
german
progenitors
its
a
worthwhile
summer
purchase
especially
if
you
cant
buy
prima
pils
where
you
live
overall
if
you
are
a
pilsner
lover
i
would
recommend
this
one
over
any
of
the
others
offered
at
avery
its
pretty
solid
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
flavors
of
grains
and
cereals
with
an
assertive
hop
snap
on
the
finish
the
presence
of
german
noble
hops
is
unmistakable
we
got
a
flavorful
pilsner
here
not
as
grassy
as
i
expected
which
is
nice
its
got
a
slight
hazy
yellow
appearance
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
big
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
grainy
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
in
the
flavor
of
this
brew
as
well
not
overly
bad
its
much
better
than
most
pilsners
but
still
just
a
pilsner
to
me
do
easy
drinking
even
if
it
isnt
categorized
as
a
pilsner
i
see
it
as
such
abv
is
very
manageable
despite
the
strong
bitterness
for
the
style
i
dont
fit
it
overwhelming
pricey
for
what
it
is
very
much
lacking
d
pretty
tasty
for
such
a
small
beer
solid
amount
of
hops
and
pretty
good
balance
yet
goes

stand
out

on
the
palate
mixed
with
a
sturdy
toasted
malt
billa
lot
of
flavor
in
a
small
package
this
to
me
is
like
a
north
german
pilsner
in
a
way
with
its
sharp
hop
profileits
hefty
malt
bill
goes
great
with
it
a
wonderful
beer
to
have
while
grillin
outside
like
i
will
be
today
o
this
is
a
prime
example
of
a
craft
lawnmower
beer
its
got
summertime
written
all
over
it
low
abv
big
drinkability
on
a
hot
and
sticky
day
pass
me
a
joes
d
the
lightness
and
mouthfeel
are
very
nice
the
taste
isnt
so
great
to
me
the
grassy
hops
are
nice
at
first
but
their
is
a
sharp
bitterness
that
over
powers
and
hangs
over
the
malt
in
the
after
taste
which
im
not
so
fond
of
dsolid
certainly
nothing
crazy
here
but
an
aggressively
hop
and
rather
tasty
and
pleasant
drinking
american
slanted
light
lager
a
nice
beer
to
have
around
for
backyard
bbqs
and
family
picnics
drinkability
with
the
bright
and
spicy
hop
flavor
and
light
body
this
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
considering
the
flavorful
taste
great
balance
and
relatively
low
abv
this
is
session
ready
nice
beer
to
ring
in
the
spring
and
stick
with
in
the
summer
had
a
can
after
work
on
friday
wow
im
not
sure
whats
so
american
about
this
at
first
with
the
big
kick
of
spicy
lemon
herb
hops
i
suppose
the
malt
is
a
bit
more
grainy
and
dry
than
a
german
pils
i
love
a
good
ipa
or
pils
but
the
bitterness
here
is
just
a
touch
close
to
astringent
otherwise
this
is
a
heck
of
a
pilsner
db
sort
of
a
hard
beer
to
go
about
reviewing
the
flavors
are
fairly
straight
forward
and
light
a
little
bit
sweet
for
me
but
pretty
balanced
and
drinkable
i
say
clean
though
its
not
perfectly
so
the
mouthfeel
is
good
though
with
an
appropriate
lightmedium
body
and
good
crispness
leading
to
an
adequately
smooth
finish
dry
is
the
operating
word
here
quite
a
clean
nose
but
hints
of
actual
flavor
are
peeking
through
toasted
grains
and
pungent
hops
and
indeed
it
proves
to
be
quite
tasty
not
too
mention
surprisingly
fullbodied
crisp
and
easydrinking
but
those
hops
are
quite
potent
earthy
at
first
then
quite
bitter
in
the
finish
as
a
pilsner
this
would
get
decent
marks
as
an
american
pale
lager
its
pretty
damned
good
i
hope
to
find
this
beer
in
the
summer
because
it
should
be
a
very
drinkable
option
during
the
hot
weather
i
noticed
the
picture
featured
a
can
which
makes
it
that
much
better
overall
i
think
avery
achieved
a
good
balance
that
helped
me
answer
the
questions
i
stated
above
this
beer
has
elements
of
european
lagers
but
it
is
distinctively
unique
and
way
better
versions
of
bmc
swilstyle
adjunct
lagers
it
has
a
sweetness
that
is
subdued
and
a
hoppiness
that
is
strong
enough
to
achieve
balance
but
not
take
over
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
is
a
good
beer
ok
avery
i
hope
you
are
reading
this
i
know
there
is
a
huge
hop
following
and
many
hop
heads
all
over
the
place
and
theres
a
big
contest
for
who
can
bitter
their
beer
the
most
or
cram
the
most
hop
profile
but
theres
a
time
and
place
for
hops
and
a
hop
profile
for
each
style
i
understand
trying
to
break
down
the
walls
and
expand
the
various
styles
but
this
is
just
overboard
a
nice
pilsner
with
some
light
noble
hops
something
like
noble
pils
actually
adds
a
nice
touch
to
it
this
however
i
just
waaay
to
much
im
a
hophead
actually
i
love
hops
in
many
ways
but
when
im
drinking
a
pilsner
i
dont
want
my
hops
to
overpower
it
so
much
i
think
im
drinking
hop
juice
a
pilsner
is
delicate
and
sessionable
a
summerspring
beer
mostly
but
this
just
smacks
it
in
the
face
and
drags
it
out
to
the
curb
to
be
runover
by
the
bus
and
have
the
neighbors
dog
piss
on
it
piss
a
golden
shower
of
hops
ok
maybe
a
little
too
much
imagery
but
seriously
too
much
d
there
is
good
drinkability
here
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
good
flavor
there
is
a
little
more
bitterness
than
im
used
to
in
a
pilsner
but
its
good
for
fans
of
tuppers
hop
pocket
pils
and
sam
adams
noble
pils
d
definitely
the
best
fizzy
pale
lager
ive
ever
had
both
thirstquenching
and
flavorful
d
easy
drinking
smooth
beer
great
tasting
this
is
a
tasty
brew
well
done
extreamly
clean
even
calling
this
an
american
pilsner
is
a
misnomer
this
is
a
lager
that
has
a
bit
of
malt
but
lacks
the
hops
and
crispness
of
anything
remotely
resembling
a
pilsner
with
that
said
this
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
and
had
no
obvious
flaws
in
the
brew
process
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
with
this
beer
if
it
were
simply
classified
as
a
pilsner
however
avery
decided
to
use
pilsner
in
the
name
i
think
its
betterclassified
as
an
american
pale
lager
which
has
been
done
here
on
ba
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
if
i
am
looking
for
something
thats
lightbodied
and
has
a
lot
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
light
with
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
easily
and
is
definitely
enjoyable
to
drink
lingering
hop
presence
throughout
good
flavor
for
a
lager
sessionworthy
would
pair
nicely
with
a
round
of
spicy
appetizers
or
throw
in
a
cooler
for
some
floatfishin
and
some
homemade
deer
jerky
on
tap
at
the
brewery
pale
yellow
malt
aroma
ibu
a
significant
42
and
its
tehre
and
felt
lacey
hoppy
arbonation
is
there
though
not
obtrusive
average
muthfeel
a
good
american
style
pilsner
served
a
little
cold
as
it
would
be
at
most
bars
d
overall
a
well
done
drinkable
beer
this
would
be
a
good
brew
for
the
summer
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
im
bummed
that
this
was
my
only
one
i
need
more
for
when
all
the
snow
melts
and
its
time
to
barbecue
all
in
all
joes
premium
american
pilsner
is
a
refreshing
naturaltasting
pilsner
with
a
slight
bitter
hop
finish
quite
a
radically
different
take
on
the
american
pilsner
this
is
a
really
smooth
drinking
enjoyable
beer
i
can
see
it
being
a
big
hit
at
the
beach
in
a
few
months
not
too
shabby
certainly
better
than
the
last
avery
beer
i
had
karma
if
avery
can
maybe
tweak
the
flavor
a
little
this
one
could
take
on
prima
as
my
favorite
for
the
style
if
you
like
a
pilsener
to
be
a
little
hoppier
this
one
will
be
right
up
your
alley
d
the
hops
seem
really
out
of
whack
here
almost
like
someone
accidentally
added
the
flavor
and
aroma
hops
all
at
the
bittering
addition
and
said
ah
screw
it
im
sure
it
will
turn
out
fine
its
not
bad
it
just
doesnt
jive
with
me
the
crack
reveled
yet
another
craft
beer
filled
to
the
brim
with
beer
the
glug
looked
like
pale
yellow
ahem
running
into
the
glass
resulting
in
two
fingers
worth
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
lemonyellow
in
total
it
resembled
lemonade
the
nose
danced
no
sparkled
with
grassy
lemony
noble
hops
hot
damn
yep
pappaps
beer
would
have
been
the
prohibition
era
or
after
swill
that
we
are
still
stuck
with
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
the
hops
were
unencumbered
filling
my
mouth
and
sinuses
with
a
grassiness
that
made
me
long
for
summer
or
the
next
visit
to
my
dealer
i
initially
poohpoohed
lagerstyle
beers
until
somebody
turned
me
onto
classically
made
beers
vice
aals
this
was
fantastic
tasty
dry
on
the
finish
refreshing
no
off
flavors
i
would
take
an
entire
cooler
full
of
this
to
the
beach
subjectively
i
dont
like
it
objectively
it
is
a
very
nice
example
well
made
and
appealing
i
suspect
that
pilsner
lovers
will
find
this
a
very
good
american
example
amazing
balance
nice
hop
bitterness
again
earthy
with
grassy
finish
cereal
and
biscuity
malts
crisp
refreshing
and
slighlty
creamy
tremendous
carbonation
and
way
to
drinkable
great
rendition
by
avery
d
high
wish
i
could
get
this
would
be
a
perfect
summertime
beer
light
and
easy
drinkin
with
a
nice
hop
snap
overall
a
mediocre
at
best
pilsner
overall
a
tremendously
tasty
pils
that
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
highly
quaffable
d
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
good
pils
slainte
very
refreshing
though
not
quite
cutting
a
very
good
domestic
example
of
a
german
classic
certainly
gives
prima
pils
a
run
for
the
money
o
interesting
new
take
on
a
style
this
is
probably
not
a
czech
pils
and
should
not
be
rated
as
such
and
at
4
7
its
also
not
an
imperial
pils
like
the
other
entry
so
this
really
belongs
in
a
new
category
rather
hoppy
and
quite
refreshing
ill
definitely
drink
joes
next
summer
while
grilling
and
consider
it
in
food
pairings
in
the
winter
this
beer
is
crisp
light
refreshing
and
bretty
very
bretty
the
dry
finish
leaves
my
palate
with
a
blank
feeling
of
dry
funk
like
i
had
been
sucking
on
a
piece
of
wood
i
asked
if
this
was
the
beer
i
ordered
and
she
brought
be
2
more
ounces
to
be
sure
ive
read
the
other
reviews
of
this
beer
all
in
the
can
and
i
cant
reconcile
their
descriptors
with
mine
but
this
is
the
beer
i
was
served
and
it
was
fermented
at
least
partially
with
brettanomyces
super
pale
straw
golden
color
forms
thick
white
head
with
fine
even
bands
of
lacing
the
nose
gives
off
herbal
citrus
grassy
notes
hints
of
pungent
german
hops
going
on
light
malt
biscuit
cracker
barely
any
sweetness
noticed
super
dry
finish
upfront
barrage
of
green
hops
from
the
can
a
nice
flow
with
each
gulp
a
couple
of
these
cans
could
vanish
so
easily
nice
cracker
light
pale
malts
provide
just
enough
sweetness
with
a
big
bitter
hop
profile
with
citrusgrassyherbal
accents
kicking
around
on
the
palate
hop
burps
are
plentiful
carbonation
is
ample
again
great
experience
drinking
out
the
can
this
isnt
as
good
as
the
authentic
german
pils
from
pa
but
these
would
definitely
be
people
interst
in
living
and
restoring
the
mouthfeel
is
accentuated
by
bubbly
carbonation
while
the
light
to
medium
body
and
heavy
malt
makes
it
feel
creamy
as
well
there
is
no
discernible
booze
at
all
which
makes
this
at
the
top
of
the
drinkability
spectrum
a
great
new
entry
to
the
craft
pilsner
market
and
a
beer
i
plan
on
enjoying
on
a
regular
basis
in
the
near
future
d
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
but
a
bit
out
of
balanced
seems
disjointed
wow
like
that
a
gamechanging
beer
is
born
demanding
to
be
heard
this
is
premium
american
pilsner
i
couldnt
agree
more
thank
you
avery
thank
you
for
making
a
pilsner
with
balls
overall
not
bad
for
a
pils
its
probably
the
hoppiest
pilsener
ive
had
i
like
all
the
hops
and
the
lower
alcohol
could
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
d
this
was
a
nice
offering
but
the
grapefruit
citrus
flavors
felt
a
bit
too
far
out
of
style
overall
im
glad
i
had
it
overall
a
really
enjoyable
beer
i
wish
it
wasnt
quite
so
expensive
9
is
a
lot
for
a
6pack
of
pils
in
cans
not
really
my
favorite
and
probably
one
i
wont
keep
going
back
to
but
i
can
imagine
this
being
a
ba
favorite
d
i
still
feel
like
im
not
there
yet
when
it
comes
to
pilsners
but
damn
i
am
trying
i
really
like
all
the
bright
flavors
maybe
i
would
turn
down
the
soapy
a
tad
but
probably
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
so
far
the
color
is
a
bright
gold
that
is
as
clear
as
you
can
imagine
the
head
is
amazing
joes
doesnt
produce
head
it
produces
a
continuous
stream
of
creamy
meringue
that
climbs
out
of
the
glass
ive
never
seen
head
like
this
on
any
beer
the
nose
is
strongly
floral
from
the
tons
of
noble
hops
flavor
is
very
bright
with
loads
of
herbal
german
hops
to
extent
that
it
makes
a
good
czech
pils
seem
not
very
hoppy
in
comparison
there
is
a
nice
breaddy
malt
backbone
to
keep
the
hops
in
check
and
the
finish
is
clean
without
any
off
character
superb
great
beer
tops
in
my
book
super
grapefruit
citrus
aroma
nice
copper
body
with
a
2
finger
head
that
laces
up
nicely
bitter
start
that
smooths
out
quickly
hint
of
a
sour
finish
but
is
otherwise
smooth
like
this
one
very
much
if
you
like
west
coast
pale
ale
or
ipas
its
worth
the
a
try
probably
wont
seek
out
and
purchase
again
but
would
drink
if
available
very
good
thick
creamy
head
good
flavor
very
good
ipl
overall
double
agent
is
a
nice
hoppy
lager
that
doesnt
go
overboard
with
bitterness
i
enjoyed
this
brew
a
little
toned
down
for
those
that
dont
like
intense
hops
this
would
be
a
great
crossover
beer
pours
a
copper
with
a
small
head
mild
to
low
carbonation
smells
biscuity
not
much
hop
presence
in
the
nose
very
smooth
and
crisp
going
down
i
dont
much
care
for
lagers
but
i
am
starting
to
open
up
to
these
ipls
overall
i
am
not
huge
into
hoppy
beers
but
this
one
is
actually
good
has
an
actual
nice
hoppy
taste
without
being
extremely
bitter
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
to
patches
aroma
of
sweet
biscuit
malt
light
piney
and
grassy
hops
flavor
is
biscuit
malt
grassy
hops
with
light
piney
and
citrus
elements
finishes
with
grapefruit
and
citrus
hop
bitterness
and
citrus
rind
medium
bodied
exactly
what
is
expected
from
a
india
pale
lager
with
a
classic
lager
body
with
distinctive
grassy
hops
with
piney
and
light
resinous
notes
the
hops
are
well
balanced
with
the
crackery
malt
a
little
of
the
distinctive
boston
beer
light
butteriness
in
the
finish
o
although
this
is
a
lager
it
does
laps
around
your
standard
bmc
beers
boasting
stronger
malt
flavor
and
lovely
hop
bitterness
the
bitterness
isnt
overwhelming
so
i
think
many
people
would
enjoy
this
beer
i
sure
did
a
little
different
than
a
standard
ipa
and
much
more
interesting
than
a
good
many
lagers
this
beer
isnt
great
but
is
worth
a
try
went
well
with
dinner
very
fruity
the
hops
impart
a
very
tropical
fruit
and
grapefruit
flavor
not
my
usual
thing
but
it
is
very
good
very
interesting
beer
maybe
being
a
lager
helps
give
it
such
a
unique
touch
i
am
not
a
fan
of
ipaipl
beer
in
general
and
this
one
does
nothing
to
change
my
thinking
looking
at
the
quality
of
sam
adams
products
this
beer
matches
a
lot
of
there
best
brews
i
may
be
a
little
biased
because
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
but
this
ipl
still
gives
me
that
hop
flavor
that
i
crave
it
would
be
a
great
beer
for
people
that
like
ipas
but
do
not
want
that
bitter
hops
flavor
overall
a
really
good
beer
o
excellent
brew
and
a
great
presentation
on
an
emerging
style
bought
in
pensacola
fl
drank
in
montgomery
alabama
july
31st
2014
o
ive
tried
this
3
times
before
and
it
was
always
skunky
and
obnoxiously
bitter
a
very
good
lager
but
be
careful
with
the
expiration
date
and
where
you
buy
it
cheers
overall
this
starts
out
like
an
apa
then
when
you
expect
that
malt
backbone
to
come
in
at
the
end
it
just
drops
off
despite
that
it
doesnt
feel
out
of
balance
the
way
many
westcoast
ipas
do
instead
it
just
feels
sort
of
empty
beautiful
to
look
at
smell
and
would
certainly
be
a
goto
for
a
hoppy
session
beer
but
if
drinking
just
one
it
leaves
a
lot
wanting
served
in
the
sexy
curvy
samuel
adams
glass
clear
golden
body
with
moderate
effervescence
an
inch
and
a
half
of
foamy
white
head
aromas
of
lager
yeast
piney
hops
biscuit
malt
earth
and
floral
notes
almost
like
a
hoppier
version
of
samuel
adams
boston
lager
medium
bitterness
clean
and
refreshing
lasting
notes
of
earthy
hops
and
a
bitter
tang
honestly
this
is
much
better
than
i
expected
i
havent
been
too
impressed
with
the
many
hoppy
offerings
in
the
samuel
adams
lineup
but
id
have
this
again

grapefruit
and
sweet
tropical
over
a
bit
of
biscuit
light
medium
body
with
a
smooth
texture
slightly
above
normal
carbonation
which
imparts
a
nice
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
a
blend
of
hop
flavor
with
very
little
bitterness
the
hop
flavor
is
citric
with
a
focus
on
grapefruit
initially
the
middle
gets
more
tropical
and
ends
with
a
nice
biscuit
crispness
on
the
finish
a
nice
light
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
lingers
a
bit
poured
a
dark
gold
body
with
good
head
and
lace
the
aroma
is
mostly
hoppy
with
a
little
bit
of
grainy
malts
in
there
these
citric
hops
dominate
the
flavor
profile
but
the
beer
is
more
fuller
body
and
not
quite
smooth
like
some
ipas
not
much
sweetness
in
this
beer
as
it
is
mostly
dry
and
hoppy
easy
finish
and
a
good
hearty
filling
beer
worth
sipping
on
d
overall
great
have
plenty
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
dark
amber
color
and
produces
a
nice
long
lasting
head
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
in
fact
more
hoppy
than
i
like
i
hate
ipas
but
id
thought
aid
give
an
ipl
a
try
i
dont
hate
it
as
much
as
the
ipas
but
ill
stick
with
the
original
boston
lager
next
time
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
over
a
finger
of
head
that
lingers
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
the
nose
is
mildly
hoppy
the
malt
profile
is
present
but
relatively
light
in
character
the
hop
bitterness
is
present
on
the
finish
this
is
basically
sas
classic
boston
lager
with
a
little
less
malt
and
a
little
more
hops
o
this
has
a
lot
going
for
it
im
just
not
sure
why
the
palate
tastes
burnt
given
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
decent
but
that
makes
me
not
a
fan
this
beer
goes
down
easily
with
its
lager
lightness
and
relatively
mild
malt
grain
flavors
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
character
provide
the
real
character
and
uniqueness
to
this
brew
its
not
as
aggressively
hoppy
like
a
west
coast
ipa
nor
as
smooth
as
a
classic
czech
or
german
styled
pilsner
yet
does
a
good
job
of
combining
these
styles
in
an
approachable
way
no
it
probably
wont
blow
anyones
mind
who
likes
a
classic
ipa
or
pilsner
style
by
itself
well
maybe
the
pilsner
lovers
may
find
more
in
common
with
this
hybrid
brew
yet
id
wager
most
people
wouldnt
turn
down
having
another
if
given
a
chance
fine
and
refreshing
o
really
great
hop
flavor
especially
in
a
beer
with
such
moderate
abv
this
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
and
i
intend
to
use
it
as
such
a
solid
meh
not
too
exciting
lager
with
a
little
more
hops
than
most
but
still
not
close
to
an
ipa
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
amber
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
and
lacing
aroma
and
taste
of
pine
citrus
hops
caramel
malt
sweet
fruity
notes
and
mild
bitterness
some
light
grapefruit
tangy
notes
a
medium
palate
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
has
a
nice
malt
finish
balance
by
pine
citrus
and
slight
tangy
grapefruit
notes
has
a
bit
of
lager
in
it
overall
a
good
drinking
brew
overall
pretty
decent
flavor
overall
hit
the
spot
for
a
hop
craving
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
that
is
nice
and
refreshing
makes
for
a
nice
warm
weather
refresher
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
transparent
amber
color
plenty
of
bubbles
and
a
foamy
longlasting
white
head
has
a
grapefruit
and
pine
aroma
taste
is
the
same
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
has
a
crisp
mediumbody
feel
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
session
beer
that
doesnt
sit
heavy
on
the
stomach
and
tastes
delicious
frankly
its
a
thin
beer
that
has
justaverage
ipa
flavors
and
it
just
doesnt
get
to
join
the
awesome
ipa
family
d
a
decent
ipl
with
some
enjoyable
hop
flavors
would
not
turn
this
one
down
as
it
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
hop
tour
but
it
still
leaves
a
little
something
more
to
be
desired
othis
would
be
a
beer
i
would
purchase
again
and
has
a
nice
cold
dry
lager
flavor
the
hoppy
lager
is
a
welcome
attempt
to
do
what
ipas
do
best
promote
hops
while
suppressing
malts
this
ipl
is
a
rather
effortless
taste
even
if
somewhat
underwhelming
o
not
bad
at
all
i
can
really
appreciate
the
clean
separation
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
in
this
beer
number
3
on
the
hop
tour
pours
a
rich
copper
amber
with
a
short
lasting
frothy
white
head
that
gives
way
to
well
nothing
the
beer
does
have
some
legs
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
but
on
the
whole
is
quite
thin
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
a
large
amount
of
citrusy
hops
and
a
nice
malty
backbone
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
a
hop
forward
bitterness
and
a
generous
amount
of
citrus
and
grassy
notes
this
is
an
enjoyable
pour
nothing
outstanding
but
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
or
after
a
long
shift
definitely
enjoyable
but
not
of
note
alot
of
head
this
beer
poured
with
more
head
than
beer
at
first
im
not
a
fan
at
all
of
ipas
so
i
thought
id
try
an
ipl
since
im
a
lager
fan
the
aging
didnt
help
at
all
lol
i
still
dont
like
ipas
im
not
sure
yet
as
to
what
makes
it
have
that
ipa
flavor
i
think
its
the
hops
but
whatever
it
is
i
dont
like
the
hops
flavor
personal
score90100
would
try
again
good
work
bb
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
on
the
lighter
side
but
is
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
there
was
a
nice
toasty
breadlike
character
that
went
well
with
the
west
coast
hops
the
tart
lemon
flavor
added
a
nice
dimension
as
well
i
can
see
this
being
a
really
good
session
beer
grabbed
a
sixer
for
thanksgiving
pours
from
the
bottle
a
mostly
clear
dark
golden
color
with
small
white
head
aroma
of
bready
malts
lemon
peel
sweet
honey
grapefruit
smells
like
a

really
like
a
malty

slick

medium
high

big
flavor
for
only
5
not
bad
but
was
hoping
for
a
lighter
on
the
malt
body
and
bigger
aromatic
hop
profile
this
one
tastes
really
good
to
me
poured
a
nice
golden
icedtea
color
with
about
12
of
offwhite
head
lots
of
tiny
bubble
trails
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
smell
a
good
amount
of
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
the
grapefruit
isnt
as
strong
in
the
taste
slight
amount
of
pine
in
there
mouthfeel
is
great
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
it
has
turned
out
to
be
quite
good
oi
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
it
drinks
way
above
its
5
abv
and
packs
more
than
enough
hoppy
punch
to
go
up
against
some
of
the
better
ipas
out
there
there
is
a
bit
of
grainy
flavor
in
there
to
remind
you
that
this
is
a
lager
but
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
day
next
spring
excellent
beer
if
only
it
wouldnt
have
been
kept
under
fluorescent
lights
at
the
store
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
decent
foamy
frothy
thick
long
lasting
creamcolored
head
and
plenty
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
orange
amber
with
loads
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
hop
malt
fruit
bit
of
skunk
flavor
is
like
nose
largely
loses
the
skunk
has
a
great
balance
between
bitter
tang
and
sweet
right
up
front
and
dance
around
each
other
in
the
mouth
body
is
spot
on
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
has
good
length
and
is
great
drinking
hope
to
get
more
of
this
overall
it
tasted
just
like
the
boston
lager
but
with
a
pine
aftertaste
taste
palate
the
flavor
picks
up
all
the
hop
notes
from
the
nose
and
adds
them
to
a
nice
bread
base
malt
it
has
a
solid
medium
body
with
balanced
carbonation
and
mellow
bitter
finish
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
pleasantly
surprised
overall
impression
a
good
beer
with
an
identity
crisis
smells
like
an
ipa
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
and
claims
to
be
a
lager
i
dont
care
what
it
is
but
its
a
finely
crafted
beer
and
ill
gladly
have
another
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
smell
was
fantastic
with
a
strong
earthy
scent
every
time
i
brought
the
glass
up
to
taste
i
enjoyed
the
smell
not
much
head
but
decent
lacing
nice
gold
color
drinks
easy
with
a
lingering
hoppyess
i
cant
pick
out
flavors
yet
but
its
good
had
this
beer
once
before
and
liked
it
very
much
so
picked
up
a
six
to
see
if
it
as
good
as
i
originally
thought
very
strong
appearance
with
an
excellent
smell
not
quite
the
hoppy
smell
or
the
bitter
bite
of
the
typical
ipa
which
is
good
and
bad
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
i
like
very
much
and
will
but
anytime
in
the
future
sam
adams
got
this
one
right
o
this
is
a
fun
beer
i
really
like
how
complex
and
yet
still
crisp
this
lager
is
leave
it
to
sam
adams
to
mix
these
two
beer
styles
so
perfectly
this
beer
has
tremendous
flavor
but
is
not
the
least
bit
harsh
it
doesnt
numb
you
with
bitterness
it
doesnt
defeat
you
with
a
high
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
with
a
little
bite
to
it
it
is
gentle
enough
and
the
lager
character
does
indeed
make
it
easy
drinking
o
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
recommended
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
light
to
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
grapefruit
and
floral
hop
aftertaste
a
very
nice
india
pale
lager
which
i
will
buy
again
othe
knock
is
that
as
it
warmed
it
went
downhill
drink
cold
o
overall
good
not
amazing
interesting
but
not
overwhelmingly
good
for
an
american
pale
lager
this
beer
is
quite
something
lots
of
flavor
but
does
not
sacrifice
any
of
its
thirstquenching
attributes
a
really
nice
beer
from
boston
beer
co
not
designed
to
blow
anyone
away
but
rather
a
good
allaround
lazingaroundthetvwatchingaballgame
beer
worth
a
try
to
enjoy
and
come
to
your
own
conclusion
there
is
a
vague
butterscotch
note
on
the
taste
at
first
but
it
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
earthy
hops
and
tropical
fruitiness
uniquely
enjoyable
for
a
pale
lager
o
nice
beer
from
sa
given
the
price
i
enjoyed
it
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
in
my
opinion
o
overall
pretty
good
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
actually
not
because
i
am
a
sam
adams
hater
which
i
am
not
but
because
i
tend
to
not
like
lager
styles
this
is
a
tasty
beer
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
may
drink
it
again
if
its
the
only
non
bmc
on
tap
somewhere
do
drinkability
is
meh
overall
this
is
as
advertised
on
overly
hopped
lager
i
found
myself
wishing
that
it
was
a
lager
since
i
appreciate
the
taste
of
a
standard
lager
over
this
rather
gimicky
beer

that

a

even
at
its

another

a

beer
that

o
this

not
a

a

i
enjoyed

it
wont
make
it

i
enjoyed
this
lager
but
would
have
never
guessed
it
was
a
lager
had
it
not
said
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
pretty
nice
drink
that
while
not
too
surprising
is
something
i
could
drink
six
of
and
still
enjoy
though
i
enjoy
the
noble

better
than
this
when
i
want
a
hoppy
sam

lager
this
double

ipl
bridges
the
gap
between
lager
and
ale
quite
nicely
give
it
a
try
you
may
enjoy
it
o
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
superb
beer
but
i
would
say
its
one
of
my
favorites
from

put
me
in

where
this

this

showcasing
the

with
minimal

from

i
thought
i
would
have
to
homebrew
an
ipl
but
apparently
i
wasnt
the
only
one
to
think
of
trying
this
and
it
seems
to
work
quite
well
a
hit
by
boston
beer
company
when
i
can
taste
what
i
smell
or
smell
what
i
taste
i
have
convinced
myself
with
this
brew
that
thats
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
although
it
pours
a
relatively
nice
golden
color
with
a
frothy
lightly
tanned
white
head
good
lacing
all
the
way
down
what
blew
me
away
was
its
odor
you
are
assaulted
with
a
mix
of
lemon
orange
pears
peaches
apples
and
other
citrusy
scents
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
i
think
i
can
taste
them
all
and
then
some
as
a
lager
it
also
poses
as
a
indian
pale
ale
not
something
i
really
like
but
it
balances
the
fruity
taste
just
right
i
was
simply
blown
away
from
the
start
gotta
hand
it
to
sam

that
defies

just
wish
they
could
have
gotten
more
of
the

into
the

of

the

the

peachyorange
color
with
a
twofinger
soapy
white
head
the
nose
is
as
advertised
all
westcoast
hops
piney
and
citrusy
pleasant
boquette
the
name
double
agent
is
well
used
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
is
there
but
the
lingering
bitterness
you
would
expect
from
an
ipa
is
abscent
seems
like
a
good
wet
hopped
beer
intense
flavor
none
of
the
bitterness
well
done
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
minimal
inactive
carbonation
overall
this
is
possibly
one
of
my
new
favorites
i
hope
sa
keeps
it
around
for
a
while
the
rest
there
were
two
of
these
in
the
mix
pack
and
i
drank
the
first
one
the
other
day
and
didnt
think
it
was
anything
special
after
sitting
down
to
review
the
second
one
im
much
more
impressed
it
would
be
a
decent
ipa
in
its
own
right
but
the
unique
lager
finish
really
makes
this
an
interesting
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
translucent
orange
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
floral
hops
with
hints
of
pine
tastes
of
earthy
and
piney
hops
but
with
a
nice
lager
taste
a
little
over
carbonated
but
light
bodied
goes
down
great
overall
a
very
good
beer
3

pretty
good

with

plenty
of

nose

with
something
of

overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
good
quaff
overall
interesting
brew
it
was
good
for
sure
the
best
i
have
had
to
date
of
these
hoppy
agers
floral
hops
thanks
americo
for
sharing
the
growler
herbal
somewhat
a
nice
mouthfeel
lacy
and
creamy

on
a
golden

a
dry
and
hoppy
finish
citrus
good
drinkability
a
good
hoppiness
great
for
the
summer
a
successful
beer
to
this
drinker
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
any
other
sam
adams
beer
i
have
had
and
i
have
had
quite
a
few
wish
more
brewers
would
do
hoppy
lagers
not
enough
of
them
on
the
market
a
decent
beer
not
much
different
than
other
sa
beers
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
a
traditional
pale
lager
this
is
a
real
enjoyable
beer
glad
i
picked
this
up
overall
a
really
new
and
refreshing
beer
im
glad
i
decided
to
finally
try
one
of
these
the
appearance
and
smell
are
great
if
a
bit
subdued
and
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
taste
is
my
biggest
complaint
and
of
course
that
is
an
important
one
i
love
the
initial
taste
but
there
is
some
definite
funky
earth
stuff
going
on
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
i
would
easily
drink
this
one
again
but
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
good
flavorful
alelike
lager
very
enjoyable
and
sessionable
would
have
it
again
for
sure
o
pretty
well
done
based
on
the
intentions
this
is
a
hoppy
lager
with
some
floral
and
tropical
notes
and
it
seems
like
that
was
the
exact
intention
overall
actually
surprised
how
much
im
enjoying
this
offering
pretty
delicious
lager
highly
recommended
in
fact
buzzlitebeer
and
i
plan
to
brew
something
like
this
as
a
model
bright
copper
clear
with
a
two
finger
tall
white
head
of
a
mix
of
fine
and
coarse
bubbles
the
nose
is
nearly
all
west
coast
hops
pine
grapefruit
and
floral
not
much
of
the
malt
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
with
the
hop
flavors
coming
out
front
here
the
grapefruit
really
takes
over
along
with
the
hop
flavors
there
is
a
pretty
good
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
level
of
a
strong
pale
ale
or
weak
ipa
biscuity
caramel
malts
are
in
there
as
well
to
provide
a
base
but
it
is
clear
that
the
hops
are
the
main
focus
here
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
while
the
hops
make
one
think
of
an
ipa
body
is
all
lager
light
body
with
a
nice
clean
crispness
that
you
just
cant
get
in
an
ale
there
is
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
in
there
that
combined
with
the
bitterness
keep
things
tingly
the
finish
is
a
touch
sweet
with
lasting
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
overall
im
a
fan
of
this
one
although
it
is
kind
of
playing
tricks
on
my
mind
a
good
combination
of
a
nice
hoppy
ale
and
a
crisp
clean
lager
eric
o
surprisingly
good
offering
from
bbc
im
not
surprised
by
them
trying
a
hoppy
ipl
given
the
explosion
of
jacks
abby
in
the
last
year
or
two
this
certainly
isnt
a
hoponious
union
but
its
like
the
60minute
version
balanced
smooth
drinkable
not
bad
clear
solid
gold
color
with
a
grand
fluffy
head
that
deflates
to
a
thin
tightbubbled
cap
smells
floral
and
citrusy
over
a
bready
base
oily
zesty
citrus
flavor
a
crisp
hoppiness
that
becomes
dry
grassy
and
a
little
resinous
before
giving
way
to
some
crackerlike
malts
the
moderate
bitterness
lingers
well
into
the
finish
fairly
light
bodied
and
snappy
making
it
easy
to
suck
down
not
really
any
lager
qualities
coming
through
this
could
pass
as
one
of
those
hip
new
session
ipas
everyones
talking
about
overall
meh
its
like
a
double
pils
maybe
not
even
that
just
a
really
hoppy
pils
a
bit
boring
truth
be
told
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
from
sam
adams
this
is
like
a
restrained
focus
group
tested
version
of
daring
innovation
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
definitely
more
interesting
than
the
typical
lager
sampled
from
a
stella
artois
chalice
a
nice
frothy
off
white
head
is
roused
with
the
pour
nice
lacing
as
it
settles
clear
deep
gold
with
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
rising
intense
hoppy
nose
getting
alot
of
simcoe
at
first
whiff
im
gonna
blaspheme
here
and
admit
im
more
of
an
old
school
hop
guy
simcoes
and
the
newer
varieties
dont
do
it
for
me
like
cascades
saaz
and
bullions
do
but
anyways
quite
a
noseful
here
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
lots
of
hops
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
but
the
hop
is
the
main
attraction
here
finshes
on
a
piney
note
backed
with
some
sweetness
and
light
tropical
fruit
i
dont
care
what
sam
calls
it
to
me
it
has
a
hoppier
pale
ale
written
all
over
it
nice
as
a
oneoff
purchase
but
i
wont
be
a
repeat
customer
of
this
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
this
is
a
nice
poundable
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
being
that
boston
beer
makes
pretty
safe
beers
this
is
even
a
little
bit
of
a
stretch
for
them
and
doesnt
work
perfectly
so
id
be
surprised
to
see
other
breweries
take
it
to
the
next
level
only
to
make
a
sloppier
beer
a
keeper
from
jim
koch
overall
this
is
the
best
beer
sam
adams
makes
easy
to
drink
great
hops
flavors
and
smooth
as
can
be
i
will
reiterate
the
sentiments
of
others
here
jim
koch
please
keep
making
this
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
overly
hopped
lager
that
sa
does
a
nice
job
with
in
the
tradition
of
their
past
hop
heavy
lagers
i
find
an
empty
spot
somewhere
in
the
bodymouthfeel
that
really
sticks
out
to
me
and
distracts
just
a
bit
i
think
this
would
pair
with
some
crackers
and
cheese
popcorn
or
other
bar
snacks
just
to
keep
it
interesting
o
this
is
easily
one
of
my
biggest
beer
surprises
this
year
if
not
of
alltime
double
agent
is
tasty
easy
drinking
and
makes
you
want
to
keep
putting
glass
to
lips
the
single
best
beer
ive
had
from
sam
adams
without
a
doubt
cant
wait
to
put
a
sixer
of
this
on
ice
during
the
summer
note
to
jim
koch
keep
making
double
agent
ipl
pours
a
bright
copper
crystal

an
off

cloudy
textured
large
bands
of
lace
as
it
settles
aroma
straight
up
hops
citrus

cut

even
some
grapefruit
action
its
like
a
light
ipa
or
ipl
in
this
case
smooth
breadiness
malt
back
bone
action
sweeps
the
bittering
hops
in
the
background
citrus
floral
notes
and
cut
grass
make
up
the
flavors
im
getting
in
the
hops
a
nice
blend
of
a
lighter
more
sessionable
hoppy
beer
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
to
light
body
with
hop
oils
texture
in
there
a
nice
bitter
finish
carbonation
moves
the
beer
on
very
well
this
is
really
good
with
different
foods
overall
a
style
that
sam
adams
should
keep
around
i
could
picture
having
this
around
on
hand
more
often
overall
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
very
flavorful
can
see
buying
more
of
this
as
the
temps
warm
up
i
know
some
will
knock
it
because
its
a
sam
adams
but
certainly
worth
a
try
this
is
perfect
with
meaty
sandwiches
bratwurst
or
gyros
to
help
balance
the
feta
but
also
a
great
introduction
to
the
more
hop
heavy
world
of
ipas
and
such
a
great
palate
cleanser
perhaps
your
third
or
forth
to
wake
up
those
taste
buds
cheers
this
did
not
act
like
a
lager
on
the
pour
producing
a
massive
dense
twoplus
fingers
of
tawny
head
that
formed
following
a
cascadinglike
action
color
was
a
deepgold
with
neplus
quality
clarity
and
croesus
and
midas
sat
across
from
me
rubbing
their
hands
together
the
nose
was
grapefruit
and
pine
and
thanks
to
my
deep
inhalation
my
eyes
watered
a
little
at
its
intensity
my
mouth
also
began
to
water
but
that
was
a
separate
issue
i
could
not
wait
any
longer
and
went
for
my
first
sip
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
the
hops
were
intense
on
the
tongue
burning
away
the
old
dead
taste
buds
and
paving
the
way
for
a
lot
of
taste
the
taste
showed
that
the
hops
had
not
been
squandered
instead
intermingling
and
giving
a
real
bite
to
a
style
that
can
often
be
unobtrusive
finish
was
very
dry
just
the
way
this
hophead
likes
his
beers
i
really
like
what
they
are
doing
with
hops
up
there
in
boston
i
really
enjoyed
this
lager
but
because
of
the
aggressive
ipa
style
hops
there
is
really
no
style
to
compare
this
beer
to
overall
a
solid
brew
for
the
hophead
in
all
of
us
the
veer
looked
very
nice
in
the
pilsner
glass
i
chose
with
a
golden
colored
clear
body
a
two
finger
thick
head
and
lots
of
fine
carbonation
the
smell
was
typical
of
a
west
coast
ipa
with
lots
of
grapefruit
orange
peel
and
some
pine
as
well
as
some
spicy
smells
the
taste
was
juicy
citric
very
clean
and
had
some
bubblegum
notes
in
mid
sip
with
clean
finish
i
drank
the
beer
warm
from
the
grocery
store
yesterday
and
it
taste
a
bit
lifeless
with
time
to
chill
today
the
beer
was
much
more
lively
the
mouthfeel
was
very
soft
aided
by
the
pillowy
head
and
about
a
billion
finely
textured
carbonation
bubbles
this
is
one
the
best
beers
to
ever
come
out
of
the
sam
adams
brewery
collections
while
enjoyable
this
ipl
wont
be
taking
the
place
of
any
of
my
favorite
apas
or
ipas
i
do
prefer
it
over
the
sam
adams
alpine
spring
though
well
balanced
with
a
lingering
but
mild
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
crisp
finish
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
buy
it
again
tastefaint
piney

pretty

lager

make
a

craft
brew
for
the
newby
craft
beer
drinker
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
wish
there
was
a
bigger
hop
presence
the
brewery
can
call
it
an
india
pale
lager
if
they
must
to
me
this
is
simply
a
flavorful
sessionable
and
refreshing
lager
that
i
will
enjoy
often
during
the
warm
months
ahead
not
an
equal
to
the
imperial
pilsner
of
a
few
years
past
i
liked
the
hops
qualities
of
this
beer
but
the
light
soapy
for
lack
of
a
better
way
to
describe
it
aspects
of
this
beer
were
a
turn
off
for
me
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
purchased
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
pack
with
other
sam
adams
beers
but
this
one
really
stands
out
as
something
i
would
puchase
again
in
the
future
on
its
own
this
sounded
like
an
interesting
concept
a
heavily
hopped
lager
i
just
dont
think
it
worked
the
hops
seemed
odd
with
the
level
of
carbonation
and
crispness
of
this
lager
gave
the
beer
a
nice
aroma
of
citrus
and
flowers
but
seemed
to
clash
with
the
taste
stick
to
boston
lager
if
you
want
a
refreshing
lager
or
just
pick
up
an
ipa
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
hops

great

and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
decent
brew
yet
a
bit
nondescript
as
well
lacking
in
bitterness
vs
what
i
expected
from
the
label
what
with
double
and
ipl
mentioned
though
im
referring
largely
to
the
ipl
here
as
double
is
obviously
not
an
abv
reference
and
at
5
0
it
drinks
like
a
citrusy
pale
ale
low
carbonation
is
surely
a
deterring
factor
for
this
particular
bottle
a
decent
pale
lager
yet
not
representative
of
expections
o
overall
this
was
alright
might
have
liked
it
a
bit
more
if
it
wasnt
a
ipa
but
not
too
bad
would
probably
have
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
not
a
bad
beer
and
you
cant
go
wrong
with
too
many
sam
adams
a
nce
fail
safe
if
out
at
a
bar
and
its
on
tap
with
bmcs
overall
its
a
good
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
almost
a
session
beer
so
in
the
summer
you
can
enjoy
a
cooler
full
of
them
kind
of
strange
but
a
nice
change
of
pace

very
smooth

easy
drinking
definitely
a
lager
in
that
regard
beyond
that
one
trait
its
more
ipa
than
lager
for
sure
hop
character
dominates
but
not
too
sticky
on
the
palate
definitely
worth
a
try
on
a
spring
day
served
in
a
standard
shaker
on

pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
strong
1cm
of
fizzy
head
that
evaporates
into
islands
of
fuzz
on
the
top
of
the
beer
it
leaves
thin
lacing
that
persists
rather
well
the
beer
is
very
clear
and
has
absolutely
no
haze
to
it
with
great
light
penetration
the
nose
is
a
gorgeous
citrus
hop
bomb
recalibrated
with
that
biscuitlike
breadiness
of
a
good
lager
it
really
does
open
your
eyes
and
i
found
myself
very
impressed
with
how
well
they
worked
well
together
the
taste
was
very
good
it
was
crisp
like
a
good
lager
tasting
of
warm
baked
bread
but
it
has
a
strong
resin
and
citurs
punch
as
well
it
was
full
of
lime
peel
resinous
pine
flavor
and
a
strong
flavor
of
oranges
and
magoes
very
good
and
clean
on
the
palate
perfect
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
offerening
from
a
very
good
beer
company
this
gives
you
the
hop
flavor
a
hophead
would
love
at
a
very
sessionable
5
and
the
twist
of
the
lager
yeast
just
makes
it
nice
and
refreshing
heard
some
chatter
so
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
thick
orange
color
good
suds
smell
is
quite
hoppy
citrus
floral
pine
almost
west
coast
flavor
matches
the
smell
pretty
well
but
not
as
fruity
as
an
ipa
crisp
lager
finish
this
was
a
solid
beer
low
alcohol
strong
hops
i
went
back
for
another
sixer
not
too
long
after
better
then
average
hop
package
especially
for
the
style
easy
drinking
and
pleasing
brew
decent
sessioner
at
5
nothing
special
but
would
work
just
fine
in
a
pinch
sort
of
a
hoppy
brew
with
training
wheels
good
one
to
encourage
a
hoppy
beer
newbie
to
check
out
o
nice
attempt
i
have
never
searched
this
combo
out
and
not
sure
it
completely
works
but
it
may
open
up
some
lager
only
palates
out
there
the
taste
has
a
genlty
herbal
but
not
really
grassy
taste
more
subtle
and
finessed
with
smooth
bitterness
blending
with
light
citrus
flavor
and
a
pleasant
lemon
accent
with
mild
dry
herbal
hop
mixed
with
a
peppery
quality
reminiscent
of
saaz
with
some
slight
grapefruit
tinges
in
the
back
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
flavor
wise
this
is
a
great
hoppy
lager
which
is
smooth
enough
to
warrant
a
second
taste
and
very
drinkable
with
nice
hop
flavor
and
subtlety
w
residual
bitterness
that
brings
you
back
after
the
swallow
nice
job
on
this
one
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
hope
that
it
is
one
i
will
be
able
to
purchase
year
round
these
are
becoming
harder
to
find
in
12
packs
im
guessing
thats
because
it
was
a
one
time
brew
the
case
i
bought
the
other
day
has
a
best
buy
date
of
july
2013
im
guessing
they
were
brewed
around
january
they
still
are
tasting
very
good
to
me
judging
it
as
a
hoppy
pale
ale
solid
i
could
see
this
working
in
the
future
although
i
dont
really
get
the
point
of
lagering
a
beer
with
so
much
fruity
hoppiness
o
i
have
had
hoppy
lagers
in
the
past
but
this
was
done
better
malty
nutty
and
grain
charateristics
of
a
lager
mesh
well
with
the
floral
fruity
pine
of
the
hops
this
is
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
with
a
low
abv
well
suited
for
good
weather
outdoor
drinking
i
am
glad
i
gave
this
a
try
overall
a
really
good
spin
on
a
lager
the
hops
make
it
seem
like
a
solid
west
coast
ipa
o
this
beer
is
a
pretty
easydrinker
and
the
addition
of
extra
hops
makes
it
all
the
more
enjoyable
if
i
ever
wanted
a
lager
this
is
the
lager
that
id
choose
in
between
the
lager
and
the
ipa
it
leans
closer
to
the
zest
of
an
ipa
it
has
such
a
refreshing
citrusy
smell
and
taste
the
smell
and
taste
really
is
deadon
grapefruit
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
nonimperial
series
sam
adams
brews
i
would
get
this
again
dried
orange
taste
bready
pale
malt
lingering
herbal
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
reminiscent
of
a
light
bodied
ipa
so
they
achieved
that
at
least
however
the
ipa
model
is
fairly
dull
here
seems
as
if
it
could
use
a
fair
amount
of
tweaking
to
improve
though
the
product
isnt
at
all
bad
just
a
little
uninspired
o
overall
heard
alot
of
good
things
about
this
i
usually
like
sam
adams
and
thier
easy
approach
to
drinkability
while
maintaining
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
balance
and
style
regards
an
easy
drinking
ipa
though
hardcore
ipa
fiends
may
find
this
a
little
underpar
either
by
bitterness
or
prejudice
of
brewery
still
worthy
a
single
try
a
good
sessionable
beer
based
on
its
5
abv
and
it
would
be
an
excellent
paring
with
food
since
it
is
not
as
overpowering
as
a
strong
ipa
style
i
could
down
45
of
these
pretty
quikly
it
makes
for
a
nice
springsummer
type
beer
overall
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
overall
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
is
very
tasty
showing
off
the
best
characteristics
of
both
an
ipa
and
a
lager
i
would
buy
this
by
the
12
pack
if
it
was
available
overall
the
concept
is
strange
enough
to
get
me
to
pick
up
a
single
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
session
it
it
does
become
balanced
halfway
through
the
glass
but
i
guess
i
am
not
crazy
about
lagers
in
general
o
quite
impressive
to
see
hops
being
used
in
such
a
plentiful
and
effective
manner
by
a
brewery
who
usually
keeps
them
toned
down
a
sam
adams
beer
i
would
not
mind
having
a
few
of
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grapefruit
juice
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malty
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
hoppy
aromas
and
flavors
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
considering
the
price
availability
drinkability
and
uniqueness
i
tip
my
hat
to
sa
i
like
their
ipl
better
than
their
ipa
o
mild
and
unassuming
but
a
good
sessionlike
lager
o
while
this
beer
might
smell
and
taste
similar
to
an
ipa
you
can
definitely
tell
its
a
lager
by
the
lack
of
crispness
and
clean
mouthfeel
in
this
aspect
i
thought
this
was
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
the
drinkability
also
makes
it
rather
sessionable
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
see
this
becoming
my
summeroutdoors
goto
if
available
in
6packs
this
summer
the
hops
add
just
enough
flavor
yet
doesnt
overpower
those
traditional
lager
flavors
a
welcomed
style
cheers
surprised
a
nice
sessionable
apa
well
done
i
have
to
score
this
pretty
high
since
its
a
very
tasty
brew
in
a
rundown
neighborhood
of
a
beer
style
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
the
inevitable
mixed
12pack
bought
at
a
local
supermarket
final
thoughts
im
not
sure
how
fresh
the
bottle
is
because
it
only
has
a
mark
for
when
it
will
be
best
by
july
however
i
tend
to
think
any
hop
forward
beer
tastes
the
best
within
a
month
of
being
bottledcanned
after
that
length
of
time
its
possible
that
the
dank
onion
and
garlic
flavors
could
be
more
perceptible
as
the
citrustropical
fruit
characteristics
fade
that
being
said
i
enjoyed
double
agent
ipl
if
for
no
other
reason
than
it
was
a
great
idea
by
samuel
adams
to
create
a
super
hoppy
lager
i
think
its
an
interesting
avenue
to
go
down
that
hasnt
been
experimented
with
nearly
enough
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
the
fresher
the
better
i
give
this
the
same
b
to
b
that
i
always
seem
to
give
sam
adams
regular
releases
its
good
not
great
feels
more
mass
produced
than
crafted
but
that
said
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
the
pour
is
a
little
more
orange
than
the
standard
lager
and
the
head
is
an
inch
high
and
bone
white
but
doesnt
last
long
smells
hoppy
really
hoppy
actually
oily
fruity
hops
like
gummy
bears
with
the
familiar
smell
of
a
lager
yeast
the
flavor
is
less
hoppy
than
the
nose
which
is
okay
in
this
setting
the
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
and
very
refreshing
but
is
lacking
something
i
think
all
well
hopped
lagers
will
be
lacking
for
awhile
as
i
recently
had
humulus
from
the
bruery
and
it
blew
my
head
off
while
setting
the
bar
for
the
style
this
one
comes
off
a
little
thin
and
contrived
but
its
good
nonetheless
lighter
feel
great
carbonation
medium
hoppy
finish
a
good
beer
to
ease
in
the
warmer
weather
but
dont
come
into
it
expecting
to
be
floored
burst
of
pine
greets
you
upon
opening
the
bottle
comes
out
hazy
golden
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
malt
holds
it
own
against
the
intense
american
hops
giving
it
good
balance
medium
light
body
with
a
bite
to
it
overall
cant
tell
you
what
the
lager
yeast
brings
to
it
you
could
have
told
me
it
was
an
ipa
and
believed
you
mouthfeel
clean
crisp
and
light
bodied
tastefeel
its
a
boston
lager
in
ipa
form
i
think
and
its
fantastic
its
a
lot
like
an
ipa
on
the
front
but
the
finish
is
sweet
with
that
classic
biscuitcracker
aftertaste
that
i
get
from
boston
alelager
and
now
this
the
mouthfeel
is
of
about
medium
carbonation
with
a
slight
creamy
feel
truly
one
of
the
if
not
thee
best
samuel
adams
beers
that
ive
had
i
hope
this
is
a
year
round
offering
thats
available
in
sixpacks
8

for
a
six

sign
me
up
o
a
fine
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
o
still
cant
decide
if
i
really
like
it
but
i
think
it
is
well
done
id
like
to
see
another
ipl
to
compare
it
with
pours
a
clear
copper
color

great
retention
and
great

smells

and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of

mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of

not
have
the
bold
and
varied
flavors
promised
but
it
is
at

a

from
the

this
is
a

up

ibus
to

anyone
anyway
this
is

a

most
i

this
one
one
of
the

beers
i
have
tried
in

maybe
the
best
i
have
had
really
hits
that

drinks
smoothly

mildly
making
it
a

candidate
i
would
laugh

people
claim
this
is
onedimensional
or
something
because
it
really
is
similar
to
80
of
the
ipashoppy
pales
out
there
today
o
i
happen
to
like
sam
adams
as
a
casual
drinking
beer
but
this
is
really
good
even
for
them
well
balanced
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
pine
lots
of
flavor
for
a
5
abv
it
isnt
a
surprising
or
particularly
interesting
brew
but
its
very
drinkable
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
o
decent
drinker
but
suffers
from
a
lack
of
diversity
and
depth
in
flavors
still
a
pretty
nice
pale
lager
with
some
ample
hopping
a
good
value
too
i
hear
theres
a
mole
in
the
agency
or
maybe
it
was
the
garden
anyway
this
stuff
pours
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
candied
orange
peel
light
leek
sweet
caramel
and
grass
the
taste
holds
notes
of
orange
rind
light
lemon
rind
grapefruit
peel
mild
caramel
and
a
bit
of
honey
dripping
from
a
tall
blade
of
grass
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
hoppy
lager
nothing
overtly
special
but
a
generally
enjoyable
experience
o
another
delicious
brew
by
sam
adams
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
boston
lager
only
a
little
bit
more
hoppy
and
less
roasty
i
have
been
a
fan
of
the
boston
lager
but
i
think
i
like
this
even
more
i
will
be
picking
it
up
again
when
i
get
the
chance
it
is
both
delicious
and
well
priced
overall
a
rather
suprising
one
from
sam
adams
a
solid
ipaish
brew
with
plenty
of
hop
character
and
no
real
flaws
impressive
and
for
the
category
it
falls
in
american
pale
lager
i
e
bmc
bullshit
this
really
blows
the
competition
away
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
it
is
a
delicious
lager
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
this
is
only
my
second
ipl
the
previous
one
must
have
spoiled
me
even
though
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
i
would
still
buy
this
again
it
would
make
a
great
session
lager
love

i
really
like
this
double
agant
ipl
from
sam
adams
the
color
is
a
nice
golden
the
smell
is
thick
with
rich
piney
hops
theres
a
bold
hoppiness
in
the
taste
somehow
they
capture
the
hoppy
flavor
without
the
face
squishing
bitterness
of
some
other
really
hoppy
beers
being
that
this
is
an
ipl
i
think
sam
adams
did
just
what
they
sat
out
to
do
with
this
one
it
is
a
very
smooth
very
drinkable
hoppy
ipa
l
beer
o
double
agent
ipl
is
a
good
piney
hopped
up
lager
very
concentrated
and
flavorful
all
the
while
sessionable
as
heck
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
by
june
2013
this
pours
a
clear
yellow
light
golden
color
with
a
large
off
white
head
the
smells
are
very
crisp
and
of
nice
grassy
and
floral
hops
a
very
nice
smelling
beer
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
mid
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
alight
crisp
grassy
and
hoppy
taste
this
is
a
very
good
lager
clear
tawny
color
with
white
head
that
leaves
sugary
lacing
hop
aroma
of
grass
mint
leaves
lemon
skin
soap
and
blood
orange
hops
are
in
the
forefront
in
flavor
grass
mint
leaves
lemon
skin
pine
towards
the
finish
bitter
but
clean
cereal
in
the
background
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
that
is
prickly
very
clean
hopforward
lager
that
makes
for
some
easy
drinkin
interesting
sessionable
and
enjoyable
very
refreshing
when
served
cold
as
shit
overall
it
is
ok
but
i
dont
need
a
six
pack
of
the
stuff
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
summer
ale
with
that
soapy
flavor
im
getting
out
of
it
crisp
mouthfeel
as
advertised
two
went
down
pretty
quickly
and
easily
well
done
sam
old
egg
this
ones
up
there
with
the
dear
old
noble
pils
which
ought
to
be
returned
to
the
12pack
format
too
meantime
thisll
do
very
nicely
while
it
lasts
o
straightforward
and
simple
but
its
well
done
hopefully
they
come
out
with
this
in
a
six
pack
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
copper
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
and
sticky
bone
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
and
sticks
itself
all
over
the
glass
on
the
way
down
smells
of
floral
pine
and
resin
in
spades
with
hints
of
bread
onion
and
garlic
wow
the
aroma
on
this
one
shocked
me
the
flavor
is
light
bready
and
caramel
malt
with
a
ton
of
hop
flavor
earth
pine
and
resinous
hop
flavors
tip
the
scale
heavily
to
the
hop
side
medium
body
with
a
medium
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
resinous
mouthfeel
this
is
nice
beer
i
was
quite
surprised
by
this
one
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
hop
bite
which
provides
some
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
lager
yeast
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
some
sticky
pine
needle
and
grassy
hop
notes
but
again
the
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
notes
are
undetectable
to
my
palate
caramel
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
bread
and
biscuit
really
disappointing
considering
what
i
was
expecting
the
idea
of
a
west
coast
style
hoppy
lager
is
intriguing
but
this
was
just
a
boring
lager
with
a
slightly
aggressive
one
dimensional
hop
profile
an
american
pale
lager
eh
yeah
this
is
the
tits
now
the
fun
part
i
get
to
rate
it
to
style
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
lager
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
lager
this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
wish
there
were
more
beers
like
this
being
made
these
days
it
combines
an
ipa
hoppiness
with
a
lager
drinkability
not
saying
ipas
arent
drinkable
but
a
lot
push
up
to
78
abv
well
done
a
pretty
decent
ipl
easy
to
drink
and
about
on
par
with
another
sam
adams
stand
out
noble
pils
minty
herbal
bitterness
up
front
some
citrus
tang
as
well
toasted
malts
come
on
but
soon
turn
crackery
with
notes
of
caramel
spicy
peppery
hop
flavors
accent
the
palate
herbal
resinous
bitterness
in
the
dry
finish
some
lingering
citrus
and
caramelcracker
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
feel
very
refreshing
and
appetizing
should
be
a
year
rounder
very
decent
would
definitely
have
again
o
ipa
flavor
with
the
smoothness
of
a
lager
not
bad
o
the
lagering
process
of
this
beer
mellows
out
the
hops
just
enough
for
them
to
still
rule
over
the
malts
and
breadiness
the
yeast
also
obviously
makes
it
different
from
an
ipa
but
this
is
one
solid
brew
i
wish
this
was
available
outside
of
the
spring
pack
heres
to
hoping
i
would
happily
buy
a
twelve
pack
of
this
next
time
im
in
the
grocery
store
ill
see
if
they
have
sixers
or
twelvskies
great
job
on
this
one
overall
its
not
bad
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
i
dont
really
like
hoppy
beers
but
my
friend
who
loves
ipa
and
similar
beer
absolutely
loves
this
one
for
my
preference
i
didnt
like
it
but
for
those
of
you
that
like
these
kinds
of
beer
it
seems
to
be
pretty
good
loved
the
aroma
though
overall
its
a
hoppy
lager
i
can
get
behind
that
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
am
extremely
pleased
with
it
make
this
a
6pack
offering
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
nice
example
of
the
style
it
was
a
hoppy
lager
just
as
promised
but
the
profile
seemed
to
lack
the
balance
i
wish
it
had
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
one
would
be
enough
since
i
would
get
tired
of
the
spicy
hops
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
just
how
it
should
be
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
spicy
hops
were
a
little
to
overpowering
if
the
spicy
and
citrus
hops
were
at
the
same
level
i
think
it
would
make
this
beer
much
more
enjoyable
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
i
would
much
rather
have
a
shift
from
new
belgium
that
beer
is
a
little
better
in
just
about
every
aspect
but
i
would
still
recommend
giving
it
a
try
all
in
all
i
thought
this
beer
was
solid
it
was
nice
for
what
it
is
i
am
happy
that
samuel
adams
took
a
shot
at
this
style
nice
work
guys
keep
being
creative
this
beer
is
a
completely
clear
pale
gold
color
the
foam
is
white
and
long
lasting
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
floral
herbal
and
woodysmelling
hops
grass
and
malt
are
ther
as
well
not
fruity
but
the
hops
do
have
a
touch
of
citric
in
the
background
nice
flavor
balanced
and
drinkable
nice
up
front
sweetness
and
malt
lots
of
hop
flavor
throughout
the
taste
medium
body
very
good
for
a
pale
lager
this
is
very
good
the
aroma
flavor
and
feel
are
all
top
notch
d
overall
a
pretty
good
new
brew
from
sam
adams
i
like
this
blend
of
styles
and
am
looking
forward
to
more
breweries
interpreting
this
style
super
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
sammy
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
head
retention
is
excellent
and
the
lacing
is
moderate
it
smells
of
piney
hops
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
subtle
malt
background
the
taste
comes
across
as
grapefruit
to
me
almost
entirely
the
malt
does
shine
through
at
moments
but
the
finish
is
definitely
pure
grapfruit
the
mouthfeel
in
light
and
crisp
with
light
prickly
carbonation
i
have
mentioned
in
previous
reviews
that
i
am
not
terribly
fond
of
samuel
adams
but
i
dont
have
any
serious
problems
drinking
this
beer
it
may
be
a
little
simple
as
far
as
flavor
and
taste
go
but
is
shines
brilliantly
with
its
bitter
hops
and
malty
highlights
mmmm
i
am
very
glad
that
this
is
in
the
spring
variety
pack
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
fairly
thick
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
pretty
faint
not
much
to
it
very
light
hop
notes
slight
sulfur
character
taste
is
fairly
bitter
with
no
truly
discernible
unique
hop
characteristics
maybe
a
slight
earthiness
definitely
got
the
flavor
of
a
lager
the
sulfur
character
carries
to
the
taste
medium
carbonation
and
light
body
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
disappointing
very
bland
with
the
character
of
a
poorly
executed
standard
lager
definitely
none
of
the
india
pale
character
you
may
be
expecting
i
will
not
be
having
this
beer
again
overall
a
tasty
hop
forward
lager
a
good
brew
probably
a
hair
lighter
than
some
of
the
other
all
malt
lagers
out
there

i
like
it
might
be
a
good
alternative
to
the
boston
lager
for
those
who
find
that
polarizing
i
dont
though
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
after
looking
at
the
label
after
i
rated
it
thought
it
was
an
ipa
but
apparently
its
an
ipalager
hybrid
beer
advocate
calls
it
an
american
pale
lager
either
way
ill
be
having
this
again
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
in
this
classification
as
i
have
had
not
a
great
beer
but
for
a
pale
lager
o
i
think
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
twist
on
an
ipa
nobody
does
innovation
like
sam
adams
thats
for
sure
this
can
be
a
great
any
occasion
beer
for
standard
macro
beer
drinkers
and
craft
beer
enthusiasts
alike
double
agent
ipl
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
very
nice

there
is
a
strong
hoppy

aroma
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
good
floral
notes
but
not
overerly
bitter
with
a
good
solid
malty
backbone
good
full
and
crisp
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
beer
the
hops
dont
make
this
beer
but
instead
add
on
to
it
double
agent
ipl
is
just
the
new
beer
samuel
adams
needed
its
a
unique
yearround
offering
for
most
of
the
country
and
has
enough
hops
to
satisfy
a
hop
head
like
me
with
a
very
low
abv
the
hop
profile
is
actually
rather
reminiscent
of
laguntiass
daytime
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sam
adams
because
i
prefer
my
beers
to
be
less
balanced
and
more
hop
forward
sa
has
stepped
out
of
the
box
on
this
one
and
hopped
it
to
high
heaven
i
would
say
next
to
the
hallertau
imperial
pils
they
brewed
years
ago
this
is
the
next
hoppiest
beer
ive
ever
had
from
them
nicely
done
and
with
an
abv
of
only
5
i
can
easily
get
my
hop
fix
and
not
worry
about
losing
my
wits
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
for
the
hop
lovers
i
can
see
the
reviews
being
all
over
the
board
on
this
one
as
it
deviates
from
the
typical
balanced
beers
they
tend
to
brew

flavor
with

medium
in

not
bad
a
good
hop
bomb
overall
hoppy
lagers
have
existed
in
europe
for
centuries
and
if
it
takes
the
india
label
to
make
the
product
marketable
so
be
it
a
nice
alternative
to
the
standard
flagship
and
also
hopped
up
boston

im
onboard
with
this
more
hoppy

please
id
like
to
see

a

beer
a

about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
named
supper
club
the
not
bad
motto
as
others
have
said
is
apt
i
will
say
that
i
disagree
with
the
reviews
that
state
that
one
is
better
off
going
with
a
cheaper
domestic
this
beer
is
definitely
of
a
higher
quality
although
i
will
agree
a
bit
pricey
for
such
a
simple
offering
its
better
than
most
mass
produced
domestic
its
a
decent
craft
lager
craft
brewers
dont
normally
make
a
lager
beer
so
its
nice
to
try
it
not
bad
and
would
recommend
to
someone
to
try
in
my
opinion
i
believe
this
beer
to
have
a
wider
appeal
to
regular
beer
drinker
unless
they
live
and
die
by
light
beer
if
you
get
a
chance
to
purchase
it
pickup
a
6
pack
it
also
comes
in
12
pack
of
12oz
cans
overall
if
i
lived
in
the
area
this
stuff
comes
from
this
would
be
the
beer
id
want
to
bring
with
me
in
a
cooler
to
go
out
camping
or
fishing
rather
than
to
drink
at
home
or
try
and
pair
with
anything
its
like
baby
bears
porridge
not
too
much
of
anything
not
too
little
its
juuust
right
but
in
the
end
its
still
just
porridge
this
beer
is
a
decent
representation
of
a
style
of
beer
i
dont
normally
care
for
it
is
better
than
most
other
lagers
on
the
market
but
doesnt
approach
the
artisan
level
of
some
of
the
better
craft
brewed
lagers
its
okay
overall
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
sample
the
brewerys
lake
house
was
better
imo
as
it
states
on
the
label
not
bad
but
not
particularly
very
good
either
it
is
easy
enough
to
drink
a
few
though
a
classic
beer
in
many

9

will
keep
me
from
being
a
regular
purchaser
but
i
give
it
all
the
credit
for
what
it
is
and
doing
a
very
good
job
at
capturing
the
aura
of
an
era
beer
is
light
in
body
somewhat
watery
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
that
foams
this
up
on
the
palate
somewhat
creating
a
mouthfeel
that
is
at
first
mildly
fizzy
and
then
foamy
and
watery
around
the
edges
does
not
close
very
dry
minor
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
after
a
sip
o
nothing
fancy
here
reminiscent
of
any
run
of
the
mill
macro
lager
with
a
tad
more
on
the
flavour
profile
i
suspect
thats
what
they
were
aiming
for
on
this
brew
but
its
not
a
brew
to
write
home
about
nothing
fancy
but
certainly
not
terrible
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
pairs
well
with
any
meal
and
could
easily
be
a
session
brew
on
a
night
of
heavy
drinking
o
the
label
says
it
all
overall
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
furthermore
i
have
never
really
found
a
pale
lager
that
i
truly
liked
i
do
not
think
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
quite
frankly
i
think
i
may
avoid
this
style
in
general
from
now
on
o
it
has
been
said
before
not
bad
not
bad
for
the
style
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
dull
their
motto
is
apt
not
bad
supper
club
pours
a
straw
yellow
no
head
and
alot
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
offensive
and
does
have
sweet
banana
like
smell
mixed
in
the
taste
is
mellow
a
bit
sweet
has
some
banana
and
tropical
fruit
notes
rather
light
in
flavor
but
not
too
bad
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
kinda
interesting
and
the
most
important
part
the
taste
is
not
bad
o
pretty
solid
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
great
rendition
of
a
not
so
great
style
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
lighter
beer
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
easy
drinking
but
it
is
a
mediocre
beer
at
best
do
this
pale
lager
portrays
a
malt
focus
that
is
well
established
yet
fails
to
elevate
the
product
out
of
mediocrity
flavors
have
little
opportunity
to
become
established
before
textural
acidity
becomes
distracting
in
a
style
that
does
not
demand
much
respect
this
beer
would
be
better
served
by
setting
out
to
exceed
the
about
as
expected
reaction
by
its
drinker
for
a
pale
lager
this
packs
plenty
of
flavor
enjoying
the
apple
biscuit
dough
flavors
crisp
finish
thirst
quenching
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
i
still
dont
really
get
the
concept
of
supper
clubs
even
after
having
it
explained
to
me
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
an
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
biscuit
bread
yeast
very
light
corn
and
a
touch
of
powdered
sugar
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
with
more
bread
more
powdered
sugar
and
a
bit
of
banana
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dusty
sorta
creamy
feel
overall
nothing
earthshattering
but
a
nice
easydrinking
simple
brew
not
bad
itsa
perfect
clear
dark
yellow
very
little
head
or
lace
the
aroma
is
missing
and
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
hint
of
yeast
which
almost
makes
it
interesting
why
this
cost
a
little
more
than
the
other
stuff
at
the
bar
is
really
a
mystery
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
light
head
aroma
mainly
malt
forward
cereal
and
a
hint
of
pearplum
tastes
like
a
straight
foward
lager
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
malty
with
typical
cereal
yeasty
flavors
and
some
mineral
notes
mainly
iron
light
on
the
mouth
wet
finishes
clean
leaves
a
slight
tingle
and
bitterness
on
the
tongue
fairly
drinkable
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
otherwise
passable
d
not
bad
this
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
but
it
has
a
nice
thick
malt
character
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
whole
sixpack
of
it
i
thought
it
was
decent
as
far
as
lagers
go
and
will
definitely
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
as
a
side
note
i
am
amused
by
the
prominent
words
not
bad
which
appear
on
the
label
art
margin
next
to
the
product
name
how
many
foodstuffs
do
you
come
across
which
choose
to
advertise
the
idea
of
not
bad
instead
of
were
the
best
o
quite
nice
easily
quaffable
i
will
have
it
again
o
better
than
the
mass
produced
lagers
that
give
me
a
headache
after
just
one
or
two
its
pretty
good
and
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
on
occasion
othis
is
a
nice
lager
as
with
most
capital
brews
it
is
well
done
but
in
my
opinion
if
youre
going
to
have
a
lagerwhy
bother
spending
the
extra
money
for
this
one
and
just
get
one
of
the
cheap
domestics
this
one
isnt
that
much
different
i
doubt
that
many
people
could
distinguish
this
from
mgd
drinkability
fine
decent
enough
to
finish
a
bottle
but
i
probably
wont
not

to

straight

i
could

from

i
have
had
this
once
and
it
was
the
definition
of
a
skunky
beer
i
cant
speak
for
how
this
normally
tastes
but
what
i
had
was
definitely
beer
gone
bad
never
had
it
thought
id
try
it
its
a
beer
this
shouldnt
even
be
brewed
gross
canadian
garbage
tastes
gross
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
this
stuff
is
tasty
not
expensive
and
has
a
great
overall
taste
and
feel
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
a
good
lager
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
good
skunky
beer
first
few
sips
are
a
little
much
but
it
tones
down
as
far
as
basic
and

north

lagers
go
this
as
close

you
will

go

barest

buy
this
when

otherwise
you
will
get
some
nasty
beer
its
not
a
bad
bbq
beer
tastes
exactly
like
you
would
expect
from
the
canadians
yuengling
its
slightly
more
flavorful
than
labatts
or
kokanee
good
stuff
o
not
a
terrible
macro
lager
but
not
something
to
go
back
to
nothing
special
but
a
solid
beer
this
is
a
rock
solid
alternative
to
macro
lagers
proudly
independent
for
as
long
as
canada
has
been
a
nation
moosehead
deserves
a
pat
on
the
back
and
a
wisers
slow
clap
for
sticking
with
a
winning
formula
this
beer
reminds
me
of
henry
weinhards
blue
boar
ale
and
brings
back
great
memories
in
short
its
a
nicely
hopped
lager
that
smells
like
a
canoe
cooler
on
a
hot
day
its
easy
to
down
several
of
these
in
hurry
be
forewarned
i
always
liked
moosehead
although
i
havent
had
one
in
years
nice
body
flavor
balance
and
finish
make
this
a
solid
and
easy
to
drink
beer
kind
of
sweetish
finish
clean
easy
to
like
very
respectable
but
there
are
other
brews
more
interesting
these
days
definitely
born
of
the
80s
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
no
there
is
not
enough
for
me
to
recommend
it
it
is
not
a
easy
drinking
beer
a
bit
disappointed
there
is
something
that
this
beer
is
missing
even
the
grolsch
premium
lager
is
much
better
than
this
one
good
stuff
faint
skunk
taste
with
heavy
corn
undertones
this
is
one
of
my
dads
favorite
brews
so
naturally
i
have
consumed
my
share
of
it
my
issue
with
it
is
the
green
bottle
so
when
it
shows
up
in
the
states
even
in
the
northeast
it
often
has
that
green
bottle
skunk
to
it
really
frustrating
because
this
can
be
quite
nice
when
its
fresh
the
color
is
clear
straw
colored
richer
than
other
yellow
lagers
and
although
the
head
fades
fast
its
tall
and
bone
white
the
nose
often
has
a
skunk
on
it
but
shows
a
pale
and
pils
malt
base
thats
quite
light
and
the
cleanness
of
patient
lagering
the
flavor
actually
has
some
hops
to
it
too
a
lot
more
than
other
american
takes
on
the
style
its
clean
drinking
beer
very
refreshing
and
has
a
unique
malt
flavor
that
sets
it
apart
from
its
peers
the
handling
and
packaging
of
it
are
extremely
problematic
but
when
once
in
awhile
a
fresh
sixer
is
found
it
can
be
tremendously
refreshing
it
is
occasionally
proof
that
cheap
yellow
beer
can
be
delicious
orders
of
magnitude
better
than
the

i
was
able
to
procure
this
beer
at
feldmans
market
in
mcallen
texas
o
my
first
swallow
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
regional
premiums
from
my
early
beer
days
augsburger
berghoff
even
andeker
this
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
as
they
call
them
not
offensive
in
any
way
easy
to
gulp
down
but
just
not
that
interesting
that
id
want
to
drink
it
all
night
in
fact
the
very
grainy
finish
starts
to
fatigue
after
a
while
and
i
start
to
crave
richer
barley
malt
sorry
stahl
this
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
german
imports
i
can
get
even
if
they
arent
independent
nice
and
drinkable
overall
a
fine
beer
with
that
is
an
easy
daily
drinker
this
used
to
be
my
beer
of
choice
before
i
really
started
looking
for
new
things
i
thought
then
when
i
revisited
it
i
would
rate
it
significantly
lower
while
this
has
occurred
to
a
certain
extent
it
still
holds
up
over
time
and
isnt
like
to
suffer
the
drop
upon
rereview
that
many
aals
will
a
solid
choice
that
is
extremely
accessible
and
superior
to
a
lot
of
the
macro
beer
available
in
canada
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
isnt
overly
malty
or
sweet
although
it
came
in
a
green
bottle
no
skunk
is
perceptible
this
is
the
first
i
have
tasted
moosehead
lager
in
over
20
years
it
does
bring
back
memories
i
received
a
case
for
christmas
from
my
brotherinlaw
and
decided
to
give
it
a
test
run
tonight
i
am
not
disappointed
i
think
it
is
much
better
than
the
big
3
lagers
o
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
which
i
foolishly
assumed
was
similar
to
bud
etc
wrong
this
is
a
quality
beer
with
all
the
flavor
it
might
just
need
some
carapils
for
mouthfeel
but
does
tastesmells
great
must
be
made
with
a

overall
i
cant
rate
this

is

this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
canadian
cult
classic
but
i
am
only
trying
it
now
happened
to
be
a
few
kicking
around
at
last
nights
house
party
and
it
was
early
enough
in
the
evening
to
actually
focus
on
the
characteristics
and
produce
an
acceptable
review
aroma
was
fairly
fresh
sweet
grains
some
fruity
citrus
esters
maybe
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
more
pleasant
than
expected
considering
the
green
bottle
i
did
not
get
much
skunk
presumably
thanks
to
this
example
being
fairly
fresh
and
properly
handled
palate
was
a
bit
interesting
there
was
too
much
fizz
way
too
much
but
there
was
also
quite
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
a
little
peach
a
whiff
of
floral
vanilla
a
lot
of
esters
for
a
lager
and
these
added
something
to
the
pedestrian
sweetish
lager
malt
backbone
hops
are
buried
deep
not
really
tasting
them
at
all
finish
was
sweetish
but
reasonably
clean
few
obvious
faults
although
things
were
a
tad
medicinal
and
this
combined
with
the
aforementioned
lemon
notes
made
me
think
of
cold
medicine
like
neocitran
or
something
of
that
ilk
still
surprisingly
unskunky
and
with
some
fresh
sweet
character
than
would
make
me
sample
again
particularly
if
the
other
options
are
the
adjunct
lager
standards
that
usually
appear
at
parties
looking
at
you
lucky
lager
if
i
were
to
be
honest
about
it
the
smell
and
taste
rating
should
have
been
0
but
ive
had
the
beer
before
and
i
know
that
it
isnt
really
that
bad
overall
much
better
than
i
expected
actually
kind
of
liked
it
you
get
more
than
what
you
pay
for
with
this
one
i
do
like
this
beer
and
i
do
think
ill
have
another
i
know
labatt
and
molson
are
not
upscale
beers
with
wholesome
flavors
but
i
think
both
are
preferable
to
moosehead
lager
i
buy
macro
two
or
three
times
a
year
tops
and
moosehead
along
with
labatt
50
and
molson
stock
ale
plus
the
even
better
moose
red
remains
my
swill
of
choice
call
me
a
sentimental
canadian
but
id
say
this
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
moosehead
is
a
solid
beer
for
a
warmer
day
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
scent
carried
grain
and
faint
alcohol
the
taste
was
a
decent
balance
between
malt
and
bittering
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
its
ok
and
easy
to
drink
i
grab
a
case
of
this
from
time
to
time
partly
cause
im
a
good
canadian
like
that
but
also
because
its
just
a
simple
refreshing
but
well
made
beer
this
is
one
of
the
canadian
beers
to
start
with
if
youre
going
to
try
our
beer
for
the
first
time
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
sugary
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
here
moosehead
has
a
phenomenal
taste
easily
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
it
has
a
very
pleasing
feel
in
your
mouth
and
is
good
year
round
the
price
is
decent
too
i
have
found
it
for
around
11
99
for
a
12
pack
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
then
something
is
wrong
with
you
the
taste
is
lackluster
for
me
malty
entry
with
stale
grain
and
slightly
sweet
cereallike
quality
with
low
spice
and
mild
creaminess
with
light
smoothness
of
diacetyl
and
husky
grainy
taste
as
it
finishes
semidry
overall
i
could
probably
find
a
better
lager
maybe
just
a
tad
above
most
mass
produced
pale
lagers
there
is
a
mild
herbal
hop
in
this
that
i
like
o
i
really
cant
understand
how
this
beer
consistently
gets
decent
ratings
every
single
one
ive
ever
had
from
a
bottle
has
been
skunky
i
cannot
understand
green
bottles
ive
had
it
on
draft
and
its
decent
then
but
green
bottles
no
thank
you
d
for
what
it
is
not
bad
that
said
it
is
on
the
lacking
side
of
taste
and
aroma
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
was
your
normal
everyday
looking
beer
it
puts
w
thing
but
white
and
foamy
head
with
no
staying
power
smell
was
typical
as
well
highly
car
instead
with
a
watery
taste
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
overall
i
scored
it
a
little
above
average
because
of
the
distinct
hint
of
sweetness
to
the
beer
not
sure
what
it
was
but
i
liked
it
o
probably
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
aal
style
with
slightly
more
flavor
than
i
expected
and
not
quite
as
thin
or
watery
as
most
i
remember
as
a
child
thinking
that
moosehead
was
some
kind
of
fancy
import
beer
man
times
have
changed
o
this
isnt
my
style
but
its
one
if
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
its
very
clean
and
theres
not
much
too
it
but
the
taste
isnt
offputing
like
many
others
of
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
lousy
beer
dont
know
if
its
cheap
but
tastes
like
it
should
be
around
3
a
6pk
a
pretty
good
lager
a
definite
goto
cheers
o
overall
a
step
above
your
average
run
of
the
mill
mass
produced
beer
i
actually
like
this
more
than
any
cheap
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
for
a
party
this
is
the
best
beer
to
drink
any
time
of
the
year
it
is
a
true
goto
for
any
occasion
great
for
the
cottage
or
even
when
youre
skiing
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
lager
it
has
a
great
mix
of
hops
and
malts
to
provide
a
drinkable
and
tasty
beverage
it
is
the
true
canadian
beer
owned
and
brewed
by
canadians
and
canadians
have
been
enjoying
it
since
confederation
i
pour
2
at
a
time
into
a
big
tumbler
i
sprinkle
a
little
seasalt
in
for
a
bit
of
zest
and
less
trips
to
the
toilet
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
example
of
a
golden
lager
moosehead
fits
the
bill
great
golden
coler
with
good
foam
retention
on
draft
this
beer
has
a
nice
malty
finish
to
go
along
with
the
lager
taste
fresh
scent
when
first
poured
the
beer
is
best
when
served
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
for
pairings
this
beer
does
well
with
fresh
seafood
as
it
comes
from
the
east
coast
of
canada
because
of
the
green
bottle
it
is
very
sensitive
to
light
so
in
order
to
avoid
it
being
light
struck
protect
it
from
light
as
much
as
possible
i
enjoy
it
with
a
slice
of
lime
as
well
its
very
smooth
but
full
bodied
not
over
the
top
with
hoppiness
much
easier
to
drink
a
perfect
beer
to
have
after
a
long
day
of
work
it
has
a
nice
golden
color
and
is
very
smooth
on
the
way
down
it
is
not
a
highly
alcoholic
drink
but
as
far
as
lagers
go
it
does
have
a
nice
kick
without
being
too
much
to
enjoy
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
full
body
and
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
a
comfortable
lager
beer
with
a
nice
golden
colour
not
too
heavy
and
easy
to
drink
has
more
of
the
actual
beer
taste
i
am
after
when
i
drink
a
non
amber
lager
i
find
moosehead
lager
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
it
uses
100
canadian
barley
malt
i
also
like
the
fact
that
this
brand
is
still
canadian
owned
and
privately
operated
the
green
bottle
certainly
distinguishes
this
iconic
canadian
brand
apart
from
its
competition
best
served
chilled
resulting
in
a
crisp
lager
taste
with
a
nice
soft
clean
finish
great
summer
time
beer
particularly
when
grilling
lighter
cuisine
highly
drinkable
have
been
enjoying
moosehead
for
years
very
happy
when
it
came
out
in
a
light
version
i
find
it
flavorful
no
after
taste
and
it
smells
good
make
sure
it
is
really
cold
goes
great
with
everything
especially
steak
mix
it
with
clamato
juice
5050
fry
up
some
hashbrowns
eggs
and
steak
or
ham
and
you
have
an
awesome
saturday
morning
breakfast
a
classic
style
lager
with
a
hint
of
the
noble
hallertau
hop
rich
mouth
feel
and
refreshing
taste
golden
staw
colour
with
a
creamy
white
froth
finishes
slightly
sweet
with
very
little
aftertaste
the
bottom
of
the
pint
has
you
craving
for
the
next
pint
i
bought
a
12
pack
for
a
party
i
was
hosting
hoping
my
friends
would
be
as
nostalgic
as
i
was
and
enjoy
pounding
these
beers
and
thinking
about
when
we
first
had
them
in
the
mid80s
they
were
a
hit
and
most
were
downed
except
this
one
used
for
the
review
the
taste
is
always
average
but
its
a
solid
beer
and
a
classic
lager
that
is
always
enjoyable
o
aside
from
the
skunky
nose
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
ive
had
worse
in
the
style
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
but
you
could
do
worse
i
thought
the
beer
would
be
kinda
harsh
actually
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
now
it
really
is
a
refreshing
lager
be
perfect
for
the
summer
doing
yard
work
overall
a
real
good
beer
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
you
would
expect
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
smell
but
the
first
drink
is
just
as
refreshing
as
the
last
a
midyellow
in
color
this
beer
has
a
strong
scent
of
hops
but
the
taste
is
not
that
strong
you
expect
it
to
be
somewhat
harsh
but
this
beer
is
so
smoothe
that
there
is
no
harshness
found
very
balanced
in
elements
i
wouldnt
classify
this
as
sweet
or
dry
bitter
or
bland
this
beer
is
just
downright
smoothe
best
just
sitting
on
the
couch
and
relaxing
overall
moosehead
lager
is
very
drinkable
i
prefer
this
over
the
bmc
but
thats
not
saying
a
whole
lot
the
few
sparing
notes
of
interest
seal
the
deal
3
0
o
this
is
my
first
experience
with
moosehead
and
i
am
not
disappointed
because
its
great
for
what
i
got
it
for
sipping
while
doing
some
yardwork
in
the
85
degree
alabama
spring
this
is
a
very
good
albeit
somewhat
light
lager
35
o
classic
lager
flavours
though
still
rather
mild
nothing
spectacular
but
easily
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
clean
beer
that
is
not
filling
with
some
taste
drinkability
a
pleasant
surprise
though
itd
be
way
more
sessionable
out
of
a
can
moosehead
lager
is
my
favorite
canadian
beer
and
one
of
my
top
lager
choices
i
consider
it
to
be
an
adjunct
since
i
believe
corn
is
used
in
the
recipe
but
not
sure
mooseheads
bottling
means
6
packs
are
prone
to
skunkiness
therefore
stick
with
12
packs
it
is
brewed
only
150
miles
away
so
it
always
seems
fresh
and
enjoyable
here
appearance
is
golden
with
limited
head
that
fades
away
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
floral
overtones
some
maltgrain
the
taste
has
a
very
nice
blend
of
distinct
hop
bite
and
crisp
lager
flavor
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
mooshead
seems
to
be
the
only
canadian
brewer
that
still
tastes
like
i
remember
from
20
years
ago
overall
45
i
had
little
expectations
for
this
beer
but
was
surprised
to
find
it
somewhat
refreshing
and
while
not
my
style
certainly
workable
this
beer
to
me
is
good
for
what
it
is
style
wise
it
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
it
is
certainly
one
that
you
could
session
all
night
long
and
not
get
sick
of
the
flavor
it
has
just
enough
to
it
it
going
on
that
it
is
enjoyable
to
me
as
compared
to
many
regular
adjunct
lagers
that
i
find
to
be
extremely
undrinkable
is
it
complex
no
but
it
is
it
refreshing
and
drinkable
yes
could
take
place
as
occasional
go
to
when
looking
for
easy
drinking
lager
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
go4111215
sampled
on
february
27
2012
too
bad
i
can
only
get
it
in
the
green
bottle
in
my
area
because
it
inevitably
comes
off
as
skunked
the
pour
is
pale
to
golden
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
trying
to
block
the
skunkiness
out
of
my
mind
i
can
get
a
solid
malty
scent
on
the
nose
and
some
crisp
clean
but
vague
hop
esthers
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
average
for
the
style
the
taste
also
has
a
creamy
maltiness
to
it
with
a
bitter
hop
bite
playing
tag
on
the
end
in
the
1980s
this
was
a
beer
i
drank
quite
often
times
and
tastes
change
but
it
still
is
a
halfway
decent
canadian
pale
lager
on
occasion
overall
a
decent
beer
that
really
just
tastes
like
an
above
average
aal
corny
and
refreshing
poured
a
2
white
soap
suds
head
fading
pretty
fast
the
color
is
standard
bmc
clear
straw
yellow
and
continues
postpour
with
a
decent
amount
of
effervescence
it
smells
like
grass
and
corn
taste
is
against
standard
bmc
but
its
decent
theres
not
much
of
a
finish
yes
a
thoroughly
average
and
boring
mainstream
beer
but
theres
nothing
actually
wrong
with
it
you
could
substitute
for
any
bmc
this
used
to
be
my
go
to
canadian
lager
it
is
better
than
canadian
blue
and
other
macro
canadian
lagers
however
after
expanding
my
lager
horizons
so
to
speak
sam
adams
boston
lager
is
significantly
better
and
costs
only
slightly
more
suprisingly
pabst
blue
ribbon
is
slightly
better
costs
significantly
less
id
say
that
it
is
a
middleoftheroad
goto
beer
if
you
are
unsure
at
a
bar
drink
well
my
boss
tried
i
dont
work
with
beer
drinkers
so
i
got
stuck
with
this
one
wont
be
coming
back
to
it
odanother
lager
that
came
at
a
good
deal
a
good
beer
for
someone
whos
looking
to
get
drunk
and
doesnt
want
to
go
down
the
bud
light
path
i
will
have
to
say
moosehead
beer
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
i
usually
drink
dark
beers
but
moosehead
can
hold
its
own
dont
let
its
lite
complexion
detour
you
mooshead
is
full
of
flavor
it
has
the
strong
american
lager
taste
with
a
hint
of
a
philsner
after
taste
very
smooth
with
little
bite
the
canadians
did
something
right
when
the
made
this
brew
pour
a
little
on
you
steak
as
you
grill
the
philsner
taste
will
give
your
ribeye
the
extra
edge
you
have
been
looking
for
either
way
i
always
figured
it
was
better
to
drink
moosehead
than
it
is
to
give
it
a
pleasant
inexpensive
surprise
for
its
price
this
is
a
very
good
lager
my
first
impression
was
of
a
lighter
german
style
beer
maybe
edging
toward
reinheitsgebot
varieties
i
assume
it
competes
with
rolling
rock
and
for
my
money
has
a
bit
more
character
and
flavor
per
overall
i
think
it
is
a
crisp
refreshing
brew
and
i
would
wholeheartedly
recommend
it
as
a
beer
to
go
with
a
weeknight
dinner
overall
overall
the
beer
is
kinda
flat
has
some
grassy
and
nutty
flavors
that
entwine
with
a
very
light
weight
light
colored
lager
o
in
my
opinion
vastly
superior
to
its
main
canadian
competitors
great
beer
if
you
need
something
to
go
the
distance
with
on
a
long
winter
night
of
hockey
watching
and
hot
tubbing
simple
yet
hard
to
get
sick
of
pours
a
fizzy
straw
yellow
light
haze
quick
plume
of
head
gone
quickly
scent
is
pale
with
a
hint
of
lightly
sweet
malt
taste
again
is
light
and
pale
with
some
splashes
of
clean
malt
and
fresh
grain
the
best
thing
this
brew
has
going
for
it
is
no
off
notes
light
bodied
bubbly
clean
and
crisp
a
decent
alternative
to
the
bmcs
of
the
world
o
not
the
worst
lager
but
its
meh
im
not
a
fan
of
the
skunk
that
follows
into
the
mouth
i
dont
have
much
to
say
but
its
not
something
to
yearn
for
o
i
generally
dont
care
for
beers
of
this
style
but
i
do
have
a
big
soft
spot
for
moosehead
its
cheap
readily
available
and
consistently
solid
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
honestly
are
you
expecting
it
to
quite
good
for
what
it
is
overall
i
think
i
prefer
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
ive
had
it
out
of
a
can
recently
and
it
seemed
to
have
a
little
more
taste
from
the
bottle
probably
just
my
imagination
anyways
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
still
just
another
drinkable
but
forgettable
lager
o
a
good
pale
lager
one
of
the
better
ones
but
not
world
changing
not
a
material
but
very
respectable
for
its
price
its
very
easy
going
down
and
very
crisp
and
refreshing
does
not
leave
a
strong
after
taste
or
skunky
flavour
im
happy
i
tried
this
beer
and
ill
be
buying
it
again
the
lack
of
bite
after
swallowing
it
is
the
part
that
i
enjoy
the
most
very
drinkable
but
void
of
any
real
flavor
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
in
canada
on
tap
i
really
enjoyed
it
given
the
style
i
wish
it
was
available
on
tap
at
more
bars
also
i
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
in
cans
this
beer
is
my
favorite
by
far
for
only
8
for
a
12
pk
of
bottles
you
can
not
go
wrong
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
no
skunky
or
bitter
after
taste
and
just
all
around
in
my
opinion
the
best
beer
i
am
sure
many
will
not
agree
with
me
on
this
and
i
respect
that
but
this
is
just
my
opinion
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
on
it
there
is
no
lacing
on
brew
the
smell
of
grains
a
malts
on
the
nose
with
the
slight
hop
aroma
in
there
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
crisp
and
had
a
sharp
hop
character
to
it
with
some
sweet
grainy
malts
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
simple
overall
like
i
said
before
if
i
had
to
pick
a
lager
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
probably
be
in
the
top
5
pale
straw
yellow
colour
with
an
airy
white
head
that
struggles
and
quickly
fails
to
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
typical
bmc
lager
smell
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
subtle
hint
of
wet
cardboard
crisp
and
clean
but
its
a
struggle
to
point
out
actual
flavours
in
the
beer
some
sweet
grainy
malt
with
little
to
no
hop
flavour
or
bitterness
thin
body
and
highly
carbed
very
easy
drinking
its
no
surprise
this
was
one
of
my
gotos
when
i
first
became
of
age
not
all
that
pleasant
but
not
offensive
it
seems
like
a
great
option
for
my
19
year
old
self
a
very
good
lager
for
what
it
is
the
appearance
and
smell
are
similar
to
any
americancanadian
lager
nothing
special
the
taste
is
actually
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
whether
it
be
the
winter
or
summer
i
can
always
go
back
to
this
beer
and
be
satisfied
when
finished
a
simple
beer
from
start
to
finish
but
a
delicious
beer
that
hits
the
spot
nonetheless
o
this
is
definitely
my
favourite
canadian
macro
lager
its
on
par
with
others
in
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
but
it
has
a
much
better
more
distinctive
taste
final
grade
3
25
a
c
overall
i
buy
cases
of
this
stuff
and
for
about
1beer
like
it
is
here
in
pennsylvania
i
say
its
a
fair
price
for
the
quality
of
beer
you
get
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fizzles
out
rather
quickly
not
much
in
the
smell
other
than
skunk
and
some
light
malts
about
the
same
in
the
taste
stale
malts
and
lots
of
skunk
fizzy
and
weak
light
bodied
and
none
to
drinkable
please
avoid
prost
o
nothing
remarkable
but
a
good
alternative
to
your
standard
macrobrew
light
refreshing
well
carbonated
a
pretty
good
offering
from
a
major
o
awesome
cookout
beer
great
change
from
bmc
garbage
oh
canada
you
make
some
great
beer
m
pleasant
and
drinkable
refreshing
when
cold
good
summer
and
hottime
beer
worthy
of
being
a
house
staple
or
for
making
radler
overall
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
better
than
labatt
not
quite
as
good
as
molson
o
average
drinking
if
you
get
one
that
is
not
too
badly
skunked
always
a
crap
shoot
with
this
beer
it
seems
d
a
much
better
option
to
bmc
ill
pick
it
up
again
to
have
some
on
stand
by
for
a
barbecue
or
when
company
comes
over
good
clean
taste
and
very
refreshing
making
this
my
common
beer
cheers
i
hate
to
see
bad
reviews
for
this
its
obviously
better
than
stella
artois
so
the
smell
aint
the
best
youre
drinking
a
lager
not
much
characteristics
in
them
despite
what
people
say
this
and
molson
taste
way
better
than
what
most
people
by
for
the
fridge
or
a
gathering
personally
i
like
ales
for
session
but
i
have
no
problem
making
this
a
goto
lager
give
it
a
try
you
wont
be
sorry
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
regularly
buy
the
twelve
packs
because
they
are
cheap
and
sometimes
they
have
collectible
bottle
openers
this
beer
is
your
standard
light
and
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
overcarbonated
and
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
taste
it
is
extremely
refreshing
and
crisp
not
one
of
my
favorites
there
are
many
other
lagers
that
are
very
more
interesting
than
this
one
from
notes
pours
a
light
straw
color
high
carbonation
small
white
head
that
goes
to
nothing
but
a
ring
slight
grassy
hop
smells
mingled
with
sweet
boiled
grains
sharp
start
mediumlight
body
with
a
clean
balanced
finish
better
balanced
in
malt
sweetness
and
hop
astringency
than
most
commercial
lagers
but
still
average
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavours
and
aromas
its
definitly
a
good
summer
beer
d
one
of
my
least
favorite
macrocanadian
beers
if
the
taste
and
odor
werent
so
below
average
i
could
down
a
case
in
a
heartbeart
if
you
want
good
canadian
macro
check
out
labatt
and
molson
for
me
this
might
me
my
go
to
beer
for
my
non
craft
beer
drinking
friends
its
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
if
not
for
the
smell
id
probably
really
like
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
generic
beer
to
me
i
enjoyed
the
six
pack
i
purchased
and
actually
think
it
tastes
better
straight
from
the
bottle
i
actually
liked
its
over
carbonation
it
at
least
made
it
a
little
different
from
other
beers
supremely
skunky
brew
more
flavor
than
bud
or
coors
maybe
skunkier
because
im
down
here
in
texas
i
like
that
though
i
think
this
is
darn
good
beer
crisp
and
very
enjoyable
to
drink
nice
labeling
attractive
green
bottle
it
reminds
me
of
something
i
think
mickeys
malt
liquor
lol
maybe
not
just
bought
a
six
pack
and
this
is
the
first
moosehead
ive
ever
drank
six
packs
are
the
dumbest
invention
beer
should
not
be
sold
in
packaging
of
less
than
12
bye
nice
and
light
golden
color
to
the
pour
with
a
whispy
thin
head
that
somehow
managed
to
hang
around
for
quite
some
time
with
minimal
lacing
lots
of
stray
carbs
running
up
to
the
top
of
the
brew
seeking
escape
it
has
a
very
sweet
malty
and
rag
weedish
aroma
to
it
sort
of
skunky
but
in
a
good
way
there
could
be
some
faint
hop
aromas
amidst
the
rag
weed
but
it
is
hard
to
differentiate
this
beer
smells
like
what
i
considered
beer
to
smell
like
growing
up
as
a
young
lad
as
for
the
taste
the
base
malt
profile
slams
your
palate
at
first
with
a
slightly
sweettangy
and
bready
barrage
to
the
tastebuds
followed
by
a
hint
of
citrus
although
very
faint
as
the
brew
makes
its
way
down
there
is
a
slight
shortlived
hop
bitterness
quickly
followed
by
an
immense
amount
of
carbonation
that
brings
a
moderate
burn
to
the
back
of
the
throat
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
to
mellow
things
out
with
that
being
said
this
is
a
great
session
beer
when
you
are
looking
for
something
with
a
little
more
body
and
character
than
your
average
go
to
cheap
brew
not
too
much
going
on
overall
but
a
solid
lager
in
my
opinion
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
cap
that
disappeared
quickly
floral
sulfury
hop
aroma
with
some
sweet
cereal
grains
low
bitterness
a
bit
lemony
in
flavour
with
mild
malt
sweetness
acidic
slightly
spicy
the
carbonation
was
coarse
partly
due
to
the
light
body
on
the
dry
side
overall
though
not
bad
compared
to
other
national
brands
rjt
on
tap
at
mikes
rehearsal
dinner
poured
into
a
pint
glass
piss
colored
with
very
little
carbonation
the
aroma
and
taste
are
both
skunk
and
lots
of
it
i
can
pull
a
little
grain
and
corn
but
nothing
good
i
try
to
drink
this
and
i
could
only
drink
about
half
of
this
this
is
not
very
good
or
worth
trying
after
all
is
said
and
done
my
opinion
of
this
beer
remains
favorable
it
withstood
an
honest
beer
review
and
will
remain
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
it
really
has
no
flaws
unlike
several
beers
of
its
genre
excellent
for
sessioning
slamming
or
enjoying
easily
available
and
modestly
priced
this
really
is
a
decent
beer
d
probably
my
favorite
adjunt
lager
if
that
means
anything
perfect
for
getting
hammered
overall
this
is
a
clean
and
simple
beer
it
lacks
anything
inherently
complex
but
then
again
it
is
undoubtedly
designed
to
be
a
straightforward
laid
back
brew
as
to
be
expected
this
beer
pours
yellow
with
a
white
head
retention
cold
be
better
though
still
a
nice
film
remains
throughout
the
drink
with
ok
lacing
smells
of
malts
and
some
citrus
hops
both
are
pretty
neutral
and
compliment
each
other
before
i
was
as
educated
on
beer
styles
to
me
this
was
like
a
high
quality
labatt
the
malts
try
to
be
sweet
but
the
hops
keep
them
down
a
bit
in
a
good
not
overpowering
way
there
is
a
definate
crisp
bitterness
in
the
finish
of
this
beer
that
i
have
grown
to
love
a
perfect
beer
for
camping
and
fishing
in
canada
and
this
one
is
dear
to
me
in
general
i
dislike
this
style
of
beer
but
i
can
make
an
exception
for
moosehead
well
done
better
then
most
big
canadian
beers
but
thats
not
saying
much
this
lager
produced
a
half
finger
head
which
faded
quickly
to
a
island
of
light
covering
and
slight
lacing
rating
a
5
on
the
srm
chart
this
beer
is
crystal
clear
with
small
bubble
action
smell
is
a
light
aroma
of
corn
and
wheat
with
a
hint
of
lime
peel
sort
of
a
straw
and
corn
taste
with
a
light
hop
finish
nothing
special
but
not
a
bad
assault
on
my
taste
buds
suitable
feeling
of
fullness
and
smoothness
in
my
mouth
but
just
a
little
bite
on
the
back
of
my
upper
palate
this
lager
goes
down
well
enough
to
have
a
six
at
an
yard
event
but
i
would
go
past
it
to
buy
some
better
on
the
local
beer
aisle
i
rank
this
beer
with
becks
and
carlsberg
skunky
this
is
a
very
good
version
of
that
style
flavor
though
moosehead
seems
not
to
be
highly
favored
here
neither
is
it
disliked
overall
i
think
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
looks
and
smells
nice
it
tastes
just
fine
so
long
as
you
know
it
has
a
little
funky
kick
to
it
ive
always
liked
it
a
good
thirst
quencher
overall
average
beer
decent
head
with
strong
lacing
and
heavy
carbonation
a
little
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
kinda
tasting
alcohol
and
some
sort
of
sour
hop
taste
maybe
a
bit
of
lemon
i
feel
like
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
carbonation
very
heavy
looks
good
but
tastes
pretty
average
d
overall
this
is
an
average
lager
nothing
special
but
easy
to
drink
while
watching
football
on
a
sunday
afternoon
d
pretty
low
abv
refreshing
make
it
pretty
damn
drinkable
but
there
are
other
beers
out
the
very
much
like
this
not
a
bad
little
beer
been
years
since
i
had
it
final
thoughts
would
reccommend
for
a
green
bottle
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
comparison
to
other
lagers
ive
had
this
ranks
more
positively
than
not
of
the
canadian
macros
this
is
one
of
the
best
its
fairly
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
d
although
not
the
most
enjoyable
or
exciting
lager
i
suppose
it
is
fairly
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
and
would
probably
recommend
it
based
on
the
name
alone
however
its
not
going
to
be
on
any
topten
lists
for
me
any
time
soon
just
soso
poured
into
a
beer
glass
fairly
stiffly
clear
and
straw
yellow
with
no
head
just
the
fizzy
stuff
you
expect
from
a
macro
such
as
this
and
wait
whats
that
lacing
on
a
macro
nice
aromas
are
corn
and
a
bit
of
vegetal
while
the
body
is
thin
and
watery
with
a
bit
of
corn
and
bread
flavour
that
lingers
decently
the
taste
really
surprises
me
as
having
something
more
than
i
would
have
otherwise
expected
finishes
cleanly
a
nice
drinkable
macro
lager
usual
mouthfeel
for
the
style
but
its
a
pretty
darned
drinkable
drop
for
me
occasional
use
isnt
out
of
the
question
cheers
overall
another
in
a
long
line
of
not
very
goo
beers
that
i
tried
over
the
last
week
dsky
high
its
very
refreshing
and
clean
there
is
not
much
to
this
beer
but
it
is
beloved
by
me
affordable
and
simple
best
thing
to
come
out
of
canada
i
say
yay
i
100
agree
with
gnr4life2
on
the
chesterfield
similarities
value
surprised
to
see
the
mant
harsh
reviews
on
moosehead
lager
on
here
i
mean
if
youre
expecting
the
best
beer
youve
ever
had
you
should
plan
on
spending
more
than
ten
bucks
for
a
12
pack
for
the
money
its
tough
to
beat
tastes
dry
grassy
earthy
but
clean
nonetheless
a
very
mild
feel
to
the
brew
it
offers
a
clean
inoffensive
finish
or
aftertaste
while
it
doesnt
force
me
to
scream
in
utter
praise
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
moosehead
lager
is
a
very
balanced
traditional
american
pale
lager
semisweet
grains
make
up
the
flavor
profile
some
slight
honeysweetness
followed
by
lemon
zest
lowtoabsent
bitterness
not
a
bad
pale
lager
at
all
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
did
for
that
matter
but
its
just
nothing
noteworthy
better
than
macro
offerings
but
better
lighter
beers
out
there
for
sure
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
surprisingly
good
head
no
head
retention
or
lacing
whatsoever
though
smell
has
a
faint
grassy
note
to
it
without
much
else
taste
is
almost
as
muted
but
it
isnt
bad
or
off
slight
bitterness
and
malt
just
a
standard
macro
style
lager
that
isnt
offensive
or
bad
carbonation
was
a
bit
prickly
which
hurts
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
i
did
finish
off
a
pitcher
so
it
wasnt
undrinkable
a
very
very
bitter
beer
in
order
to
drink
moosehead
it
has
to
be
theonly
beer
available
at
the
time
this
to
me
is
one
of
the
most
overrated
beers
i
have
ever
encountered
and
is
so
plain
and
average
you
might
just
fall
asleep
before
the
end
of
the
beer
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
definitely
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
an
okay
beer
pick
up
lord
chesterfield
ale
for
a
cheaper
price
plus
a
higher
alcohol
content
i
got
a
finger
of
bubbling
bonewhite
head
that
fizzled
out
like
a
cheap
piece
of
fireworks
off
of
my
pour
color
was
a
light
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
very
characteristic
lager
sweetness
it
was
a
welcome
change
from
its
adjunctladen
counterparts
as
well
as
a
nice
contrast
to
my
buddys
skunked
green
bottles
in
198687
a
smell
that
still
haunts
me
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
lager
sweetness
on
the
tongue
it
was
definitely
not
skunked
making
another
solid
case
for
beer
in
a
can
vice
out
of
a
green
bottle
finish
was
smooth
slightly
sweet
definitely
drinkable
this
is
definitely
coolerworthy
drinkability
a
fantastic
session
beer
goes
down
super
easily
and
crisply
making
it
a
pretty
cheap
and
unbeatable
staple
this
is
good
beer
by
any
standards
you
could
measure
it
in
its
price
range
and
its
macroimport
class
it
is
crisp
and
bright
flavorwise
and
demonstrates
the
brewerys
ability
to
construct
a
very
good
beer
with
what
must
be
assumed
to
be
somewhat
low
cost
ingredients
judging
by
the
price
8
99
for
12
bottles
at
foremost
in
chicago
either
that
or
they
are
selling
this
stuff
too
cheap
it
definitely
stands
up
to
beers
in
a
higher
price
range
and
is
much
better
than
other
canadian
beers
like
molson
and
labatts
the
color
is
pale
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
the
flavor
is
full
without
any
bitterness
or
astringency
its
clean
with
a
very
slight
citrus
flavor
and
rich
grain
throughout
this
is
a
perfect
chugger
if
youre
really
in
the
mood
for
34
good
tasting
beers
in
rapid
succession
this
would
go
down
smooth
any
time
and
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
not
to
recommend
it
as
a
straightforward
high
quality
medium
lager
light
the
campfire
and
pull
out
the
iced
moosehead
and
you
will
have
pure
enjoyment
the
reputation
as
skunk
beer
is
received
wisdom
and
repeated
without
really
tasting
this
beer
d
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
lager
much
while
not
as
bad
in
flavor
or
aroma
as
the
bottles
ive

moosehead
is
the
largest
and
oldest
independant
brewery
in
canada
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
clean
and
balanced
notes
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
lager
it
is
better
than
other
comparable
beers
like
molson
golden
d
well
its
easy
to
swallow
even
though
its
honestly
not
that
refreshing
overall
definitely
not
one
of
the
best
beers
of
the
world
far
from
it
id
say
the
only
thing
distinctly
canadian
about
this
one
is
that
it
has
moose
in
its
name
d
you
could
do
worse
for
a
standard
chugachug
lager
but
id
pick
labatts
over
this
any
day
not
to
mention
that
like
any
other
american
pale
lager
thats
not
actually
brewed
in
the
united
states
theyve
got
us
beat
at
our
own
game
its
still
a
pretty
wimpy
brew
though
back
in
college
moosehead
was
one
of
my
first
steps
out
of
bmc
i
havent
had
it
in
a
while
but
it
seemed
right
to
have
one
while
in
canada
its
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
a
reliable
thirst
quenching
session
beer
the
moose
is
loose
the
canquest
is
spreading
this
is
one
of
the
best
lager
ive
had
even
tho
i
am
not
a
big
lager
fan
this
is
better
than
molson
has
better
taste
color
it
is
more
refreshing
as
well
i
hope
recommend
this
lager
to
a
friend
if
there
was
nothing
else
on
tap
macrobrews
cheers
i
still
like
it
its
got
a
taste
that
i
like
will
buy
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
colour
however
that
is
the
only
really
decent
quality
about
the
beer
due
to
it
being
in
a
glass
bottle
skunk
cabbage
reins
throughout
with
some
corn
and
rice
rounding
it
out
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
and
i
regret
having
purchased
a
twelver
of
this
shit
this
is
just
plain
not
a
worthy
beer
the
moose
is
loose
in
the
wild
manitoba
snows
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
the
taste
doesnt
linger
feels
good
and
tastes
what
youd
expect
from
a
lager
botlle
341ml
light
gold
very
skunky
aroma
and
smoked
grain
taste
is
standard
lager
light
lemon
a
little
sweet
light
but
sticky
palate
an
horrible
interlude
in
somewhat
a
perfect
christmas
tasting
nothing
much
to
say
concerning
this
standard
macro
beer
taste
the
skunk
isnt
as
noticeable
in
the
taste
thankfully
skunk
aside
this
is
a
pretty
decent
pale
lager
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
though
refreshing
crisp
and
very
drinkable
drinks
like
a
light
lager
almost
like
a
cheap
end
pilsner
but
better
good
taste
and
the
ability
to
get
you
drunk
quick
if
you
dont
watch
out
due
to
its
easy
consumption
a
good
beer
to
have
around
for
tailgating
barbecues
and
with
heavy
foods
i
liked
this
beer
it
wasnt
to
bad
d
you
get
drunk
very
quickly
was
the
official
beer
of
my
group
of
friends
taste
thin
but
not
offensive
decent
hop
zest
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
better
than
most
mass
produced
lagers
mouthfeel
eh
not
much
to
savor
but
again
it
isnt
offensive
its
drinkable
for
sure
and
it
will
get
better
pair
with
hot
food
barbecue
long
story
short
you
could
drink
plenty
of
worse
things
than
this
its
fairly
agreeable
fresher
might
help
and
unobtrusive
hence
macro
tried
to
twist
this
one
off
and
had
no
luck
gotta
get
out
the
bottle
opener
received
this
one
from
a
friend
randomly
around
xmas
time
hope
its
not
skunked
green
and
clear
bottles
are
risky
here
goes
nothing
does
not
smell
skunked
smells
just
like
an
american
adjunct
initially
pours
out
about
as
clear
as
a
beer
could
get
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
being
water
colored
is
a
faint
yellow
almost
golden
tint
the
pale
white
head
actually
has
pretty
good
retention
making
this
a
decent
looking
beer
the
only
bad
part
is
how
unappetizing
the
pale
yellow
color
looks
medium
lacing
starts
to
be
left
as
the
head
dies
down
i
really
cant
bash
the
appearance
of
this
beer
at
all
next
comes
smell
this
beer
just
smells
like
coors
bud
light
corona
etc
i
cant
even
describe
the
smell
it
is
so
strange
that
of
any
cheap
adjunct
lager
maybe
just
a
bit
lemony
and
malty
hard
to
describe
but
everyone
that
has
had
a
cheap
beer
knows
the
smell
i
do
not
enjoy
this
smell
at
all
it
does
follow
the
stylegoal
pretty
well
and
i
have
to
give
it
some
credit
for
that
taste
brings
me
back
to
my
very
old
college
days
before
sam
adams
and
sierra
nevada
came
into
play
this
one
reminds
me
of
a
sweeter
coors
with
a
tiny
hint
of
citrus
the
sweetness
is
hard
to
adjust
to
even
on
the
first
sips
still
just
a
pretty
common
taste
for
a
cheap
lager
i
have
had
worse
and
this
one
still
follows
the
styles
ways
so
i
have
to
give
it
some
credit
on
taste
the
malt
lingers
around
in
the
after
taste
mouthfeel
actually
surprised
me
a
bit
on
this
one
the
carbonation
is
not
overdone
like
some
lagers
of
this
sort
and
the
body
is
relatively
creamy
and
enjoyable
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
feels
pretty
good
on
the
tongue
taste
not
included
i
am
certainly
not
gonna
lie
the
mouthfeel
is
better
than
some
beers
i
have
had
that
were
23x
the
price
of
this
drinkability
is
hard
to
describe
the
beer
is
cheap
and
not
filling
at
all
if
i
was
given
a
ton
of
these
to
session
i
probably
would
do
it
since
i
can
block
out
bad
tasting
beer
pretty
well
i
definitely
would
not
buy
one
of
these
to
do
that
though
i
would
say
the
db
is
right
down
the
middle
it
could
be
very
sessionable
but
i
would
not
choose
to
do
so
i
poured
this
just
average
stinking
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
light
pale
color
with
a
nice
white
frothy
head
however
that
went
away
very
soon
it
did
have
decent
lacing
like
that
means
a
lot
the
smell
was
skunky
and
green
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
candy
yuk
though
the
beer
was
refreshing
it
is
not
a
great
beer
and
i
will
not
buy
again
as
i
hate
smelling
skunk
when
getting
drunk
d
itll
do
just
right
for
the
occasion
it
is
an
average
lager
with
a
light
mouth
feel
and
very
good
drinkability
an
easy
session
beer
i
have
recently
switched
to
this
from
coors
as
my
everyday
beer
to
supplement
the
micros
in
the
fridge
had
this
on
tap
at
a
few
bars
and
in
bottle
pours
a
typical
golden
clear
pale
colour
with
a
little
bit
of
foam
well
it
doesnt
taste
as
shitty
as
the
other
canadian
macro
brews
and
you
might
as
well
throw
in
the
main
american
macro
brews
as
well
its
still
pretty
damn
average
at
best
though
it
just
has
that
flat
taste
to
it
but
i
had
no
other
options
lastnight
not
sure
what
else
i
can
say
about
this
a
beer
that
i
have
not
had
in
close
to
20
years
on
sale
at
a
local
store
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
starts
of
with
a
bit
of
grassy
and
spicey
hop
aroma
but
that
settles
down
and
graininess
comes
through
actually
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
but
not
too
sweet
i
like
my
beers
on
the
dry
side
but
i
can
tolerate
this
lager
some
noble
hop
flavor
but
mostly
malt
bitterness
is
low
light
body
but
overlycarbonated
this
is
a
fine
pale
lager
came
with
a
bottle
opener
in
the
12
pack
so
that
was
a
bonus
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
not
strong
but
its
not
watery
and
the
aftertaste
isnt
entirely
unpleasant
i
could
imagine
having
a
couple
of
these
outside
with
some
friends
in
the
summer
and
id
have
one
if
they
were
being
chilled
at
a
party
and
for
the
price
i
might
pick
it
up
as
a
sessionparty
beer
if
im
bored
with
yuengling
good
but
nothing
new
operative
term
for
this
beer
is
humble
nothing
bold
or
particularly
flavorful
sort
of
an
agreeable
grain
flavored
seltzer
certainly
easy
enough
to
put
away
and
lacking
in
obvious
flaws
its
the
lack
of
assertiveness
that
ultimately
relegates
this
beer
to
the
boring
section
from
experience
this
beer
seems
to
get
skunky
real
quick
when
in
bottles
but
even
from
a
can
its
not
too
impressive
its
just
an
average
brew
theres
better
canadian
lagers
out
there
than
this
d
i
preffer
this
over
adjunct
lager
any
day
of
the
week
overall
not
a
good
lager
with
no
hop
presence
and
lacking
in
any
positive
taste
drinkability
an
acceptable
easily
drinkable
lager
that
forgiving
the
minor
skunkiness
is
just
a
hair
more
distinctive
than
the
rest
of
the
macro
lagers
out
there
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
the
taste
is
rather
lively
for
the
style
but
very
simple
overall
there
is
a
nice
bready
malt
taste
and
not
much
else
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
is
very
inoffensive
but
has
some
flavor
i
have
ordered
this
beer
in
bars
numerous
time
when
there
wasnt
anything
better
and
i
can
see
myself
doing
so
again
in
the
future
i
know
moosehead
is
revered
for
being
the
last
of
the
canadian
ownership
holdouts
among
macro
brewers
but
their
flagship
beer
is
nothing
that
i
would
seek
out
its
barely
more
palatable
than
the
adjunctladen
offerings
of
their
bigger
competitors
d
i
hate
these
types
of
beers
because
they
offer
nothing
besides
drinkability
sure
its
not
offensive
but
its
only
good
for
one
thing
mass
consumption
good
flavor
is
totally
absent
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
gold
color
with
a
12
inch
head
mild
smell
slightly
skunky
taste
is
crisp
but
not
overly
flavorfull
feels
somewhat
watery
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
decent
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
ugh
what
do
i
do
with
the
other
22
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
its
massproduced
type
drinkability
is
good
this
is
very
light
and
refreshing
nice
beer
for
a
macro
it
isnt
an
interesting
beer
but
would
probably
make
a
great
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
american
lagers
ive
had
very
refreshing
moosehead
has
long
been
one
of
my
favorite
allpurpose
beers
its
very
malty
with
a
substantial
feel
in
my
mouth
a
bit
of
a
mild
aftertaste
and
only
the
slightest
bit
of
hop
bitterness
easy
drinking
but
it
does
start
to
fill
you
up
after
a
while
i
dont
think
id
want
to
pound
it
all
day
if
you
havent
tried
moosehead
id
highly
recommend
if
nothing
else
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
anything
objectionable
about
it
unless
youre
a
diehard
flavorphobic
coors
light
fanatic
d
due
to
the
lack
of
mouthfell
and
little
taste
these
can
cruise
down
overall
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
buy
this
beer
drinkability
i
can
finish
what
i
have
left
but
wont
be
buying
it
again
salutations
this
doesnt
drink
too
badly
but
it
gets
warm
quickly
not
for
savoring
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
on
sale
to
commemorate
the
chicago
blackhawks
ascension
to
the
post
season
ranks
why
not
get
blitzed
with
some
good
ol
canadian
beer
as
is
custom
i
had
to
write
a
review
for
at
least
one
of
these
so
here
i
am
this
beer
isnt
anything
special
but
its
a
good
brew
at
a
relatively
cheap
price
i
would
recommend
drinking
it
with
some
kind
of
bbq
andor
during
a
hockey
game
its
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
worth
having
every
now
and
then
overall
a
good
beer
happy
that
i
made
the
purchase
it
good
beer
for
its
price
how
could
i
turn
down
having
the
good
ole
moose
somehow
between
the
thinner
yellow
color
and
even
thinner
taste
i
didnt
manage
to
pour
this
one
out
its
not
totally
offensive
as
say
for
instance
busch
light
its
bland
but
not
skunked
its
what
we
call
a
lawnmower
beer
when
all
other
lawnmower
beers
have
been
exhausted
nice
beer
for
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
summers
day
pours
light
gold
in
color
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
and
thin
fading
lace
smells
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
corn
taste
is
fresh
and
clean
with
no
funky
after
taste
your
its
your
basic
lager
only
brewed
in
canada
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
both
are
good
not
much
else
to
say
on
the
plus
side
other
than
it
would
be
ok
for
something
quick
and
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
same
comments
many
nights
have
been
spent
pounding
back
numerous
of
these
how
can
it
not
be
a
5
for
me
my
dad
calls
it
moose
piss
and
now
i
get
why
pbr
is
a
better
all
around
beer
in
my
opinion
drinkability
if
you
like
sugar
water
you
will
probably
like
moosehead
this
is
pizza
swill
or
in
this
case
thai
i
suppose
that
an
icy
bucket
of
these
on
a
hot
day
would
hit
the
spot
and
i
remember
buying
this
by
the
case
when
i
was
in
my
20s
so
more
than
a
few
of
these
were
tipped
by
me
after
a
hot
day
at
work
not
exactly
the
sipper
just
not
enough
complexity
here
still
not
a
horrific
effort
it
is
drinkable
in
the
same
way
water
is
drinkable
id
drink
it
again
only
if
it
was
free
golden
straw
in
color
beer
looks
lifeless
no
head
and
minimal
carbonation
i
cant
smell
anything
from
this
beer
ill
give
it
a
2
0
since
i
guess
its
better
to
smell
nothing
then
to
smell
something
bad
taste
is
what
i
expected
from
this
style
mild
maltiness
and
then
some
grains
and
mild
hop
finish
easy
to
drink
but
similar
to
water
in
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
unless
you
like
beer
that
is
odorless
and
minimal
in
flavor
moosehead
lager
is
a
pretty
decent
canadian
lager
there
isnt
anything
particularly
noteworthy
about
it
just
kind
of
an
average
lager
it
has
a
bit
of
a
skunky
taste
not
unlike
heineken
but
once
you
get
used
to
that
its
actually
kind
of
refreshing
the
smell
isnt
all
that
wonderful
so
i
dont
recommend
pouring
it
into
a
glass
but
straight
from
the
bottle
moosehead
lager
is
an
alright
beer
drinkability
its
an
ideal
drinking
brew
for
all
you
kids
out
there
the
perfect
bottle
beer
after
seven
or
eight
don
cherry
might
look
chic
final
thoughts
for
the
most
part
this
beer
is
slightly
above
average
its
nothing
worthy
going
out
of
your
way
for
but
its
also
not
a
bad
choice
really
i
find
myself
drinking
this
beer
because
i
dont
have
a
more
interesting
option
and
i
feel
its
certainly
a
step
up
from
the
standard
macro
offerings
its
been
5
years
since
ive
had
this
paticular
beer
and
i
know
the
reason
it
has
been
so
long
this
beer
is
not
good
it
has
less
taste
than
most
of
the
macro
beers
ive
had
it
probably
would
go
good
with
a
funnel
it
also
had
kind
of
a
skunky
smell
probably
due
to
the
green
bottle
or
the
age
of
the
beer
very
easy
drinking
possibly
ok
for
beachbbq
if
you
can
get
over
how
watery
this
is
yeesh
maybe
good
for
a
fishing
trip
when
its
cold
enough
that
your
lips
dont
taste
much
but
not
good
for
here
on
the
sofa
overall
moosehead
overall
not
very
good
beer
but
better
than
some
i
have
had
i
will
definately
never
have
this
one
again
d
i
find
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
take
it
to
the
dirt
track
races
in
the
summer
no
bottles
allowed
and
always
find
myself
with
a
empty
coloer
on
the
way
out
mouth
surprising
heft
of
flavor
not
as
watery
as
your
average
pale
lager
lightly
toasted
cereal
grains
with
a
touch
of
adjunct
sweetness
inoffensive
semidry
sort
of
slimy
and
astringent
on
the
palate
high
drinkability
low
desirability
comments
this
is
better
then
expected
and
the
taste
is
better
then
the
smell
but
still
not
great
d
if
it
were
really
hot
and
i
was
really
thirsty
sure
but
i
am
neither
so
not
really
d
very
drinkable
something
i
will
definitely
have
again
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
good
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
a
euro
lager
lots
of
yeast
fits
the
style
smooth
crisp
and
low
carbonation
low
malt
flavor
along
with
the
lager
taste
doesnt
really
taste
clearly
of
adjuncts
also
an
associated
skunk
aroma
and
taste
but
not
very
strong
if
this
skunk
flavor
wasnt
there
the
beer
would
be
pretty
darn
good
oh
well
drinkability
honestly
am
i
drinking
beer
or
sparkling
water
better
than
most
macros
but
still
nothing
good
a
decent
lager
always
a
better
choice
than
budweiser
pours
clear
gold
white
head
sweet
grassy
aroma
with
pale
malt
sweeter
tasting
smoother
with
an
okay
finish
this
beer
will
easily
skunk
if
so
the
taste
will
stay
with
you
for
a
while
similar
to
the
taste
you
will
have
the
next
morning
with
that
ringing
hangover
drinkability
refreshing
and
not
too
bad
but
nothing
i
would
buy
normally
better
than
most
american
macros
but
not
a
standout
pick
it
up
as
a
single
from
the
liquor
store
the
beer
was
pour
in
an
english
pint
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
could
threw
me
off
but
the
flavor
compensates
for
it
a
light
color
with
some
flavor
and
a
bit
of
malt
after
being
in
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
dissipated
thin
watery
and
drinkable
pours
a
very
pale
strawlike
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
minimal
head
not
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
aroma
some
faint
grains
and
a
weird
almost
skunky
smell
taste
is
also
not
very
impressive
or
even
shows
much
flavors
except
some
light
grains
and
adjunct
flavors
finishes
with
an
off
flavor
lots
of
carbonation
very
prickly
crisp
grab
something
else
if
its
available
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
effected
by
the
nontaste
and
general
blandness
of
the
product
i
dont
recomend
this
beer
drinkability
absolutely
do
not
want
another
one
of
these
worse
than
almost
every
other
macro
lager
ive
ever
had
wont
buy
this
ever
again
cant
believe
canadas
oldest
independent
brewery
has
been
around
this
long
i
thought
canadian
beer
was
supposed
to
be
good
drinkability
better
than
your
runofthemill
american
lager
and
something
that
we
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
i
recommend
this
beer
if
you
want
something
easy
to
drink
d
not
great
but
certainly
a
step
up
from
the
average
macro
a
safe
bed
for
someone
moving
up
from
the
bmc
standards
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
better
than
canadian
or
blue
in
a
can
there
is
a
freshness
and
crispness
that
have
not
had
in
a
bottle
to
my
tastes
this
beer
lacks
the
corny
finish
of
other
macro
lagers
at
least
unlike
keiths
it
simply
is
a
lager
with
no
pretences
this
beer
pours
a
light
goldenstraw
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
of
german
pills
with
some
hops
the
taste
is
watery
with
that
is
sweet
at
first
and
ends
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
unoffensive
d
in
the
end
this
beer
is
fairly
flavorless
its
not
as
bad
as
others
out
there
but
it
isnt
anything
to
seek
out
again
out
of
the
bottle
this
canuck
brew
was
a
light
straw
gold
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
retention
and
lacing
were
mediocre
and
the
aroma
malty
in
a
musty
kind
of
way
the
flavors
were
not
much
better
above
average
for
a
macro
lager
but
little
more
than
that
malt
lager
in
the
aftertaste
and
assorted
wet
grains
in
the
middle
with
a
undertone
of
minerals
the
body
was
lightmedium
the
mouthfeel
ok
and
the
carbonation
the
same
just
a
c
class
beer
in
general
well
i
admire
the
marketing
for
moosehead
the
companys
image
i
think
is
marketed
very
well
to
canadians
as
being
strongly
independent
etc
the
beer
isnt
very
great
though
unfortunately
i
wont
bother
trying
to
describe
the
appearance
or
aroma
theres
nothing
to
talk
about
the
flavour
is
quite
bland
and
the
beer
is
overcarbonated
stale
tasting
usually
and
sour
i
personally
drink
it
at
bars
so
i
dont
give
any
more
money
to
labbatt
or
molson
or
the
other
beer
monopolies
here
in
canada
the
bottle
is
nice
too
d
eh
i
guess
its
drinkable
if
you
like
chewing
on
minty
blades
of
grass
this
one
is
for
you
serving
type
bottle
meh
another
fairly
bland
lager
the
aroma
is
all
dms
and
cooked
corn
once
this
warms
no
good
the
flavor
is
pale
clean
barley
with
a
slight
herbal
bitterness
at
the
end
light
in
body
and
easy
to
drink
there
isnt
a
lot
of
flavor
but
its
ok
lawnmower
beer
once
the
greenbottle
skunk
clears
out
its
mostly
inoffensive
the
beer
poured
a
light
gingerale
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
smell
very
indicative
of
a
macro
some
grain
and
some
malt
the
taste
is
almost
all
malt
with
a
bit
of
hops
towards
the
finish
and
little
to
no
residual
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
crisp
due
to
the
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
could
easily
be
enjoyed
by
the
sixpack
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
buddy
brought
me
a
few
of
these
from
canada
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
but
i
was
comparing
it
to
typical
swill
at
least
it
wasnt
foul
tasting
pretty
smooth
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
mixed
in
with
some
grains
a
touch
watery
but
thats
expected
drinkable
and
refreshing
id
have
it
again
poured
into
a
22
oz
tall
glass
light
straw
color
with
a
large
creamy
foam
head
the
carbonation
is
medium
the
aroma
is
mild
malts
with
a
a
touch
of
wet
blankets
the
taste
is
a
not
a
overpowering
in
any
direction
the
malt
aftertaste
comes
through
with
a
good
amount
sweetness
the
body
is
light
and
if
your
out
of
good
options
or
you
want
something
light
this
is
better
than
most
macros
and
cheap
d
very
drinkable
and
i
was
obviously
pretty
buzzed
by
the
time
i
started
drinking
these
i
had
3
and
could
have
had
more
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
standard
canadian
lagers
slightly
above
average
in
all
categories
easy
drinking
and
tastes
real
good
when
its
nice
and
cold
i
like
to
come
back
to
this
beer
once
in
a
while
and
most
of
the
bars
around
here
have
it
on
tap
so
its
better
than
most
of
the
other
choices
hmmm
this
isnt
doing
the
job
for
me
thats
a
shame
because
i
have
a
fond
memory
of
drinking
this
beer
ontap
on
new
years
eve
2006
in
toronto
if
wasnt
really
off
as
it
was
bland
d
drinkable
one
of
the
better
canadian
beers
ive
had
had
thus
far
pours
a
decent
goldenyellowstraw
color
with
some
nice
head
but
little
lacing
very
clean
and
crisp
scent
not
near
as
skunky
as
a
typical
macro
lager
with
a
nice
malt
sweetness
good
taste
crisp
and
refreshing
very
little
hoppiness
but
a
great
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
extremely
smooth
a
very
nice
beer
to
have
after
mowing
the
grass
i
may
have
a
new
favorite
picnic
beer
i
should
note
however
that
i
bought
a
boxedin
12
pack
and
so
there
was
no
chance
for
this
beer
to
get
exposed
to
light
i
dont
think
it
could
handle
a
skunking
as
is
though
its
supremely
drinkable
and
really
one
of
the
best
surprises
ive
had
in
a
long
time
d
very
drinkable
like
most
macro
lager
the
lager
style
is
not
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
darn
good
beer
and
for
its
style
its
better
than
most
pours
from
the
bottle
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
small
head
and
lacing
smell
a
bit
skunky
with
corn
smell
it
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
and
is
very
flavorful
in
your
mouth
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
you
can
just
sit
and
enjoy
a
few
i
like
this
i
had
not
had
it
for
20
yrs
but
now
i
have
i
will
be
getting
it
again
a
very
nice
lager
beer
mfd
thin
bodied
and
easy
drinking
great
summer
session
lager
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
easily
enough
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
theres
really
not
much
of
anything
here
that
would
make
me
want
to
drink
this
beer
again
finish
is
rather
clean
very
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
no
flaws
given
what
the
brewers
were
aiming
for
one
of
the
very
best
for
this
style
hands
down
the
best
of
the
big
three
canadian
macro
lagers
ive
tasted
certainly
more
hop
character
than
your
average
north
american
lager
d
very
drinkable
definately
something
you
could
chill
on
the
patio
with
and
drink
oddly
it
goes
well
with
cigars
body
and
drinkability
are
medium
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
used
to
really
enjoy
back
in
the
90s
my
how
things
have
changed
great
for
a
day
to
just
pound
a
few
down
ill
probably
buy
this
again
during
football
season
and
see
if
my
dad
digs
on
it
this
seems
like
a
beer
my
old
man
would
appreciate
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
a
standard
pale
lager
without
anything
special
could
use
a
bit
more
in
profile
but
not
bad
otherwise
notes
i
will
say
it
beats
the
american
competition
for
the
style
and
i
paid
very
little
for
the
taste
i
really
do
not
prefer
beers
of
this
stylebut
i
can
appreciate
a
good
one
and
this
beer
is
worth
having
every
now
and
then
on
a
really
hot
day
i
can
see
myself
having
one
or
twobut
not
for
session
i
decide
to
pour
this
one
into
a
flying
fish
standard
pint
glass
what
came
out
was
a
really
clear
straw
yellow
with
an
ok
less
than
12
inch
head
of
white
foam
it
quickly
dissipated
into
a
few
white
rings
along
the
edge
it
didnt
bother
to
leave
any
white
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
very
grainy
with
malted
corn
and
rice
a
drop
of
apple
juice
and
a
hint
of
juicy
fruits
in
the
back
the
taste
was
nothing
but
grains
no
subtle
fruit
or
hops
just
malted
corn
and
rice
with
a
hint
of
malted
wheat
in
the
background
it
was
clearly
a
light
beer
with
a
grainy
aftertaste
of
malted
corn
and
rice
what
kind
of
aftertaste
could
i
have
been
expecting
after
a
very
grainy
taste
in
the
end
its
better
than
some
of
the
macro
lagers
ive
had
and
i
wouldnt
really
mind
on
having
another
one
of
these
if
you
like
drinking
youir
grains
you
have
to
drink
a
moosehead
m
d
maybe
a
little
flat
feeling
but
decently
smooth
and
finishes
semidry
an
easy
drinker
though
not
something
i
think
i
would
session
really
wouldnt
complain
about
it
sitting
in
the
fridge
though
either
the
taste
is
mostly
lightly
sweet
with
very
faint
bitterness
brief
but
clean
and
cleansing
its
smooth
and
fairly
fullbodied
for
what
it
is
whit
a
nice
firm
longlasting
grain
flavour
with
faint
hints
of
juniper
apple
and
flowers
its
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
and
far
superior
to
many
macro
lagers
d
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
lager
it
is
easy
drinking
and
very
sessionable
this
is
really
not
a
bad
choice
for
something
cheap
its
much
grainier
than
other
lagers
which
more
of
a
wheatlike
bread
flavor
rather
than
the
standard
corn
very
clean
and
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
american
all
malt
lager
or
munich
helles
lager
i
have
been
looking
for
a
good
refressing
beer
that
will
not
break
the
bank
i
think
i
may
have
found
it
this
beer
has
a
very
light
color
with
a
head
that
went
away
fast
very
little
hop
taste
mildly
sweet
malt
much
better
then
bmc
i
compared
this
beer
to
victory
lager
and
found
them
to
be
pretty
similar
i
am
partial
to
penn
craft
brews
but
when
i
dont
want
a
beer
that
is
to
complex
i
would
buy
this
again
one
note
my
bottle
says
3
2
alcohol
by
weight
that
is
4
0
abv
not
5
im
sitting
here
trying
to
really
enjoy
this
brew
and
finding
it
difficult
to
do
ill
pass
on
another
round
overall
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
i
might
like
it
more
on
a
hot
day
better
than
some
worse
than
others
pale
straw
yellow
with
skiff
of
a
head
and
some
carbonation
clean
hoppy
smell
with
some
sweetness
tastes
a
lot
like
it
smells
with
citrus
and
a
hoppy
bite
clean
and
smooth
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
easy
to
drink
and
beats
most
american
lagers
of
the
same
style
best
when
cold
overall
not
that
bad
it
is
what
it
is
going
well
with
chips
salsa
and
sour
cream
why
the
aversion
to
brown
bottles
among
moosehead
and
molson
ill
never
know
but
green
in
this
sense
does
not
mean
go
certainly
not
for
me
drinkability
is
good
goes
well
with
burgers
and
other
standard
pub
fare
light
golden
color
with
a
medium
thickness
white
creamy
head
smell
is
slight
skunk
at
first
followed
by
some
malt
taste
is
clean
smooth
creamy
and
a
tad
watery
of
the
pale
lagers
ive
had
this
is
definitely
the
best
has
a
hint
of
bitterness
but
finishes
with
a
fairly
pleasant
bittersweetness
this
isnt
a
jaw
dropping
beer
but
for
the
style
this
is
very
drinkable
and
much
better
tasting
than
your
standard
budmillercoors
selection
with
slightly
more
body
even
though
it
is
still
a
bit
watery
the
taste
and
aroma
of
the
beer
act
alike
the
clear
and
crisp
bite
that
feels
great
on
my
tongue
this
beer
is
very
good
going
down
and
is
hard
to
keep
away
there
are
not
many
canadian
beers
in
the
usa
but
this
one
hits
the
top
of
my
list
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
for
a
macro
lager
its
fairly
decent
because
its
canadian
its
not
as
watered
down
as
the
more
common
american
cousins
one
taste
and
i
was
transported
back
to
my
early
twenties
when
moosehead
seemed
to
represent
a
step
up
from
the
standard
issue
macro
lager
even
now
it
is
still
upscale
in
comparison
its
just
that
now
i
know
how
much
higher
in
quality
beer
can
really
be
regardless
the
clean
crisp
character
makes
it
drinkable
but
getting
around
the
aroma
is
a
challenge
now
that
really
didnt
present
itself
decades
ago
but
hey
if
you
want
to
stick
one
in
my
hand
ill
find
a
way
to
get
it
past
my
nose
moosehead
is
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
its
just
a
good
smooth
lager
that
has
that
typical
canadian
lager
taste
a
little
bitter
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
to
take
camping
or
fishing
in
the
summer
theres
nothing
like
moosehead
after
working
out
a
light
golden
in
appearance
with
a
thin
head
that
dissapated
rather
quickly
smell
is
skunky
but
clean
i
can
taste
the
malt
with
some
grass
that
is
slightly
bitter
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
good
spike
of
carbonation
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
i
can
enjoy
drinkability
solid
brew
very
refreshing
while
also
satisfying
the
taste
buds
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
aroma
is
skunky
with
some
malt
and
not
much
else
skunkiness
kind
of
overwhelms
here
taste
is
very
smooth
crisp
and
malty
inoffensive
and
average
are
two
words
id
use
to
describe
this
beer
its
certainly
not
much
impressive
a
good
lawnmower
beer
and
nothing
more
recommended
over
some
american
lagers
but
i
would
stay
away
from
it
otherwise
if
its
on
sale
this
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
with
virtually
no
head
left
once
i
poured
smell
is
of
grain
corn
and
a
slight
skunky
smell
the
taste
on
this
one
is
initially
bitter
followed
by
a
slight
sweetness
and
more
bittering
skunk
kind
of
flavor
body
is
light
and
somewhat
watery
carbonation
is
active
and
somewhat
filling
better
than
the
average
macro
lager
d
good
this
beer
is
good
on
a
hot
day
and
in
the
winter
as
well
i
give
her
a
b
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
refreshment
feel
to
it
very
easy
to
consume
in
mass
quantitiesnot
badbetter
than
what
i
could
remember
from
when
i
first
tried
it
i
would
have
againnothing
special
thoughdont
want
to
get
everyones
hopes
up
a
slightvery
slightimprovement
over
budweiser
light
bodied
smooth
inoffensive
it
beats
most
macros
but
i
can
think
of
so
many
better
lagers
a
decent
choice
to
bring
to
a
party
of
macro
drinkers
as
it
is
easy
but
has
something
to
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
nice
to
drinkthis
beer
reminds
why
you
like
beer
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
and
totally
inoffensive
texture
is
thinner
than
id
like
and
a
little
oversweet
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
a
dealkiller
i
honestly
could
drink
a
twelver
of
these
and
be
quite
pleased
they
go
down
smooth
and
easy
and
very
quickly
not
unbelieveable
but
honest
and
dependable
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
canadian
if
had
way
better
then
molson
products
and
labatt
products
moosehead
lager
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
grain
the
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
and
grain
inoffensive
but
not
inspiring
a
reasonably
better
alternative
to
bmc
pours
a
decent
looking
clear
pale
color
with
nice
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
skunky
flavor
was
less
skunky
and
a
light
grassy
flavor
carbonation
was
heavy
while
mouthfeel
was
light
nothing
i
would
ever
seek
out
again
cant
figure
out
why
these
breweries
dont
wise
up
with
the
green
glass
thing
first
thing
i
noticed
upon
pouring
this
was
the
skunky
aroma
had
a
nice
big
frothy
head
though
some
lace
that
all
faded
pretty
quickly
lovely
golden
color
maybe
over
carbonated
skunkiness
wasnt
as
apparent
in
the
flavor
which
was
dominated
with
some
play
between
bitterness
and
some
grainy
sweetness
sweet
finish
not
as
good
as
i
recalled
d
good
but
didnt
feel
like
having
another
it
just
got
boring
at
the
end
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
didnt
make
an
impression
on
me
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
colour
that
is
very
clear
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
some
yeasty
aftersmells
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clear
as
a
lager
should
be
some
mild
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
bland
and
nondescript
with
some
hints
of
malt
and
grass
too
bad
about
the
green
bottle
though
oh
well
i
guess
it
looks
cool
this
beer
didnt
wow
me
in
any
sense
but
it
really
wasnt
bad
either
its
less
corncerealheavy
than
its
american
counterparts
and
much
smoother
with
less
skunk
than
the
euro
pale
lagers
so
in
that
regard
moosehead
is
successful
again
its
really
just
an
average
lager
but
it
did
have
a
pretty
nice
aftertaste
and
is
pretty
drinkable
man
when
i
was
16
this
was
highend
shit
looks
like
your
normal
macro
lager
smells
like
your
normal
macro
lager
and
tastes
like
your
normal
macro
lager
corn
adjuncts
spritzy
the
difference
is
that
there
is
a
bit
more
going
on
than
bmc
but
not
much
would
only
drink
this
if
bmc
were
the
only
other
options
and
i
absolutely
needed
a
beer
nice
pour

clear
straw
yellow
decent
white
head
and
laces
i
can
sure
notice
the
euro
yeast
skunk
now
and
the
taste
has
a
ton
of
corn
and
cooked
veggies
in
there
even
though
its
suppose
to
be
all
malt
crisp
and
dry
it
has
enough
redeeming
qualities
to
give
it
a
thumbs
up
pale
clear
lager
yellow
not
much
head
to
speak
of
pretty
decent
lacing
faint
smell
of
grainy
malt
crisp
malt
taste
at
the
front
end
followed
by
a
vert
quick
bite
of
hops
that
exit
almost
imediately
went
a
bit
watery
before
ending
with
a
dry
almost
tart
aftertaste
smooth
mouthfeel
a
nice
easy
to
drink
lager
a
decent
lager
this
used
to
be
my
favorite
beer
i
was
born
in
canada
and
i
hadnt
drunk
any
in
quite
a
while
i
did
my
best
to
suppress
any
prejudices
in
favor
of
it
even
so
i
found
it
rather
pleasant
to
drink
color
is
a
typical
goldenyellow
not
much
head
aroma
is
sharp
and
malty
the
crisp
malty
taste
is
not
complex
but
is
refreshing
it
definitely
has
an
edge
to
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
that
most
lagers
lack
this
is
a
good
party
beer
in
my
premicro
brew
days
this
was
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
i
had
tried
this
a
few
years
ago
and
swear
when
moosehead
got
bought
out
they
changed
the
formula
nonetheless
this
beer
looks
like
yellow
piss
will
leave
some
lacing
and
has
a
candy
like
taste
on
the
nose
terrific
session
beer
and
the
cornyness
dwindles
if
drank
very
cold
goes
down
easily
and
is
about
the
same
price
it
was
20
years
ago
when
i
first
loved
it
better
than
most
american
macros
d
easy
to
drink
refreshing
but
far
too
bland
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
lacks
any
real
character
drinks
pretty
easy
a
little
more
complexity
would
help
nice
revist
to
a
blast
from
my
past
8490
i
drank
a
fare
amount
of
this
stuff
d
highly
drinkable
because
of
how
refreshing
it
is
not
an
amazing
lager
but
one
you
could
throw
down
a
bunch
of
with
no
real
turnoffs
its
lacking
in
the
skunkiness
of
a
heineken
but
doesnt
really
bring
a
whole
lot
to
the
table
for
itself
either
nose
of
metal
and
cats
pee
for
those
of
who
that
dont
know
cats
pee
is
a
legitimate
smell
description
often
used
by
winos
taste
is
watery
grainy
and
rather
sweet
a
cloying
sweetness
with
faint
hints
of
artificial
grape
flavor
is
present
instead
of
bittering
this
is
a
nasty
beer
it
seems
so
innocuous
and
i
have
never
encountered
any
american
macros
i
simply
could
not
handle
but
this
one
will
go
down
as
the
first
i
gave
this
one
to
my
roommate
puke
moosehead
is
a
lager
with
a
light
straw
hue
and
a
euro
lager
taste
its
not
as
skunky
as
grolsch
or
heiny
but
this
is
headed
in
that
direction
the
malt
is
right
up
front
and
comes
off
crisp
with
a
bite
from
the
alcohol
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
very
drinkable
though
i
prefer
this
very
cold
and
in
that
state
it
is
easily
the
best
canadian
lagermasspro
other
than
labatts
50
maybe
but
definately
better
than
blue
or
molsen
however
if
it
warms
the
negative
qualitiesalcoholskunkiness
become
more
prominent
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
not
an
award
winner
by
any
means
priced
right
for
a
decent
import
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
foamy
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
of
malt
hops
grain
and
a
slight
hint
of
corn
taste
was
good
for
basically
a
runofthemill
lager
with
the
malt
and
corn
taste
coming
through
with
a
slight
sweetness
a
goood
amount
of
carbonation
a
step
above
a
bud
id
say
with
easy
drinkability
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
it
poured
a
drak
straw
yellow
with
a
head
that
lasted
a
few
seconds
its
a
great
beer
for
the
awesome
and
sometimes
hot
2
days
a
year
wny
weather
during
the
summer
it
has
a
somewhat
plain
taste
but
its
overall
a
good
brew
to
have
alot
during
the
summer
its
a
light
thirst
quenching
lager
once
thought
canadian
beers
like
this
were
good
fizzy
head
pale
color
very
little
nose
to
the
beer
its
a
good
summer
beer
with
enough
ommphh
and
goes
well
with
burgers
and
pizza
quite
drinkable
on
hot
days
notes
while
i
havent
had
a
moosehead
in
quite
some
time
i
will
be
back
for
more
when
im
in
the
mood
right
up
there
with
pabst
blue
ribbon
as
the
finest
examples
of
macro
lagers
you
gotta
get
this
fresh
though
and
without
any
markings
on
the
bottle
its
a
crap
shoot
this
one
was
very
fresh
w
zero
off
flavor
thumbs
up
to
a
brewery
that
is
very
important
to
st
johns
economy
ive
seen
these
green
bottles
in
open
six
packs
as
far
west
as
california
and
as
far
east
as
poland
ive
never
had
an
issue
with
it
but
id
advise
a
change
because
canadas
oldest
independent
brewery
does
in
fact
offer
a
lager
a
little
cleaner
drinking
than
its
now
foreign
owned
counterparts
drink
it
cold
and
expect
what
is
to
be
expected
easy
to
drink
a
step
above
your
normal
lager
salud
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
to
come
out
of
canada
cheap
refreshing
canadian
beer
accomplishes
what
it
set
out
to
do
nothing
offensive
here
very
basic
would
be
good
with
food
would
love
to
try
some
of
the
breweries
other
offerings
final
statement
i
poured
it
in
a
glass
for
this
review
however
i
prefer
to
leave
it
in
the
nice
green
bottle
this
is
a
beer
of
choice
for
me
on
hot
summer
days
goes
down
smooth
its
crisp
and
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
maritime
day
by
the
water
it
is
what
it
is
moosehead
lager
was
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
had
poor
retention
the
smell
was
skunky
with
a
little
malt
in
the
backround
the
taste
was
fairly
light
and
clean
with
a
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
medium
carbontion
its
a
fairly
drinkable
light
tasting
lager
get
my
buzz
on
n
this
lager
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
quickly
there
was
very
little
carbonation
apparent
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
lightly
sweet
perhaps
corn
hard
to
tell
with
a
bit
of
malt
the
taste
was
lightly
sweet
with
very
minimal
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
light
carbonation
thin
flavor
overall
this
was
an
ok
inoffensive
macro
lager
taste
tends
to
get
a
little
bit
on
the
cheap
beery
side
as
this
one
warms
but
when
cold
the
malts
are
clean
and
theres
a
citric
acidity
that
makes
this
beer
a
little
more
interesting
and
wellbalanced
than
most
canadian
macro
lagers
a
good
thirst
quencher
at
any
rate
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
with
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
lots
of
body
i
stand
by
this
beer
but
serve
cold
and
make
sure
you
get
one
that
hasnt
been
lightstruck
it
can
get
brutally
skunky
cheers
not
bad
for
what
it
is
unattractive
light
gold
color
not
much
of
a
head
and
average
clarity
not
much
of
an
aroma
smells
a
bit
of
mixed
malt
and
floral
scents
taste
is
slightly
blah
but
compared
to
other
beers
in
this
category
its
not
bad
light
bodied
but
good
carbonation
gives
it
a
decent
feel
like
this
style
and
the
apas
it
can
be
drank
at
whatever
pace
you
like
great
drinkability
not
bad
for
a
mass
produced
canadian
beer
but
not
a
lot
to
offer
either
probably
best
after
you
have
had
a
couple
good
beers
like
some
canadian
unibroue
offerings
and
taste
and
quality
is
not
as
big
an
issue
then
several
of
these
will
hit
the
spot
note
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
moosehead
there
was
a
day
25
years
ago
when
we
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
the
craft
beer
movement
wasnt
nearly
what
it
is
today
and
moosehead
was
imported

in
retrospect
we
didnt
know
jack
but
ill
always
have
fond
memories
of
moosehead
just
the
same
moosehead
pours
a
crystalclear
dark
gold
body
beneath
a
thick
finger
of
brightwhite
foam
that
holds
remarkably
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
welcomes
you
with
a
beautiful
combination
of
sweetish
grainy
malt
and
herbal
and
floral
hops
that
combination
carries
over
in
the
flavor
where
the
hops
really
come
into
their
own
initially
they
seem
more
herbal
but
as
it
warms
a
bit
some
of
the
more
floral
nuances
appear
the
malt
doesnt
appear
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggests
and
its
also
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
in
combination
with
the
crisp
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
the
bitterness
cuts
through
nicely
it
finishes
dry
with
some
quickly
passing
lightly
sweet
malt
up
front
a
slap
of
floral
hops
and
then
lingering
herbal
hops
amidst
a
longlasting
bitterness
refreshing
satisfying
and
highly
drinkable
no
better
sound
than
the
crack
of
an
ice
cold
can
of
beer
on
a
hot
summers
day
pours
out
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
starts
with
a
pretty
thick
white
head
looks
impressive
but
doesnt
last
smell
is
of
sweet
grainy
malt
flavor
is
clean
sweet
maltiness
with
the
slightest
floral
hop
clean
and
refreshing
no
aftertaste
smooth
very
drinkable
slightly
above
average
for
a
lager
much
better
than
the
big
brewers
molson
or
labatt
for
a
sessional
surprisingly
crisp
pale
colored
nice
tasting
all
malt
lager
easy
to
drink
has
a
bitterness
but
its
not
offensive
its
good
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
pay
extra
money
to
drink
it
if
there
is
a
drink
special
where
you
can
get
one
of
these
cheap
try
it
out
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
not
get
too
full
i
guess
not
a
real
problem
in
northern
canada

way
mouthfeel
is
pretty
crisp
and
well
carbonated
and
drinkability
isnt
bad
at
all
i
had
this
at
a
wedding
where
i
was
beset
by
limited
choices
and
its
really
not
that
bad
not
something
id
buy
for
myself
but
if
i
was
offered
one
id
drink
it
without
much
complaint
light
to
medium
body
no
presence
of
alcohol
so
to
speak
an
easy
enough
of
a
drinker
overall
its
an
average
macro
tasting
lager
brewed
by
the
mighty
canadians
cheers
sparkling
8
karat
gold
topped
with
a
brilliant
white
head
of
loosely
packed
medium
bubbles
ample
vibrant
carbonation
streams
jet
to
the
surface
the
head
settles
to
nothing
shortly
after
pouring
leaving
no
lacing
the
smell
is
fresh
and
clean
sweet
with
fresh
grain
and
some
hop
edge
the
taste
is
crisp
initially
giving
way
to
a
distinct
sweetness
which
is
a
tad
heavy
finishes
with
a
soft
but
firm
hop
edge
that
doesnt
linger
light
body
and
filled
with
roiling
carbonation
which
somewhat
offsets
the
medium
sweetness
nice
and
crisp
and
good
for
a
warm
day
a
good
ball
park
beer
a
very
drinkable
canadian
lager
head
and
shoulders
above
the
other
canadian
lagers
beats
a
keiths
i
bought
the
beer
on
a
whim
and
was
surprised
i
expected
little
from
the
lager
i
was
just
hoping
against
bud
light
in
a
different
bottle
this
beer
is
a
great
recommendation
for
drinkers
who
dont
care
for
dark
beers
certainly
a
high
lager
dthis
one
is
ok
i
can
see
it
being
highly
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
i
bought
a
12
pack
since
it
was
on
sale
ill
save
the
rest
for
next
month
when
i
can
sit
outside
on
the
deck
overall
an
average
beer
worth
a
try
once
tried
this
drink
last
night
and
i
dont
think
my
experience
with
this
beer
was
as
good
as
expected
the
smell
of
this
one
was
very
skunky
almost
unbearable
i
do
believe
this
was
light
struck
nonetheless
i
drank
it
and
it
was
alright
nice
head
that
stayed
ok
plenty
of
carbonation
tasted
nice
and
hoppy
ill
try
this
drink
again
hopefully
with
a
better
review
typical
for
green
bottled
beer
pungent
odors
emit
from
the
bottle
aromas
of
light
skunk
earthy
and
grain
getting
into
the
flavor
the
odors
subside
a
bit
leaving
a
cereal
grain
flavor
with
a
mouthfeel
of
light
huskiness
and
graininess
malt
sweetness
and
breadiness
is
moderate
and
improves
until
the
sharp
and
almost
astringent
finish
leaving
a
grainlike
aftertaste
though
ive
had
worse
this
is
not
likely
to
be
a
beer
that
i
will
revisit
one
of
my
favorite
popular
canadian
lagers
the
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
some
beers
but
its
definitely
good
in
its
own
way
would
recommend
there
is
a
good
golden
color
with
poor
head
retention
this
beer
makes
you
suspect
that
the
color
might
be
artificial
it
smells
every
so
slightly
hoppy
but
there
are
no
presence
of
malts
you
can
defeinetly
smell
that
skunk
though
again
the
taste
is
skunk
this
overpowers
and
other
hops
or
malts
the
beer
is
watery
but
there
is
good
carbonation
this
could
be
artificial
too
though
maybe
if
this
beer
was
cold
enough
your
tastebuds
cold
be
numbed
enough
just
to
enjoy
a
buzz
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
headalthough
it
does
have
alot
of
carbonation
bubbles
the
smell
has
a
slight
hoppinessbut
nothing
else
the
taste
is
lightweakand
watery
it
has
a
slight
carmel
aftertastebut
this
is
pretty
bad
the
mf
is
like
the
tasteweak
and
watery
i
cant
imagine
ever
having
this
again
overall
this
is
fairly
drinkable
more
so
than
many
macro
lagers
but
obviously
not
something
id
seek
out
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
if
youre
going
to
drink
it
at
all
its
better
if
you
cant
get
the
smell
as
much
in
a
pinch
id
drink
one
or
two
of
these
overall
not
too
much
of
an
improvement
over
several
other
more
commerciallymarketed
american
lagers
but
i
have
to
say
that
it
is
better
than
some
this
is
worse
than
bud
the
vegetal
flavors
are
too
prominent
i
think
this
beer
is
close
to
being
really
good
but
is
just
a
bit
light
on
flavor
it
is
better
than
most
american
macros
however
and
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
real
good
beer
little
better
than
its
sister
smell
clean
like
green
malt
taste
light
bitter
wide
and
round
full
bodied
special
for
the
american
food
try
with
mexican
and
goat
cheeses
drink
from
the
bottle
and
in
a
pilsner
glass
try
too
in
a
mug
90
recommended
pale
yellow
in
colour
with
loads
of
carbonation
theres
some
faint
grassyspicy
hop
aroma
to
this
one
i
suspect
its
tettnanger
but
i
could
be
wrong
theres
a
touch
of
light
malt
and
sulphur
too
but
not
enough
to
be
offensive
light
malt
flavors
abound
with
the
spice
element
of
the
hops
coming
though
a
bit
more
clearly
the
bitterness
is
slightly
higher
than
most
north
american
macros
but
still
on
the
low
side
generally
speaking
this
beer
is
my
last
fall
back
when
it
comes
to
eatingdrinking
at
places
that
dont
have
much
or
any
good
beer
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
im
suprised
its
panned
as
much
as
it
is
its
nothing
special
but
its
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
pours
golden
clear
with
a
thick
white
head
that
fades
quickly

flavor
is
about

for
a
typical
lager
slightly
bitter
with
yeast
wheat
and
malt
with
the
same
citrus
notes
and
a
hint
of
hops
finish
is
again
citrus
and
slightly
bitter

is
watery
bubbly
and

i
remembered
this
being
a
lot
worse
not
as
bad
as
some
a
good
hot
weather
beer
mild
crisp
and
fairly
refreshing
this
brew
poured
a
light
golden

with
a
thin
white
head
that
dispersed
rapidly

was
crisp
with
well
blended
hops

malts
taste
was
a
refreshing
dry
malt
start
with
a
clean
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
pretty
average
nothing
noteworthy
overall
drinkability
is
ok
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
would
i
drink
this
again
maybe
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
freebie
i
doubt
id
actually
buy
it
i
remember
drinking
this
in
my
earlier
uneducated
days
just
because
it
was
from
canada
same
reason
i
drank
molson
labatt
etcetera
solid
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
fades
to
good
lacing
rich
hoppy
smell
blended
well
with
malt
skunk
aftertaste
makes
this
a
sipping
beer
and
it
is
very
filling
but
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
crisp
well
balanced
taste
boost
an
otherwise
very
low
drinkabilty
a
full
flavored
lager
less
expensive
than
other
inferior
canadian
imports
extra
style
points
kind
of
a
dull
beer
not
much
off
taste
but
nothing
great
to
detect
either
good
but
not
that
lasting
head
golden
collored
and
clear
beer
nose
is
some
maltarome
litle
citric
note
litle
aplearome
but
all
dosed
very
low
as
taste
is
litle
maltarome
litle
sweetness
little
bitter
fresh
but
overal
a
dull
brew
drinkable
but
so
is
molson
i
tried
this
with
high
hopes
that
it
would
be
as
good
as
the
movie
never
cry
wolf
made
it
sound
appearance
is
standard
golden
with
white
foam
and
soongone
lace
aroma
contains
barley
sweet
malt
and
mild
hops
initial
taste
is
clean
and
mildly
carbonated
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
snappish
hop
kick
finish
is
dry
and
leaves
no
aftertaste
okay
but
not
great
it
tastes
like
your
average
lager
and
thats
about
it
grains
malts
hoppy
at
times
goes
down
quick
and
easy
which
makes
it
great
for
a
hot
afternoon
when
you
want
something
to
gulp
12

race

the
top
smells
tinny
like
saaz
hops
with
a
very
gentle
malt
sweetness
cut
dried
hay
like
my
inlaws
barn
but
not
dirty
smelling
taste
starts
rough
bitter
then
a
gentle
malt
sweet
rolls
in
mild
and
clean
there
also
is
a
watery
flavor
later
a
mild
floral
hangs
around
in
the
aftertaste
sharp
carbonation
thats
not
too
distracting
but
carbonation
is
part
of
the
flavor
profile
superthin
mouthfeel
the
moose
is
a
cool
animal
but
does
this
beer
offer
more
than
the
coolness
of
the
moose
the
aroma
contains
skunkiness
but
overall
fairly
clean
the
white
head
dissapears
quickly
the
taste
is
so
damn
malty
and
sweet
not
pickin
much
up
in
terms
of
hoppage
though
the
sweet
plastic
tasting
nastiness
is
really
gross
at
first
this
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
just
got
more
and
more
annoying
now
i
dont
like
budwesier
but
this
is
worse
it
is
jsut
plain
queer
really
dissapointing
they
tried
to
complicate
something
that
was
meant
to
be
simple

but
doesnt
die
leaving
some
lacing
toward
the
end
has
the
grassyskunkymetallic
scent
of
a
euro
macro
on
the
palate
there
is
sweet
grain
hops
skunk
and
wet
paper
its
the
last
flavor
that
ruins
it
for
me
and
leads
me
to
believe
its
a
bad
bottle
the
body
is
light
and
tingly
with
not
much
aftertaste
and
im
sure
i
could
make
a
session
beer
out
of
some
fresh
ones
which
i
would
then
rereview
a
very
decent
lager
that
is
rather
affordable
and
doesnt
usehave
the
adjunct
flavor
of
other
lower
price
brews
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
best
canadian
macros
out
there

some

it
is

you
will
get
with
this
brand
its
sad
but
i
dont
know
why
if
i
am
in
the
maritimes
i
will
rather
drink
alexander

or
alpine
moosehead
sounds
better
to
me
for
its
hockey
team
rather
than
its
premium
beer
holy
skunk
batman
usually
the
first
thing
i
comment
on
id
the
appearance
but
i
didnt
even
get
it
out
of
the
bottle
before
this
nasty
wave
of
skunk
hit
me
didnt
get
any
better
when
i
pour
it
into
the
glass
lets
let
it
sit
for
a
bit
and
see
if
the
stink
subsides
a
bit
its
a
pale
gold
brew
with
a
small
white
rapidly
diminishing
fizzy
head
ok
the
stink
did
go
away
a
bit
but
its
still
not
pleasing
now
i
can
pick
up
a
corny
grainy
adjunct
smell
with
a
little
floral
hop
to
it
taste
is
vegetablelike
with
a
skunk
kick
even
my
belch
is
skunky
this
is
just
wrong
and
its
going
down
the
drain
i
remember
back
in
the
day
i
used
to
like
this
stuff
maybe
its
a
bad
bottle
but
looking
at
the
past
few
reviews
im
thinking
its
just
a
crappy
beer
avoid
this
is
one
of
the
worst
samples
ive
tried
of
moosehead
ill
rereview
this
beer
from
a
case
or
twelve
pack
that
hasnt
been
light
struck
as
its
not
usually
this
skunky
moosehead
lager
is
an
unoffensive
rehydrater
hey
at
least
i
didnt
make
any
moose
liquid
waste
product
references
drinkability
no
problem
putting
these
away
and
ill
likely
purchase
again
sometime
in
the
future
thanks
for
the
beer
pop
drinkability
nope
sorry
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
finish
the
bottle
ill
pass
on
these
in
the
future
reviewing
this
as
an
american
macro
lager
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
1
12
finger
head
the
head
did
hang
around
for
3
or
4
minutes
and
left
a
very
thin
head
with
ok
lace
smells
of
a
typical
macro
some
malt
with
some
bitternes
mixed
with
a
bit
of
rice
and
corn
as
far
as
taste
it
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
the
average
a
sweet
malt
finished
by
some
mild
hop
bitternes
some
rice
and
corn
notes
come
through
as
well
finishes
a
bit
dry
as
far
as
typical
macros
this
one
is
better
than
the
average
but
there
are
still
better
choices
out
there
upper
canada
lager
comes
to
mind
a
good
beer
to
always
have
available
due
to
its
drinkability
give
it
a
pass
the
rest
of
this
one
goes
down
the
sink
i
tried
this
beer
for
the
second
time
last
night
being
from
new
orleans
moosehead
isnt
really
a
beer
worth
getting
other
than
trying
it
out
from
a
bottle
i
poured
out
a
light
golden
beer
with
little
head
the
aroma
smelled
extremely
grainy
and
very
potent
my
friend
could
smell
it
from
across
the
room
as
another
thought
it
smelled
like
cereal
the
taste
was
very
typical
lager
flavor
a
little
more
grainy
than
others
i
thought
average
body
for
a
lager
nothing
to
get
worked
up
on
wasnt
a
bad
beer
just
not
all
that
good
and
i
probably
wont
have
one
for
a
long
while
since
i
thought
there
wasnt
anything
special
in
this
one
i
dont
know
why
but
ive
never
had
a
good
experience
with
moosehead
in
cans
in
bottles
its
your
typical
north
american
macro
lager
but
better
ive
almost
come
to
order
them
by
default
in
places
with
limited
selection
ive
never
noticed
the
skunk
thing
that
others
have
mentioned
if
you
find
any
moosehead
cans
with
spanish
on
them
outside
of
mexico
the
police
in
new
brunswick
are
looking
for
several
thousand
this
was
one
of
my
first
beers
outside
the
bmc
ring
albeit
its
not
much
different
although
i
assume
that
ill
always
have
a
little
soft
spot
for
the
moose
definately
wont
be
purchasing
in
bulk
anytime
soon
but
a
bottle
every
6
months
or
so
brings
back
some
memories
pours
a
super
light
straw
color
with
a
head
consisting
of
rather
large
bubbles
and
the
air
is
filled
with
that
skunked
funk
which
i
actually
dont
mind
that
much
taste
is
very
similiar
to
american
macros
but
there
is
a
little
little
little
cant
emphasize
this
enough
taste
of
some
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
very
light
despite
the
blandness
of
this
beer
i
dont
really
mind
it
but
i
dont
see
why
i
always
seemed
to
purchase
this
in
times
past
very
drinkable
if
you
can
get
past
the
smell
whispy
white
head
soon
thina
nd
blue
light
gold
body
with
quite
active
carbination
a
refreshing
nose
but
quite
vacatn
adjuncty
and
malty
what
is
there
in
ta
glass
this
beer
seems
a
lot
sweeter
than
in
the
bottle
which
is
too
sweet
long
and
sweet
finish
with
a
slight
carb
sting
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
lingering
cloyness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
and
good
but
is
should
have
kept
this
in
the
bottle
a
good
beer
to
drink
if
you
dont
want
to
be
challenged
in
any
form
neither
flavorful
nor
offputting
but
more
drinkable
than
the
typical
macro
the
beer
pours
from
the
12
ounce
green
bottle
a
translucent
gold
with
a
bountiful
bright
white
head
that
is
spumescent
in
texture
and
the
residual
lace
a
velum
like
sheet
to
coat
the
glass
nose
is
malt
somewhat
fresh
moosehead
always
at
the
first
sniff
smell
like
its
skunked
but
does
seem
to
smooth
out
after
a
few
minutes
start
is
sweet
and
fair
to
middling
in
the
malt
arena
top
is
skimpy
in
its
feel
upon
the
palate
finish
is
benignly
acidic
and
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
most
likely
will
be
another
4
years
before
i
try
this
or
the
others
again
this
beer
was
ok
but
something
about
it
did
not
really
agree
with
me
it
poured
your
standard
macro
lager
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
frothy
head
that
faded
quick
but
left
decent
lace
on
my
glass
the
smell
was
overly
sweet
with
malt
and
grain
the
flavor
was
way
too
sweet
and
had
little
to
no
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
the
grain
flavors
snuck
in
as
well
but
the
overly
sweet
flavor
dominated
too
much
not
recommended
at
all
a
watery
mouthfeel
finsih
but
it
is
oddly
quaffable
on
this
hot
summer
night
its
very
plain
but
at
least
it
remains
tolerable
i
remembered
this
beer
being
better
than
this
but
that
was
quite
some
time
ago
i
suppose
that
my
tastes
have
changed
as
i
have
sampled
more
varieties
average
thats
all
i
can
come
up
with
that
stands
out
about
moosehead
there
was
a
day
when
it
seemed
head
and
body
better
than
most
of
the
commercial
yellow
fizzy
drinks
produced
by
canuck
mega
brewers
but
there
is
so
much
micro
brew
out
there
now
the
moose
just
seems
average
pours
a
light
straw
color
high
carbonation
small
white
head
that
goes
to
nothing
but
a
ring
slight
grassy
hop
smells
mingled
with
sweet
boiled
grains
sharp
start
mediumlight
body
with
a
clean
balanced
finish
better
balanced
in
malt
sweetness
and
hop
astringency
than
most
commercial
lagers
but
still
average
ah
moosehead
it
was
actually
a
beer
of
choice
of
mine
back
in
the
day
not
so
much
now
but
i
still
enjoy
it
on
occasion
it
pours
an
unimpressive
light
golden
colour
its
highly
bubbly
and
looks
alot
closer
to
champagne
than
beer
at
times
the
smell
is
typical
of
lagers
packaged
in
green
bottles
a
bit
grainy
and
a
bit
skunked
nothing
more
to
say
luckily
this
doesnt
carry
over
into
the
flavour
which
is
nice
and
crisp
and
quite
refreshing
its
nothing
that
breaks
the
bank
but
its
better
than
any
us
macro
and
probably
better
than
all
of
the
canadian
ones
as
well
this
is
a
relatively
smooth
brew
overall
thats
quite
quaffable
especially
in
the
summer
months
not
great
overall
but
itll
quench
your
thirst
moose
great
packaging
obviously
moosehead
tends
to
be
skunky
in
a
6
pack
but
recently
i
had
it
from
a
case
so
it
was
kept
in
the
dark
not
so
skunky
i
think
i
prefer
the
skunk
not
as
good
as
molson
canadian
in
my
opinion
its
a
clear
light
gold
with
some
white
fizzy
head
smells
a
bit
hoppy
grainy
tastes
well
skunky
and
grainy
a
little
sweet
maybe
but
not
too
much
maybe
a
bit
like
cornflakes
but
less
sweet
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
that
adds
to
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
in
a
night
but
given
better
choices
i
probably
wouldnt
not
a
bad
pale
lager
too
euroskunky
and
doughy
to
have
more
than
a
couple
ng
this
is
the
first
beer
i
ever
remember
tasting
having
a
sip
from
my
dads
when
i
was
a
nipper
most
industrial
lagers
are
offensively
sweet
this
beer
demonstrates
balance
at
the
moosehead
bar
in
paris
chich
6th
arrondisement
monday
nights
is
2
for
1
nights
on
the
moosehead
lager
why
its
obvious
you
rarely
get
a
bottled
beer
on
such
a
discount
of
its
any
good
but
this
macro
served
at
extreme
freezing
temperatures
like
just
pulled
out
of
freakin
north
canada
is
nothing
to
preach
favourably
about
gassy
flavourless
and
overhopped
when
balanced
against
the
rest
of
the
content
it
proves
what
the
spirit
of
the
mooseheads
monday
night
2
for
1
is
quantity
over
quality
the
drink
was
very
clean
and
refreshing
i
just
wasnt
that
impressed
with
it
i
guess
i
was
hopeing
for
alot
more
hop
presense
it
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
this
is
a
better
than
average
canadian
lager
served
out
of
a
green
bottle
ack
but
should
be
okay
due
to
the
12
pack
packaging
nice
maltysweet
taste
to
the
beer
a
head
that
lasts
longer
than
most
and
i
was
a
bit
surpised
by
the
amount
of
lacing
that
this
beer
left
given
the
fact
it
is
a
macro
slight
smell
of
malted
barley
perhaps
some
corn
and
or
rice
but
not
as
present
as
most
macros
could
use
another
shot
of
hops
but
very
very
drinkable
as
it
is
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
is
light
with
a
slight
malt
scent
and
a
pleasant
green
bottle
skunky
smell
the
taste
is
good
it
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
skunky
green
bottle
flavor
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
canadian
lager
it
has
a
decent
aroma
and
good
lager
flavor
pours
to
a
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
to
a
tiny
ring
of
foam
color
is
pale
yellow
aroma
is
initially
skunky
mostly
due
to
age
and
poor
handling
that
it
receives
in
oklahoma
the
skunk
fades
away
to
reveal
a
crisp
sweet
malt
aroma
backed
up
by
alcohol
and
noble
hops
tastes
malty
and
tartnot
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
suggests
rather
dry
and
mildly
bitter
decent
balance
with
residual
malt
sweetness
and
carbonation
bite
in
the
finish
easy
to
drink
tastes
better
than
i
remember
it
being
this
would
be
drinkable
enough
at
a
summer
party
or
the
like
small
step
up
from
the
likes
of
michelob
etc
better
than
the
national
brands
by
a
moose
whisker
if
youa
re
surrounded
by
national
brands
you
can
get
by
on
one
of
these
if
you
sip
it
as
some
maltiness
and
carbonation
unattractive
yellow
and
short
but
immense
sudsy
foam
grainy
more
drinkable
with
food
all
in
all
this
is
a
quality
beer
good
drinkability
but
here
this
isnt
exactly
cheap
i
remember
when
this
was
the
greatest
beer
ever
its
ok
drinkability
perfect
session
beer
carbonated
just
enough
to
keep
it
crisp
and
have
it
go
down
smoothly
clean
easy
drinking
taste
and
a
touch
of
character
i
really
do
love
this
beer
ill
never
call
it
great
but
it
is
good
i
consider
this
to
be
a
quintessential
canadian
beer
yep
pretty
much
the
same
after
twenty
years
still
sporting
that
funky
olive
flavor
that
ive
yet
to
find
in
any
other
beer
otherwise
moosehead
is
a
pretty
uninspiring
unremarkable
beer
that
i
can
wait
another
twenty
years
before
trying
again
drinkability

i
cant
believe
that
i
used
to
like
this
beer
drinkable
and
decent
pours
out
clear
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
weak
with
some
slight
skunkiness
and
a
whiff
of
grains
taste
starts
of
ok
basically
alot
like
a
heineken
some
faint
hops
and
grains
then
everything
turns
to
nastiness
a
saccarine
sweetness
kicks
in
halfway
through
your
sip
with
no
flavor
just
sweetness
like
powdered
sugar
making
this
one
nasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
that
taste
lingers
drinkablity
is
decent
if
you
can
get
past
that
sweetness
pick
up
a
cheaper
macro
instead
quite
impressive
lager
pours
a
golden
colour
topped
by
an
acceptable
white
head
that
settled
after
a
couple
of
sips
this
beer
is
slightly
more
bitter
in
the
flavour
than
other
lagers
though
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
beer
all
night
long
tried
this
one
for
the
first
time
and
found
it
to
be
a
unique
beer
each
one
had
a
hint
of
skunky
flavor
but
not
to
the
extent
that
it
ruined
all
the
flavor
from
earlier
postings
i
suppose
this
is
the
effect
that
this
brew
is
supposed
to
have
besides
the
touch
of
stale
flavor
it
was
rather
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
aftertaste
that
was
not
all
that
displeasing
poured
out
to
a
lighter
golden
color
with
a
decent
over
bubbly
head
for
some
reason
this
beer
was
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
not
better
not
worse
just
different
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
this
brew
again
as
it
was
kind
of
expensive
for
the
overall
experience
but
it
may
be
for
you
worth
a
try
if
you
are
open
to
a
different
kind
of
beer
straw
golden
hue
with
a
creamy
mountainous
white
head
very
nicely
textured
leaves
behind
thickests
of
lacing
primarily
smells
of
sweet
grain
not
bad
at
all
but
there
is
a
hop
aroma
here
to
balance
the
sweetness
good
representation
of
a
solid
all
around
drinkable
lager
very
clean
and
inviting
but
there
have
been
times
when
ive
had
6
packs
this
time
i
sided
with
a
12
pack
split
with
a
friend
only
five
bucks
a
piece
not
bad
eh
taste
is
full
on
sweetness
fresh
cracked
grains
a
malty
lager
with
a
nice
bite
of
hops
in
the
finish
considered
flavorful
side
by
side
other
macro
north
american

could
be
a

for
the

taste
is

bland

and
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
lots
of

on

in
the

this
beer
is
pretty
bad
nice
golden
brew
with
a
generous
head
strong
skunky
taste
with
a
small
malt
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
light
brew
this
is
one
of
the
worst
macro
i
had
for
a
while
i
dont
see
the
need
to
drink
this
again
and
again
why
are
they
using
light
green
bottle
known
to
people
in
new
brunswick
as
moose
green
the
label
is
green
a
near
perfect
clear
gold
that
has
a
small
but
aromatic
releasing
head
the
smell
of
malt
is
very
pleasant
and
you
can
taste
it
but
you
can
also
taste
the
hops
too
feels
pretty
good
in
the
mouth
and
is
still
refreshing
after
its
gone
down
it
stands
alone
well
on
a
summer
afternoon
or
with
a
hamburger
done
on
the
bbq
on
a
cold
january
first
its
a
better
lager
than
most
its
an
overall
above
average
average
lager
and
tops
any
macro
ive
had

if
you
imagine
hard

refreshing

very
drinkable
straight
and
simple
a
session
lager
for
pool
darts
or
karaoke
it
lets
you
focus
on
what
you
are
doing
rather
than
on
what
you
are

you
get
down
to
business
very
pale

color
small

a
light

aroma
a
medium
bodied
sweet
tasting
lager
there
is
some
maltyness
and
some
hoppyness
but
its
masked
by
the
sweetness
very
carbonated
better
than
most
of
the
eurolagers
but
still
not
very
good
i
used
to
love
this
stuff
either
my
tastes
have
changed
or
this
beer
is
really
different
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
another
mundane
canadian
beer
this
beer
is
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
and
nothing
interesting
about
it
very
average
beer
but
very
drinkable
as
well
it
fits
in
with
the
other
canadian
beers
like
lebatt
and
molson
nothing
to
see
here
folks
move
along
this
one
looked
like
a
normal
lager
but
definitely
not
light
which
is
good
smelled
sweet
and
nice
taste
is
of
generic
malts
and
little
hops
finishes
better
than
most
lagers
but
nothing
stands
out
too
much
money
for
its
quality
better
from
the
tap
than
from
the
bottle
ontap
color
is
straw
gold
somewhat
pale
thin
loose
white
head
with
small
spots
of
lacing
smell
is
of
fresh
grains
with
good
malted
barley
sweetness
and
clean
easy
hops
taste
is
crisp
medium
maltyness
very
clean
a
bit
breadish
hops
linger
in
quickly
with
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
and
then
leaves
with
a
fresh
drying
grain
texture
that
kinda
pulls
any
harsh
sweetness
away
lending
a
crisp
clean
after
taste
and
since
it
comes
in
a
green
bottle
that
harsh
sweetness
can
be
overbearing
if
its
old
and
been
exposed
to
alot
of
light
thats
why
i
stick
with
it
being
ontap
its
much
fresher
in
this
form
and
makes
for
some
pretty
easy
drinkin
no
freshness
date
still
a
simple
good
lager

i
say
maple

simple
good
lager
id
probably
rate
this
better
if
the
skunk
didnt
get
to
it
first
but
overall
this
beer
seems
like
a
average
macro
and
is
probably
quite
refreshing
if
its
a
fresh
batch
cheers
boring
but
not
bad
flavor
out
of
the
tap
for
this
one
it
is
a
bit
better
than
the
bottled
version
slightly
bitter
but
mostly
sweet
with
a
lot
of
grains
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
it
is
definitely
not
the
worst
thing
you
could
fall
back
on
at
the
bar
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
if
not
impressive
beer
the
color
smell
and
taste
are
all
quite
average
nice
head
little
retention
i
like
the
packaging
even
though
the
green
bottle
creates
the
less
than
optimum
taste
and
smell
this
is
a
thirst
quenching
inexpensive
and
enjoyable
summer
beer
huge
snowwhite
head
with
modest
carbonation
and
thick
lace
crystalclear
medium
golden
color
aroma
is
extremely
skunky
so
much
so
that
my
fiancees
cat
who
was
nearby
when
i
poured
this
wrinkled
her
nose
also
notable
in
the
aroma
is
a
strong
grain
component
and
slightly
spicy
hops
taste
begins
with
solid
light
malt
flavors
and
a
sweet
almost
honeylike
note
carbonation
is
quite
smooth
towards
the
finish
there
is
a
brief
spike
of
spicy
hops
there
and
then
gone
quite
quickly
the
finish
is
utterly
clean
a
smooth
and
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
this
was
a
favorite
of
mine
during
college
when
i
could
afford
it
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
to
be
all
around
an
average
beer
but
it
is
a
little
better
than
id
thought
itd
be
this
is
the
canadian
beer
in
my
book
its
definately
a
mass
produced
beer
but
the
quality
shows
through
it
is
average
to
above
average
in
all
respects
pours
medium
yellow
with
a
good
head
the
taste
is
malty
with
decent
hoppiness
has
a
crisp
distinct
flavor
a
little
skunk
did
not
deter
the
experience
i
liked
this
i
wish
all
macros
tasted
this
good
i
have
also
tried
this
from
a
keg
and
it
is
excellent
oh
canada
moosehead
pours
out
a

my
glass

aromas
of

aftertaste
this
lager
has
character
and
gives
hope
to
those
who
think
all
mass
produced
american
style
lagers
suck
moosehead
is
a
canadian
classic
and
a
lager
to
be
respected
slightly
more
rich
and
golden
than
straw
in
color
the
beer
was
topped
with
a
dense
layer
of
fine
white
foam
which
was
sticking
slightly
to
the
glass
it
smelled
very
clean
like
pale
malt
and
hops
maybe
a
little
bit
of
husk
too
ill
have
to
have
another
since
i
was
a
little
stuffed
up
malt
flavor
was
present
which
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
given
the
style
and
what
ive
had
in
the
past
bitterness
too
was
at
decent
levels
but
without
any
lingering
the
hop
bitterness
along
with
some
alcohol
dried
out
the
finish
making
it
a
very
enjoyable
gulping
beer
compared
to
many
other
beers
of
the
style
moosehead
is
great
i
wont
buy
this
often
because
i
cant
rationalize
spending
premium
on
american
lagers
but
if
they
were
all
priced
the
same
and
i
wanted
an
american
lager
this
would
be
the
choice
no
questions
asked
hey
moosehead
chuck
the
green
bottles
poured
to
a
brilliant
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
lasts
the
aromas
are
of
light
malt
and
hops
with
a
bit
of
grain
aromas
as
well
again
like
in
the
aromas
the
flavors
are
of
light
hop
and
malt
and
a
bit
of
grain
flavors
moosehead
is
a
very
smooth
crisp
clean
lager
which
makes
it
go
down
really
easy
it
has
more
flavor
than
your
average
mainstream
american
lagers
before
a
good
friend
by
the
name
of
hootie
introduced
me
to
the
beauty
of
good
beer
with
my
first
hoegardden
on
tap
at
ds
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
still
like
it
but
my
no
means
or
to
any
extent
does
it
touch
my
top
40
list
smell
is
a
little
grainy
taste
is
smooth
smooth
smooth
i
always
thought
its
had
almost
a
creamy
taste
to
it
but
by
reading
the
reviews
of
many
other
bas
im
starting
to
think
that
just
may
have
been
me
flavor
is
far
more
malty
than
hops
hop
taste
is
insignificant
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
one
of
the
highlights
of
this
brew
feels
great
on
the
tongue
palate
and
the
rest
of
the
way
down
many
people
knock
this
brew
as
just
another
canadien
import
but
it
is
far
superior
to
anything
that
comes
into
my
distributor
while
i
may
in
defense
say
i
am
in
meadville
where
the
public
tend
to
have
less
teeth
that
grades
of
high
school
completed
it
just
makes
no
sense
to
me
that
this
bottle
is
green
why
take
a
chance
of
skunkiness
also
ive
tended
to
stay
away
from
this
brew
to
its
price
and
the
fact
that
well
the
same
company
imports
this
as
corona
could
that
be
the
reason
for
high
prices
good
plain
beer
nothing
special
butt
not
bad
smells
of
sweet
corn
and
grain
come
from
this
ultraclear
pale
yelloworange
beer
it
pours
a
large
2
12
finger
white
head
that
is
quite
impressive
for
the
style
although
not
at
all
complex
this
is
an
extremely
smooth
beer
with
a
little
character
to
please
as
well
mild
carb
bite
in
the
beginning
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
and
grain
contained
in
a
semisweet
maybe
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
very
drinkable
although
this
is
a
very
simple
beer
it
is
an
easylike
beer
but
just
like
music
easylike
you
tend
to
get
bored
with
it
sooner
than
one
that
has
to
grow
on
you
good
beer
in
comparison
to
others
in
this
style
cheers
in
high
school
this
was
the
exotic
canadian
import
tastes
pretty
much
like
molson
although
the
moose
really
inspires
me
good
outdoor
beer
we
were
in
high
school
the
taste
is
pleasant
enough
and
after
three
who
really
tasted
it
anyways
think
i
will
crack
one
open
now
this
is
as
good
as
any
other
canadian
the
difference
i
experience
in
the
canadians
is
the
smooth
drinkability
it
seems
to
be
their
marquee
note
the
overall
appearance
is
good
smell
and
taste
are
what
you
would
expect
from
an
above
average
lager
present
tones
of
spice
and
hop
aromas
goes
down
smooth
and
stays
there
when
fresh
moosehead
lager
can
be
refreshing
and
crisp
but
when
light
struck
youll
want
to
hold
your
nose
a
pale
golden
wellcarbonated
body
forms
a
beautiful
compact
and
foamy
white
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
hop
spiciness
but
not
much
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
crisp
malt
notes
lead
at
first
followed
by
a
wellbalanced
hop
bitterness
lingering
into
a
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
the
canadian
version
is
a
very
nicelybrewed
north
american
lager
too
bad
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
its
americanimported
version
nothing
great
but
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
a
clean
and
quick
to
drink
lager
better
than
many
us
lagers
with
a
bit
more
quality
and
the
same
drinkability
no
one
aspect
blows
you
away
but
not
bad
all
together
slightly
sweet
apple
notes
or
maybe
it
was
the
green
bottleugh
but
bottom
line
nothing
struck
me
about
this
beer
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
luckily
i
didnt
get
a
skunky
bottle
clear
straw
hue
topped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
generic
sweetness
light
sulfur
with
a
very
subdued
floral
hop
nose
in
aroma
the
typically
bland
flavor
profile
is
comprised
of
a
quick
snap
of
hop
bitterness
upfront
followed
by
dextrin
sweetness
and
pronounced
corn
notes
when
coupled
with
the
watery
mouthfeel
this
brew
goes
down
easy
but
is
uttery
unremarkable
moosehead
is
only
a
notch
above
typical
megaswill
in
enjoyment
well
i
hate
to
be
such
a
conformist
but
this
is
a
really
bad
brew
the
only
good
thing
i
can
think
of
is
the
head
which
was
there
but
not
too
thick
nor
thin
the
aroma
was
that
of
formaldehide
or
something
similar
the
beer
is
actually
drinkable
but
i
think
it
is
the
bottle
that
is
green
that
is
causing
all
of
the
problems
this
is
skunky
it
seems
like
a
bit
more
watery
heineken
it
was
very
pale
had
a
slight
bubbley
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
starts
with
a
skunky
taste
and
finishes
with
an
even
skunkier
aftertaste
the
only
thing
i
can
really
say
about
this
brew
is
the
attractive
logo
on
the
bottle
the
smell
really
tuned
me
off
before
i
even
tasted
it
and
then
the
taste
confirmed
it
very
skunky
and
such
a
bad
after
taste
im
sure
some
like
this
beer
but
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
should
i
say
beer
lol

what
remains
is
a

gassy
beer
thats
not
very
pleasant
to
swallow
a
slightly
skunked
macro
in
taste

impression
good

better
than
budwieser

this

of

this

poured

left

the

of

i
had
friends
in
college
from
canada
so
i
always
had
them
introducing
different
beers
to
me
from
there
nation
one
of
them
loved
this
beer
but
i
have
never
been
that
impressed
with
it
i
found
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
smell
not
very
good
at
all
funky
skunk
taste
watery
weak
and
a
waste
of
money
for
what
you
pay
for
16
aussie
dollars
a
sixer
around
8us
tastes
like
evry
other
mass
produced
lager
ever
made
quite
sweet
very
one
dimensional
mass
market
style
lager
zzzzzzzz
not
too
bad
id
drink
it
over
budweiser
anyday
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
side
and
a
little
watery
but
definitely
drinkable
itd
be
an
option
for
a
summer
cookout
beer
notes
a
clean
and
quick
to
drink
lager
better
than
its
us
counterpart
while
leaving
a
touch
more
quality
without
taking
away
from
the
swift
drinkability
of
most
american
lagers
very
drinkable
lager
if
fresh
better
then
budweiser
lager
i
thought
it
was
crisp
with
a
clean
finish
the
poor
smell
is
for
the
semioccasional
skunky
bottle
otherwise
a
very
drinkable
golden
brew
with
a
decently
clean
finish
good
lawnmower
beer
and
ive
yet
to
find
a
beer
that
in
all
seriousness
causes
people
to
belch
as
much
as
moosehead
is
it
the
carbonation
i
have
no
idea
not
a
bad
canadien
lager
best
drunk
when
cold
and
fresh
can
be
extremely
skunky
good
body
and
fairly
well
balanced
consistent
from
start
to
finish
easy
to
drink
and
although
it
does
not
have
a
lot
of
depth
of
flavor
it
is
probably
a
little
more
flavorful
than
the
average
american
lager
as
usual
abita
brews
very
refreshing
with
high
drinkability
i
guess
that
reflects
what
the
local
staggering
hot
climate
demands
but
this
is
way
too
bland
which
is
fine
they
want
to
get
a
piece
of
the
mass
brews
with
something
better
overall
a
nice
clean
tasting
beer
light
enough
to
drink
all
summer
long
this
is
not
your
watered
down
tv
light
has
a
decent
flavor
o
a
nonoffensive
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
dull
euro
lager
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
but
feel
the
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
just
a
bit
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
by
this
but
i
could
still
put
back
a
few
of
these
clear
and
a
pale
yellowish
colour
with
a
creamy
cap
of
white
foam
great
head
retention
not
one
of
my
favourite
hop
aromas
really
sulfury
and
floral
slight
sweet

in

is

pale
malt
and
noble
hops
with
a
slightly
spicy

biscuity
finish
mouthfeel
is
super
light
and
well
carbonated
this
beer
is
what
most
american
light
lagers
should
be
light
but
with
a
decent
malt
and
hop
character
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
the
labeling
now
mentions
it
is
brewed
in
the
style
of
a
munich
helles
its
not
exactly
there
but
close
enough
to
draw
such
a
comparison
o
nothing
bad
about
it
but
not
great
either
i
was
rather
disappointed
in
how
watery
it
tasted
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
pale
gold
with
a
twofinger
length
white
head
there
are
plenty
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
indicating
plentiful
carbonation
the
head
dissipates
slowly
there
isnt
much
lacing
it
has
the
classic
pale
lager
smell
there
are
light
bready
malts
aroma
it
smells
clean
and
grassy
the
flavor
is
of
pale
malt
its
slightly
sweet
and
bready
there
isnt
much
hop
bitterness
to
speak
of
its
a
very
clean
flavor
the
body
is
light
and
there
is
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
a
drinkable
pale
lager
that
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
abita
accomplished
what
it
set
out
to
do
with
this
beer
o
this
is
what
id
tell
the
people
who
prefer
bmc
to
drink
if
they
happen
to
be
looking
for
craft
beer
pass
just
ok
descent
flavor
but
most
of
the
other
characteristics
could
use
much
improvement
pours
clear
golden
with
a
small
white
ring
for
a
head
that
disappears
as
quick
as
it
showed
up
smell
and
taste
is
your
typical
adjunct
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
overall
i
dont
think
i
was
expecting
much
but
this
is
a
disappointment
this
might
be
worse
than
coors
light
not
worth
seeeking
out
guess
i
had
high
hopes
because
i
liked
turbo
dog
the
rest
this
beer
is
just
soso
not
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
pretty
thin
body
make
this
an
unremarkable
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
minimal
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
dough
and
vanilla
its
flavor
has
lemon
and
banana
notes
with
a
faint
hint
of
lime
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
like
beer
flavored
champagne
abita
golden
is
a
decent
beer
crisp
and
very
refreshing
recommended
overall
my
first
beer
in
new
orleans
post
katrina
had
to
be
from
abita
the
brewery
i
have
drunk
so
often
when
rooting
on
the
saints
this
version
is
a
very
sessionable
lager
that
is
borderline
pils
nothing
too
fancy
but
a
good
light
beer
that
i
could
have
a
six
of
d
more
co2
and
more
of
a
hop
presence
woulda
vastly
improved
this
beer
not
bad
but
meh
d
low
abv
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
great
deal
of
flavors
here
just
your
normal
apl
d
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
your
generic
macro
lager
but
not
much
more
it
doesnt
offer
anything
in
the
way
of
exciting
flavors
or
complexities
but
its
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
i
know
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
abita
beers
even
if
this
isnt
the
best
example
d
very
drinkable
while
there
is
nothing
truly
outstanding
about
this
beer
it
is
at
the
very
least
easy
to
drink
pours
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
very
pale
yellow
with
just
a
little
bit
of
foam
weak
smell
is
mostly
grain
reminds
me
of
a
macro
light
beer
flavor
is
strange
is
it
skunked
still
has
a
light
beer
flavor
but
with
a
slightly
bitter
oily
body
behind
it
its
hard
to
get
through
even
one
glass
let
alone
have
it
in
any
quantity
im
starting
to
gather
that
abita
has
a
certain
characteristic
body
and
this
is
another
example
i
cant
find
anything
to
recommend
this
but
you
might
like
it
if
you
like
turbodog
geez
these
guys
can
make
great
beer
when
they
want
to
why
o
why
do
they
put
stuff
like
this
out
there
poured
with
a
small
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
hazy
gold
aroma
is
a
bit
skunky
malt
cereal
flavor
is
like
aroma
plus
a
generous
dash
of
kerosene
body
is
not
bad
but
carbonation
is
razor
sharp
finish
is
like
flavor
and
best
forgotton
which
is
easy
to
do
in
this
case
theres
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
neither
is
there
anything
particularly
awesome
its
refreshing
grainy
and
lemony
without
much
hops
its
got
a
haze
that
isnt
all
that
attractive
overall
this
feels
like
cheap
beer
at
expensive
beer
prices
rjt
and
high
marks
for
drinkability
as
well
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
abita
beer
but
i
could
still
kick
back
a
few
while
watching
lsu
play
or
destroying
a
crawfish
boil
dm
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
it
was
the
expense
of
any

poured
from

into

with
12
inch
head
aroma
is
mild
slightly
grainy
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
some
maltiness
but
not
very
strong
flavor
feels
good
in
mouth
and
is
a
very
drinkable
warm
weather
beer
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
holy
head
batman
the
twoplus
fingers
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
could
have
been
used
in
advertising
what
with
its
great
retention
the
nose
had
a
slight
saaz
quality
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
lemon
yellow
taste
was
more
pilsnerish
than
lager
mouthfeel
was
medium
finish
was
slightly
dry
this
was
a
table
beer
if
i
ever
had
one
overallsolid
beer
i
have
no
problems
with
it
definitely
get
yourself
a
sample
a
very
golden
beer
which
pours
a
nice
head
that
soon
dissipates
it
may
be
just
this
particular
beer
i
got
but
it
has
somewhat
of
a
flat
taste
needs
more
bite
i
thought
the
smell
was
pretty
desirable
enough
of
an
aroma
to
give
you
something
to
like
smells
like
some
citrus
ill
have
to
try
another
one
to
see
if
maybe
just
this
particular
beer
is
a
bit
flat
and
not
the
beer
overall
if
not
the
score
could
be
lowered
considerably
i
typically
have
like
what
ive
had
from
abita
though
really
nice
atmosphere
solid
appearance
a
really
strong
head
and
substantial
lacing
plus
a
fairly
complex
nose
flavor
is
not
bad
but
also
not
much
there
this
leaves
the
feel
a
little
flat
as
well
of
course
does
have
good
drinkability
because
its
so
mild
and
light
it
has
a
certain
refreshing
quality
if
youre
looking
for
something
serviceable
to
just
power
through
a
few
of
this
is
a
good
candidate
nice
quaff
d
this
beer
would
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
the
summertime
to
quench
the
thirst
if
not
for
the
high
amounts
of
carbonation
which
seems
to
accompany
most
abitas
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
a
freind
notes
from
72508
as
american
lagers
go
this
one
is
better
than
most
it
has
a
grassy
hop
aroma
with
plenty
of
malt
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
and
the
head
is
small
the
flavor
is
evenly
balanced
between
bitter
and
sweet
the
malt
is
bread
like
and
there
is
a
hay
like
quality
to
it
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
corn
taste
in
the
finish
but
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
good
lager
it
doesnt
have
the
metallic
or
garbage
taste
so
common
to
macro
lagers
i
will
buy
this
again
a
solid
summertime
quencher
from
abita
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
overall
a
nice
tasty
brew
very
light
with
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
representative
of
the
style
i
would
buy
a
case
of
this
its
just
nice
nothing
really
exciting
going
on
with
this
brew
its
just
generally
an
all
around
tasty
brew
that
would
be
good
for
sitting
around
with
some
friends

well
this
is
your
typical
slug
in
the
sun
kind
of
beer
with
a
fancy
name
at
least
ive
never
heard
of
them
golden
colored
small
head
some
lacing
it
looks
slightly
better
than
a
bud
coors
or
miller
somewhat
grassy
tasting
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
lemon
but
overall
its
watery
its
important
to
note
that
there
is
no
skunk
or
foul
taste
to
this
its
very
easy
drinking
but
theres
just
not
much
to
it
i
wont
buy
it
again
as
ill
just
buy
the
cheap
stuff
to
suit
this
purpose
but
ill
drink
one
if
someone
gives
it
to
me
thinbodied
and
watery
the
drink
is
refreshing
and
easy
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
especially
on
a
cool
summer
day
not
a
bad
beer
from
abita
at
all
and
its
pretty
tasty
for
a
lager
it
just
needs
a
little
more
to
it
very
drinkable
due
to
the
lightness
of
the
drink
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
on
a
warm
afternoon
d
this
beer
really
lacked
much
flavor
it
didnt
taste
like
most
allmalt
lagers

its
funny
to
see
microbrew
references
in
movies
an
abita
purple
haze
sign
is
seen
in
the
background
of
larry
the
cable
guys
health
inspector
they
also
drink
dogfish
head
a
lot
in
reno
911
but
anyway
i
enjoyed
purple
haze
so
i
decided
to
try
the
golden
ale
served
it
well
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
wan
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
was
corny
sweet
like
a
cup
of
kelloggs
corn
flakes
taste
was
similar
bt
not
as
sweet
mild
hop
background
i
would
stick
with
purple
haze
this
was
not
a
good
beer
unless
you
like
sucking
on
nickels
otherwise
you
might
as
well
just
have
a
bud
lite
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
that
was
in
an
abita
party
pack
into
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
had
a
clear
golden
color
hence
the
name
with
a
white
1
head
that
reduced
to
minimal
lacing
no
sheen
no
charlie
sheen
and
no
emilio
estevez
smells
like
clean
water
and
sweet
corn
had
a
well
balanced
crisp
taste
the
colder
the
better
good
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
similar
to
most
mass
produced
american
beers
with
a
less
watery
feel
i
could
throw
back
an
icecold
6
pack
at
a
bbq
or
ballgame
very
easily
appears
a
pale
fizzy
golden
only
a
few
shades
lighter
than
the
abita
light
a
standard
crystal
clear
pale
helles
style
lager
look
with
a
bit
more
fizzy
carbonation
that
a
german
version
lacing
is
sporadic
and
light
as
the
thick
bright
white
head
quickly
dwindles
down
to
a
collar
aroma
light
two
row
bring
out
cereal
grains
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
more
biscuit
pale
malts
really
are
nice
here
with
a
touch
of
hallertau
herbal
hop
bouquet
flavor
is
creamy
smooth
and
crisp
with
those
biscuit
malts
really
coming
out
in
liquid
cereal
nature
with
a
smidge
of
finishing
herbal
hops
to
add
in
that
signature
hop
burp
im
sure
they
sell
a
ton
of
this
around
the
brewery
but
i
see
why
it
doesnt
get
much
attention
up
this
away
its
only
incrementally
better
than
your
standard
bmc
mouthfeel
is
still
light
syrup
with
tickling
carbonation
that
really
effects
the
back
of
the
throat
drinkability
is
downright
effortless
yet
not
complex
enough
in
flavor
to
keep
me
coming
back
again
and
again
pretty
damn
boring
pours
a
nearly
clear
piss
yellow
color
has
hardly
any
color
at
all
i
think
natty
light
has
more
color
and
carbonation
smell
is
barely
tangible
and
what
little
smell
there
is
is
just
corn
and
water
taste
is
also
non
existant
im
trying
hard
not
to
bash
this
beer
but
there
isnt
much
to
even
bash
about
its
basically
boring
without
hardly
any
substance
id
avoid
o
an
ok
session
beer
poured
a
clear
goldenyellow

with

rather
quickly

was
not
real
prominent
but
a
bit
malty
flavor
was
malty
without
any
real
hop
presence
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
one
not
very
complex
and
not
meant
to
be
good
sessionable
lager
pured
a
golden
color
so
i
guess
the
name
is
appropriate
formed
a
tight
bubbled
half
inch
heead
smelled
sweet
and
corny
the
odor
was
a
little
offputting
the
taaste
was
good
however
not
very
sweet
good
grainy
taste
nicely
carbonated
no
problem
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
beats
a
bmc
it
was
a
great
beer
something
id
have
again
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
you
could
definetly
drink
more
then
one
because
the
taste
is
not
to
heavy
id
say
buy
a
six
it
is
worth
it
golden
yellow
transparent
pilsner
body
head
is
swift
in
its
descent
and
thins
to
a
partial
white
hallertau
hops
noticeable
and
metallic
malt
is
present
predicatble
but
not
annoying
slow
effervescent
bubbles
creamy
soft
palate
with
a
late
malt
kick
crisp
soft
rather
unobtrusive
flavor
golden
yesconsistent
in
its
modesty
and
a
true
member
of
its
style
pours
as
is
expected
clear
straw
no
head
nose
smells
like
a
skunks
ass
is
this
a
bad
beer
or
is
it
just
a
bad
beer
overall
flavor
is
okay
kind
of
grainy
and
metallic
with
a
very
slight
sweet
tone
to
it
leaves
a
pretty
decent
sweet
aftertaste
feel
is
thin
on
the
liquid
and
pretty
good
with
the
carbonation
overall
it
has
a
decent
drinkability
factor
i
mean
it
is
a
malt
lager
and
doesnt
really
have
a
strong
quality
to
it
if
this
is
your
thing
go
for
it
if
not
id
say
consider
passing
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
with
a
respectable
white
head
a
little
bit
of
lacing
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
light
on
malt
and
has
a
slight
grassy
hop
in
there
the
taste
is
also
lightweight
a
slight
bit
of
tangy
spicy
something
a
malt
somewhere
between
cardboard
and
stale
crackers
a
decent
hop
bittering
rather
bland
but
drinkable
the
body
is
light
to
medium
but
the
saving
grace
is
a
nice
effervescent
carbonation
that
activates
any
slight
flavor
in
all
drinkable
but
enjoyable
eh
doverall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
the
aroma
is
pretty
inviting
and
the
taste
and
feel
doesnt
let
me
down
from
there
not
an
alltime
great
but
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
with
some
cajun
food
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
for
tailgating
at
southern
miss
games
its
easy
to
drink
is
flavorful
yet
light
enough
to
drink
in
quantity
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
pale
grainy
malt
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hallertauer
hops
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
the
typical
light
lager
flavors
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
prickly
from
the
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
lager
that
is
very
refreshing
but
nothing
special
if
you
consider
the
style
its
not
too
bad
it
has
more
taste
than
the
standard
macro
lager
but
otherwise
not
too
much
better
than
the
macro
lager
poured
from
a
12
oz
into
pint
glass
aroma
is
nasty
and
wont
be
missed
the
head
was
crisp
with
tony
bubbles
and
disappeared
rather
quickly
poured
a
straw
color
there
is
a
good
malty
flavor
with
biscuit
hints
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
an
average
golden
ale
and
for
7
a
six
pack
wasnt
a
bad
deal
wont
buy
again
however
because
it
really
takes
a
special
golden
ale
for
me
to
be
a
repeat
buyer
this
one
was
not
that
i
enjoyed
the
nice
slightly
tart
and
crisp
carbonation
lifted
malt
hop
team
adjuncts
seem
to
be
kept
low
in
the
grain
bill
i
could
almost
taste
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
in
the
last
swallow
abita
golden
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
just
a
slight
grainy
smell
the
flavor
is
also
grainy
with
kind
of
an
off
flavor
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
almost
like
stale
cigarette
smoke
id
pass
on
this
one
last
and
final
chance
for
this
brewery
to
impress
me
yet
another
soda
water
fucking
beer
i
do
not
get
the
appeal
of
this
brewery
their
beers
taste
like
water
and
alcohol
with
some
artificial
flavorings
and
soda
water
type
carbonation
do
they
brew
with
carbonated
water
the
last
beer
i
will
ever
try
from
them
i
have
given
this
brewery
chance
after
chance
the
turbo
dog
was
decent
but
this
brewery
produces
beers
that
are
offensive
to
my
taste
buds
maybe
you
will
like
them
maybe
they
just
hit
me
the
wrong
way
but
damn
dude
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
freshness
date
on
the
label
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
clear
gold
forming
a
very
thin
white
head
and
leaving
no
lacing
very
little
carbonation
aroma
is
malt
and
grain
nothing
exciting
or
complex
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
thick
malts
a
semisweet
caramel
flavoring
and
ending
with
the
notsoharsh
grainy
finish
medium
mouthfeel
an
easy
enough
beer
to
drink
but
the
lack
of
flavor
keeps
this
from
being
a
sessionable
beer
overall
tastes
a
little
better
than
olde
english
800
worth
a
try
got
in
a
sampler
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
on
back
label
had
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
good
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
trace
of
foam
and
no
lacing
the
smell
was
not
that
pleasant
and
was
straight
malt
no
sweetness
or
hops
the
taste
was
bland
and
just
north
of
a
miller
lite
only
worth
drinking
if
nothing
better
around
or
if
you
just
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
beer
and
dont
care
about
taste
3
na
tie
n
the
third
beer
in
tha
abita
party
pack
my
patience
is
begining
to
wear
thin
with
them
poured
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
lasted
about
a
minute
no
lacing
and
the
taste
was
weak
this
could
actually
be
a
light
beer
clear
and
light
haze
in
the
glass
well
three
more
to
go
i
hope
it
gets
better
i
got
this
12
ounze
bottle
from
an
abita
party
pack
at
kunda
bev
i
poured
into
a
large
20
ounze
glass
there
was
less
than
a
finger
of
head
the
head
had
decent
retention
but
produced
no
lace
at
all
absolutly
none
the
color
was
the
clearest
gold
i
have
ever
seen
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
smell
the
taste
was
pretty
good
and
wellblended
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
a
fair
beer
dont
drink
and
review
when
drinking
it
was
a
very
bland
no
real
apparent
taste
with
a
slight
sour
note
at
the
end
almost
flat
like
in
flavor
but
just
enough
there
to
keep
me
guessing
what
it
was
i
was
missing
in
its
taste
overall
good
for
the
style
but
its
pretty
plain
overall
a
light
golden
that
fails
on
all
aspects
except
for
its
watery
quenching
abilities
an
excellent
lager
and
one
of
my
favorites
on
the
abita
lineup
strawgold
color
that
isnt
very
remarkable
and
in
fact
lends
itself
to
a
typical
macrobrew
the
taste
doesnt
necessarily
stand
out
either
as
far
as
lagers
go
its
a
medium
lager
though
within
this
genre
i
feel
like
it
tastes
lighter
than
traditional
lagers
according
to
the
label
it
contains
pilsner
malts
which
i
think
contributes
to
its
body
and
taste
abita
very
accurately
matches
creole
food
with
this
beer
while
the
amber
will
remain
my
favorite
for
a
humid
night
and
good
food
golden
acquites
itself
well
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
small
white
foamy
rapidly
diminishing
head
smell
is
of
sweet
grain
orange
smells
light
but
refreshing
taste
is
more
of
the
same
juicy
orange
and
light
bready
malt
crisp
short
finish
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
lightly
crisp
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
nothing
great
but
it
made
a
very
good
grilling
beer
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
brew
but
theres
little
to
recommend
it
it
would
be
a
fine
first
step
in
introducing
macro
drinkers
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
but
theres
not
be
enough
personality
to
make
it
a
standout
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
grassy
aroma
with
malts
that
smell
vaguely
of
cornbread
bright
golden
color
with
a
quickly
diminishing
two
finger
thick
head
light
and
sweet
fore
tastes
a
bit
of
cornbread
and
karo
syrup
has
a
decent
feel
to
it
very
low
hop
profile
this
is
a
lager
i
could
drink
a
few
of
no
obvious
faults
but
this
is
one
very
boring
beer
i
read
a
few
other
comments
that
said
this
might
be
lighter
than
their
light
beer
and
i
think
theyre
right
smelled
pretty
light
too
gave
off
a
decent
head
though
i
did
end
up
liking
the
taste
very
creamy
in
my
mouth
and
going
down
was
pretty
smooth
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
from
abita
ya
just
have
to
give
it
a
chance
insanely
light
and
clear
i
think
this
is
lighter
than
their
light
beer
wtf
the
smell
is
weak
malt
and
grain
corny
too
this
is
really
grainey
in
taste
but
there
is
obnoxious
sweetnes
in
here
that
is
just
plain
weird
i
would
prefer
their
light
beer
to
this
the
taste
plain
sucks
medium
body
here
ehh
kinda
drinkable
but
this
is
too
weird
for
me
hazy
dull
gold
faint
hops
and
some
grassy
notes
on
the
nose
blah
grainy
malts
some
earthy
tones
slightly
watered
down
factor
here
the
taste
of
day
old
biscuits
even
some
adjuncts
very
thin
and
chalky
finishes
with
a
carbonated
just
sipped
champagne
feel
wet
cardboard
left
on
the
palate
next
time
punt
overall
a
pretty
good
session
beer
when
in
the
mood
for
a
simple
tasting
craft
lager
to
quench
your
thirst
but
nothing
to
go
ranting
and
raving
about
very
attractive
beer
that
is
clean
crisp
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
abita
brews
to
my
taste
a
nice
session
beer
thanks
to
biglove
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
poured
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
no
head
but
there
was
carbonation
on
the
tongue
nose
is
malty
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
some
sugary
mals
but
the
hops
are
really
only
noticeable
when
i
burp
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
has
a
crispish
finish
almost
feels
like
wet
moss
in
the
mouth
heavy
and
sticky
at
first
but
finishes
nicely
a
satisfying
drink
after
running
around
all
day
thanks
goes
to
biglove
from
the
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
got
some
malt
and
hops
grainsand
hints
of
corn
flavor
the
corn
comes
out
a
little
bit
stronger
than
in
the
aroma
than
came
hints
of
malts
and
hops
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
this
is
a
worthy
example
of
the
style
crisp
refreshing
wqith
a
nice
light
malt
base
tasty
beer
well
its
a
light
lager
theres
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
it
theres
nothing
that
really
stands
out
for
me
its
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
almost
yellow
has
little
head
very
little
nose
not
much
going
on
for
flavor
a
fairly
light
body
little
in
the
way
of
aftertaste
dn
crisp
and
clean
very
refreshing
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
pairs
well
with
a
nice
breakfast
plate
i
just
finished
working
the
night
shift
so
bacon
and
eggs
and
beer
at
8am
isnt
so
strange
not
a
beer
that
is
going
to
rewrite
the
book
on
beer
but
this
is
a
damn
solid
brew
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
fits
in
well
to
the
summer
beer
niche
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
moderate
white
head
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
with
a
breadlike
background
taste
is
excellent
and
pleasantly
suprising
very
refreshing
with
a
bite
at
the
finish
first
class
beer
my
favorite
from
the
sampler
pack
glad
i
saved
it
until
last
abita
golden
may
be
an
acceptable
thirst
quencher
in
the
big
easy
and
it
may
be
a
decent
inexpensive
accompaniment
to
some
a
that
fine
nawlins
spicy
food
that
i
remember
with
such
fondness
solo
though
its
little
better
than
its
more
popular
cousins
from
up
north
light
aroma
with
slight
hints
of
u
s
barley
and
european
hops
clean
and
sensable
medium
golden
apearance
low
bodied
yet
refreshing
well
carbinated
for
nice
efforvescence
head
retention
is
surprisingly
well
formed
flavors
and
aromas
weaken
toward
the
finish
dry
finish
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
for
a
head
smells
like
sweet
grains
and
faint
hops
very
clean
taste
a
bit
malty
and
grany
some
hops
come
out
to
balance
the
grains
clean
finish
and
light
bodied
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
for
a
summer
day
thirst
quenching
nothing
too
comlex
and
still
tasty
goes
good
with
a
burger
thin
but
good
carbonation
easy
enough
to
drink
but
even
in
nola
better
options
exist
pale
colored
with
wispy
foam
slightly
carbonated
with
a
sweet
nutty
aroma
with
strong
corn
notes
abita
tortilla
taste
is
a
tad
watery
for
my
liking
but
finishes
with
mild
hops
and
raw
nuts
which
is
tasty
sweet
and
refreshing
without
a
bad
or
metallic
aftertaste
very
drinkable
just
not
my
style
12
ouncer
sampled
does
have
best
before
dating
but
good
luck
trying
to
figure
it
out
pours
very
light
amber
moderate
bubble
whie
head
cabadgy
nose
this
one
i
found
to
be
thin
and
watery
and
lacking
in
most
departments
limited
in
complexity
and
interest
in
general
expensive
lawn
mower
libation
at
best
nevertheless
when
i
first
cracked
open
the
bottle
the
smell
was
not
that
bad
but
nothing
hardly
notable
about
it
the
taste
was
just
like
any
golden
beer
but
there
was
almost
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
very
thin
and
watery
beginning
to
leave
a
very
bad
aftertaste
as
i
desperatly
searched
for
some
type
of
flavor
or
fizz
or
anything
at
all
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
flat
coors
original
from
a
can
nothing
special
at
all
not
recommended
unless
its
dirt
cheap
drinkability

sorry
this
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
foamy
small
white
head
clear
dirty
yellow
beer
nuts
and
fruit
in
the
nose
almost
candy
lemony
fresh
nutty
front
tingly
light
fruity
middle
very
fresh
nutty
dry
finish
this
is
actually
pretty
good
nice
citrusy
fresh
and
nutty
this
style
turns
out
to
be
a
nice
base
for
abitas
peanuttiness
this
was
nothing
really
special
pretty
much
the
typical
craft
beer
lager
decent
malt
body
clean
with
a
slight
bit
of
citrus
in
the
flavor
very
slight
aroma
doesnt
really
do
anything
for
or
against
the
beer
the
hops
are
almost
a
no
show
except
for
the
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
back
pretty
crisp
and
drinkable
but
nothing
special
true
to
its
name
abita
golden
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
average
head
size
smell
is
standard
grain
smell
clean
but
nothing
special
taste
is
crisp
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
is
probably
what
macros
would
taste
like
if
the
used
quality
ingredients
and
took
time
with
their
beer
this
is
a
standard
american
lager
that
works
best
in
sessions
or
as
a
lawnmower
beer
i
enjoyed
abita
golden
but
i
would
recommend
most
of
their
other
beers
before
this
one
pale
sickly
yellow
in
hue
dull
and
the
lack
of
animation
only
amplifies
this
notion
the
white
head
was
a
slight
half
finger
in
height
at
the
zenith
but
it
quickly
faded
to
a
soapy
cap
the
appearance
is
completely
unimpressive
an
adjunct
free
lager
of
this
nature
imo
should
have
a
richer
color
the
subsequent
lacing
was
almost
nonexistent
the
nose
is
distinctly
abita
or
iowas
millstream
as
both
breweries
beers
smell
identical
to
me
the
yeast
strain
these
two
brewers
use
is
obviously
german
this
beer
has
soft
notes
of
grain
malty
like
a
typical
but
decent
macro
lager
luckily
the
hints
of
lemon
flowers
and
hay
increase
the
likeability
of
the
bouquet
moderate
potency
decent
the
palate
is
very
well
crafted
it
is
much
tastier
than
the
nose
indicated
the
appearance
screams
macro
lager
but
my
tongue
detected
a
good
amount
of
hops
for
the
style
lemon
hay
and
grass
upfront
the
bitterness
is
moderate
but
firm
enough
to
balance
the
malt
profile
ideally
the
malt
adds
some
sweetness
its
bready
as
well
clean
finish
simple
tasting
but
very
pleasant
i
liked
it
medium
in
body
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i
am
sure
it
would
be
a
hit
the
with
bmc
crowd
it
is
nothing
i
need
to
seek
out
again
in
the
future
still
thank
you
morris729
for
the
bottle
this
beer
is
very
mild
but
its
a
step
up
from
any
american
macro
the
quintessential
lawnmower
beer
this
could
be
chugged
in
pints
back
to
back
icecold
refreshing
and
light
probably
the
easiest
drinking
beer
ive
ever
had
an
excellent
crossover
for
your
macrolovin
picnic
attending
coworkers
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
tall
foamy
white
head
that
soon
fades
into
a
trace
amount
of
lace
nose
is
slightly
stale
grains
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
light
to
medium
in
body
and
quite
crisp
in
texture
taste
starts
a
bit
sweet
turning
a
bit
grassy
and
herbal
towards
the
middle
with
a
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
finish
a
good
thirst
quencher
for
a
hot
day
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
certainly
better
than
the
macro
lagers
and
a
fine
thing
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
in
florida
very
pale
yellow
and
clear
low
carbination
poured
with
alot
of
head
that
mellowed
out
to
a
very
thin
almost
nonexistant
coating
not
too
much
scent
you
can
catch
a
drift
of
lemon
taste
is
not
strong
in
any
flavor
a
very
light
flavored
beer
good
session
beer
slight
taste
of
citrus
taste
of
water
nothing
really
jumps
at
you
the
body
is
very
light
with
good
drinkability
from
a
bottle
this
one
poured
a
very
clear
and
bright
golden
color
small
head
with
low
carbonation
small
grainy
lemon
and
grassy
notes
emanate
from
the
beer
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
nothing
that
outstanding
but
highly
quaffable
the
bitterness
is
low
and
there
is
some
citrus
character
in
the
flavor
a
very
drinkable
and
attractive
golden
lager
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
weak
and
watery
there
is
a
slight
pale
malt
scent
but
not
much
else
the
taste
is
less
than
average
it
is
of
pale
malts
and
nothing
more
it
is
watery
and
clean
this
hardly
tastes
like
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
very
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
drinks
well
but
who
would
want
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
came
in
a
sampler
pack
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
but
i
might
by
a
sixer
sometime
for
a
change
pours
a
light
yellowish
golden
hue
with
a
pretty
decent
size
white
head
moderate
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
taste
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
a
small
step
away
from
macrodom
filler
for
a
gift
pack
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
watering
hole
but
not
one
that
i
would
buy
a
light
straw
colored
ale
that
is
thin
in
body
and
no
lasting
head
after
initial
pour
taste
is
flat
and
not
impressive
and
on
the
hoppy
side
drinkable
only
in
the
sense
of
being
low
in
alcohol
content
and
not
very
refreshing
worth
a
try
at
a
beer
festival
but
otherwise
not
a
great
overall
impression
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
somewhat
bubbly
with
thin
lacing
aroma
is
light
hops
just
a
tad
floral
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
notes
of
hops
and
citrus
and
even
a
little
malt
finish
is
a
little
hoppy
and
a
little
fruity
and
fairly
clean
i
have
had
lots
of
worse
lagers
than
this
to
be
sure
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
little
residual
head
or
lace
the
nose
is
typical
lager
with
mostly
a
malt
sense
good
lager
flavor
and
decent
body
strength
this
is
an
easy
drinking
lager
that
is
very
average
that
is
to
say
better
than
most
macros
like
other
abitas
this
is
served
in
its
standard
packaging
convenient
and
practical
not
a
bad
lager
choice
overall
again
this
is
another
textbook
style
example
put
out
by
abita
who
uses
spring
water
and
good
ingredients
with
this
example
being
of
a
light
lager
i
dont
know
if
i
would
put
it
in
the
lager
pale
category
that
it
is
in
but
abita
has
put
out
another
great
beer
there
is
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
but
the
flavor
is
not
very
complex
at
all
in
fact
i
would
call
it
simple
grain
and
grain
oh
well
nothin
special
hazy
golden
color
high
carbonation
produces
a
healthy
head
which
leaves
a
thin
lace
around
the
glass
corny
aroma
really
sweet
grainy
flavors
carbonation
produces
a
fizziness
that
accentuates
the
crispness
no
hop
flavors
medium
body
feels
fuller
than
it
really
is
due
to
the
sweetness
corn
sugar
galore
would
be
really
good
to
drink
with
a
mega
spicy
pizza
or
some
hot
mexican
food
pours
a
hazy
golden
body
topped
by
a
quick
to
dissipate
white
head
it
keeps
an
alright
collar
but
maintains
very
little
surface
covering
and
leaves
no
lace
the
aroma
is
minimal
with
just
some
light
maltiness
the
body
is
light
with
a
very
fine
bubbled
moderate
carbonation
that
leaves
it
quite
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
a
lightly
sweet
somewhat
husky
and
mildly
tangy
malt
thats
well
balanced
with
hop
bitterness
finishes
dry
with
a
gently
lingering
maltiness
this
is
a
light
minimally
flavored
crisp
and
clean
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
fit
in
nicely
at
tailgate
parties
and
bbqs
its
certainly
not
a
munichstyle
helles
as
suggested
in
the
listing
here
good
healthy
peeyellow
color
and
theres
that
sour
peanut
smell
again
like
a
pile
of
dusty
peanut
shells
seems
inappropriate
the
taste
is
manageable
with
dry
slick
flavors
of
water
shredded
wheat
and
yogurt
dusty
mouthfeel
drink
if
you
must
aroma
is
quite
subdued
a
little
malt
and
some
sharp
grain
flavors
taste
is
initially
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
stinging
carbonation
rises
to
a
tart
and
slightly
sour
finish
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
lacking
in
character
best
if
used
by
date
of
1118
notes
just
some
down
right
easy
drinking
here
an
excellent
brew
to
pair
with
spicy
szechwan
or
some
creole
that
has
been
kicked
up
a
notch
none
the
less
your
all
around
dependable
beer
to
drink
without
thinking
about
what
you
are
drinking
reserved
almost
to
the
point
of
being
bland
the
primary
character
was
an
astringent
tartness
not
sour
or
unpleasant
but
that
is
pretty
much
what
you
get
not
much
depth
to
the
flavor
but
at
the
same
time
i
found
the
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
i
put
this
in
my
backyard
bbq
class
overall
you
get
what
you
pay
for
it
is
sad
how
badly
sleeman
has
fallen
even
their
flagship
cream
ale
has
tarnished
itself
over
the
years
it
is
a
poor
beer
with
huge
of
flavours
of
apple
and
a
funky
sweetness
that
prevents
this
from
even
being
a
serviceable
lawnmower
beer
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
yes
nice
refreshing
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
if
you
are
in
canada
and
you
find
it
on
special
go
grab
a
pack
had
a
pint
on
tap
at
a
calgary
pub
arrived
a
light
amber
hue
with
perhaps
an
inch
or
so
of
white
head
that
quickly
broke
and
disappeared
aroma
is
a
pronounced
malty
sweetness
and
not
much
else
maybe
the
barest
tinge
of
sour
fruit
is
detectable
if
you
really
focus
this
could
be
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
i
have
yet
to
consume
one
almost
wants
to
taste
some
astringent
husks
or
something
to
mitigate
this
even
my
wife
who
is
not
a
beer
drinker
described
this
as
tasting
like
a
cooler
the
doughy
malts
recall
cheap
white
bread
and
the
rest
of
the
flavor
comes
off
like
someone
dissolve
some
sweettart
fruit
candies
into
an
otherwise
bland
base
or
perhaps
think
artificially
flavored
cherry
gum
savage
carbonation
thin
watery
body
with
a
vaguely
buttery
mouthfeel
nil
hop
aroma
or
flavor
the
finish
is
cleaner
although
the
sweetness
continues
to
linger
alternating
between
cidery
and
vinous
this
is
clearly
a
young
beer
with
acetylaldhyde
placed
front
and
centre
to
entice
mainstream
drinkers
the
good
old
budweiser
trick
put
to
use
in
a
brew
that
is
supposed
to
be
a
tier
above
an
adjunct
lager
no
thanks
overall
well
worse
beer
exists
and
this
isnt
bad
if
youve
just
been
doing
yard
work
or
some
sort
of
workout
otherwise
pay
an
extra
dollar
or
two
for
a
case
and
get
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
overall
excellent
beer
for
the
price
i
am
on
my
6th
beer
now
and
will
continue
to
drink
more
of
this
it
seems
to
be
made
for
a
nice
hot
summer
day
on
the
patio
with
some
friends
will
recommend
this
beer
to
people
if
they
are
looking
for
a
quality
beer
with
a
low
price
tag
o
my
alpha
mater
beer
never
had
it
during
university
its
a
distinct
marker
of
where
craft
beer
was
20
years
ago
in
guelph
i
could
see
it
as
an
alternative
to
a
molson
canadian
for
some
as
its
less
bitter
o
not
too
much
going
on
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
flavour
in
their
beer
of
which
there
are
many
it
wasnt
horrible
just
too
bland
for
my
taste
the
dms
was
a
bit
of
a
fault
though
giving
it
that
corn
aroma
i
actually
kind
of
liked
the
apple
reminded
me
of
an
ale
a
bit
that
way
bottle
5
not
my
favourite
and
would
require
a
lime
or
some
other
fruitiness
to
be
drinkable
nice
clear
light
to
medium
yellow
color
white
to
offwhite
head
mild
sweetness
and
a
very
light
bitterness
and
softly
carbonated
too
much
grass
and
adjunctyacetyl
mess
on
the
palate
to
be
praised
buddy
of
mine
brought
me
one
after
work
one
day
and
i
was
really
surprised
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
summer
excellent
taste
with
a
smooth
finish
bubbly
for
a
beer
with
so
much
flavour
and
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
color
isnt
a
huge
deal
for
me
but
is
appealing
nonetheless
one
of
those
beers
you
can
drink
all
night
its
just
an
ordinary
pale
lager
standard
stuff
but
yknow
well
done
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
know
its
not
meant
to
be
great
but
it
is
just
right
especially
right
after
meal
salud
sleeman
pours
out
your
standard
yellowish
gold
color
with
some
faint
bubbles
that
dont
get
to
a
cap
or
even
nothing
by
the
time
i
was
dome
pouring
nothing
to
speak
of
smell
is
pale
malt
adjuncts
spent
grain
and
sweetness
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
i
get
some
caramel
with
faint
old
earthy
hops
no
bitterness
though
malt
presides
grain
comes
forth
with
warming
drink
it
up
feel
is
a
bit
above
light
bodied
for
a
pale
beer
the
body
wont
do
the
crispness
is
not
present
as
the
carb
is
minimal
and
the
taste
aint
all
there
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
thats
a
plus
the
abv
is
minimal
but
so
is
the
taste
on
a
rainy
day
in
canada
if
i
ever
get
up
there
i
will
revisit
this
and
blend
in
o
not
really
worth
buying
beer
for
might
be
nice
cold
on
a
hot
summers
day
but
then
again
so
is
water
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
interesting
move
along
past
this
one
overall
drinkable
and
yummy
chug
chug
chug
in
any
case
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
cheap
massproduced
brew
drink
a
canadian
even
a
coors
light
trumps
this
enjoy
this
one
without
guilt
une
blonde
classic
o
its
a
run
of
the
mill
pour
it
down
your
throat
as
fast
as
you
can
american
lager
not
a
lot
going
on
this
was
another
of
a
bunch
of
unremarkable
beers
i
had
on
a
recent
visit
to
toronto
not
too
much
to
say
about
it
its
pale
in
color
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
flavor
is
not
bad
but
not
great
either
there
are
other
fizzy
yellow
beers
id
have
instead
of
this
one
but
i
guess
im
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavours
and
aromas
o
drinkable
but
nothing
special
to
report
here
o
average
beer
its
better
then
most
macros
but
you
can
still
find
better
as
well
final
grade
2
71
a
c
overall
could
be
the
best
sleeman
offering
not
a
bad
lager
but
not
a
standout
d
im
gonna
say
that
for
the
premium
price
that
sleeman
usually
gets
i
dont
think
its
worth
any
more
than
the
next
macro
however
it
is
super
easy
to
down
several
of
these
that
said
its
an
average
beer
for
the
most
part
thats
going
to
do
the
job
maybe
just
a
slight
notch
above
the
norm
id
drink
this
again
if
available
on
tap
or
if
offered
but
probably
wont
go
looking
for
it
oh
well
just
as
i
find
it
puzzling
contradictory
and
downright
stupid
to
name
and
market
a
bottled
beer
as
draught
so
too
am
i
stupefied
that
this
product
actually
meets
some
peoples
standards
when
it
comes
to
a
refreshing
gratifying
lager
to
my
tastes
this
is
anything
but
then
again
emasculated
adulterated
insipid
massmarket
lagers
arent
my
thing
d
drinkable
but
quite
bland
pours
from
a
can
drank
it
just
for
the
review
nice
clear
golden
coulour
no
head
or
very
this
white
head
no
distinct
odour
are
perceptible
grainy
on
the
mouth
difficult
to
taste
the
hops
very
thin
mouthfell
undistingable
from
other
canadian
lager
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
so
is
water
this
beer
has
no
personality
kind
of
disappointed
this
came
from
sleeman
wouldnt
recommend
pours
a
pale
golden
colour
with
thin
bubbly
white
head
smells
slightly
grassy
some
bready
pale
malts
flavour
is
a
bit
sweet
no
bitterness
that
i
can
detect
carbonation
level
is
fine
though
maybe
a
tad
overcarbonated
for
my
taste
i
have
no
desire
to
have
this
beer
again
there
are
other
sleeman
products
that
i
like
much
better
than
this
drink
i
used
to
think
this
was
a
good
beer
not
sure
what
was
wrong
with
me
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
d
easy
to
down
but
not
too
impressive
by
any
means
good
economic
choice
though
poured
from
a
clear
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
clear
straw
yellow
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
effervescing
to
the
surface
snowwhite
one
finger
head
that
recedes
quickly
smells
of
soggy
fritos
perhaps
dipped
in
sugar
water
taste
is
of
light
corn
with
a
super
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
drinkability
no
pretty
average
beer
but
nothing
offensive
i
may
drink
it
when
im
at
a
bar
with
only
macro
taps
sleeman
makes
some
decent
beers
but
this
aint
one
of
them
bottle
341ml
pours
a
transparent
spakling
gold
body
with
a
frothy
and
long
lived
white
head
some
lacing
aromas
are
almost
non
existant
some
yeast
mild
malty
aromas
grassy
taste
is
subtle
in
every
way
semisweet
bread
trace
hops
just
a
note
to
sleeman
that
this
is
not
the
coldest
tasting
beer
on
the
market
in
fact
cold
is
not
a
taste
cheers
d
not
bad
fairly
clean
as
expected
pretty
basic
fizzy
yellow
beer
overall
decent
brew
for
a
hot
summers
day
doesnt
offend
at
all
but
unfortunately
doesnt
inspire
either
an
intial
flavor
would
help
this
one
out
a
bit
too
mild
on
the
real
beer
flavour
what
with
all
that
chemical
skunk
bullshit
however
i
see
now
how
this
kind
of
thing
can
fly
and
even
turn
into
a
stupidly
decent
quaff
on
a
bright
warm
day
emotions
being
duly
distracted
otherwise
i
imagine
this
to
be
rather
putrid
offering
in
a
more
sober
kind
of
light
of
day
drinkability
good
choice
for
an
afternoon
beer
ok
to
consume
in
quantity
provided
you
pace
yourself
not
the
best
out
of
the
sleeman
family
all
the
while
it
is
not
the
worst
could
be
a
good
session
beer
for
some
people
d
easy
drinker
ordinary
macro
type
beer
without
any
major
flaws
i
tried
this
beer
on
april
5
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
small
offwhite
islands
the
aroma
was
very
grassy
with
little
other
discernable
aromas
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
amply
carbonated
the
flavour
was
more
of
the
grassy
malt
flavour
overall
nothing
special
here
but
any
flaws
that
this
brew
does
have
are
cancelled
out
by
how
wicked
refreshing
and
sessionable
it
is
in
the
summertime
pretty
much
mild
and
inoffensive
no
great
flaws
but
nothing
to
make
you
go
wow
reminds
me
a
little
of
mgd
i
would
actually
drink
this
again
but
its
not
my
favourite
pours
a
clear
goldyellow
fluffy
white
head
forms
sticks
around
some
lacing
doesnt
look
too
bad
smell
is
sweet
some
citrus
and
floral
bit
of
corn
honey
some
grass
who
knew
sleemans
could
be
half
decent
when
not
destroyed
in
a
clear
bottle
taste
is
weird
kind
of
fruity
almost
medicinal
very
sweet
minty
flavour
corn
weak
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
smell
is
okay
but
the
flavour
is
pretty
weird
d
its
not
a
terrible
beer
its
completely
mediocre
ill
drink
it
if
its
there
or
for
lack
of
a
better
option
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
got
this
on
sale
at
a
beerstore
where
the
selection
was
minimal
golden
colour
beer
peaks
through
a
clear
and
slightly
frosted
bottle
looking
good
so
far
smell
is
decent
and
minimal
not
bad
slightly
malty
and
very
clean
taste
a
very
rounded
aftertaste
that
is
slightly
sour
but
not
at
all
bitter
whcih
reminds
me
of
the
cream
ale
also
in
the
sleemans
lineup
its
not
bad
as
a
session
beer
i
would
imagine
this
one
to
be
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
pour
produced
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
short
lived
head
minimal
lacing
evident
but
it
sheets
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
minimal
nose
with
a
citrus
note
very
light
theres
not
much
flavor
to
comment
on
no
outstanding
maltiness
or
hop
flavors
think
macro
brews
and
corn
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
almost
like
youre
drinking
one
of
those
low
carb
brews
bottom
line
a
most
unremarkable
brew
which
is
in
line
with
their
other
offerings
sad
to
say
personally
i
cant
recommend
this
brew
taste
was
ok
at
first
a
good
malty
taste
and
good
bitterness
but
oh
my
lord
what
is
that
aftertaste
it
tastes
like
aspirine
mixed
with
grass
sort
of
noodle
soup
not
so
bad
that
i
would
spit
it
out
immediatly
but
every
sip
was
ruined
by
this
taste
could
this
be
the
conditions
the
beer
has
been
kept
under
lets
hope
so
i
am
going
to
drink
some
water
a
fair
offering
from
sleeman
pours
out
to
a
medium
golden
yellow
color
with
a
short
lived
white
foam
head
no
lacing
and
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
buttery
malts
are
most
noted
but
traces
of
grass
bread
and
yeast
are
also
present
taste
is
decent
buttery
malts
a
touch
of
crisp
granny
smith
apples
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
acceptable
but
had
no
distinguishing
characteristics
to
speak
of
drinkability
is
fine
not
bad
for
an
all
malt
lager
worth
a
try
in
any
event
sleeman
original
draught
is
worth
a
shot
id
say
but
ill
also
admit
to
being
terribly
biased
i
like
sleeman
ive
always
liked
sleeman
to
the
point
where
that
cooked
veggie
flavour
is
something
i
crave
i
guess
im
a
little
crazy
but
i
dont
much
care
probably
one
of
the
better
sleeman
beers
but
still
nothing
special
maybe
something
id
consider
on
a
hot
summer
day
because
its
reasonably
priced
and
isnt
anything
horrible
this
is
definitely
a
cut
above
blue
labatts
or
bud
it
actually
has
a
finish
and
discernable
hop
flavors
still
its
pretty
insipid
and
i
wouldnt
pay
for
it
poured
from
the
gold
can
clear
with
a
golden
color
one
inch
bright
white
foam
left
fair
amount
of
thin
sticky
lacing
the
beer
looks
ok
but
its
nothing
special
smell
is
quite
grassy
and
grainy
typical
of
a
lager
taste
is
similar
grainy
and
somewhat
sweet
it
has
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
alright
lots
of
carbonation
alright
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
you
say
wow
the
taste
is
just
not
good
all
cheap
vegetable
malts
a
bit
sweet
not
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
just
a
rancid
corn
mash
skunkiness
oh
sleemans
what
have
you
done
here
this
is
as
bad
as
any
other
cheap
american
macrolager
oh
well
i
didnt
buy
it
mouthfeel
is
good
and
carbonated
sticks
to
the
throat
but
i
cant
get
over
the
taste
this
beer
came
to
me
with
the
head
already
subsided
but
it
appeared
to
be
a
yellowyorange
not
too
too
bad
smelled
like
a
standard
macro
hints
of
corn
and
something
else
i
couldnt
quite
identify
taste
was
actually
not
bad
at
all
surprisingly
it
was
refreshing
and
surprisingly
smooth
fairly
drinkable
typical
of
other
beers
of
this
calibre
decent
session
beer
good
on
a
hot
day
bottle
poured
a
pale
golden
color
lager
with
a
very
small
amount
of
head
and
not
much
retention
aroma
of
well
not
much
aroma
except
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
taste
is
bland
with
again
some
hint
of
corn
some
sweetness
and
absolutely
no
aftertaste
another
bland
offering
from
this
great
yeah
canadian
brewer
medium
gold
in
colour
with
a
fairly
average
amount
of
carbonation
an
unpasturized
beer
in
a
can
hmmmm
its
got
some
nice
honey
malt
aroma
which
conflicts
with
the
other
dominant
aromatic
note
a
kind
of
veggie
hop
thing
that
reminds
me
of
an
allspalt
homebrew
that
my
homebrew
club
made
for
our
hop
varietals
tasting
event
the
flavor
is
somewhat
akin
to
their
honey
brown
lager
only
with
less
of
a
nutty
taste
and
more
of
a
solvent
chemical
note
the
cloying
finish
of
the
honey
brown
is
also
still
apparent
in
this
beer
this
is
not
one
of
their
better
efforts
after
working
in
the
heat
this
was
nice
but
nothing
spectacular
i
will
drink
a
few
more
because
i
was
a
sucker
for
the
free
glass
nothing
special
a
little
lace
paler
golden
colour
nothing
to
breathe
in
metallic
drying
lager
drinakble
though
on
sweet
side
and
agree
that
its
cheaper
sweetners
like
corn
and
dextrose
isnetad
of
good
malting
are
mr
sleemans
days
numbered
as
the
head
and
he
is
in
the
end
game
regardless
this
is
a
refreshing
summer
beer
that
would
be
welcome
in
my
fridge
despite
my
usual
dislike
of
lagers
is
this
one
of
sleemans
limited
edition
beers
like
that
awful
porter
if
so
i
might
stock
up
on
this
its
not
bad
not
good
but
not
bad
pours
a
gold
colour
with
a
small
half
finger
head
which
does
last
what
a
surprise
smells
bready
malty
and
sweet
with
no
skunk
smell
i
was
expecting
whew
their
is
a
bit
of
a
corn
husk
smell
but
not
alot
basically
their
is
a
corn
smell
but
not
that
sickening
corn
syrup
taste
is
bready
and
sweet
and
simple
i
doubt
their
are
many
if
any
hops
used
but
it
is
a
sweet
somewhat
refreshing
lager
a
lawnmower
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
watery
reminded
me
of
perrier
drinkable
yes
ill
drink
it
again
i
may
even
buy
it
again
but
only
if
on
sale
gold
colored
hard
pour
gives
you
a
white
frothy
cap
that
retains
well
with
a
fair
lace
left
on
the
glass
sides
skunky
cabbage
kind
of
smell
malty
but
with
a
wierd
odor
like
a
skunky
becks
but
vgital
moderate
to
low
carbonation
smooth
mouth
feel
but
watery
some
biscuit
malt
slightly
sweet
but
also
some
veggies
attenuated
hops
wet
abrupt
finish
very
forgettable
i
didnt
want
to
spend
the
money
ona
six
pack
of
this
so
i
bought
a
single
i
really
should
have
grabbed
one
of
my
dads
after
all
and
saved
myself
the
two
dollars
as
with
most
of
their
beers
this
is
a
decent
looking
lager
a
bright
clear
gold
with
a
very
thin
froth
of
head
not
much
retention
in
that
respect
things
take
a
bit
of
a
dive
with
the
aroma
the
nose
possesses
some
sweet
malt
with
almost
a
sugary
character
to
it
trying
to
mask
out
a
bit
of
corn
and
boiled
cabbage
that
lingers
in
the
background
i
admit
that
the
first
sip
bodes
good
prospects
but
things
regress
after
that
sugary
sweet
malt
and
corn
with
a
nearly
sour
finish
accompanied
by
the
essence
of
overcooked
veggies
the
aftertaste
lingers
on
two
levels
that
of
an
underlying
sugary
sweetness
and
the
bitter
sourness
of
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
the
standard
sleeman
lightly
abrasive
carbonation
and
watery
body
as
with
most
beers
of
this
style
and
nature
i
take
it
that
this
was
meant
to
be
drank
straight
out
of
the
bottle
ice
cold
used
solely
for
the
function
of
being
a
hot
summer
weather
thirst
quencher
it
appears
to
me
that
they
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
boost
the
sweetness
level
of
this
lager
perhaps
a
healthy
dose
of
extra
dextrose
to
appeal
to
a
younger
and
crossgendered
market
of
summer
drinkers
for
those
out
there
in
search
of
a
new
lawnmower
or
barbecue
beer
you
have
one
more
option
on
the
market
now
definitely
not
the
worst
draught
beer
ive
sampled
but
it
doesnt
bring
that
style
above
the
rest
of
the
flotsam
either
very
easy
drinker
definitely
a
repeater
and
worth
a
taste
smooth
tasting
beer
without
a
harsh
taste
o
a
really
tasty
beer
when
i
want
to
back
off
the
hops
and
get
my
palate
back
on
an
even
keel
my
wife
would
enjoy
this
and
is
a
good
beer
to
initiate
your
friends
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
another
solid
offering
from
kansas

to
surprisingly

and
pear
good
showcasing
of
german
hops
altogether
the
crispness
and
carb
level
cut
through
any
sweetness
making
this
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
overall
the
brewer
took
great
pride
in
making
this
beer
incredibly
clear
it
would
rival
german
beers
this
is
a
nice
lager
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
beer
it
would
be
a
far
shorter
list
to
mention
whats
not
drinkable
about
this
beer
that
would
be
a
list
with
zero
items
this
is
really
really
well
done
if
youre
into

if
it
aint
eleventy
jillion
percent
alcohol
and
infinity
ibus
then
dont
call
me
mode
you
wont
find
this
worth
your
time
this
is
a
beer
for
a
refined
drinker
who
chases
nuance
and
appreciates
the
art
of
brewing
rather
than
one
who
enjoys
getting
slapped
upside
the
head
with
huge
flavor
and
jawclenching
bitterness
it
would
also
be
great
for
a
bmc
drinker
who
wants
to
get
into
craft
beer
ill
admit
it
bothers
me
a
small
amount
when
i
see
brews
like
this
denigrated
by
craft
beer
drinkers
who
should
know
better
if
one
approaches
this
with
the
understanding
of
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
clean
mild
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
allmalt
american
style
pilsner
rather
than
what
it
is
not
a
supercomplex
rich
overhopped
ale
made
from
a
recipe
found
in
a
ufo
at

using
the
only

fruit
from

in

picked
right
before
it
was
plowed
under

aged
in

and
carbonated
with

cant

be

not
bad
but
certainly
not
my
first
choice
either
one
of
the
lower
canadian
beers
not
again
overall
molson
kind
of
lacks
the
charm
of
high
life
and
pabst
but
its
also
much
better
than
budweiser
and
not
appreciably
worse
than
heineken
as
multinational
macro
lagers
go
its
midrange
theres
worse
stuff
to
drink
while
watching
hockey
eh
but
its
very
soso
this
has
potential
as
a
pilsner
like
maltiness
meets
a
rye
like
grain
flavor
meets
slight
bitterness
and
cracker
dryness
it
has
a
real
ease
of
drinkability
and
its
not
too
harsh
rather
crisp
actually
theres
just
a
weakness
and
a
lack
of
assertiveness
that
ranks
it
below
average
o
top
notch
adjunct
lager
very
refreshing
and
tasty
i
didnt
buy
this
for
a
while
because
i
was
wary
of
the
dreaded
green
bottle
six
beers
in
and
no
skunk
go
get
some
it
comes
out
not
half
bad
but
is
just
slightly
ordinary
than
a
lawnmower
beer
i
am
not
feeling
this
really
i
have
tried
many
american
adjuncts
and
dont
enjoy
anything
from
ab
i
recently
drain
poured
a
miller
fortune
coors
light
offends
me
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
discovered
molson
golden
and
will
be
keeping
it
around
as
a
goto
for
when
i
want
to
enjoy
a
neutral
beer
that
doesnt
pull
me
to
any
extreme
sometimes
you
want
an
ipa
or
an
imperial
stout
but
sometimes
you
just
want
a
beer
to
kick
back
with
this
is
that
beer
if
you
understand
what
i
mean
by
that
then
i
recommend
giving
this
a
shot
sometimes
note
having
a
terribly
thin
watery
body
can
be
a
detractor
for
this
style
odd
i
know
but
this
beer
has
a
thickness
and
a
certain
slickness
thats
worse
than
if
it
had
a
weaker
body
though
it
is
light
regardless
its
sort
of
a
clash
on
the
palate
though
a
bite
of
crispness
cuts
through
it
some
o
this
is
a
solid
choice
for
any
canadian
beer
drinker
its

no

but
2
5
times
bud
for
overall
drinkability
when
it
comes
to
this
watery
sweet
style
there
is
really
only
one
other
option
i
would
consider
for
a
nice
mellow
session
and
that
would
have
to
be
coors
xtra
gold
o
this
takes
me
back
to
the
days
of
college
in
upstate
ny
where
this
was
the
beer
of
choice
due
to
the
cheap
price
compared
with
american
bmc
this
was
in
the
early
1990s
so
there
were
not
a
lot
of
craft
options
available
maybe
not
as
quite
as
i
expected
it
to
be
from
my
college
memories
and
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
not
skunky
at
all
considering
the
green
glass
bottle
o
a
simple
brew
thats
not
remarkable
or
offensive
overall
i
have
no
idea
what
i
just
drank
it
could
have
been
any
number
of
mass
produced
american
pale
lagers
overall
disappointed
i
was
not
expecting
a
whole
lot
however
the
earthiness
of
the
beer
dominated
its
entire
presence
this
is
the
definition
of
a
chugging
beer
because
you
do
not
want
to
just
sip
on
it
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
lawn
mower
beer
or
when
you
invite
your
buddies
over
for
the
big
game
this
is
not
a
one
of
a
kind
brew
cheers
has
a
light
yet
good
flavor
nice
and
crisp
and
has
a
unique
sweetness
to
it
reminiscent
of
carmel
d
i
wish
i
had
more
to
say
about
this
brew
but
between
the
unappealing
aroma
and
lack
of
flavor
it
is
tough
to
use
more
words
in
this
review
if
the
purpose
of
drinking
a
beer
is
to
drink
some
fizzy
liquid
that
has
alcohol
in
it
this
could
suffice
for
everyone
using
this
website
pass
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
very
good
balance
between
malts
and
hops
for
a
light
beer
while
it
came
in
a
green
bottle
i
couldnt
detect
any
skunk
in
the
smell
or
taste
the
beer
like
its
name
pours
out
a
beautiful
golden
color
rather
appealing
really
the
smell
and
taste
were
surprising
in
a
way
there
was
a
distant
hint
of
citrus
i
am
certain
i
tasted
the
single
reason
why
i
rated
it
better
than
average
mouthfeel
was
average
at
best
and
it
actually
felt
a
bit
watery
sloshing
around
overall
it
was
better
than
what
i
expected
and
have
enjoyed
a
few
more
than
one
since
how
did
i
miss
this
stuff
during
my
trip
to
windsor
those
years
ago
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
topped
by
a
relatively
shortlived
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
very
light
lemon
peel
and
mineral
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
both
the
wheat
and
the
lemon
gaining
that
usual
macro
funk
one
day
ill
find
a
better
way
to
describe
that
quality
or
lack
thereof
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
meek
bland
sad
little
beer
nuff
said
really
a
totally
underrated
beer
this
pours
clear
golden
beautiful
a
nice
head
not
too
much
not
too
little
the
smell
is
as
beer
should
be
hops
malt
yum
it
can
get
a
little
skunky
which
to
be
honest
i
really
dont
mind
if
it
is
not
excessive
the
alc
kick
is
decent
and
actually
a
little
surprising
as
the
flavor
of
alc
doesnt
come
through
at
all
it
is
very
very
drinkable
maybe
a
little
too
much
so
i
can
down
three
of
these
in
a
half
hour
and
not
realise
it
until
the
buzz
hits
which
is
nice
and
smooth
not
heavy
and
sickening
all
around
a
true
favorite
rjt
o
overall
its
a
good
cheap
beer
somewhat
above
a
large
number
of
them
but
nothing
fancy
by
any
means
would
i
have
it
again
yes
taste
is
nice
creamy
grain
maltomeal
light
spritzy
apple
and
grass
its
simple
and
light
but
fairly
good
it
seems
a
bit
more
flavourful
and
enjoyable
than
the
molson
canadian
there
is
much
worse
out
these
pours
see
through
and
very
light
yellow
color
with
a
decent
white
head
thats
gone
in
an
instant
smells
kind
of
like
the
can
watery
malt
body
i
dont
know
just
kind
of
like
a
stale
beer
flavor
is
moderately
better
drinkable
and
crisp
really
watery
taste
but
there
are
some
hops
in
the
finish
just
enough
to
remind
you
that
its
a
beer
but
there
is
nothing
craft
about
this
thing
metallic
in
the
finish
feel
isnt
that
bad
ultra
light
and
well
carbonated
which
makes
for
good
golf
course
beer
some
some
similar
application
i
think
its
better
than
canadian
maybe
equal
to
it
but
not
as
good
as
export
which
isnt
bad
at
all
overall
it
has
its
place
in
the
18pack
of
cans
hall
of
once
a
summer
drinks
a
clear
but
radiant
golden
color
with
an
impressive
white
foam
on
top
and
lacing
to
match
the
aroma
brings
out
a
slightly
metallic
wheat
grain
that
fills
out
into
a
somewhat
pleasant
pepperyyeast
bread
idea
quite
nice
actually
and
the
metallic
hint
pretty
much
disappears
the
taste
is
relatively
light
cereal
grain
with
a
citrus
kiss
theres
a
mild
malt
backbone
that
brings
a
sweetness
into
the
blend
that
becomes
more
prominent
as
you
get
near
the
end
its
medium
light
bodied
with
a
tingly
midland
feel
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
during
my
youthful
barhopping
years
and
is
actually
one
of
the
few
revisits
that
didnt
make
me
think
now
what
was
i
thinking
then
really
pleasant
and
refreshing
and
im
happy
to
know
i
can
happily
accept
one
if
thats
what
the
host
is
offering
from
the

the
pour
is
golden
yellow
with
a
small
but
slightly
lingering
head
green
bottle
aromas
are
not
as
noticeable
as
other
instances
but
there
is
a
mild
skunkiness
beyond
that
i
get
grains
and
crisp
hops
the
body
is
thin
to
medium
and
very
typical
the
taste
is
grainy
with
a
clean
enough
finish
there
is
a
reason
this
is
a
big
seller
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
fairly
clean
and
easy
drinking
as
far
as
the
style
is
concerned
this
is
one
best
enjoyed
while
colder
as
the
sweet
aftertaste
increases
as
it
warms
poured
a
12
white
soap
suds
head
which
dissipated
quickly
clear
yellow
body
only
slightly
deeper
than
the
standard
straw
yellow
americanlager
beers
smells
of
grass
taste
too
is
straight
bmc
the
only
plus
is
the
texture
is
creamier
than
most
of
its
peer
beers
overall
compared
to
some
other
ots
canadian
beers
this
one
holds
its
own
recommended
for
drinking
outdoors
or
at
a
party
overall
drinkability
must
be
a
skunked
bottle
beers
like
this
make
me
really
wish
breweries
would
get
over
green
bottles
i
have
no
sympathy
because
i
feel
the
skunking
is
an
almost
inevitable
part
of
the
design
of
this
product
as
such
o
hmmm
not
sure
what
to
say
on
this
part
but
its
originally
canadian
so
might
be
good
for
watchin
hockey
eh
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
like
it
more
than
regular
moson
probably
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
abv
so
you
could
drink
a
few
but
there
is
just
not
enough
taste
to
make
it
really
worth
while
it
is
just
a
beer
interesting
that
i
read
on
molsons
website
that
this
is
a
blend
of
ale
and
lager
one
of
the
better
choices
for
cheap
beer
this
is
yet
another
forgettable
mass
produced
beer
the
draft
version
is
not
much
better
but
it
is
ubiquitous
in
canada
and
better
than
bud
10
99
for
a
twelve
pack
in
acworth
ga
not
a
bad
taste
actually
faint
hop
metallic
bitterness
easy
to
drink
very
light
no
off
flavors
small
skunkiness
lots
of
carbonation
to
give
that
spritzy
vibe
to
it
corn
aroma
did
not
lead
to
corn
husk
taste
which
is
nice
a
decent
hot
weather
pick
but
they
still
charge
too
much
for
this
stuff
onot
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
not
bad
an
okay
session
beer
if
you
have
friends
over
that
like
canadian
things
and
dont
know
beer
this
beer
its
a
good
social
brew
there
isnt
too
many
charactoristics
that
can
be
described
on
this
the
beer
is
light
in
color
golden
like
the
label
says
the
nose
has
some
skunk
on
it
but
not
enough
to
gross
me
out
the
beer
has
a
good
drinkablity
to
it
not
a
lot
of
head
but
overall
its
decent
first
beer
ive
listed
on
here
that
i
wouldnt
drink
again
unless
someone
handed
me
a
free
one
and
there
wasnt
anything
else
to
drink
id
take
a
molson
candian
over
this
hands
down
not
sure
what
molson
was
thinking
with
this
one
good
rich
one
finger
head
of
dense
foam
broken
but
clingy
lace
color
is
a
5
on
the
srm
beer
color
grid
smells
of
fresh
cut
wheat
sweet
corn
and
roasted
barley
taste
is
fresh
leading
with
roasted
wheat
and
cooked
corn
then
flavors
of
barley
and
light
citrus
tangy
bite
your
tongue
feeling
in
my
mouth
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
refreshing
taste
that
is
clean
and
tart
but
not
bitter
this
is
a
slightly
better
than
yard
work
beer
but
not
as
flavorful
as
the
beer
i
like
to
share
with
my
beer
buddies
d
good
i
could
have
a
few
more
of
these
its
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
once
you
get
past
the
skunkiness
d
terribly
ruined
taste
with
strong
doses
of
skunk
and
thin
watery
feel
absolutely
horrible
drain
pour
overall
as
cases
go
this
can
work
as
fortunate
as
i
feel
to
be
able
to
rate
beer
again
i
was
a
bit
foolish
to
welcome
myself
back
with
this
watery
fare
mouthquenching
with
a
bit
of
beef
bite
that
doesnt
make
the
beer
as
easydrinking
as
it
should
be
all
things
considered
though
the
flavor
wasnt
that
offputting
i
slugged
down
a
sixer
its
remarkably
smooth
gave
me
no
indigestion
and
the
back
end
was
void
of
the
burning
fizziness
that
you
get
from
a
truly
awful
macro
still
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
any
time
soon
tastes
like
macro
town
although
a
little
svelter
and
less
clumsy
than
the
american
versions
thin
but
not
too
watery
in
the
mouth
easy
to
drink
and
uncomplicated
but
not
completely
lacking
soul
this
ones
not
too
bad
id
be
happy
to
drop
a
few
in
the
cooler
for
friends
and
give
them
a
slightly
better
option
over
cold
water
light
aroma
mostly
light
grain
and
hints
of
corn
slight
grassy
hops
but
very
very
light
this
carried
right
over
in
the
flavor
which
was
again
far
too
light
for
my
tastes
but
what
can
you
do
small
hop
presence
in
the
finish
and
a
light
cereal
grain
balance
nice
feel
was
not
too
light
at
all
and
overall
not
a
terrible
expierence
by
any
means
all
in
all
not
a
remarkable
beer
as
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
but
its
drinkable
from
the
sheer
standpoint
that
it
will
not
offend
d
this
beer
is
just
unimpressive
and
is
it
really
a
blonde
ale
drinkability
fairly
decent
for
a
macro
lager
not
too
offensive
which
makes
it
fine
for
drinkingon
a
hot
summer
day
upon
opening
the
almost
skunky
characteristic
molson
aroma
is
just
as
i
remember
it
from
30
years
ago
it
shows
plenty
of
bubbles
but
the
head
does
not
last
long
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
malt
but
the
excessive
fizziness
makes
it
hard
to
evaluate
all
the
subtleties
a
nice
amount
of
floral
hoppiness
lingers
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
the
bubbles
as
well
as
decent
flavor
for
the
style
this
would
be
really
nice
on
an
85
degree
day
taste
is
pretty
standard
euro
pale
lager
fare
sweet
and
grainy
adjuncts
with
a
light
touch
of
sulfur
and
hops
in
the
finish
to
balance
things
out
somewhat
nothing
really
offputting
about
this
one
but
there
is
nothing
here
that
makes
you
crave
more
tastes
pretty
fresh
and
crisp
with
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
body
is
medium
maybe
even
bordering
on
thin
for
a
epl
which
i
am
rating
this
as
as
a
blonde
ale
it
would
fail
miserably
not
too
much
different
from
the
canadian
lager
imho
pours
a
clean
but
dulled
gold
color
with
a
quick
puff
of
white
frothy
head
no
retention
or
lacing
smell
is
very
faint
whiff
of
adjunct
grains
with
no
impurities
or
skunkyness
taste
is
a
very
faint
bite
of
mildly
sweet
adjunct
grains
hint
of
hops
with
no
impurities
or
skunyness
body
is
light
and
watery
not
over
carbonated
like
other
beers
in
its
demographic
a
very
adequate
substitute
for
the
typical
bmc
fare
for
a
backyard
bbq
or
tailgate
in
the
end
the
beer
fares
about
as
well
as
budweiser
where
we
are
giving
up
on
crispness
and
cleanliness
we
are
adding
fruity
complexity
and
slightly
more
maltiness
wow
did
my
pour
ever
result
in
some
nice
head
two
fingers
worth

foamy
bonewhite

with
decent

a

clarity
talk
about

in
advertising
nose
had
a
slightly
sweet
cast
to
it
more
lagerlike
than
ale
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
slightly
sweet
taste
not
much
hops
in
evidence
but
not
overwhelmed
by
malt
either
striking
a
nice
balance
finish
was
slightly
dry
and
quite
tasty
especially
compared
to
molson
canadian
if
you
did
not
enjoy
this
in
a
bottle
i
urge
you
to
give
it
a
revisit
in
a

from
a

scents
of

flavor
is
pretty
plain

bland
some
maltlike
notes
with
also
a
very
basic
hop
flavor
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
drinkable
this
is
a
boring
beer
i
wont
get
it
again
i
dont
what
makes
it
so
golden
thats
for
sure
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
this
beer
besides
im
sure
in
many
folks
opinion
the
label
that
and
the
stupidly
skunk
inducing
green
bottle
that
is
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
for
the
price
especially
a
very
nice
sessionable
lager
i
really
thing
to
most
of
the
mass
produced
things
molson
puts
out
a
pretty
solid
product
and
served
up
ice
cold
you
would
have
no
problem
enjoying
a
few
of
these
a
refreshing
lager
when
looking
for
a
no
fuss
cheaper
priced
beer
d
very
drinkable
because
there
really
isnt
too
much
to
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
faint
head
the
smell
is
of
malt
grains
and
some
floral
hops
taste
is
of
sweet
corn
and
some
floral
hops
the
taste
is
fairly
weak
not
offensive
and
not
good
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
moderately
high
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
average
nothing
offensive
and
nothing
very
good
from
a
12
oz
green
bottle
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
very
skunky
not
so
pleasant
taste
is
crisp
with
some
maltiness
but
also
a
bit
skunky
feels
well
carbonated
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
overall
blonde
ale
really
no
i
wouldnt
mind
giving
it
a
higher
rating
if
it
was
more
run
of
the
mill
but
by
labeling
itself
as
an
american
blonde
ale
im
going
to
have
to
review
it
relative
to
that
fails
drinkability
this
is
another
baffling
aspect
of
this
beer
why
would
anyone
put
away
several
of
these
but
the
key
is
you
do
its
like
being
beside
a
shrimp
ring
or
a
bowl
of
chips
each
last
one
leads
to
another
one
boring
as
it
may
be
several
more
of
these
will
be
going
down
tonight
drinkability
below
average
not
the
worst
had
a
green
bottle
at
italiano
delight
in
emmaus
pa
the
bartender
set
it
down
with
a
frosted
mug
upon
pouring
the
beer
the
a
cloud
of
skunk
hit
the
air
man
this
was
bad
especially
for
a
beer
that
was
just
in
a
cooler
under
a
bar
eventually
the
skunk
cleared
and
i
was
left
with
a
plain
light
amber
ale
with
a
bready
sweetness
and
not
a
lot
of
much
else
easy
drinking
skunk
aside
overall
this
is
lawnmower
beer
bought
it
on
a
lark
mostly
out
of
fond
memories
of
teenage
drinking
binges
when
this
was
considered
high
end
beer
luckily
im
no
longer
in
that
phase
this
is
better
than
the
coronabudcoors
group
of
brews
but
not
much
better
some
bitterness
and
balance
put
it
a
step
above
but
it
is
a
shallow
step
so
much
for
the
trip
down
memory
lane
d
this
is
to
me
on
par
with
the
drinkability
of
most
macros
ill
drink
them
but
if
something
else
is
available
ill
check
that
out
first
drinkability
is
amazing
sweet
enough
to
be
tasty
but
very
light
and
drinkable
drinkability
eh
marginally
average
would
probably
be
the
best
words
to
describe
this
beer
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
pure
gold
color
with
good
clarity
and
lots
of
rising
carbonation
the
one
finger
head
displayed
good
retention
as
a
thin
cap
and
very
nice
lacing
too
the
aroma
was
of
corn
stale
grains
and
lager
malt
the
flavors
were
not
very
impressive
dry
grains
macrolager
malt
some
earthydirty
pale
malt
a
little
bit
of
minerals
and
metal
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
carbonation
lightmedium
and
the
body
mediumlight
it
really
just
looked
much
better
than
it
was
drinkability
its
easy
to
drink
because
its
found
a
middle
area
between
too
light
and
light
that
is
not
half
bad
d
given
that
it
doesnt
taste
that
bad
and
it
has
a
light
body
its
relatively
drinkable
well
i
had
this
molson
offering
last
night
pours
out
a
nice
deep
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
last
and
then
fades
to
a
small
ring
of
laceing
looks
decent
smell
was
average
for
a
macro
and
that
trademark
corny
molson
smell
better
than
canadians
smell
this
was
a
great
tasteing
brew
tho
goes
down
smooth
well
carbonated
with
a
sweet
tart
after
taste
quite
pleasing
this
is
a
beer
that
can
be
slammed
all
night
and
thats
what
i
did
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
its
light
years
ahead
of
canadian
highly
enjoyable
tastey
and
light
highly
recommended
drinkable
like
water

given
the
price
im
gonna
go
with
moosehead
or
labatt
from
here
on
out
i
always
feel
whitetrashy
when
i
drink
this
beer
it
does
taste
good
especially
icecold
out
of
a
cooler
my
real
question
is
how
this
is
classified
as
an
american
blonde
it
looks
like
one
gold
pour
big
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
but
the
taste
is
a
lager
pale
malt
sweet
and
grainy
nothing
special
but
not
a
blonde
in
my
opinion
d
great
for
one
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
more
than
one
drinkability
on
the
whole
not
a
bad
beer
possibly
one
of
the
upper
level
cheap
beers
to
buy
the
bitterness
does
make
me
question
as
to
whether
or
not
many
can
be
drunk
at
a
time
pours
a
golden
dark
yellow
colored
body
and
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
it
has
a
pale
and
bitter
aroma
some
malts
does
not
have
much
flavor
but
there
is
a
light
bittersweetness
in
the
taste
very
light
tasting
yea
macros
d
liely
its
most
favorable
attributes
is
drinkability
a
bit
better
than
average
smell
and
taste
very
similar
to
their
canadian
this
is
an
overall
decent
lager
smooth
faint
aroma
light
golden
pour
with
minimal
head
retention
nice
and
easy
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
flavor
that
is
real
basic
not
much
to
write
home
about
but
its
a
solid
choice
for
a
simple
quenching
lager
pours
out
very
transparent
golden
yellow
with
a
bigbubbled
white
head
head
fizzles
out
quickly
and
theres
no
lacing
theres
a
greenbottle
funk
in
the
odor
accompanied
by
the
smell
of
cheerios
tastes
like
how
a
can
of
corn
smells
if
that
makes
any
sense
theres
a
cereal
kind
of
essence
to
the
tastes
as
well
pretty
watery
but
theres
a
decent
semiclean
aftertaste
its
an
ok
beer
on
par
with
any
other
bud
type
beer
i
suppose
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
i
was
very
impressed
by
canadas
beers
during
a
recent
trip
and
wanted
to
try
some
more
back
home
canada
mass
produces
beer
with
flavor
d
i
dont
really
care
for
blonde
ales
in
general
but
this
is
about
as
bad
as
it
can
get
virtually
flavorless
with
a
sickening
sweetness
accompanied
by
skunky
hops
top
it
off
with
a
nearly
flat
mouthfeel
and
this
is
one
toughtostomach
brew
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
some
very
nice
initial
head
almost
no
lacing
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
complete
malt
scent
but
even
that
was
a
bit
weak
nice
crisp
flavor
but
almost
entirely
malt
nearly
a
macro
lager
no
hop
balance
at
all
goes
down
very
smoothly
though
even
considering
the
amount
of
carbonation
a
good
thirst
quencher
if
not
a
great
beer
i
bought
this
in
a
6
pack
at
my
local
hannaford
maine
for
7
99
tax
deposit
not
as
good
as
its
brother
molson
canadian
its
name
doesnt
lie
it
is
very
deep
yellow
in
appearance
the
smell
is
strong
i
didnt
care
for
the
taste
a
little
bitter
for
me
its
mouthfeel

my
dad
likes
this
beer
which
is
more
of
an
indictment
than
an
endorsement
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
some
good
head
retention
due
to
high
carbonation
has
that
typical
grainy
adjunct
smell
but
it
is
light
and
not
pungent
like
other
cheap
beers
pale
and
dry
this
tastes
like
a
really
generic
beerreally
cheap
pils
guess
that
minimal
hop
bitedryness
on
the
backbite
makes
it
a
beer
rather
than
watery
piss
i
cant
even
see
drinking
this
while
eat
hot
wings
or
pizza
during
a
hockey
game
when
theres
labatts
or
excuse
me
real
beer
probably
the
best
of
the
molsons
ive
had
and
id
rather
not
try
any
more
to
see
if
i
can
find
better
golden
colored
a
thin
white
head
with
a
little
sticking
arouund
flavor
is
malty
sweet
cereal
and
a
bit
stale
tasting
but
its
at
least
not
skunked
or
foul
ie
molson
ice
not
horrible
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
anyone
could
drink
this
all
night
but
why
would
you
want
to
less
you
were
trying
to
get
smashed
even
then
id
drink
something
tastier
to
get
me
going
then
when
real
buzzed
start
on
this
shit
light
in
body
and
on
carbonation
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beers
body
feel
or
drinkabilty
its
not
a
worthy
beer
so
steer
clear
less
you
really
really
want
to
try
it
i
came
by
it
for
free
so
i
figured
id
try
and
review
this
one
bottle
d
if
youre
having
a
great
time
at
a
picnic
or
party
and
this
is
all
there
is
to
drink
i
believe
you
will
survive
without
much
complaint
d
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
seek
out
this
beer
bought
at
specs
as
a
broken
six
pack
single
no
glass
not
much
smell
very
health
wise

too
quite
a
smooth

with

in
the

department
dmv
a
pretty
easy
going
lager
from
americas
hat
part
why
bcuz
i
gotta
d
one
of
the
worst
ive
experienced
even
for
a

and
thats
not
being
biased
its
a

my

pretty
gross
actually
the
beer
totally
nosedived
after
the
appearance
not
recommended
whatsoever
do
avoid
pours
very
pale
golden
with
a
big
fluffy
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
but
does
leave
decent

for
a

beer
the
beer
has
an
astringent
but
not
unpleasant
aroma
that
carries
through
to
the
surprisingly
malty
flavor
there
is
a
slight
hop
bite
though
everything
evaporates
quickly
leaving
hardly
any
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely

not
a

that

i
could
definetly
still
pound
quite
a
few
of
these
over
the

of
a
night
overall
my
palate
has
changed
my
tastes
have
changed
and
this
is
no
longer
my
absolute
1
favorite
beer
but
i
think
it
is
still
head
shoulders
above
any
other
mass
produced
pale
macro
lager
out
there
yes
i
gave
it
a
couple
of
nostalgia
points
but
no
one
said
thats
not
allowed
when
moneys
tight
between
paychecks
or
im
hanging
out
with
macro
drinking
friends
this
will
remain
my
macro
beer
of
choice
overall
a
decent
macro
certainly
molsons
best
offering
light
bodied
not
bad
overall
for
a
macro
it
has
some
blonde
ale
features
overall
pretty
bland
and
the

a
golden

with
a

the
aroma

the

but
has
more
flavor
than
most
macro
lagers
on
the
market
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
brew
but
it
is
certainly
better
than
the
average
macro
lager
out
there
drink
it
while
it
is
cold
because
the
taste
quickly
deteriorates
as
it
heats
up
molson
golden
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
mildly
skunky
flavor
is
very
grainy
and
quite
a
bit
skunky
too
there
is
also
for
lack
of
a
better
description
a
woody
flavor
the
green
bottle
is
not
doing
this
one
a
favor
pours
a
light
yellowblond
color
with
a
decent
head
green
bottle
so
theres
some
skunkiness
not
a
surprise
decent
foam
though
taste
is
somewhat
maltish
and
dry
kind
of
bland
up
front
nothing
impressive
its
not
much
of
a
blonde
ale
either
interesting
nostalgic
trip
but
im
good
on
this
one
for
a
while
poured
into
a
pint
glass
highly
carbonated
head
light
straw
color
the
smell
is
much
like
an
off
europale
lager
the
skunk
of
the
beer
comes
through
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
no
crispness
or
smoothness
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
but
i
wouls
say
that
sense
is
influenced
by
the
previous
two
factors
all
together
the
drinkability
is
brought
down
but
it
is
no
different
than
drinking
any
of
the
europale
lagers
anyway
the
last
time
i
tried
this
the
beer
was
golden
in
colour
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
was
weak
with
a
grassy
tinge
to
it
it
was
very
crisp
and
clear
on
the
tongue
with
weak
carbonation
the
taste
was
also
weak
not
watery
but
not
very
beery
either
drinkability
this
is
my
wifes
beer
of
choice
ill
leave
the
rest
for
her
green
bottle
skunkupon
opening
and
through
the
pour
and
drink
the
distinctive
hops
flavor
overpowered
any
other
flavors
not
in
a
strong
way
but
in
a
euroskunk
been
in
the
sun
too
long
way
this
was
a
fresh
bottle
but
the
ideas
is
the
same
ive
enjoyed
it
and
even
bought
it
before
but
now
that
my
beer
palate
is
a
bit
more
experienced
i
can
taste
it
for
what
it
isa
canadian
macro
would
i
turn
it
down
no
would
i
buy
it
perhaps
for
the
right
event
as
macros
go
this
is
probably
the
best
molson
product
available
at
least
in
the
us
and
is
much
better
than
its
sister
regular
coors
the
hopless
wonder
a
very
decent
macro
beer
grainy
flavorful
and
balanced
i
bought
a
6pack
of
this
when
with
some
friends
it
was
the
best
available
option
they
normally
only
drink
miller
lite
but
they
really
liked
it
flavorful
enough
for
me
to
tolerate
not
too
flavorful
for
them
to
tolerate
its
a
beer
for
the
masses
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
nothing
that
leaps
out
at
you
but
nice
would
recommend
a
try
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
just
cover
the
beer
and
with
a
minimal
lacing
strong
skunkly
smell
taste
is
grainy
malt
up
front
with
a
skunked
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
dry
light
lots
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
if
you
like
the
skunky
smell
and
taste
this
is
a
nice
change
from
molson
canadian
its
not
as
good
as
canadian
but
its
pretty
good
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
lacy
head
if
your
a
fan
of
molson
and
the
like
pick
this
one
up
itll
be
in
my
rotation
from
now
on
its
molson
what
else
is
there
to
say
the
bottle
was
freshness
dated
code
on
the
neck
the
ale
poured
as
i
would
have
expected
a
light
golden
color
smell
was
stronger
than
id
anticipated
the
body
wasnt
that
of
a
craft
brew
but
it
wasnt
as
lacking
as
found
in
most
macros
very
drinkable
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
one
at
all
on
occasions
where
micros
arent
available
i
think
it
may
earn
a
regular
spot
in
my
refrigerator
primarily
for
macrodrinking
guests
but
also
on
occasion
for
me
as
a
session
brew
d
it
is
okay
but
not
canadas
finest
offering
when
poured
into
a
simple
pint
glass
the
beer
really
wasnt
a
golden
color
but
a
really
pale
yellow
color
with
a
minimal
head
of
white
foam
i
was
surprised
that
there
was
an
aroma
to
this
beer
it
was
just
sweet
grains
a
pinch
of
citrus
fruits
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
at
the
end
noting
really
good
but
at
least
it
didnt
have
any
skunk
in
it
this
beer
tasted
like
beer
what
more
can
say
about
it
it
had
a
taste
of
crisp
grains
like
corn
and
rice
and
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
its
beer
all
right
the
mouthfeel
was
light
not
too
watery
which
why
it
makes
it
so
drinkable
i
drank
4
of
these
in
a
row
and
felt
nothing
after
it
i
could
drink
these
again
if
they
were
cheap
or
the
way
i
got
them
free
the
beer
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
was
light
malt
and
hops
basic
sour
beer
the
taste
was
of
hops
and
malt
the
beer
was
drinkable
but
offered
very
little
that
was
exciting
or
enticing
this
one
would
be
ok
in
a
pinch
but
not
a
very
satisfying
product
an
ok
beer
but
not
much
else
much
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
the
raw
canadien
lagers
this
is
smoother
and
creamier
and
to
be
honest
much
tastier
they
bill
it
as
a
cross
between
a
lager
and
an
ale
not
sure
what
it
is
exactly
but
it
isnt
bad
id
buy
a
pitcher
of
this
after
a
playing
some
hockey
slightly
above
average
pale
apple
cider
colored
yellow
thin
head
the
collar
leaves
sparse
amounts
of
lace
aroma
contains
light
amounts
of
sweetness
and
light
amounts
of
skunk
thats
about
it
not
a
lot
on
the
nose
skunkiness
is
minimal
on
the
buds
light
graininess
and
almost
a
dortmunder
kind
of
malthops
blend
but
not
quite
nonetheless
this
isnt
bad
i
must
have
a
relatively
fresh
one
as
the
skunk
quotient
is
low
body
checks
in
around
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
a
little
aggresive
but
thats
almost
to
be
expected
with
macro
style
lagers
sometimes
its
not
annoying
in
any
case
this
is
a
decent
beer
drinkability
good
to
have
on
a
really
hot
day
but
not
anything
too
special
this
is
a
pretty
decent
drinking
beer
its
clean
and
clear
but
not
as
golden
as
the
title
hints
at
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
the
head
fades
quick
the
smell
is
nothing
special
but
not
bad
either
the
taste
is
smooth
and
light
with
only
a
traditional
beer
taste
about
it
no
subtle
hints
of
anything
else
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
but
refreshing
more
so
than
any
soda
can
provide
the
over
all
drinkability
is
good
i
think
for
this
one
and
i
was
kind
of
suprised
to
see
such
a
low
mark
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
its
an
enzyme
manufactured
beer
and
many
have
refined
pallets
cheers
d
quite
drinkable
if
you
dont
let
the
ambiguous
taste
get
to
you
pretty
average
overall
a
beer
that
brings
back
great
summer
memories

the
front
porch

the

order

not

its

was

something

the

was
as
is
almost
always
the
case
more
of
the

its

a

there

almost
mouthfeel
almost

i
could
drink
several
of
these
bottom
line
this
quality
isnt
awesome
but
tastes
ok
and
its
pretty
interesting
for
such
a
pale
beer
maybe
thats
the
ale
yeast
at
work
if
i
hadnt
repeatedly
read
that
this
was
a
type
of
ale
i
would
swear
its
a
lager
and
if
any
brits
read
this
and
then
happen
to
get
ahold
of
a
molson
golden
do
not
drink
it
warm
your
native
ales
taste
fine
warm
by
which
i
mean
newcastle
and
bass
im
not
a
british
ale
afficionado
but
this
beer
does
not
warm
well
i
didnt
deduct
anything
for
that
since
i
didnt
give
this
beer
a
real
high
rating
anyway
and
i
dont
drink
beer
warm
on
purpose
but
you
dont
want
this
unless
its
at
least
cool
clear
as
watereddown
urine
with
a
finely
carbonated
head
that
scatters
to
a
mear
film
lots
of
carbonation
running
all
over
the
glass
the
mildly
fruity
aroma
is
followed
by
a
wheatlike
grain
dryness
not
much
of
anything
going
on
in
the
smell
but
not
disgusting
either
the
taste
is
fruity
up
front
with
a
creamy
but
skunky
finish
the
foul
sourness
not
good
sourness
is
a
bit
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
dim
and
leaves
a
slick
oily
taste
which
is
not
very
enjoyable
overall
is
it
bad

the
mouthfeel
remains
crisp

refreshing
the
all
around

is
a

for
the

the

makes
a
great
drinkability
despite
my
ratings
i
drink
molson
prodcuts
as
often
as
i
can
beacsue
i
enjoy
them
personally
i
do
realize
this
isnt
the
best
beer
in
fact
far
from
it
but
i
enjoy
the
easyness
of
it
and
the
fact
that
i
can
have
plenty
and
not
feel
full
its
very
pale

i
had
this
bc
a

of
mine
loves
it

gave
me
a

try
nothing
great

not

do
think
the

this

and
all
of
molsons
beers
seems
better
than
most
american

not
bad

not

you

only
a

around
the
edge
of
the

kinda
skunky
which
is
what
to
expect
from
a
minimal
flavored
beer
resembles
coors
original
a
little
not
too
suprising
as
they
are
the
same
company
little
pricey
for
the
quality
of
beer
but
as
one
of
the
guys
said
above
its
a

one
of
the

the

is
pale
golden

colored
with
a
mediumsized
white
frothy
head
that
was
mostly
gone
before
the
first
sip
the
smell
was
a
little
stinky
of
corn

the
taste
is
bland

tiny
bitterness
toward
the
finish
thin

watery
texture
lively
carbonation
yes
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
think
it
was
just
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
really
cold
and
i
got
to
drink
at
work
not
because
of
the
beers
characteristics
not
a
beer
for
a
beer
nerd
but
i
would
much
rather
see
people
drinking
this
as
their
mindless
choice
of
a
beer
as
opposed
to
many
other
macrobrews
molson
goldon
drinks
like
a
dressed
up
beefed
up
smoothed
out
macro
lager
the
website
describes
it
as
a
unique
blend
of
an
ale
and
a
lager
how
is
that
even
possible
unless
they
actually
blended
two
different
beers
is
it
good
enough
for
those
of
us
used
to
quality
craft
beer
not
as
far
as
im
concerned
in
a
roomful
of
macros
though
molson
golden
might
be
one
of
the
better
options

brew
of
choice
when
i
was
stationed
down
in

it
seems
to
have
improved
overalla
fine
job
for
the
style
i
am
satisfied
with
this
beer
obviously
its
nothing
youll
get
up
and
scream
about
but
the
quality
is
here
from
molson
not
a
bad
brew
at
all

on

not
much
but
some
average
micro
mouthfeel
very
very
easy
drinking
beer
a
bit
watery
even
as
canadian
macros
go
its
still
better
than
american
macros
though
not
nearly
the
rice
and
corn
flavors
not
much
body
or
complexity
here
which
was
probably
the
intent
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summers
day
as
a
thirst
quencher
nothing
complex
about
this
one
but
its
a
clean
easy
drinking
well
balanced
ale
that
would
make
for
an
ideal
session
or
lawnmower
beer
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
but
dont
expect
a
lot
of
flavor
or
any
complexity
very
decent
for
a
canadian
macro
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
crisp
clean
pale
malt
scent
that
is
slightly
skunky
and
dry
the
taste
is

it
has
a
light
plain

flavor
with
a
slightly
skunky
taste
and
a
dry

the
mouthfeel
is

it
is
a
low

beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
drinking
canadian

it

devoid

goes

the

i
enjoyed
for
lunch
i
think
all
beers
have
their
place
and
this
one
worked
today
mouthfeel
fine
and
drinkability
for
the
situation
was
great
certainly
not
my
all
time
favorite
but
it
is
my
favorite
cheap
beer
i
wont
really
drink
anything
cheaper
lots
of
carbonation
no
head
to
speak
of
i
think
it
smells
and
tastes
a
little
bit
like
green
apples
great
on
a
hot
day
crisp
and
refreshing
i
can
even
get
my
wife
to
drink
it
simply
put
its
better
than
nothing
and
its
not
as
much
as
the
good
stuff
great
value
this
was
a
quite
drinkable
beer
that
in
my
mind
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
its
quite
refreshing
but
it
just
lacks
in
the
taste
department
the
beer
after
departing
the
green
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
limpid
gold
color
with
a
moderate
sized
white
head
that
is
somewhat
creamy
in
texture
with
the
lace
forming
a
tight
curtain
to
drape
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
fresh
and
crisp
start
is
sweet
and
decently
malted
the
top
skinny
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
moderately
carbonated
the
hops
adequately
spicy
dry
aftertaste
and
i
see
ive
not
missed
much
over
the
last
4
years
poured
from
cans
into
a
large
pilsner
glass
on
the
back
deck
this
is
a
pale
clear
strawcolored
brew
the
head
is
puffy
white
and
fairly
large
it
also
leaves
a
surprising
amount
of
lace
its
a
pretty
good
looking
beer
not
much
aroma
grainy
and
grassy
but
not
much
else
neither
maltiness
nor
flowery
hops
sigh
the
taste
is
sweet
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
remember
theres
a
little
yeastiness
and
vegetable
flavors
but
its
all
very
subtle
its
a
very
light
almost
watery
beer
the
finish
is
weak
and
sweeter
than
id
like
a
good
dose
of
bittering
hops
would
do
this
beer
some
good
all
in
all
however
its
a
decent
lawnmower
brew
well
this
was
the
best
beer
they
had
on
the
menu
at
a
place
we
went
yeah
i
could
have
had
water
but
as
a
ba
i
thought
what
the
heck
since
i
poured
it
myself
i
got
a
beer
that
was
medium
pale
gold
in
color
buh
no
real
head
to
speak
of
i
was
dazzled
at
all
the
bubbles
rising
but
not
so
impressed
by
them
when
drinking
my
notes
next
to
aroma
say
which
leads
me
to
think
there
wasnt
that
much
at
all
medium
mouthfeel
but
i
must
say
the
taste
isnt
all
that
theres
some
sweetness
and
jellycandy
notes
but
overall
i
would
have
to
say
it
came
across
as
very
watery
typical
macro
lager
in
appearance
light
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
quite
a
strong
pilsner
like
aroma
grassy
and
it
seems
fresh
quite
a
smooth
sweet
taste
then
a
small
hop
bite
is
detected
some
bitterness
left
in
the
aftertaste
average
mouthfeel
though
it
does
tend
to
become
cloying
overall
not
that
bad
really
for
a
canadian
lager
no
more
of
ths
for
me
this
beer
looks
nice
and
is
drinkable
when
cold
but
is
bland
and
somewhat
unpleasant
the
warmer
it
gets
i
would
have
given
it
higher
ratings
if
the
taste
didnt
disintegrate
as
it
warmed
snagged
this
from
my
roommates
fridge
this
is
a
very
clean
looking
beer
it
poured
to
a
golden
hue
with
an
impressive
head
which
didnt
last
too
long
unfortunately
aroma
is
very
similiar
to
bmc
i
was
expecting
just
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
or
hops
from
this
one
taste
is
pretty
bland
as
well
everything
about
this
beer
is
understated
this
is
nothing
spectacular
but
then
again
it
had
no
serious
problems
drinkability
hmmm
due
to
its
blandness
and
low
alcohol
content
this
beer
does
go
down
without
too
many
qualms
but
the
soulessness
of
this
beer
becomes
obnoxious
after
like
a
half
a
beer
making
a
person
want
to
get
a
beer
thats
not
molson
golden
this
is
a
beer
i
am
going
to
try
to
avoid
a
drinkable
brew
but
just
not
a
first
choice
type
of
beer
pours
a
medium
golden
colour
with
little
to
no
head
smell
is
quite
minimal
with
it
being
basically
a
bit
of
sweetnes
with
some
lemon
and
some
malt
perhaps
quite
thin
but
not
nearly
as
bad
a
an
american
macro
the
taste
is
quite
average
not
cheap
tastin
like
bud
but
not
full
of
flavour
either
this
one
is
smooth
throughout
and
has
a
basic
taste
that
echoes
the
smell
for
the
most
part
again
better
than
an
american
macro
and
i
could
drink
these
if
need
be
but
really
only
ordered
it
because
i
hadnt
had
one
in
a
long
time
this
is
a
beer
i
rate
just
ahead
of
the
macro
crowd
here
in
the
usa
lively
on
the
tongue
but
bland
in
taste
it
might
be
a
fallback
refresher
on
a
hot
day
but
not
something
id
stock
my
fridge
with
nothing
much
to
write
home
about
a
lawnmower
beer
at
best
thats
priced
too
high
compared
to
others
certainly
not
something
that
id
seek
out
again
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
it
is
light
with
some
crispness
dry
aftertaste
as
slight
bitterness
seems
to
show
up
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
average
drinkability
for
a
macro
drinkability

this
one
is
on
par
with
the
other
molsons
that
ive
had
they
arent
putting
out
anything
stellar
but
they
are
a
small
notch
above
the
other
macros
fairly
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
example
of
the
canadian
brewers
art
on
the
palate
it
is
fruity
with
a
pleasant
bitter
bite
on
the
finish
there
is
however
a
fleeting
impression
of
talc
and
medicinebox
notes
in
the
midpalate
which
keeps
this
from
acheiving
appropriate
heights
of
cleanness
and
balance
pu
upon
opening
and
pouring
i
am
greeted
by
the
aroma
of
pepe
le
pews
quebecois
cousin
that
stench
subsides
enough
that
the
glass
of
beer
in
front
of
me
is
at
least
drinkable
the
head
is
thin
but
it
is
creamy
enough
to
stick
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
color
is
yellowgold
and
there
are
tons
of
floating
little
bits
in
it
flavor
is
lightstruck
hops
adjunct
and
cheap
malt
finishes
with
a
woody
bitter
aftertaste
a
lame
and
somewhat
offensive
fluid
has
a
sweet
taste
and
aftertaste
to
it
but
is
somewhat
watery
and
devoid
of
any
distinct
character
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
exceptional
either
and
im
sure
i
would
pass
it
by
if
other
beers
are
available
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
molson
products
molson
canadian
while
not
a
fabulous
beer
by
any
means
is
better
than
this
however
i
think
of
molson
golden
as
one
of
those
it
is
what
it
is
beers
if
youre
thirsty
itll
do
the
job
but
if
you
want
anything
approaching
tasty
it
just
doesnt
measure
up
ah
molson
golden
this
beer
pours
a
golden
colour
with
absolutely
almost
no
head
this
beer
is
pretty
similar
to
moosehead
but
it
does
have
a
flowery
pilsenerlike
taste
to
italmost
a
bit
like
a
brooklyn
pilsener
from
the
bottle
this
beer
also
features
a
thin
mouthfeel
that
is
not
that
great
a
pretty
drinkable
runofthemill
molson
product
not
bad
but
not
something
to
search
out
canadian
is
better
and
this
is
also
better
in
canada
than
in
the
us
although
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
it
still
remains
average
for
the
style
enjoy
it
cold
and
as
soon
as
it
warms
slightly
dump
it
and
crack
another
this
was
the
fire
sale
at
the
flying
saucer
last
night
it
poured
a
very
clear
light
straw
an
overall
fine
looking
beer
to
bad
i
was
not
painting
a
picture
but
rather
drinking
a
beer
the
aroma
was
nill
the
taste
was
similar
to
coors
that
is
none
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
this
beer
does
not
have
much
to
recommend
it
it
was
not
bad
so
if
you
are
with
someone
who
wants
to
switch
from
coors
maybe
suggest
this
one
but
other
than
that
skip
it
this
pours
a
perfectly
clear
golden
color
with
a
moderately
fluffy
lingering
head
that
collapse
to
leave
fine
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
topped
with
sharp
yet
subtle
hops
the
aftertaste
is
mild
lingering
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
crisp
carbonation
overall
a
moderately
good
yet
satisfying
beer
i
like
molsons
export
alei
really
do
the
golden
however
does
not
measure
up
rather
it
has
all
the
shortcomings
of
the
macrobrewery
from
which
it
comes
it
pours
light
and
fizzy
yet
somehow
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
flat
the
smell
is
indistinct
and
the
taste
is
too
theres
a
touch
of
hoppiness
which
adds
something
but
unfortunately
not
enough
there
is
nothing
here
that
will
wow
anyone
as
i
stated
it
is
kind
of
refreshing
but
there
is
nothing
here
that
will
keep
me
coming
back
boring
and
bland
seem
to
be
the
motifs
with
this
beer
notes
plain
tasting
bland
could
be
refreshing
if
it
was
100
f
and
it
was
ice
cold
but
then
i
would
not
even
be
drinking
it
for
the
taste
as
the
oldest
brewery
1786
in
north
american
you
would
expect
something
more
than
a
beer
that
appeals
to
the
american
massproduced
megabeer
palette
and
when
youre
expected
to
pay
extra
because
its
an
imported
beer
the
value
declines
further
a
yellowishgold
color
is
unimpressive
the
thinmedium
malt
presents
a
somewhat
mealy
odd
tasting
flavor
the
hops
are
a
little
more
noticeable
than
some
of
the
american
megabrew
counterparts
the
lightly
skunky
aroma
is
less
than
pleasant
i
do
not
like
this
very
much
yellow
to
light
golden
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
little
lacing
grassy
nose
with
some
faint
maltiness
the
taste
was
of
malt
with
a
small
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
this
is
pleasant
beer
that
neither
offends
or
impresses
i
found
the
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
to
be
one
of
the
strongest
impressions
pours
out
a
clear
darkish
golden
color
moderate
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
strong
corn
aromas
and
a
hint
of
floral
hoppiness
sort
of
strange
tasting
a
dirty
or
earthy
maltiness
some
adjuncts
a
slight
hop
crispness
in
the
finish
all
this
is
propped
up
by
a
rather
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
seems
to
be
the
only
highly
redeeming
quality
to
this
beer
not
really
impressed
and
i
clearly
prefer
the
canadian
molson
over
the
golden
counterpart
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
thick
snowwhite
head
that
fades
but
remains
to
the
end
modest
carbonation
and
very
good
lace
aroma
is
very
skunky
and
sulferous
not
at
all
pleasant
somewhere
underneath
all
of
the
skunk
there
seems
to
be
some
malt
hops
and
hints
of
alcohol
but
its
hard
to
tell
taste
begins
with
slightly
sweet
maltiness
which
gives
way
to
mild
medicinal
hop
bitterness
both
malt
and
hops
seem
to
fade
to
the
end
with
a
clean
and
crisp
finish
i
suspect
that
this
sample
may
be
light
struck
cursed
be
those
who
do
not
bottle
beer
in
brown
glass
but
its
really
not
that
bad
curious
that
this
commonlyavailable
beer
has
not
garnered
more
reviews
and
this
is
a
pale
ale
hard
to
believe
thankfully
i
only
paid
89c
for
a
single
of
this
beer
personal
notes
this
was
pretty
bad
the
sad
part
is
this
used
to
be
a
staple
for
me
for
about
7
years
of
my
life
during
that
time
i
had
a
canadian
girlfriend
whose
father
asked
me
one
day
what
are
you
drinking
that
stuff
for
now
i
know
why
clear
dark
yellow
appearance
biggish
head
that
clears
to
nothing
in
20
seconds
no
lacing
in
the
pint
glass
a
blend
of
vague
lemon
and
corn
to
the
aroma
some
tassel
and
pollenlike
stuff
going
on
taste
is
pretty
strippeddown
a
little
bit
of
diacetyl
and
mild
corn
syrup
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
decent
hop
crispness
late
not
bad
balance
the
malts
seem
more
at
fault
this
beer
just
doesnt
generate
a
flavor
profile
cant
really
recommend
this
one
nice
golden
colour
with
pleasing
head
which
quickly
disapates
having
said
that
the
body
is
weak
taste
is
nondescript
poor
thing
is
rather
ugly
tasting
in
a
pretty
sort
of
way
nuff
said
blahh
just
a
bland
beer
with
a
slightly
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
after
enjoying
the
craftwork
of
bill
and
ron
at
victorymaterialized
in
the
art
that
is
golden
monkey
i
can
say
this
this
isnt
a
beer
but
sadly
in
comparison
of
many
macros
this
is
a
good
macro
which
is
why
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
i
rated
it
as
only
a
little
below
average
molson
golden
is
aptly
named
as
it
is
a
pale
goden
color
and
pours
with
about
a
one
inch
nice
white
head
the
head
slowly
dissipates
and
leaves
no
evidence
of
its
earlier
prescence
the
aroma
is
faint
but
has
a
hint
of
hops
florals
in
it
it
smells
very
fresh
on
the
taste
the
malt
is
evident
and
the
hops
clean
the
palate
fairly
well
but
there
is
a
hint
of
something
tha
lingers
and
i
want
to
say
it
is
butterscotch
but
it
is
just
a
hint
after
a
few
moments
an
unpleasant
bitterness
reappears
as
an
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
typical
macrothin
but
the
drinkability
is
better
than
most
macros
this
beer
gives
a
fair
blend
of
macro
swill
and
micro
thrill
can
opens
with
a
resounding
poop
smell
fills
my
nostrils
as
i
close
my
eyes
and
bring
the
can
to
my
lips
i
take
a
can
opener
and
pop
another
hole
in
the
back
of
the
can
as
i
tilt
my
head
and
allow
the
sweet
nector
to
fill
my
gullet
the
only
way
to
drink
this
beer
is
frat
style
not
a
sipping
beer
pours
a
very
clear
light
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
tries
to
leave
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
a
heavy
lemon
twang
with
nothing
else
coming
through
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
smell
revealing
an
earthy
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
it
is
rather
faint
it
has
traces
of
a
light
spice
but
this
definitely
has
more
characteristics
of
a
lager
than
an
ale
just
fair
in
my
book
i
think
this
is
canadas
very
own
bud
cheers
very
light
and
smooth
are
the
defining
characteristics
of
this
beer
not
much
taste
difference
than
any
other
simple
cheaper
beer
but
a
bit
more
flavorful
and
certainly
not
as
nasty
smelling
doesnt
have
that
terrible
corn
flavor
either
all
in
all
a
refreshing
crisp
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
good
but
certainly
nothing
special
and
it
beats
dirty
molson
ice
any
day
in
conclusion
molson
is
marketing
a
well
done
hybrid
product
that
is
really
worth
the
money
doesnt
seem
like
an
ale
to
me
but
it
is
a
little
dark
in
flavor
and
smooth
for
an
economic
beer
it
goes
down
with
great
ease
and
it
is
no
problem
to
have
a
few
a
decent
to
good
brew
that
you
can
drink
with
a
good
flavor
and
a
medium
body
i
have
to
say
that
i
kind
of
like
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
starts
off
with
kind
of
an
apple
flavor
followed
up
by
a
hint
of
light
malt
the
flavor
is
kind
of
thin
but
this
is
really
not
a
bad
beer
not
something
thatll
make
it
to
the
top
of
my
list
but
not
bad
this
is
a
decent
macro
yes
my
tastes
are
more
along
the
lines
of
any
ipa
but
when
fresh
this
beer
is
decent
pours
out
to
a
bright
yellow
with
a
quickly
fading
head
very
light
aroma
somewhat
that
of
corn
and
grains
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
albeit
very
light
ocanada
someone
start
singing
already
is
hockey
night
in
canada
on
the
tube
in
the
detroit
area
labatt
and
molson
products
sell
quite
well
at
one
time
this
was
a
huge
seller
all
over
the
u
s
this
particular
beer
has
seen
better
days
saleswise
but
is
overall
a
decent
beer
there
once
was
a
time
in
the
early
80s
when
my
friends
and
i
thought
that
this
was
the
best
beer
it
had
to
be
it
cost
2
65
a
six
back
then
but
as
im
drinking
one
now
i
laugh
at
that
thought
now
it
just
seems
like
any
other
lightbodied
massproduced
lagerale
hell
which
is
it
anyway
not
something
id
go
out
and
purchase
myself
these
days
this
one
was
one
of
a
fresh
12
pak
given
to
me
i
dont
know
if
its
me
and
my
palate
growing
more
umm
sophisticated
or
the
brewerys
recipe
being
doctored
over
the
years
a
very
light
ale
with
very
little
flavor
a
very
pleasant
beer
with
well
balanced
hops
and
slightly
sweet
malt
i
like
this
a
little
better
than
molson
canadian
lager
the
only
good
thing
about
the
flavor
is
that
there
is
not
much
of
it
light
cabernet
buttery
flavors
hit
the
tongue
with
bubblegum
grain
and
cereal
malt
this
is
much
sweeter
than
your
average
adjunct
and
thats
not
good
notes
i
was
under
the
impression
that
this
was
a
trader
joes
beer
but
perhaps
not
regardless
its
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
found
at
trader
joes
its
sweetish
with
no
hops
bitterness
or
malt
flavor
just
a
thin
corn
note
its
inexpensive
which
is
great
but
its
not
good
enough
that
i
wouldnt
pay
more
to
get
a
better
retro
beer
genesee
cream
ale
is
just
12
99
for
a
30
pack
which
equals
43
a
can
grabbed
a
can
for
a
buck
on
a
whim
thought
it
would
just
be
a
pounder
after
playing
hockey
but
this
is
a
syrupy
thick
poor
brew
serving
type
can
crisp
refreshing
and
flavorful
quite
nice
rather
sweet
in
the
flavor
reminds
me
a
bit
of
some
of
those
strong
polish
lagers
like
tatra
and
zywiec
except
this
one
cant
boast
68
abv
those
also
taste
cleaner
with
more
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
and
are
generally
enjoyable
to
drink
this
one
has
a
rather
assertive
artificial
generifruit
gummy
candy
or
jellybean
fruitiness
in
the
finish
and
no
hops
to
balance
things
out
not
particularly
dry
and
weak
in
mouthfeel
and
body
the
first
couple
sips
were
ok
but
im
wishing
i
didnt
have
5
more
of
these
to
drink
the
carbonation
starts
out
very
lively
but
gets
fairly
flat
about
halfway
through
and
youre
stuck
with
something
akin
to
a
less
than
great
apple
cider
definitely
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
o
again
not
a
bad
aalamerican
pale
lager
but
certainly
not
an
interesting
beer
slight
chemical
flavors
in
the

enough

fast
somewhat
watery
mouth
feel
a
pale
lager
through
and
through
but
refreshing
on
these
hot
summer
days
o
after
the
first
two
lagers
from
tj
ended
up
being
not
terrible
it
kind
of
gave
me
hope
for
the
others
too
bad
two
okayish
lagers
would
lead
into
two
horrid
ones
ill
give
the
slight
edge
to
this
over
the
trader
jose
crap
but
only
just
theyre
both
easy
drainpours
either
way
o
in
all
seriousness
this
is
a
terrible
beer
but
again
as
a
corn
cider
its
drinkable
id
reach
for
a
name
tag
lager
before
i
picked
up
an
american
budweiser
but
i
can
think
of
a
few
unappealing
american
macro
lagers
that
id
reach
for
before
picking
up
one
of
these
again
very
very
bad
if
i
didnt
have
another
five
to
finish
id
say
id
never
try
it
again
the
verdict
meh
another
cheap
beer
from
trader
joes
its
a
step
up
from
old
milwaukee
and
the
like
but
its
still
a
cheap
beer
for
the
same
price
ill
take
the
much
better

from
tjs
this
one
is
too
thin

i
am
glad
this
beer
does
not
say
superior
private
reserve
or
best
because
it
is
truly
not
any
of
them
for
the
price
this
beer
is
great
to
try
or
cook
with
but
it
is
nothing
special
i
vote
buy
a
six
pack
drink
one
or
two
and
cook
some
brats
with
the
remainder
the
appearance
and
smell
are
just
average
not
like
the
cheap
pee
smell
some
sub
1
beers
have
the
taste
is
great
not
bitter
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
very
smooth
pretty
sweet
and
estery
for
a
lager
just
too
sweet
this
beer
seems
like
a
lemony
bud
light
ill
have
to
pass
on
drinking
any
more
of
these
but
i
think
those
bud
light
lime
drinkers
might
like
it
d
o
want
apple
juice
that
says
its
beer
this
is
for
you
o
with
appropriately
low
expectations
youll
probably
agree
that
this
hits
its
target
a
cheap
but
drinkable
lager
not
especially
bad
but
not
very
enjoyable
on
the
flip
side
this
mixes
extremely
well
with
trader
joes
orange
juice
coarse
bubbles
but
not
unpleasant
mouthfeel
in
the
cheap
swill
department
there
are
better
choices
i
am
a
fan
of
less
sophisticated
beers
like
old
style
or
hamms
most
likely
due
to
fond
college
memories
of
drinking
them
and
i
usually
do
not
shy
away
from
a
beer
just
because
of
price
but
i
should
have
known
even
in
the
land
of
two
buck
chuck
that
3
99
a
sixer
was
too
good
to
be
true
poured
this
12
oz
can
of
name
tag
american
pale
lager
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
pale
straw
color
produced
a
thin
white
head
with
poor
retention
and
it
leaves
no
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
fresh
and
clean
grain
and
corn
no
hop
aroma
to
speak
of
light
in
body
this
lager
is
sweet
a
nice
mouthfeel
not
much
taste
or
character
there
is
some
grain
flavor
with
the
taste
of
corn
overall
its
decent
there
are
worse
american
lagers
out
there
but
honestly
its
not
something
that
i
would
purchase
again
even
for
the
50
cents
that
i
paid
for
this
can
yes
i
paid
50
cents
how
about
that
for
a
man
soda
prost
o
for
50
cents
a
can
you
cant
do
much
better
great
to
keep
on
hand
for
a
hot
summer
day
its
refreshing
and
not
awful
enough
said
for
2
99
a
sixer
i
see
this
is
brewed
in
monroe
which
was
the
longtime
home
of
berghoff
beers
at
one
time
berghoff
had
an
advertising
campaign
that
used
name
tags
hello
my
name
is
berghoff
i
wonder
is
this
a
riff
on
or
homage
to
the
old
campaign
only
good
thing
i
can
say
is
it
goes
down
rather
smoothly
but
thats
it
like
i
said
for
fifty
cents
a
can
you
cant
really
expect
anything
spectacular
this
is
something
id
drink
on
the
beach
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
i
have
nothing
else
around
o
well
this
beer
provides
an
experience
i
will
leave
it
at
that
pbr
is
a
very
rich
beer
compared
to
this
stuff
extremely
lightbodied
with
a
flavor
or
lack
thereof
to
match
i
suppose
that
for
3
for
a
sixpack
i
cant
be
blamed
too
much
12oz
can
purchased
at
trader
joes
in
portland
me
pours
a
very
light
yellow
crystalclear
body
with
no
head
to
speak
of
grains
similar
to
a
triscuit
cracker
and
the
slightest
hint
of
citrissy
hops
jump
out
of
the
aroma
but
only
lightly
bready
and
crackerlike
notes
make
up
most
of
the
flavor
with
a
hint
of
cooked
vegetable
and
citrus
to
round
things
out
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
suppose
very
simple
nothing
horribly
wrong
with
it
about
what
youd
expect
for
3
99
per
sixpack
i
guess
overall
not
terrible
but
then
again
neither
is
miller
lite
both
are
so
flavorless
that
they
dont
offend
but
also
so
weak
that
they
really
arent
worth
my
time
drinking
at
2
99
a
sixpack
i
had
to
give
this
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
the
thin
head
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
was
not
too
impressive
no
hops
to
be
found
and
a
little
stale
the
taste
was
surprisingly
sweet
up
front
with
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
medium
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
great
for
the
price
it
is
many
times
better
than
anything
else
you
can
find
for
50
cents
a
can
ok
i
did
it
this
has
some
potential
but
needs
work
i
picture
trader
joes
contracting
to
someone
to
make
an
all
malt
lager
for
cheap
but
good
i
feel
like
the
recipe
is
fine
but
there
could
be
more
attention
to
detail
in
the
process
to
get
a
drier
cleaner
brew
o
the
price
isnt
bad
which
i
guess
brings
this
up
a
bit
an
adequate
substitute
for
your
bmc
do
rated
to
style
drinkability
is
there
for
the
bmc
folk
obviously
there
are
better
beers
out
there
but
at
this
price
point
it
demands
a
purchase
if
only
to
catch
a
buzz
minhas
sure
does
do
everything
not
to
show
ownership
in
its
brews
o
to
be
quite
honest
id
drink
this
beer
if
it
were
closer
to
5
bucks
a
six
pack
i
really
enjoy
it
it
is
simple
and
has
no
frills
at
50
cents
a
can
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
more
beer
for
your
buck
id
take
it
over
budcoorsmiller
but
not
over
much
else
it
is
slightly
below
average
in
every
way
but
it
doesnt
suck
for
2
99
per
6
pack
i
aint
complaining
im
surprised
to
see
all
the
negative
reviews
at
2
99
a
6
pack
this
is
possibly
the
cheapest
beer
in
america
but
blows
away
any
of
the
macrobrews
like
budweiser
pbr
keystone
etc
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
cheap
pilsner
infact
it
reminds
me
of
the
sob
pilsner
which
is
not
a
beer
im
crazy
about
but
again
at
2
99
a
6
pack
this
is
more
of
a
compliment
then
complaint
if
youre
looking
for
some
cheap
summer
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
here
o
not
half
bad
for
2
99
for
a
six
pack
of
cans
at
trader
joes
you
could
do
worse
and
pay
twice
as
much
o
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
any
time
you
want
to
drink
a
few
beers
but
not
be
hungover
because
of
a
high
abv
o
overall
i
have
to
say
this
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
better
than
bmc
offerings
and
half
the
cost
i
know
what
ill
be
having
any
time
i
feel
like
a
lawnmower
beer
from
here
on
out
overall
impression
im
not
sure
id
bother
pouring
this
stuff
into
a
glass
again
but
you
could
certainly
do
worse
for
a
lawnmowergolf
course
brew
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
avoid
this
not
even
worth
a
tick
12

served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
corn
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
its
mostly
sweet
malt
and
corn
but
theres
also
a
slight
bitter
taste
noticable
overall
its
a
little
too
sweet
tasting
for
me
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
a
little
bit
slick
and
its
well
carbonated
its
not
a
bad
brew
and
theres
nothing
really
offensive
about
it
for
the
style
of
beer
it
is
you
could
pick
much
worse
and
for
50
cents
a
can
why
not
try
it

poured
into
a
frosted
mug
its
average
lager
looking
sunshine
yellow
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
unpleasant
some
nail
varnish
remover
for
an
instant
its
gone
now
now
just
paper
and
corn
taste
is
really
just
sweet
corn
and
a
bit
of
grass
not
really
bad
actually
ok
on
the
palate
for
style
kinda
has
a
smoothness
to
it
overall
drinkable
and
not
too
bad
for
2
99
a
six
light
golden
color
not
much
nose
just
sugar
tastes
like
someone
poured
a
beer
then
dumped
a
pint
of
water
on
top
of
it
and
this
is
whats
left
soooo
watery
tasting
a
hint
of
corn
but
mostly
just
watered
down
junk
even
3
bucks
a
6
pack
is
too
much
money
for
me
to
every
try
this
again
name
tag
lager
is
a
very
clear
very
sparkling
pale
yellow
beer
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
much
instantly
it
has
a
corny
beer
breath
aroma
its
light
bodied
pretty
smooth
and
lively
the
dry
finish
leaves
the
mouth
a
touch
chalky
it
has
a
corny
flavor
not
sweet
or
dry
with
a
barely
detectable
bitterness
the
aftertaste
almost
seems
a
touch
sweet
and
corny
did
i
mention
corn
this
is
the
beer
i
expected
to
taste
when
i
looked
at
the
can
overall
always
fun
to
scour
the
single
beers
at
trader
joes
and
look
for
new
things
not
really
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
so
dont
expect
to
buy
again
but
a
decently
made
refreshing
lager
definitely
better
examples
of
the
style
but
far
from
the
worst
o
a
truly
worthy
beverage
thanks
for
sharing
bobby
i
purchased
a
single
can
of
this
from
trader
joes
this
a
golden
brew
has
just
a
wisp
of
foam
sweetish
malt
in
the
nose
and
more
on
the
palate
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
as
it
warms
the
adjunct
emerges
and
brings
an
unpleasantness
to
this
thing
tried
this
one
at
my
buddys
house
took
it
down
from
the
can
not
too
much
comes
through
on
the
nose
not
to
me
anyway
taste
was
better
than
expected
definitely
not
great
though
kind
of
bland
went
down
easy
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
but
if
thats
all
thats
available
its
ok
t
about
as
appealing
as
the
smell
nasty
grain
flavor
with
an
off
sweetness
poorly
made
beer
and
not
worth
the
2
99
price
tag
one
of
the
worst
ive
ever
had
12
oz
can
from
trader
joes
pours
a
notquitecrystalclear
golden
with
a
few
particulates
and
medium
carbonation
that
builds
up
an
inch
of
white
head
adjunctladen
and
metallic
in
the
nose
smooth
and
light
flavor
sweet
with
suggestions
of
grapey
esters
perhaps
some
corn
and
some
lightly
oily
hops
that
hardly
contribute
any
bitterness
highly
carbonated
with
a
light
body
the
sweetness
detracts
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
not
that
bad
of
an
example
of
the
style
pours
extremely
light
gold
with
virtually
no
head
whats
there
is
gone
instantly
smells
grainy
and
slight
corn
tastes
weird
a
little
rice
and
some
sweetness
man
this
is
not
good
and
i
used
to
drink
big
bear
and
mickeys
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
drinkability
is
low
d
i
got
a
6pack
of
this
stuff
at
trader
joes
for
2
99
ill
drink
them
but
definitely
not
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
taste
better
then
expected
but
nothing
special
light
in
flavor
with
a
slight
bit
of
sweetness
to
balance
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
the
taste
is
slightly
above
other
light
american
adjunct
lagers
drinkability
is
only
for
quantity
over
quality
plus
its
wicked
cheap
so
if
youre
in
a
pinch
this
is
your
ticket
this
is
one
of
the
two
cheap
6packs
in
cans
at
trader
joes
name
tag
is
2
99
simpler
times
is
3
99
i
prefer
this
one
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
sugary
cereal
this
one
tastes
like
water
straight
water
and
the
faintest
bit
of
malt
on
the
finish
i
like
the
can
im
hoping
that
one
day
i
can
get
a
6
of
this
on
sale
for
1
99
just
cause
it
would
be
very
cheap
and
funny
the
smell
is
malty
mouthfeel
is
watery
as
can
be
drinkability
is
hard
to
say
this
is
very
boring
and
watery
sure
one
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
but
it
wouldnt
be
that
fun
more
of
a
chore
best
bet
is
to
drink
about
two
if
youre
feeling
a
need
to
drink
some
brew
just
to
quench
your
thirst
goes
down
so
easy
d
a
good
drinking
adjunct
lager
once
again
its
a
light
flavor
beer
with
sugary
sweetness
more
like
sugar
water
really
oh
well
cant
have
it
all
at
times
finished
a
trader
joes
mixed
sixer
with
this
little
guy
he
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
shortlived
halffinger
of
fizzy
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
corn
syrup
wheat
and
hard
water
the
taste
is
very
similar
though
slightly
sweeter
and
with
an
old
green
apple
kinda
flavor
thrown
in
for
bad
measure
the
body
is
rather
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
not
much
goin
on
here
but
what
is
going
on
isnt
very
good
i
find
the
mouthfeel
to
limit
this
beers
drinkability
if
i
want
a
beer
in
this
style
ill
go
for
one
that
isnt
as
syrupy
it
is
hard
to
complain
when
you
drink
a
beer
that
50
cents
a
can
though
cheerios
i
had
never
had
this
beer
before
but
it
still
makes
me
feel
kind
of
nostalgic
with
its
ultrageneric
labeling
and
unmistakably
adjunctladen
aroma
and
flavor
overall
it
is
not
a
good
beer
but
at
2
99
per
sixpack
its
not
a
bad
lawnmower
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
as
an
adjunct
lager
with
bargain
basement
price
i
have
to
thank
minhas
and
trader
joes
for
this
red
oval
and
other
inexpensive
beers
im
a
fan
of
simpler
times
lager
and
pilsner
especially
to
offer
in
comparison
to
other
american
massproduced
overpriced
marketing
abominations
id
rather
see
this
in
the
cooler
than
those
other
american
beers
i
actually
prefer
this
to
trader
joes
simpler
times
given
that
this
is
a
little
easier
to
drink
in
session
i
think
st
is
6
2
and
with
the
dollar
i
saved
i
bought
a
scratch
ticket
a
wise
investment
indeed
while
my
review
of
this
beer
is
probably
not
going
to
add
up
to
a
lot
of
points
ive
got
to
say
that
this
is
a
good
value
at
3
for
a
6pack
the
look
in
the
glass
was
allamerican
lager
a
k
a
urine
the
nose
was
very
weak
malt
and
bananas
i
poured
this
can
into
a
pint
glass
so
i
could
get
a
better
look
and
smell
at
it
bad
idea
really
neither
characteristic
being
a
strength
and
the
head
took
less
than
a
second
to
dissipate
so
i
might
as
well
get
to
the
drinking
the
taste
was
good
actually
with
sweet
corn
and
froot
loops
being
the
major
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
not
overly
foamy
and
pretty
smooth
the
drinkability
is
also
above
average
clocking
in
at
about
15
minutes
for
first
beer
on
a
friday
better
than
the
big
guys
and
cheaper
pours
your
usual
urine
color
characteristic
of
american
adjunct
lagers
normal
big
fuzzy
head
but
it
actually
keeps
a
little
layer
instead
of
disappearing
completely
i
actually
got
some
aroma
just
from
opening
the
can
not
sure
yet
if
that
is
a
good
thing
smells
sweet
with
a
little
corn
aroma
kind
of
funky
in
a
bad
way
a
very
light
noble
hop
aroma
that
combines
with
the
sweetness
to
make
it
kind
of
fruity
smelling
wow
for
an
adjunct
lager
it
really
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
fairly
sweet
with
definite
pilsner
maltiness
slight
fruitiness
maybe
a
very
light
touch
of
corn
not
watery
but
a
little
thin
it
has
a
redeeming
creaminess
to
it
though
i
really
dont
mind
it
d
save
your
money
and
buy
a
12ozer
i
second
what
everybody
else
said
great
price
although
trader
joes
seems
to
charge
3
99
for
this
in
ny
state
and
2
99
everywhere
else
and
a
yougetwhatyoupayfor
lager
no
more
no
less
retrolooking
70sstyle
label
all
it
needs
is
the
oldfashioned
poptop
and
you
can
almost
see
your
moms
avocadogreen
appliances
and
smell
the
crock
pot
cooking
while
you

marshall
on
your

curtismathis
have
a
nice
day
btw
can
now
says
5
abv
well
i
drank
it
all
and
even
finished
the
six
pack
but
mostly
out
of
obligation
it
washes
down
food
fine
and
cleanses
thirst
ok
as
long
as
its
cold
id
probably
spring
for
some
of
the
big
macro
brews
over
this
one
though
definitely
give
me
pbr
any
day
first
however
price
is
a
big
factor
in
my
drinkability
rating
which
helps
it
out
a
little
more
effort
red
oval
light
fairly
refreshing
the
aftertaste
would
prevent
me
from
seeking
this
out
still
not
a
horrible
brew
would
drink
if
there
was
nothing
else
around
as
it
stands
tonight
though
i
cant
finish
this
glass
ps
keeps
ones
irony
quotient
up
as
well
which
is
harder
than
ever
now
that
im
over
40
edit

i
grabbed
one
of
these
without
realizing
that
id
already
reviewed
it
and
am
changing
my
numbers
from
all
3s
to
the
321
521
5
you
see
here
i
found
this
second
tasting
to
be
a
sticky
sweet
mess
just
a
syrupy
grainless
hopless
yeastless
trainwreck
of
a
beer
avoid
serious
bang
for
the
buck
totally
passes
this
summertime
feed
your
friends
barbecue
and
beer
freak
red
oval
is
a
pretty
dismal
beer
at
best
its
unpleasant
i
reckon
i
cant
be
too
surprised
after
all
this
costs
50
cents
per
can
still
its
really
bad
drinkability
is
ok
for
what
it
is
a
2
99
a
six
pack
tj
beer
it
is
ok
but
no
hidden
gem
well
heck
its
not
too
bad
at
all
drinkable
certainly
but
if
thats
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
it
then
i
can
live
without
ever
having
another
one
still
its
not
awful
and
i
guess
i
expected
so
much
worse
d
it
is
what
it
is
an
adjunct
lager
nothing
off
nothing
interesting
but
generally
clean
and
drinkable
its
redeeming
quality
is
possibly
its
drinkability
because
it
does
go
down
well
and
its
somewhat
quaffable
if
theres
little
else
around
a
good
filler
beer
for
people
who
are
bmc
fans
but
not
much
else
all
in
all
if
you
just
want
a
beer
its
hard
to
argue
with
the
price
wont
be
winning
any
awards
any
time
soon
but
then
again
they
never
claimed
to
deserve
one
this
is
a
good
one
to
share
with
a
new
neighbor
who
is
obviously
not
into
craft
beer
which
my
neighbor
jim
clearly
is
not
boring
ill
reach
for
simpler
times
lager
any
day
of
the
week
over
this
one
oh
well
2
99sixer
what
did
i
expect
this
is
a
simple
under
hopped
lager
with
little
character
sure
its
drinkable
but
for
those
who
have
paid
their
dues
the
overall
impression
leaves
an
intuitive
wariness
of
having
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
the
overall
ba
rating
of
not
worthy
leads
me
to
ask
the
question
not
worthy
of
what
your
majesty
pale
gold
with
a
good
sized
white
head
and
minimal
lacings
aroma
is
corny
taste
is
corny
sweet
with
a
kiss
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
average
nothing
wrong
with
this
typical
american
lager
just
no
reason
to
drink
it
again
unless
this
is
your
style
value
is
good
at
2
99
per
six
pack
at
trader
joes
d
i
think
on
a
hot
day
just
after
mowing
the
lawn
it
would
be
fine
ice
cold
with
me
lying
in
the
hammock
otherwise
save
it
for
your
beerstupid
friends
drinkability
its
nothing
complex
and
its
nothing
special
but
itll
pass
as
beer
worth
every
penny
at
50
cents
each
f
t
this
beer
is
not
for
me
i
need
flavor
in
my
beer
if
you
have
any
cheap
beer
drinking
friends
do
them
a
favor
and
turn
them
on
to
this
drinkability
certainly
an
uncomplicated
beer
but
for
me
it
just
comes
up
a
bit
short
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
department
yes
finally
a
beer
that
i
can
buy
for
less
than
0
50
a
can
ok
so
there
really
isnt
anything
impressive
but
it
does
the
trick
when
youre
broke
and
have
a
tjs
in
your
neigborhood
very
pale
color
smells
like
a
cheap
lager
tastes
a
little
syrupy
sweet
with
a
hint
of
dryness
mouthfeel
is
average
at
best
on
the
flip
side
of
everything
you
can
drink
a
ton
of
these
easily
happy
drinking
d
all
beer
has
its
place
it
was
what
it
was
once
again
an
aggressive
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
worth
of
explosive
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
it
looked
like
the
top
of
a
lemon
meringue
pie
just
before
it
goes
into
the
oven
to
brown
the
tips
of
the
meringue
whoops
in
the
short
time
that
it
took
me
to
type
that
last
the
head
disappeared
bye
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
lemon
yellow
nose
was
characteristic
of
the
style
notes
of
bubble
gum
and
cereal
with
a
light
lagerlike
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
exceptionally
sweet
taste
in
the
mouth
like
drinking
candy
woof
finish
was
equally
candysweet
in
its
intensity
i
can
really
do
without
this
sort
of
thing
d
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
for
three
bucks
and
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
thought
it
was
so
bad
i
poured
it
out
and
one
of
my
fiends
that
was
over
poured
it
out
as
well
it
was
terrible
so
i
had
the
other
four
cans
in
the
fridge
for
a
couple
of
months
and
decided
to
try
it
again
it
isnt
good
but
i
finished
the
remaining
four
it
is
good
for
the
price
if
anything
i
just
wont
buy
it
again
but
im
also
a
beer
snob
ok
so
initially
the
flavor
was
pretty
bad
slick
on
the
tongue
sweet
slightly
smokey
after
eating
a
few
spicy
nachos
however
it
wasnt
too
bad
weak
watery
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
hard
to
call
this
a
craft
brew
beer
pours
like
a
typical
macro
fizzy
head
that
reduces
to
nothing
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
canned
creamed
corn
and
is
cloyingly
sweet
i
get
no
hops
at
allor
malt
i
guess
just
corn
50
cents
well
spent
glad
i
didnt
get
a
six
still
there
ar
worse
beers
md
weak
and
easy
to
slam
duing
beer
pong
but
short
of
that
not
impressive
in
any
way
i
prefer
this
to
simpler
times
lager
as
it
doesnt
have
quite
as
much
sticky
sweetness
to
my
palate
in
comparison
after
2
stls
im
out
but
i
could
go
for
a
3rd
red
oval
but
bewarelike
any
cheap
beer
this
is
best
consumed
cold
as
the
less
flavor
revealed
the
better
there
is
a
reason
why
the
big
guys
focus
so
much
on
ice
cold
beer
ok
keep
in
mind
that
this
beer
does
not
pretend
to
be
anything
else
than
it
is
cheap
all
the
connotations
that
go
with
it
seem
to
apply
this
does
not
damn
the
beer
however
a
wicked
cheap
offering
from
minhas
simple
times
via
trader
joe
it
is
fun
order
a
case
barely
marked
behemoth
of
one
that
seems
to
impress
tj
staff
immensely
at
50ccan
it
is
a
bargain
but
only
if
you
want
cheapass
beer
forget
your
trendy
pbr
this
is
way
better
than
your
tasteless
bud
lites
c
and
actually
has
some
flavor
reminiscent
of
a
naragansett
or
reading
its
worthwhile
just
for
cheap
bragging
rights
and
cheaper
than
the
portuguesepolishindian
cheapo
lagers
that
seem
overpriced
to
me
a
bright
yellow
pisswasser
appearance
with
frothy
bright
white
head
red
oval
is
better
from
the
can
than
glass
keep
it
honest
cornbased
malty
like
its
pricier
cousin
simple
timesit
is
best
served
cold
in
abundance
would
i
prefer
a
black
label
yes
but
again
50c
wins
overall
great
price
but
ill
stick
with
hamms
first
choice
or
old
milwaukee
second
choice
if
im
on
the
lookout
for
a
good
budgetpriced
beer
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
considering
would
be
right
up
there
with
some
go
to
lagers
pbr
and
rainier
the
aroma
di
would
drink
it
if
it
were
free
or
the
only
beer
i
could
afford
preference
is
given
to
the
mountain
creek
for
cheap
beer
not
in
the
ballpark
of
the
sweet
but
tasty
and
potent
simpler
times
but
certainly
not
going
to
break
the
bank
at
50
cents
a
can
i
had
to
try
red
oval
i
was
hoping
that
it
would
be
a
little
bit
better
than
simpler
times
but
its
really
similar
or
worse
if
theres
some
other
lager
you
havent
had
at
trader
joes
id
suggest
you
pick
it
up
instead
of
this
one
once
when
i
was
in
seventh
grade
our
basement
flooded
during
a
spring
rain
i
was
able
to
divert
the
water
while
my
parents
were
still
at
work
as
a
reward
my
mother
offered
me
my
first
beer
perhaps
it
was
a
genny
or
a
utica
club
or
a
matts
lager
it
was
one
of
those
thin
heavily
adjuncted
lagers
i
drank
only
a
quarter
of
it
and
didnt
enjoy
another
beer
until
i
was
23
years
old
red
oval
could
be
that
beercorn
syrupy
sweet
fizzy
not
a
hint
of
hops
or
malt
the
only
thing
going
for
it
is
a
large
head
that
dies
slowly
and
a
smidgen
of
lace
on
the
glass
at
2
99
a
six
pack
one
shouldnt
complain
but
still
this
ones
destined
for
the
kitchen
sink
touch
of
noble
hops
on
the
nose
blend
with
some
light
cereal
adjuncts
and
make
for
an
interesting
brew
has
a
relatively
long
albeit
simple
finish
a
bit
earthy
as
it
settles
i
think
ill
return
and
pony
up
2
99
for
a
full
sixer
to
better
judge
this
beer
bring
on
the
jacuzzi
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
its
a
flavorful
lager
that
might
be
a
touch
too
strong
or
heavy
but
still
with
the
2
99
for
a
sixer
price
tag
give
it
a
shot
its
not
bad
great
beer
fun
to
have
at
a
party
to
play
rock
paper
siccisors
love
the
taste
and
the
smaller
size
feels
good
to
hold
the
fat
bottle
and
the
taste
is
great
with
steaks
or
a
cookout
like
hot
dogs
or
hamburgers
o
no
complexity
not
very
interesting
great
beer
for
summer
day
mowing
the
yard
and
running
the
bbq
not
a
bad
lager
much
better
than
a
populartraditional
big
market
brand
just
not
a
good
lager
for
my
tastes
almost
to
sweet
for
me
drank
this
right
out
of
the
bottle
at
just
jakes
in
montclair
nice
and
crisp
but
nothing
totally
stood
out
probably
my
mistake
by
drinking
this
directly
after
a
stronger
ipa
i
may
not
have
gotten
the
full
effect
overall
enjoyable
enough
though
cheers
overall
would
be
a
fine
party
or
tailgating
beer
o
still
looking
for
the
salsa
to
get
rid
of
the
wrong
type
of
bitter
thats
still
hanging
around
tasty
refreshingly
hopped
pale
lager
i
love
that
this
lager
is
commonly
available
and
well
priced
i
knocked
a
few
points
off
for
the
11
oz
bottle
which
i
think
is
a
cheesy
move
great
times
with
this
great
session
beer
more
full
bodied
than
almost
anyother
session
ive
drank
overall
a
winner
be
sure
to
try
fest
and
black
lager
ill
be
back
well
done
pils
with
a
superior
clean
taste
session
lager
is
definitely
a
proper
name
overall
nice
session
lager
when
you
are
not
out
for
big
heavy
pints
the
11oz
bottle
if
fairly
unique
holds
true
to
the
lager
style
othis
is
a
simple
lager
but
not
boring
my
example
was
a
week
past
its
best
by
date
so
im
not
surprised
that
the
hops
had
faded
i
can
imagine
a
fresh
bottle
being
a
bit
more
complex
and
balanced
but
even
this
old
bottle
made
for
a
nice
afterwork
quaff
easy
to
drink
excellent
alternative
to
american
macrobrews
at
a
comparable
price
overall
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
in
here
for
a
pale
lager
the
allalt
characteristics
really
shine
through
without
affecting
the
mouthfeel
the
name
speaks
the
truth
this
is
a
great
session
lager
when
you
want
something
fullflavored
and
unoffensive
i
would
offer
this
to
even
the
strongest
naysayers
of
craft
beer
wow
i
bought
this
as
something
new
to
try
it
was
on
the
bottom
shelf
and
cheap
11
bucks
for
a
12
pack
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
and
maybe
a
little
salty
but
it
was
gooood
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
as
i
prefer
ipa
or
malt
liquor
but
this
did
ir
for
me
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
taste
was
crisp
and
yummy
a
little
hops
a
little
malt
no
corn
straw
yellow
looking
poured
into
a
pint
glass
just
the
right
amount
of
bubbles
salt
and
flavor
light
tasting
but
with
just
enough
charachter
to
grab
me
and
slap
me
and
drink
another
this
stuff
rocks
light
straw
like
complexion
the
head
was
practically
non
existent
the
nose
is
full
of
straw
and
grain
but
i
think
i
caught
a
little
apple
the
flavors
have
a
grain
and
barley
character
with
some
cereal
maltiness
the
feel
is
light
but
a
bit
abrasive
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
sessionable
based
on
its
lightness
on
the
stomach
but
i
probably
wont
drink
a
ton
of
these
what
we
have
here
is
a
classic
session
beer
with
an
incredibly
high
drinkability
level
true
to
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
crossover
beers
ive
had
in
some
time
thin
white
bubbly
head
and
pale
gold
color
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
and
slightly
vinous
with
grassy
piney
very
american
hoppiness
flavor
exhibits
a
lot
of
sweet
american
lager
flavor
without
the
cheap
adjunct
nastiness
very
clean
finishes
with
a
slight
tinge
of
hoppiness
a
very
clean
sessionable
beer
for
summer
or
any
time
really
think
of
it
as
a
better
tasting
stubby
bottle
beer
o
good
price
great
beer
only
wish
it
came
in
cans
notes
poured
into
a
clean
u
s
style
tumbler
glass
served
chilled
o
i
think
a
pale
lager
is
one
of
natures
simple
treats
a
beer
you
can
enjoy
while
completely
shutting
your
brain
off
this
one
though
is
almost
southern
tier
levels
of
cloying
with
a
bit
more
hoppiness
or
a
fresher
bottle
hell
maybe
both
this
could
have
been
genuinely
good
bmc
fans
will
enjoy
this
at
least
11oz
stubby
bottle
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
bottle
has
a
best
by
date
of
81714
the
aromatics
are
a
bit
strange
but
quickly
forgotten
once
it
hits
ur
tbuds
i
am
copying
these
notes
over
from
ratebeer
it
does
not
require
as
long
of
review
i
tasted
this
some
time
ago
so
i
cant
add
anything
good
everyday
drinker
nice
lightbodied
and
crisp
with
some
volume
to
it
that
doesnt
detract
from
its
nature
or
add
too
much
the
feel
fits
the
style
best
crispness
really
is
key
keeping
up
well
and
never
waning
and
continuing
over
a
good
smoothness
even
into
a
dry
finish
its
a
light
golden
colored
beer
topped
with
a
big
soapy
head
a
few
strings
and
spots
of
lace
cling
around
the
glass
it
has
a
strong
grassy
aroma
underlined
with
a
cooked
corn
note
and
vague
grainy
sweetness
smells
like
an
adjunct
lager
with
extra
hops
the
taste
which
has
the
character
of
said
style
does
have
a
vibrant
grassy
flavor
which
buries
some
of
those
less
appealing
flavors
helping
it
are
crisp
bubbles
albeit
with
a
slick
base
for
the
money
session
lager
may
be
one
of
the
better
buys
out
there
session
red
is
sweet
you
can
smell
and
taste
floral
hops
it
is
not
bitter
session
red
is
a
light
enjoyable
lager
beer
the
quality
is
good
it
is
all
malt
this
is
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
it
is
good
for
when
you
want
something
light
i
wish
this
was
12
ounces
i
would
pay
1
more
for
a
twelve
pack
of
12
ounce
bottles
theres
something
about
the
malt
flavor
of
this
beer
that
i
dont
like
too
much
as
it
lingers
on
my
palate
that
detracts
from
the
overall
quality
of
this
beer
smooth
balanced
great
finish
this
is
what
an
american
pale
lager
should
taste
like
you
can
drink
it
with
anything
any
time
any
place
nice
clean
session
lager
easy
drinking
and
has
flavor
nice
when
cold
like
the
stubby
bottles
light
golden
color
and
good
carbonation
white
head
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
malty
aftertaste
not
bitter
at
all
heads
and
tails
above
the
macro
light
beers
in
my
humble
opinion
overall
i
take
moosehead
heineken
corona
over
this
beer
at
least
they
give
me
12
oz
with
more
or
similar
taste
real
germany
beer
like
spatan
lowenbrua
has
twice
as
much
taste
as
session
beer
full
sail
brewery
does
not
have
no
excuse
for
the
11
oz
bottle
just
for
misleading
public
and
profit
you
will
receive
half
less
12
oz
beer
from
a
six
pack
also
i
will
buy
grenade
bottle
beer
from
coors
and
mickey
in
future
for
more
taste
and
more
beer
12
oz
beer
american
standard
not
11
oz
overall
i
liked
this
beer
just
fine
but
it
tasted
more
like
a
munich
helles
mixed
with
a
bit
of
watered
down
berliner
weisse
rather
than
a
light
american
lager
the
absence
of
the
head
and
the
lower
amount
of
carbonation
made
the
uncharacteristic
sweet
and
sour
flavors
stand
out
even
more
and
caused
the
beer
to
lack
the
refreshing
quality
this
style
is
known
for
pours
a
pale
straw
with
thin
white
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
think
it
was
a
commercial
light
beer
a
faint
aroma
of
grass
with
some
herbal
notes
not
much
hop
presence
on
the
nose
little
bitterness
on
the
palate
mostly
a
floury
malt
with
faint
bread
notes
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
serviceable
lager
o
i
have
traveled
around
north
america
and
europeireland
germany
austria
switzerland
italy
etc
and
have
tasted
the
best
beer
ive
longed
to
have
a
true
high
quality
beer
brewed
properly
and
unpasteurized
here
in
the
good
old
usa
for
many
years
sam
adams
is
good
beer
but
not
quite
this
good
this
is
the
finest
example
of
a
high
quality
lager
without
concern
for
cost
or
any
other
factor
except
beer
quality
i
now
have
that
beer
no
bud
will
buy
this
again
and
looking
forward
to
trying
the
dark
o
at
5
1
abv
purists
are
going
to
have
a
cow
when
they
see
the
word
session
on
the
label
still
sessionable
is
absolutely
what
this
beer
is
certainly
not
a
thinking
mans
beverage
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
pleasing
in
its
simplicity
a
good
tool
to
use
when
trying
to
bridge
the
gap
between
macro
and
craft
the
oldtimey
stubby
bottles
are
a
great
marketing
ploy
too
poured
from
a
brown
11
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
malty
some
light
hops
refreshing
and
tasty
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
like
its
name
says
is
a
good
session
beer
o
this
one
was
ok
a
step
above
bmc
but
very
simple
and
not
very
pleasing
to
a
craft
palate
its
an
outstanding
beer
probably
the
best
basic
lager
i
ever
had
overall
i
have
no
idea
how
this
brew
got
this
high
of
a
rating
this
is
proof
the
ratings
must
be
taken
skeptically
bc
anybody
in
their
right
mind
should
know
better
even

or

low
end
german
stomp
this
i
guess
i
didnt
keep
it
brief
but
this
stuff
has
tainted
my
taste
buds
had
i
bought
another
bottle
that
would
have
gone
down
right
after
this
i
couldnt
even
detect
the
alcohol
here
and
there
wasnt
any
of
it
that
could
be
detected
in
the
taste
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
and
theres
enough
body
here
to
shake
off
the
stereotype
that
a
light
lager
has
to
feel
overcarbonated
and
skunked
id
certainly
buy
this
again
poured
from
a
pill
bottle
into
a
shaker
the
beer
is
a
bright
clear
palegolden
coloring
with
a
filmy
ring
of
white
on
the
surface
aromas
of
toasted
grains
and
some
subtle
floral
highlights
flavors
are
bold
and
toasty
initially
with
a
slightly
bitter
and
toasted
grain
followup
across
the
palate
some
buttery
sweet
highlights
throughout
the
body
is
effervescent
and
light
with
the
carbonation
keeping
a
frothy
feel
in
mouth
toasted
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
clean
smooth
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
little
smoother
than
most
in
this
style
but
tasty
for
a
summer
beer
i
really
like
it
a
refreshing
no
nonsense
lager
from
a
respectful
craft
brewery
that
is
priced
amazingly
close
to
the
factory
beers
the
flavor
is
very
good
with
nice
malt
toastiness
and
slight
yeasty
flavor
in
the
middle
with
a
gentle
spiciness
in
the
hops
without
much
alcohol
in
the
taste
the
beer
is
not
complex
but
it
fits
the
style
well
overall
i
say
it
is
a
good
west
coast
lager
which
is
not
a
common
style
being
put
out
by
craft
brewers
i
like
it
considering
how
great
the
lagers
in
the
limited
series
are
this
is
a
bafflement
even
if
it
was
4
1
instead
of
5
1
it
would
still
taste
anemic
its
hard
to
beat
the
industrial
breweries
at
the
game
they
invented
from
the
12
oz
stubby
bought
at
trader
joes

great
summer
beer
i
need
a
case
the
flavor
is
light
refreshing
and
everything
i
love
about
beer
this
is
super
fresh
beautiful
constructed
light
bodies
no
frills
lager
so
good
when
its
your
lips
it
might
have
u
streaking
like
frank
the
tank
running
the
grill
during
your
summer
bbq
and
want
to
keep
it
under
control
for
the
duration
this
beer
should
be
in
the
cooler
for
you
golden
lager
color
with
not
much
head
of
which
to
speak
aromas
of
sweet
yeast
and
grain
and
a
flavor
is
much
the
same
grain
and
bread
has
a
very
crisp
body
with
some
heft
to
it
i
saw
someone
liken
this
to
a
german
lager
and
theyre
exactly
right
i
find
most
euro
lagers
to
be
a
little
more
crisp
dry
and
with
more
hop
bitterness
this
one
had
a
little
more
sweetness
and
a
little
less
hop
bitterness
in
comparison
for
an
american
lager
i
find
this
one
to
be
one
of
the
better
ive
had
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
would
buy
this
again
as
well
as
recommend
it
for
someone
looking
to
transition
to
craft
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
brew
coupled
with
a
more
moderate
alcohol
level
it
is
just
what
a
session
style
brew
should
be
although
the
abv
may
be
a
little
on
the
high
side
for
a
session
ah
but
rather
nice
o
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
not
overly
complicated
and
really
hits
it
spot
on
price
is
very
affordable
this
is
my
new
go
to
beer
hands
down
overall
not
as
interesting
as
the
session
black
lager
but
a
step
up
from
bmc
cheers
full
sail
session
lager
pours
a
clean
and
crisp
golden
color
with
a
quickly
diminishing
white
head
the
nose
consists
of
pale
malt
grain
and
hints
of
corn
are
met
with
just
a
touch
of
honey
cracker
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
are
well
met
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
a
touch
of
hops
to
provide
a
good
balance
moderately
carbonated
this
sessionable
is
both
crisp
and
sharp
for
a
lighter
bodied
brew
not
too
much
going
on
but
hellarefreshing
i
like
this
beer
it
tastes
great
and
is
less
filling
plus
the
cap
said
tools
required
how
awesome
is
that
i
went
bananas
with
my
pour
and
almost
caused
it
to
overflow
the
glass
whoops
two
fingers
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
were
the
result
color
was
sunshineyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
nose
was
grassy
biscuit
malty
and
just
as
i
remembered
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
grassiness
of
the
hops
reminded
me
of
freshmown
lawn
come
on
warm
weather
it
is
three
days
into
spring
2013
and
it
is
colder
than
some
days
this
past
winter
grrr
it
is
a
good
thing
that
i
have
beer
i
anxiously
await
the
opportunity
to
begin
mowing
my
backyard
again
after
laying
grass
seed
last
summer
i
digress
man
was
this
beer
going
down
quickly
i
really
liked
the
way
the
malt
got
out
of
the
way
of
the
hops
until
the
extreme
finish
and
offset
them
just
enough
to
be
considered
semidry
dry
should
be
reserved
for
american
ipas
while
lagers
should
exhibit
at
least
a
little
sweetness
welcome
to
pa
hood
river
or
i
hope
that
you
plan
to
stick
around
this
beer
does
for
me
what
i
wish
the
macro
brews
did
that
is
to
offer
a
refreshing
yet
flavorful
light
beer
that
doesnt
reek
of
cereal
grains
session
also
offers
a
nice
mouthfeel
for
this
type
of
beer
subtle
and
nice
beer
really
nice
o
good
lager
especially
for
the
price
11
95
for
a
12pack
of
stubbies
at
heb
in
texas
i
havent
bought
this
beer
in
a
while
but
i
might
have
to
get
some
the
next
time
i
am
at
total
wine
i
am
serious
about
taking
this
to
the
golf
course
if
you
want
a
good
replacement
for
a
domestic
and
yes
you
do
give
this
a
try
grab
a
single
bottle
of
this
and
the
black
lager
so
you
can
compare
these
two
stubbies
ha
that
sounds
dirty
updated
bottles
now
require
tools
out
pours
a
golden
yellow
lager
with
white
head
and
thin
lacing
slightly
creamy
body
with
mild
malt
sweetness
and
aroma
of
malt
hops
grain
caramel
and
light
floral
overall
session
lager
is
easy
to
drink
yet
combined
with
low
cost
and
accessibility
in
most
places
of
the
us
makes
it
a
real
winner
o
full
sail
succeded
in
making
a
quality
flavorful
easy
drinking
lager
o
i
could
drink
this
all
night
one
of
the
best
session
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
a
great
backyard
bbq
beer
or
the
perfect
beer
to
have
after
mowing
the
lawn
i
usually
have
a
tendency
to
not
crave
lagerpils
during
the
winter
however
the
february
thaw
is
here
and
signs
of
warmer
weather
are
approaching
drinking
this
brew
brought
back
memories
of
a
warmer
time
when
the
leaves
were
green
the
waves
were
crashing
on
the
beach
the
birds
were
chirping
and
the
smell
of
bbqs
permeated
the
air
it
brought
back
nostalgic
feelings
from
a
previous
moment
in
time
worth
yearning
for
cheers
overall
the
black
is
better
but
whatever
i
gues
this
can
pass
for
a
decent
sessionable
brew
if
your
expectations
arent
terribly
high
but
it
definitely
isnt
my
favorite
straw
beer
session
premium
lager
has
a
medium
white
head
and
a
clear
bubbly
yellowgolden
appearance
with
minimal
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mild
but
one
gets
sweet
bready
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
one
will
notice
a
similar
flavor
which
even
has
a
fruity
aspect
to
it
mouthfeel
is
mostly
watery
and
session
premium
lager
finishes
crisp
refreshing
dry
and
delicious
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
think
its
really
good
rjt
refreshing
for
a
warm
fall
day
but
i
would
like
for
this
brew
to
be
a
bit
more
full
flavor
and
less
on
the
light
side
of
things
recommended
for
a
hot
day
drinkability
is
ridiculously
high
why
have
i
waited
this
long
to
try
it
a
simple
american
lager
taste
that
seems
to
have
more
too
it
than
most
of
the
more
popular
light
american
lagers
american
pale
lagers
rarely
excite
me
and
this
beer
was
no
exception
although
i
inadvertently
purchased
my
bottle
after
its
expiration
date
had
passed
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
it
was
much
better
when
fresh
i
much
prefer
the
dark
version
of
session
but
this
beer
aint
bad
light
and
clean
with
an
unassuming
taste
nicely
balanced
yet
nothing
to
make
it
standout
but
with
regards
to
its
intent
and
character
a
nice
little
easy
drinking
beer
to
while
away
an
evening
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
grass
from
the
hops
smells
like
a
pale
lager
should
smell
only
without
the
harsh
notes
you
sometimes
get
in
the
noncraft
versions
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
some
grain
and
sweet
biscuit
malt
notes
as
well
as
some
grass
no
bitterness
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
impression
i
have
to
say
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
from
the
first
time
i
tried
it
about
a
year
or
two
ago
while
the
taste
is
not
revolutionary
as
far
as
beers
go
it
is
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
lagers
i
have
encountered
i
would
also
say
i
am
a
fan
of
the
stubby
bottles
as
they
make
for
a
more
transportable
glass
bottle
brew
it
falls
down
somewhat
on
taste
not
being
anything
extraordinary
the
same
goes
for
the
aftertaste
overall
its
drinkable
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
ever
want
to
buy
again
excellent
price
can
get
these
for
11
99
at
a
qfc
in
seattle
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
lager
a
bit
hearty
with
some
grain
tones
on
there
that
push
it
out
of
being
a
lighter
beer
but
it
is
still
smooth
with
a
good
character
overall
impression
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
enjoyed
while
it
is
refreshing
and
quite
light
the
flavor
and
wellbalanced
background
makes
this
a
sure
shot
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
hence
why
i
gave
it
a
55
get
your
hands
on
some
if
your
in
the
area
a
simple
but
enjoyable
wellbrewed
lager
i
think
they
hit
the
target
for
what
they
wanted
to
achieve
very
nicely
o
overall
sweet
flavor
grows
on
you
afer
awhile
a
great
intro
beer
for
those
macro
buddies
easy
drinking
pale
lager
with
a
small
bit
of
hops
your
bmc
friends
should
enjoy
and
not
find
offensive
interesting
pretty
good
fullness
of
body
with
a
good
carbonation
factor
taste
is
has
quite
a
strong
cereal
grain
sweetness
on
the
body
definitely
the
predominant
taste
right
away
then
it
fades
into
a
strong
grain
profile
that
mixes
with
a
sweet
creamy
note
as
well
i
guess
the
two
words
to
sum
up
this
beer
would
be
sweet
and
grainy
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
because
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
easy
drinking
lager
and
thats
exactly
what
it
is
so
by
style
i
have
to
give
it
high
marks
this
would
be
remarkably
easy
to
drink
on
just
about
any
day
especially
hot
ones
o
a
great
session
beer
that
delivers
great
taste
and
low
alcohol
so
you
can
pound
them
away
really
enjoyable
in
the
summer
and
one
of
my
favorite
garage
work
beers
beware
these
11oz
stubby
bottles
go
down
fast
this
allmalt
preprohibition
style
lager
will
take
you
back
to
the
roots
of
brewing
in
america
its
golden
color
and
crystal
clarity
combine
with
a
smooth
almost
sweet
taste
that
keeps
this
little
beer
enticing
to
the
very
last
sip
the
cozy
11oz
bottles
add
a
charming
nostalgic
character
that
almost
makes
up
for
the
missing
12th
oz
overalltoo
much
of
the
adjunct
lager
style
for
my
liking
but
finishes
better
overall
a
simple
session
lager
just
enough
hops
and
full
sail
yeast
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
not
bad
with
buffalo
chicken
pizza
looks
as
clean
as
any
other
american
lager
but
with
a
bright
and
whiter
head
that
retains
much
better
unique
sweet
unbaked
bread
dough
on
the
nose
some
graininess
and
a
touch
of
hop
on
the
back
of
the
nostrils
full
mouth
feel
graininess
throughout
with
a
touch
of
lingering
sweetness
hop
bitterness
enough
to
balance
it
a
unique
creaminess
as
well
a
bit
earthy
but
a
clean
and
well
done
lager
its
nice
to
have
a
craft
12
pack
option
other
than
varieties
and
this
fits
the
bill
quite
nicely
pours
a
light
golden
ale
with
a
little
white
foam
on
the
surface
and
brilliant
clarity
the
nose
strikes
me
initially
like
a
bohemian
pilsner
with
earthy
hops
and
sweet
corn
like
malts
really
a
light
and
sweet
nose
here
with
just
a
hint
of
rose
like
florals
flavor
is
of
faint
grain
and
cardboard
not
much
else
for
me
medium
bodied
for
style
with
standard
hi
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
the
beer
is
nice
looking
and
smelling
but
the
flavor
kills
its
appeal
for
me
greatly
although
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
over
many
others
its
not
special
o
i
like
it
and
given
that
its
often
selling
for
9
99
for
a
twelve
pack
around
austin
id
recommend
it
even
if
it
isnt
that
cheap
near
you
its
a
quality
lager
that
wont
break
the
bank
or
offend
your
taste
buds
id
take
a
session
over
a
budweiser
but
theyre
not
too
far
apart
if
bud
didnt
have
that
weird
sweet
smelltaste
it
would
come
across
similar
to
the
session
i
used
to
think
that
american
macro
brewers
just
used
crappy
ingredients
and
processes
but
it
may
be
that
this
style
just
sucks
the
third
option
is
that
session
just
sucks
too
would
i
get
it
again
probably
if
not
for
anything
else
but
for
its
unique
red
stripeesque
style
o
drinks
pretty
good
light
clean
and
easy
not
much
to
it
would
go
well
with
a
meal
cheers
overall
this
is
a
true
session
beer
however
for
the
style
ive
had
better
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
price
of
16
for
a
twelve
pack
next
time
i
will
purchase
yuengling
or
schlitz
gusto
overall
a
brew
that
is
very
mild
in
the
flavor
department
which
is
typical
of
a
lot
of
light
lagers
would
however
be
great
for
a
nice
hot
lawn
cutting
day
that
being
said
it
is
a
feisty
full
bodied
beverage
with
a
little
grit
to
it
and
a
nice
finish
if
this
is
a
regional
beer
then
everywhere
outside
the
west
coast
should
be
clamoring
for
it
this
should
fill
the
niche
left
by
rolling
rock
once
rr
went
corporate
plus
it
has
a
fun
chubby
bottle
for
this
chubby
drinker
session
lager
is
light
amber
gold
with
not
much
of
a
head
but
crisp
carbonation
nonetheless
smells
like
cider
and
malt
to
me
this
is
as
pure
a
taste
as
you
could
hope
for
in
a
lager
a
slight
tartness
is
rounded
out
by
smooth
malt
flavor
crisp
delicious
though
this
is
straightforward
stuff
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
sweet
and
sour
malts
enough
hops
and
good
body
old
school
lives
up
to
the
name
this
is
as
straightforward
as
it
gets
for
a
lager
in
a
good
way
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
white
head
that
fizzes
away
and
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
light
flowery
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
comes
in
with
sweet
malts
some
breadiness
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
thanks
to
the
hops
also
a
slight
slight
hint
of
citrus
the
big
thing
about
this
beer
though
is
its
smoothness
and
drinkability
this
thing
goes
down
super
easy
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
pale
lager
style
and
is
replacing
longboard
lager
as
my
go
to
lager
as
we
speak
overall
not
all
lagers
are
too
thin
flavorless
and
overcarbonated
this
beer
proves
that
not
necessarily
great
as
a
beer
but
very
good
for
its
style
this
is
a
nice
balanced
beer
that
is
just
as
its
name
implies
a
session
beer
i
would
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
o
my
hopes
were
a
little
higher
than
they
should
have
been
based
on
their
preprohibition
lager
description
on
their
website
better
than
your
average
adjunct
though
odthis
is
a
solid
twelvepack
especially
when
you
want
to
bring
some
beers
to
a
party
that
arent
too
intense
that
most
everyone
will
enjoy
high
in
drinkability
simple
and
downright
good
o
a
very
drinkable
lager
with
more
than
the
usual
flavor
of
an
american
lager
a
most
pleasant
beer
that
i
would
have
again
o
outstanding
cooler
filler
this
is
a
crowd
pleaser
the
beer
nuts
will
drink
it
the
beer
novices
will
drink
it
comes
in
a
bottle
that
reminds
me
of
my
dad
and
uncles
drinking
rhinegold
and
schmidts
when
i
was
a
kid
but
thats
where
the
simiilarities
end
great
price
for
12
pack
its
in
my
fridge
at
all
time
but
not
for
long
session
being
the
opperative
word
but
at
5
1
many
may
disagree
i
found
this
beer
very
enjoyable
and
with
extremely
high
ease
of
consumption
o
i
would
love
to
have
a
12
pack
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
clear
yellowgold
with
a
tall
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
head
clean
aroma
pale
malt
sweetness
and
light
floral
lemon
and
grass
notes
mildly
sweet
pale
malts
honey
and
a
subtle
flowery
hop
bitterness
pleasantly
grainy
light
and
somewhat
effervescent
but
not
watery
very
refreshing
a
good
old
school
pale
lager
with
no
offnotes
maybe
a
little
pricey
but
im
still
interested
in
trying
the
other
two
session
varieties
o
for
the
price
this
beer
is
great
i
would
much
rather
have
these
on
hand
at
a
party
than
any
macro
one
of
the
best
session
beers
out
there
t
very
nice
medium
body
well
balanced
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
are
delicious
and
the
bitternees
after
taste
is
large
and
deep
enough
price
point
4
99
for
a
6pk
it
has
been
a
long
time
coming
for
my
review
with
this
one
of
my
favorites
just
an
excellent
lager
and
something
i
would
highly
recommend
overall
its
a
good
lager
to
drink
the
stubby
bottles
do
help
makes
things
easier
packing
for
a
trip
i
know
that
some
people
would
be
put
off
by
the
price
o
refreshing
a
very
good
session
or
summer
beer
very
good
alternative
to
the
much
more
widely
available
american
macrolagers
i
assume
this
general
public
is
the
target
audience
overall
this
is
a
nice
average
beer
there
isnt
anything
great
about
it
but
nothing
bad
either
it
is
a
nice
session
beer
for
sure
overall
one
solid
sessionable
lager
indeed
i
could
have
this
anytime
o
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
definitely
a
beer
i
could
kick
back
with
and
drink
a
few
overall
a
very
easy
drinker
thirst
quencer
beer
session
is
the
right
name
for
it
12
99
for
a
twelve
pack
in
atlanta
ga
o
pretty
average
in
respect
to
lagers
the
only
exception
is
the
mild
sour
notes
on
the
finish
overall
it
is
a
light
refreshing
lager
wellnamed
if
but
for
the
unmoved
alcohol
content
but
that
may
just
be
a
reflection
of
the
american
craft
beer
ethos
your
beers
strength
is
our
lowabv
strength
and
ours
still
tastes
better
i
often
overlook
this
beer
in
favor
of
the
session
black
but
after
sitting
down
to
actually
review
it
i
rate
this
beer
higher
its
a
refreshing
lager
with
no
faults
and
just
enough
depth
to
keep
you
interested
and
at
9
99
a
12
pack
it
feels
like
a
steal
the
perfect
beer
to
please
any
group
craft
lovers
or
macro
fans
not
a
bad
beer
would
like
to
try
other
beers
from
this
brewery
if
i
get
the
chance
drinkability
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
try
again
has
a
watery
lemony
consistency
i
dont
like
o
session
indeed
i
paid
a
buck
thirtythree
for
this
little
bottle
and
it
was
absolutely
worth
it
if
i
can
find
a
sixer
out
here
in
mass
ill
definitely
pick
some
up
for
the
weekend
this
beer
screams
backpacking
canoeing
and
farting
around
in
the
backyard
great
for
a
cheap
beer
primarily
for
having
the
audacity
to
be
exactly
what
it
says
on
the
bottle
clear
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
that
leaves
a
thin
layer
of
froth
behind
grass
and
slight
herbal
notes
on
the
nose
same
on
the
palate
with
a
fair
bit
more
malt
than
you
would
find
on
a
typical
macro
lager
carbonation
is
bright
and
very
prevalent
this
beer
has
a
bit
more
flavor
and
richness
than
you
would
find
from
bmc
however
it
still
finishes
clean
and
has
a
nice
light
flavor
this
is
what
a
lighter
style
american
lager
should
taste
like
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
full
sail
you
get
what
you
pay
for
overall
a
good
pale
lager
i
would
defiantly
pick
it
up
again
and
a
good
alternative
to
the
buds
and
millers
of
the
world
and
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
during
the
summer
overall
a
very
good
tasting
beer
but
not
cheap
either
hard
to
find
here
in
ohio
but
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
a
while
a
straightforward
lager
very
refreshing
but
thats
about
all
thats
going
on
here
i
tried
several
tastings
and
did
not
desire
to
finish
the
sample
the
aroma
was
light
lots
of
light
grain
and
bready
malts
abound
here
small
light
fruit
notes
and
an
overall
light
profile
taste
was
more
of
the
same
light
grain
light
fruits
small
doses
of
grain
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
profile
very
light
feel
with
an
almost
non
existently
light
feel
o
awesome
if
i
could
find
it
by
the
case
i
would
my
favorite
beer
of
the
summer
thus
far
cheers
overall
i
have
been
wanting
to
step
away
from
the
ipas
for
a
minute
this
is
proving
very
difficult
and
this
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
at
just
5
1
abv
and
more
important
less
than
10
per
12
pack
this
could
be
a
staple
in
the
fridge
during
the
summer
months
45
so
good
for
summer

a
miniscule

the

attacked
my

and
made
me
feel
like
i
hadnt
had
a

didnt
work
for
me
welcome
to
the
brew
tube
i
hope
you
enjoyed
your
first
session
ored
says
raise
your
glass
id
tap
that
o
overall
an
extremely
average
pale
ale
nothing
offensive
in
the
nose
or
taste
but
nothing
that
made
it
stand
out
or
that
i
really
liked
just
bland
malts
kind
of
reminds
me
of
like
a
bmc
product
without
the
skunkiness
or
offensiveness
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
2
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
broken
rings
and
random
spots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
grains
and
a
grassy
aroma
taste
is
of
sweet
grain
grassherbs
and
slight
hop
flavors
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
lager
that
is
refreshing
and
just
right
for
drinking
multiples
the
overall
score
is
better
than
the
other
scores
because
of
this
hello
carbonation
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
that
sounded
like
rice
crispies
due
to
the
carbonation
this
settled
out
after
a
minute
but
the
carbonation
continued
the
smell
is
subtle
grainy
with
hints
of
malt
the
flavor
follows
a
mostly
grainy
lager
with
a
subtly
sweet
finish
and
notable
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
light
refreshing
and
crisp
what
i
expected
from
a
lager
overall
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
the
flavor
is
somewhat
different
but
doesnt
pack
a
huge
punch
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
especially
on
a
hot
summer
night
drinkability
is
awesome
this
is
a
session
lager
and
it
fits
the
style
perfectly
the
best
session
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
ever
heard
of
anyone
else
saying
they
have
had
such
a
great
beer
and
high
abv
for
the
way
it
goes
down
bring
this
to
a
party
and
you
will
be
a
hero
a
tasty
session
lager
that
should
work
for
the
most
part
i
was
expecting
less
of
a
sweet
taste
and
a
bit
more
bitterness
still
worth
a
try
to
offer
to
others
at
your
house
light
crisp
refreshing
this
goes
down
too
smooth
overall
an
awesome
beer
to
guzzle
in
the
summer
pp
price
point
12
for
a
12
pack
seems
about
par
to
me
higher
than
average
abv
for
the
style
of
beer
that
it
is
its
drinks
well
and
fits
the
bill
for
style
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
im
digging
the
stubby
bottle
this
came
in
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
and
yellowgold
in
colour
a
short
white
cap
didnt
last
long
but
left
some
transient
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
bit
of
pale
malt
and
slight
spiciness
there
were
no
surprises
in
the
flavour
based
on
the
aroma
a
bit
of
malt
floral
and
spicy
hops
plus
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
the
texture
was
alright
it
had
a
little
more
body
than
expected
and
the
carbonation
was
on
the
light
side
this
kept
it
from
being
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
it
could
have
been
overall
a
decent
beer
but
it
didnt
wow
me
enough
to
seek
it
out
again
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
did
not
retain
a
head
at
all
pale
color
not
a
very
good
looking
beer
not
much
aroma
coming
from
the
glass
does
have
a
wheat
or
earthy
smell
taste
is
typical
pale
lager
with
some
sweetness
and
wheat
taste
not
bad
and
is
probably
the
best
part
about
this
beer
definitely
lives
up
to
the
name
but
honestly
not
my
style
decently
tasty
and
drinkable
for
the
style
sessionable
indeed
but
pretty
uninteresting
a
good
beer
and
a
definite
session
beer
but
the
flavor
was
average
at
best
and
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
of
this
beer
unless
youre
looking
for
a
just
above
average
lager
wish
the
bottles
were
12
ounces
instead
of
11
have
a
nagging
feeling
that
im
getting
shorted
somehow
even
though
i
knew
about
the
size
before
i
made
the
purchase
eh
its
drinkable
and
its
a
pretty
good
example
in
fact
of
how
you
can
do
a
light
uncomplicated
pale
lager
well
but
the
style
is
still
pretty
unexciting
overall
as
though
it
begs
for
low
scores
in
reviews
overall
dont
be
fooled
by
the
stubby
bottle
give
this
one
a
try
especially
for
the
price
can
be
found
for
close
to
a
buckabeer
and
beats
many
beers
for
the
same
price
hands
down
d
a
very
pleasant
supremely
easy
drinker
from
full
sail
this
definitely
lives
up
to
its
session
billing
not
the
most
exciting
style
to
some
but
this
is
definitely
enjoyable
a
worthy
beer
with
wide
appeal
overall
im
surprised
and
impressed
nice
hops
blended
with
decent
malts
clean
and
crisp
no
off
or
skunk
cheap
extract
flavors
overall
drinkability
way
batter
than
red
stripe
im
digging
it
overall
this
is
a
good
sessionable
lager
beer
with
actual
some
weight
and
taste
to
it
i
had
not
tried
this
beer
despite
seeing
it
around
for
years
recommended
for
tailgates
or
parties
drinkability
to
me
this
is
in
the
lower
half
of
this
style
it
walks
a
line
between
pilsner
and
american
adjunct
beer
certainly
not
the
worst
i
have
had
in
the
style
but
nowhere
near
some
others
i
might
drink
this
more
if
the
abv
were
a
bit
lower
but
for
me
this
is
a
one
and
done
it
ended
up
being
more
flavorful
and
smoother
than
i
expected
its
easy
drinking
and
a
relatively
low
abv
5
1
i
would
strongly
consider
purchasing
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
normally
i
dont
really
care
for
most
lagers
but
this
really
quite
good
it
has
a
nice
flavor
with
a
great
light
mouthfeel
which
as
you
would
expect
based
on
the
name
makes
it
a
great
session
beer
while
this
is
not
something
i
would
normally
drink
it
is
a
great
example
of
its
style
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
and
a
great
beer
for
just
hanging
out
and
drinking
with
friends
o
ive
heard
this
beer
talked
about
for
so
long
and
finally
picked
up
some
up
its
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
and
i
suppose
if
i
was
in
the
mood
to
pound
down
some
lightish
lagers
this
might
not
be
a
bad
choice
all
serious
beer
drinkers
should
do
themselves
a
favor
if
they
are
planing
on
getting
into
a
beer
drinking
session
and
put
the
pbr
away
and
pour
a
session
this
is
a
fun
pleasing
beer
that
doesnt
make
you
want
to
quit
drinking
but
rather
beckons
the
beer
drinker
to
finish
it
and
uncap
another
one
session
lager
is
dangerously
good
and
definitely
revives
my
opinion
of
the
full
sail
brewery
d
an
admirable
lager
that
makes
for
good
drinking
on
a
warm
spring
evening
a
huge
step
up
from
macro
crowd
but
nothing
to
specifically
search
out
either
easy
drinking
and
one
could
go
through
a
couple
without
blinking
well
for
starters
on
the
looks
it
is
crystal
clear
i
mean
its
completely
see
through
i
know
its
a
lager
but
this
is
kinda
of
ridiculous
this
might
be
the
most
see
through
beer
i
have
ever
seen
it
pours
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
is
a
hanging
around
for
a
bit
which
is
surprising
giving
the
appearance
of
it
also
in
the
appearance
so
much
carbonation
wow
omg
there
are
so
many
fing
bubbles
coming
up
from
this
thing
i
hate
to
say
it
but
other
than
the
head
this
thing
doesnt
look
too
good
the
smell
is
a
little
better
i
dont
pick
up
any
corn
or
anything
really
offensive
like
that
it
smells
like
a
lager
i
mean
there
really
isnt
much
aroma
though
you
get
a
small
malty
smell
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
somewhere
in
there
but
not
much
it
just
kinda
smells
like
a
generic
lager
without
the
corn
and
other
crap
ok
well
for
the
taste
its
not
too
bad
it
for
sure
tastes
like
a
lager
and
there
really
isnt
too
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
taste
but
there
really
isnt
anything
offensive
about
it
its
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
im
torn
with
the
taste
really
because
it
is
tasty
and
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
it
its
just
really
really
not
exotic
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
i
want
to
give
this
a
4
on
taste
but
i
cant
bring
myself
to
do
that
so
3
5
mouthfeel
is
normal
for
a
lager
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
but
that
is
no
surprise
i
guess
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
lager
and
it
is
tasty
with
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
if
there
was
a
beer
to
define
the
term
nothing
special
about
it
this
would
be
the
one
the
finish
is
really
nice
and
clean
without
any
bitterness
or
bite
yes
this
is
a
true
session
beer
im
not
just
talking
about
the
low
abv
since
there
are
many
low
abv
beers
that
i
would
drink
in
a
session
this
one
i
could
and
would
drink
all
night
d
this
is
reminiscent
of
cheap
malt
liquor
that
tastes
like
it
has
a
much
stronger
abv
i
couldnt
finish
it
i
have
no
idea
where
these
high
ratings
are
coming
from
maybe
its
the
cool
bottle
bravo
drink
up
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
standard
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
head
quickly
dissipates
without
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
a
touch
if
alcohol
and
i
get
sort
of
a
grainy
smell
but
dont
trust
me
on
that
taste
starts
with
s
slight
hoppiness
but
the
focus
is
on
sweet
light
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
generous
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
craft
beer
it
doesnt
really
impress
me
but
that
is
not
the
target
for
this
beer
which
would
be
the
bmc
drinker
for
that
role
it
is
a
perfect
bridge
to
the
wide
world
of
craft
beer
for
its
category
it
deserved
a
very
good
grade
it
has
high
reviews
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
the
weird
sweet
aftertaste
is
just
not
good
picked
this
up
in
nyc
as
i
dont
think
its
distributed
to
ma
at
this
pont
nice
gold
color
and
saazsome
other
germanczech
type
hops
smell
and
taste
it
seems
extremely
freshexcellent
example
of
a
style
that
is
not
produced
as
often
as
it
should
be
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
of
these
overallas
the
name
states
this
is
a
great
session
beer
nice
flavors
a
little
more
complex
and
powerful
than
most
beers
of
the
same
style
a
very
nice
beer
ill
stay
in
this
session
most
of
the
time
coming
out
the
weird
shaped
bottle
session
lager
is
a
bright
golden
color
resembling
a
pale
lager
a
fading
white
head
before
it
even
forms
no
stickage
on
the
sides
smell
is
pale
malt
a
nice
amount
of
hops
on
a
nearly
expired
bottle
taste
is
smooth
simple
pale
malt
light
hops
no
bitterness
slight
fruit
in
the
middle
with
a
easy
ending
feel
is
light
carb
is
bright
smoother
than
a
bud
or
the
like
though
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
hope
to
find
it
fresher
next
time
overall
this
beer
was
a
really
nice
surprise
i
like
full
sail
but
wasnt
expecting
much
going
in
it
was
fuller
bodied
complex
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
really
solid
sessionable
beer
this
is
a
decent
lager
especially
for
the
price
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
its
very
drinkable
i
could
go
through
bottles
of
this
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
quickly
overall
a
great
picnick
or
backyard
bbq
beer
without
having
to
worry
about
the
drive
home
the
mouthfeel
is
spoton
its
substantial
enough
where
it
doesnt
feel
watered
down
and
not
the
slightest
bit
more
the
drinkability
of
course
is
exceptional
if
youre
calling
your
brew
session
it
had
better
be
a
very
drinkable
brew
from
full
sail
i
probably
like
this
one
just
a
bit
better
than
yuengling
for
the
drinkable
staple
beer
category
clear
straw
gold
smallish
head
a
touches
of
lace
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
a
floral
hops
taste
is
really
quite
nice
light
sweet
malt
with
a
healthy
breadiness
clean
dry
hops
with
a
touch
of
cracker
and
biscuits
in
the
finish
an
herbal
touch
with
good
solid
bitternes
gives
excellent
balance
feel
is
light
and
crisp
quenching
and
refreshing
very
good
drinkability
and
at
11
bucks
for
12
of
these
this
is
a
great
find
d
incredibly
high
this
lager
fits
the
bill
extremely
drinkable
more
flavor
and
body
than
most
lagers
out
there
this
one
is
great
in
the
warm
weather
if
im
ever
in
a
mood
for
a
lager
this
is
one
of
the
few
ill
go
for
after
a
nice
cocktail
at
drink
on
congress
st
we
still
had
enough
time
before
our
dinner
reservations
at
sportello
for
one
more
quick
drink
i
decided
to
grab
a
beer
got
a
bottle
and
a
small
juice
glass
to
accompany
it
nice
white
fizzy
head
appears
with
a
strong
pour
dark
copper
colored
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
smell
has
a
bit
of
grass
and
hay
to
it
taste
was
very
flavorful
for
a
domestic
pale
lager
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
mouthfeel
was
wonderfully
crisp
and
cleansing
an
extremely
easy
beer
to
drink
and
with
flavor
to
boot
nice
to
see
fsbc
beers
finally
on
the
boston
market
i
will
remember
this
one
next
time
i
am
looking
for
a
session
beer
pun
very
intended
i
dont
get
some
of
the
negative
reviews
on
this
brew
why
does
everything
need
to
be
a
barrel
aged
hop
fueled
monster
of
a
brew
why
doesnt
anyone
make
a
normal
beer
anymore
glad
to
see
full
sail
not
give
a
shit
about
the
popular
status
quo
amongst
american
craft
beer
awesome
job
overall
good
for
the
style
but
way
too
light
and
fizzy
too
reminiscent
of
a
macro
i
wont
buy
again
taste
very
carbonated
easy
drinking
faint
hop
presence
bolstered
by
heavy
carbonation
dont
really
see
what
separates
this
from
the
macros
at
least
the
pricing
is
nice
this
is
a
good
12
pack
to
have
when
you
cant
get
weinhards
for
those
stuck
in
purgatory
between
the
good
the
bad
and
the
ugly
d
good
grade
bb
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
this
little
lager
that
could
it
was
lacking
in
appearance
with
minimal
head
that
receded
quicker
than
a
cocacolas
the
smell
brought
sweet
malts
and
yeast
to
the
picture
which
were
pleasant
tasting
in
this
tasty
but
quite
gassy
beer
hhis
beer
is
simple
but
nice
not
very
good
beer
is
thin
and
tastes
like
boiled
corn
gross
the
finish
is
fine
at
least
there
isnt
an
aftertaste
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
but
that
was
because
i
was
watching
xfiles
on
netflix
if
i
wasnt
so
preoccupied
i
would
have
poured
it
out
and
moved
on
for
the
night
i
wont
be
having
this
again
11oz
bottle
poured

a
pint
glass
best

pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
frothy
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
very
little
carbonation
and
lacing
nose
is
slightly
more
complex
and
pleasing
that
the
macro
lagers
but
still
about
the
same
profile
sweet
and
yeasty
malted
barley
with
dull
bitter
hop
undertones
light
bodied
and
flat
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
super
easy
to
drink
mildly
sweet
with
roasted
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
make
it
very
clean
on
the
palate
roasted
malt
comes
through
in
the
finish
this
beer
tries
to
be
true
to
style
but
i
feel
like
they
could
have
made
this
a
lot
better
still
if
you
want
an
authentic
american
lager
to
session
that
is
still
tasty
and
inexpensive
without
supporting
the
giants
well
here
you
go
ill
be
keeping
this
is
the
car
to
await
me
after
a
long
day
of
snowboarding
11
oz
stubby
with
clearly
marked
inkjet
freshness
date
pours
a
crystalclear
bright
golden
with
holyshit
levels
of
turbulent
carbonation
that
makes
the
head
climb
out
of
the
glass
it
maintains
a
tight
bonewhite
head
throughout
and
leaves
decent
lacing
as
i
go
pale
malts
nutty
lager
yeast
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
in
the
nose
similar
on
the
palate
with
apple
and
grape
esters
mild
bitterness
perhaps
some
finishing
hops
and
a
curiously
increasing
sweetness
that
tastes
almost
corny
and
leads
to
a
quick
finish
mildly
dextrinous
body
leans
toward
medium
but
is
lightened
by
the
tingly
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
allmalt
lager
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
although
a
bit
of
adjuncts
would
serve
this
brew
well
in
order
to
lighten
its
body
and
increase
its
drinkability
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
and
it
makes
me
wish
there
were
more
tasty
craftbrewed
light
lagers
like
this
one
out
there
slighty
above
american
macro
lager
proceed
at
your
own
risk
these
go
down
very
easily
this
is
a
top
notch
lager
especially
for
the
dollar
this
is
a
good
beer
it
isnt
looking
to
expand
horizons
or
make
new
ground
does
every
beer
have
to
do
that
if
this
were
at
the
party
i
would
not
turn
it
down
i
may
prefer
other
beers
strongerstranger
but
that
preference
does
not
render
this
beer
as
crap
drinkability
light
and
mildly
refreshing
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
interested
in
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
d
easy
to
drink
drinkability
decent
i
got
a
free
stubby
from
a
friend
thinking
it
was
the
schwarzbier
i
wouldnt
make
the
purchase
though
the
best
thing
about
it
was
i
was
able
to
enjoy
it
the
way
the
name
intends
it
to
be
enjoyed
drinking
many
of
them
and
not
getting
too
trashed
its
rare
that
i
feel
full
from
beer
before
i
feel
drunk
but
in
this
case
it
was
a
good
thing
very
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
should
be
mouthfeel
is
smooth
almost
too
smooth
and
silky
very
drinkable
and
in
fact
pretty
chuggable
a
nice
alternative
to
the
big
brews
d
this
is
an
amazing
find
being
both
refreshing
and
flavorful
there
is
an
alarming
number
of
bas
out
there
who
would
dismiss
this
brew
as
flavorless
and
dull
these
my
friends
are
bas
who
have
not
discovered
the
great
brews
of
germany
they
are
those
who
have
not
a
clue
as
to
the
value
of
delicacy
and
balance
in
a
beer
sessions
lager
is
delicate
it
is
flavorful
and
it
is
balanced
and
that
is
why
you
should
drink
sessions
lager
grade
one
thumb
up
its
not
a
great
beer
but
its
certainly
not
bad
after
seeing
the
beer
and
smelling
it
i
feared
the
worst
it
bounced
back
with
a
decent
taste
which
after
all
is
the
most
important
thing
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
id
have
session
lager
again
just
a
good
simple
session
brew
im
not
concerned
about
head
retention
lacing
or
appearance
because
i
drink
this
one
right
out
of
the
cool
stubby
bottle
aroma
and
flavor
is
mild
and
refreshing
with
slight
grainy
sweetness
and
noble
type
hop
character
this
lager
finishes
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
carbonation
bite
session
is
a
great
beer
for
drinking
in
large
quantities
while
camping
or
fishing
my
favorite
session
brew
session
lager
is
transparent
and
yellow
in
color
the
head
is
pretty
insignificant
and
fades
to
nothing
after
a
few
moments
leaving
only
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
subtle
with
herbal
notes
grass
and
a
mild
hop
character
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
refreshing
and
smooth
feel
alcohol
presence
is
very
muted
making
this
a
good
session
lager
indeed
very
drinkable
session
is
a
good
name
for
this
beer
because
it
is
light
and
easy
to
throw
back
even
if
the
abv
is
over
five
percent
good
for
the
style
and
honestly
better
than
i
expected
conclusion
this
is
a
good
beer
and
drinks
better
in
comparison
to
most
adjunct
lagers
it
is
not
outstanding
however
and
doesnt
shine
beyond
the
level
of
something
like
miller
high
life
enough
to
justify
the
price
in
my
opinion
good
work
on
the
part
of
full
sale
though
best
i
can
say
is
its
light
and
easy
drinking
not
a
lot
going
on
here
just
a
thin
layer
of
malt
just
barely
a
hint
of
hops
to
dry
the
finish
hot
summer
day
ice
cold
you
get
the
idea
not
worth
driving
cross
town
for
pours
a
moderate
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
nice
white
head
the
head
dies
down
fairly
quickly
without
leaving
too
much
lace
behind
the
nose
brings
some
slight
grain
nice
and
pleasant
but
certainly
simple
the
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
good
body
and
carbonation
drinks
well
and
is
definitely
a
session
beer
awesome
bottle
pils
clear
gold
loose
white
head
fades
pretty
fast
to
just
about
nothing
smells
like
a
session
lager
not
much
hops
grainy
cereal
smell
tastes
like
a
nice
light
bodied
beer
cereal
light
malt
not
much
if
any
hop
presence
i
was
really
hoping
for
just
a
bit
more
bite
with
kind
of
low
carb
and
probably
a
pretty
basic
grain
bill
mouthfeel
is
just
ok
i
could
however
drink
thirty
of
these
bad
boys
tasty
for
a
session
and
damn
i
love
that
bottle
d
a
decent
brew
easy
drinking
id
have
another
session
has
a
strong
carbonation
that
balances
well
with
the
clean
flavors
the
hops
arent
overpowering
in
their
bitterness
and
works
well
with
the
grains
easy
drinking
and
quite
satisfying
well
worth
checking
out
d
highly
drinkable
fairly
flavorful
lager
actually
wish
id
had
another
bottle
of
this
at
the
time
to
drink
a
2nd
helping
i
think
ill
go
buy
more
tomorrow
was
my
last
thought
at
the
time
very
nice
and
easy
going
drinkable
beer
the
only
one
i
currently
have
extra
stocks
of
in
my
fridge
cheap
tasty
and
refreshing
if
i
were
watching
my
waistline
and
my
wallet
but
wanted
something
that
was
easy
to
drink
but
still
satisfying
this
would
be
it
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
its
a
session
lager
so
its
doing
its
job
well
personally
i
would
tend
toward
with
their
session
black
lager
because
of
it
drinkability
combined
with
a
little
more
flavor
overall
good
amount
of
flavor
plus
easy
drinkability
makes
this
a
pretty
good
choice
enough
taste
to
keep
it
interesting
keeping
the
style
in
mind
of
course
but
with
an
overall
smooth
finish
seek
it
out
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
dvery
easy
drinking
with
good
taste
extremely
sessionable
hence
the
name
hence
why
i
had
several
in
rapid
succession
before
game
time
beats
bmc
hands
down
this
is
what
adjunct
lagers
wish
they
could
be
but
cant
because
they
add
things
not
meant
to
be
in
beer
dont
especially
like
the
11
oz
bottles
although
they
fit
in
the
hand
nicely
d
very
drinkable
low
abv
and
balanced
flavors
not
a
bad
little
session
beer
another
good
beer
from
full
sail
i
love
the
stubby
bottle
i
love
the
fact
that
folks
are
brewing
a
quality
lager
such
as
this
drinkability
this
would
be
super
easy
to
drink
all
day
d
pretty
decent
light
and
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
interesting
flavors
to
keep
me
sipping
all
night
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
nice
big
white
head
aromas
are
largely
subdued
and
uninteresting
tending
towards
the
nebulously
grainy
and
light
honey
sweetness
taste
is
similarly
uninteresting
but
its
wellbalanced
and
frankly
well
sessionable
which
is
just
what
it

to
be

i
would
pick
this
up
over
any
american
macro
and
feel

to
do
so
if
anything
stands
out
about
this
this
beer
is
very
drinkable

this

the

ive
had
the

consists
of
a
notable

flavor
over
a
malt
body
that
has
a
moderate
level
of
sweetness
a

its
a
decent
but
the
beer
tastes
much
better
poured
into
a

not
bad
for
a
pale
light

clean
and
could
go
well
with
island
cuisine
as
it
has
a
bit
of
an
edge

more

this

it

this

about

quickly
settles
down
to
just
along

of

a
decent
amount

sticky

is
seen

is
surprising
the

is
hard
to
describe
actually
mostly
of
grains
with
maybe
a
hint
of

the
taste
is
pretty

like
a

would
be

better
than
a

or
other
similar
brews
goes
down
easy
with
no

with
good

all
the

it
wasnt

3

a

this
just
screams

its

beer
one
of

first
loves
i
still
grab
some
of
this
from
time

for
a

i
still
dont

this

pours

with

the

you
pick
up
on

in
this

the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
and
grains
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
too
it
there
is
nothing
over
powering
in
this

i
like
how
this
brew
has

it
goes

the
mouthfeel
is

also
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a

out

i
will
get
this
brew
again
overall
a
very
solid

brewing
co
it
was

with
over
50
humidity
today
here
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
in
ohio
and
this
sure
hit
the
spot
ill
probably
buy
this
brew
again
very
very
smooth
beer
and
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
or
night
i
generally
loathe
lighter
beers
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
while
being
totally
boring
and
bland
at
the
same
time
but
i
can
get
it
for
the
same
price
as
bud
bud
light
at
a
local
bar
and
it
is
infinitely
more
enjoyable
pretty
decent
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
white
head
that
stays
for
a
little
bit
before
dissipating
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
taste
is
crisp
good
amount
of
carbonation
nothing
extraordinary
but
solid
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
was
surprised
at
the
complexity
of
this
beer
poured
out
a
pale
yellow
with
a
rich
white
head
the
smell
was
a
good
balance
between
sweet
malt
and
hops
with
the
malt
dominating
a
very
subtle
blend
of
flavors
that
while
i
couldnt
pick
them
all
out
they
work
well
with
each
other
the
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
creamy
this
is
a
good
refreshing
beer
that
is
perfect
for
after
finishing
chores
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
good
head
very
good
lacing
and
retention
light
nose
of
slightly
sweet
biscuit
over
subtle
notes
of
tropical
hops
very
nice
medium
body
for
a
lager
with
a
touch
of
creamy
texture
above
average
carbonation
level
that
imparts
a
nice
effervescent
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
well
balanced
and
also
clean
and
crisp
it
begins
with
a
light
biscuit
sweetness
that
flows
into
a
crisp
effervescent
light
bitterness
behind
the
bitterness
is
a
light
tropical
tartness
from
the
hops
the
finish
is
crisp
and
effervesces
into
a
slight
dryness
im
glad
that
i
was
introduced
to
longboard
and
can
get
it
5000
miles
from
its
source
overall
not
a
bad
american
lager
very
light
bodied
but
packs
enough
flavor
to
be
worth
a
try
a
weak
beer
kona
brewing
co
is
skimping
on
the
malt
i
will
never
buy
another
kona
brew
again
for
the
price
they
charge
weak
all
the
way
around
and
through
a
limp
ass
beer
their
ipas
are
terrible
nothing
good
to
say
about
it
id
rate
it
with
bud
lite
and
we
all
know
how
that
tastes
was
not
too
impressed
this
beer
was
given
to
me
and
i
gave
it
a
try
yellow
color
with
a
head
that
fizzed
out
pretty
quick
the
smell
was
mostly
malt
although
it
was
hard
to
find
any
really
outspoken
notes
from
the
nose
the
taste
was
very
thin
with
more
of
a
ricewheat
flavor
than
anything
else
it
was
very
crisp
which
made
it
decent
to
just
drink
in
the
summer
but
was
forgettable
overall
i
give
it
a
3
00
altogether
appearance
is
a
3
only
because
im
sipping
straight
from
the
bottle
pretty
sure
this
is
better
from
the
kona
brewery
not
a
lot
better
but
it
wouldnt
take
much
decent
lager
thats
a
cut
above
your
average
bud
or
miller
its
cool
crisp
and
has
more
flavor
than
whats
out
there
still
its
not
super
fine
in
taste
compared
to
other
high
quality
lagers
i
have
but
its
not
bad
for
something
so
available
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
with
no
head
and
some
lacing
nose
is
very
bready
with
notes
of
heavy
cereal
grain
and
a
hint
of
herbal
hop
character
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
similar
light
in
flavor
mainly
bready
grains
present
which
almost
come
through
with
a
stale
taste
lager
yeast
comes
through
with
a
dry
quality
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
beer
isnt
that
great
the
breadiness
gets
in
the
way
of
the
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
really
really
good
beer
i
have
it
every
summer
and
usually
year
around
i
recomend
it
to
friends
and
family
it
is
not
a
heavy
beer
but
it
has
a
really
good
taste
to
it
the
smell
is
really
good
as
well
it
is
a
refeeshing
beer
great
to
sit
back
with
and
relax
after
working
al
day
or
after
working
outside
in
the
yard
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
from
ye
ole
spirits
in
frederick
because
i
had
not
ever
had
a
kona
beer
and
i
figured
it
was
a
good
time
to
try
them
not
much
to
look
at
thin
with
not
much
color
smell
was
again
disappointing
which
now
had
me
very
pessimistic
and
the
taste
followed
i
gave
it
an
okay
because
i
did
not
mind
drinking
it
but
certainly
not
buy
again
i
guess
if
there
was
nothing
else
available
i
would
drink
again
overall
this
is
a
nice
session
pale
lager
well
worthy
of
having
with
venison
sausage
mmmm
my
favorite
with
this
overall
i
really
like
this
one
has
a
nice
hoppiness
that
balances
the
maltiness
well
i
am
sure
to
get
this
one
again
o
decent
brew
good
lawn
mower
warm
weather
type
beer
o
not
bad
but
also
not
all
that
good
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
this
lager
is
that
it
does
not
offend
in
any
way
still
it
is
just
sort
of
lacking
all
around
try
this
one
at
least
once
but
pick
up
a
better
lager
when
youre
craving
something
bottom
fermented
and
just
about
anything
else
is
available
overall
good
solid
beach
beer
hawaiian
beer
beach
beer
smooth
unoffensive
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
revolutionary
not
nearly
as
good
as
fire
rock
i
highly
recommend
but
pleasant
ill
buy
this
again
in
this
summer
o
when
i
reviewed
full
sails
session
lager
i
said
that
a
pale
lager
when
done
right
can
be
one
of
lifes
simple
pleasures
this
is
such
a
beer
nothing
to
wow
the
senses
but
a
spectacular
thirst
quencher
after
doing
some
menial
labor
ill
keep
this
one
around
occasionally
for
that
reason
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
lager
and
seems
to
me
closer
in
style
to
european
pale
lagers
than
american
macros
in
short
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
pretty
close
to
average
example
of
the
style
it
was
very
true
to
style
and
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
would
expect
from
a
lager
but
it
still
was
a
little
bland
and
it
felt
like
it
was
missing
a
little
bit
of
something
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
pretty
crisp
a
little
refreshing
not
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
probably
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
but
i
think
the
taste
would
start
to
loose
my
interest
so
one
or
two
would
be
enough
for
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
to
me
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
and
i
thought
they
were
both
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
seemed
just
a
little
blander
than
the
taste
and
i
felt
it
was
lacking
something
but
i
dont
know
what
that
is
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
theres
a
few
lagers
that
i
enjoy
much
more
than
this
one
and
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
unless
your
big
a
lager
fan
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
it
didnt
have
any
off
flavors
or
off
aspects
but
it
fell
pretty
much
right
in
the
middle
in
every
aspect
and
it
wasnt
too
memorable
this
isnt
my
favorite
lager
and
big
wave
golden
ale
is
still
my
favorite
beer
from
kona
but
i
dont
see
how
this
island
lager
is
any
different
from
any
other
lager
i
appreciate
the
attempt
but
this
one
could
use
just
a
little
bit
of
work
better
luck
next
time
guys
overall
the
type
of
summer
beer
that
we
all
need
in
our
beer
diet
no
matter
how
much
we
all
like
extreme
barrel
aged
imperial
stouts
ill
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
for
something
this
light
easy
going
and
flavorful
pours
clear
and
softly
golden
with
a
flourish
of
bubbles
and
a
fat
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
nose
has
the
scent
of
light
grain
and
some
cut
grass
hints
of
flaky
biscuit
in
the
nose
and
a
subtle
noble
hop
presence
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
its
creamy
and
just
rolls
over
the
palate
seemingly
forever
and
without
end
a
touch
of
herbal
and
hop
bitterness
takes
this
one
to
the
finish
almost
dry
the
biscuit
is
doughy
and
the
grains
start
to
stand
out
on
the
palate
toward
the
end
the
carbonation
is
ample
but
it
does
not
disturb
the
creamy
smoothness
of
this
beer
overall
i
would
call
it
earthy
and
a
good
and
tasty
lager
mild
overall
and
with
a
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
my
only
criticism
is
that
its
a
bit
too
soft
for
a
lager
the
doughy
quality
starts
as
smoothness
but
then
drinks
a
bit
heavier
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
it
had
some
kind
of
sweetness
like
almonds
in
the
very
last
moments
after
it
warmed
overall
a
good
lager
light
smooth
nice
taste
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
overall
im
sure
many
light
beer
fans
enjoy
this
one
o
decent
sessionable
beer
could
drink
this
while
soaking
under
the
sun
on
the
beach
i
wish
you
werent
so
far
away
kauai
id
recommend
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
pretty
refreshing
brew
if
youre
looking
for
complex
this
isnt
the
beer
if
youre
lookin
for
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
hanging
out

and
work
your

through

then
golden
belgiums
then
ipas
if
you
think
lagers
are
your
thing
this
is
a
truly
outstanding
lager
beer
which
i
will
definitely
keep
in
mind
especially
on
those
special
occasions
after
the
warm
months
come
i
bought
this
as
part
of
a
variety
12
pack
for
about
14
dollars
at
three
bears
alaska
cheap
pours
a
thin
head
on
a
clear
golden
colored
body
the
aroma
is
dry
grain
a
little
grass
and
slight
metallic
taste
the
taste
is
mildly
bitter
and
grain
dryness
the
texture
is
crisp
and
fairly
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
a
fine
drink
for
a
typical
lighter
lager
style
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
its
easydrinking
and
fairly
flavorful
for
what
it
is
i
wouldnt
call
kona
a
craft
brewery
anymore
but
this
is
a
good
step
up
for
people
drinking
typical
bmc
stuff
overall
this
is
not
really
doing
it
for
me
from
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
poured
with
very
little
foam
color
a
solid
but
uninteresting
straw
yellow
not
much
lacing
went
down
okay
very
little
personality
very
little
to
remember
her
by
i
would
note
that
there
may
have
been
something
henky
with
the
refrigerator
by
the
time
i
was
in

of
the
glass
it
had
reached

barely
any

bought
this
as
part
of
their
variety
12pack
id
drink
it
again
if
someone
offered
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
make
this
my
goto
lager
its
fall
as
of
this
review
maybe
i
would
be
more
into
it
if
it
was
july
and
90
degrees
oi
can
see
myself
drinking
this
on
an
island
somewhere
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
o
would
be
a
nice
warm
weather
beach
beer
but
beyond
that
its
a
typical
lager
without
much
making
it
unique
kona
brewing
longboard
island
lager
3
55
overall
nothing
too
exceptional
here
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
overall
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
gold
with
a
quickly
dissapating
head
that
left
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
nose
was
classic
american
adjuncts
with
a
twist
corn
and
rice
aromas
with
an
earthy
minerally
odor
taste
was
more
of
a
european
that
american
lager
taste
the
clean
dry
bitterness
of
a
stella
mixed
with
an
earthy
tealike
astringency
that
left
a
puckering
sensation
on
my
mouth
somewhat
unpleasant
medium
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
high
carbonation
level
a
unique
and
interesting
lager
due
to
the
earthiness
in
the
flavor
profile
but
the
mouth
drying
astringency
is
a
major
flaw
that
keeps
me
from
reaching
for
more
this
lager
is
very
smooth
it
can
satisfy
veteran
beer
enthusiasts
as
well
as
the
relative
newbie
for
me
this
is
a
very
practical
drinker
this
beer
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
will
hopefully
keep
your
shirt
on
it
has
low
abv
with
a
solid
taste
despite
other
great
beers
i
can
enjoy
not
getting
hammered
by
high
abvs
all
in
all
this
brew
delivers
a
fairly
average
lager
quenches
the
thirst
probably
pairs
well
with
food
but
nothing
special
smells
really
good
but
the
taste
is
a
little
boring
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
though
this
beer
picks
up
where
budweiser
and
miller
high
lifecoors
left
off
it
lets
you
know
that
american
lagers
can
actually
have
taste
and
character
but
still
be
something
that
a
macro
beer
drinker
might
appreciate
this
a
truly
great
lager
overall
this
is
a
clean
lager
fresh
tasting
lager
this
would
be
a
nice
sessionable
brew
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
clear
gold
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
strong
adjunct
hint
of
hop
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
very
weak
american
pale
lager
but
decent
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
pale
malt
adjunct
hint
of
hop
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
overall
adjunct
dominates
both
aroma
and
body
more
malt
than
most
its
a
very
clean
easy
drinking
beer
great
on
a
hot
day
the
minerally
character
doesnt
suit
my
palate
overall
as
lagers
go
this
fulfills
a
basic
need
it
it
not
above
and
beyond
some
american
lagers
but
comparable
for
sure
nothing
special
but
also
quite
fulfilling
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lager
mouthfeel
clean
crisp
and
tasty
are
great
ways
to
describe
this
beer
got
to
give
credit
lacing
its
got
it
and
not
so
bad
a
head
either
the
color
is
basic
lager
same
goes
for
the
smell
faint
grainy
malt
this
isnt
winning
points
for
the
aroma
the
taste
is
all
you
could
hope
for
though
clean
easy
on
the
palate
refreshing
you
of
course
want
to
serve
this
cold
but
it
wont
be
awful
at
below
freezing
temperatures
either
this
is
a
wellmade
lager
that
feels
great
on
the
tongue
in
hot
weather
im
a
fan
o
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
entirely
spectacular
or
remarkable
to
talk
about
with
this
one
the
verdict
not
bad
a
good
solid
well
rounded
lager
that
would
make
a
good
session
beer
party
beer
or
kick
back
in
the
hammock
after
mowing
the
lawn
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
nothing
to
complain
about
m
nice
and
full
with
just
a
hint
of
the
carbonation
i
would
assume
this
is
made
to
be
an
island
vacation
on
the
beach
thirst
quenching
beer
if
thats
the
case
than
bravo
it
has
succeeded
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
nothing
within
seconds
the
aroma
has
a
faint
hint
of
bready
malt
and
an
even
fainter
hint
of
spicy
hops
it
is
a
very
thin
aroma
the
taste
luckily
isnt
as
thin
its
nothing
if
not
simple
but
its
bready
malt
character
is
quite
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
either
o
in
the
the
pale
lager
category
it
has
much
more
flavor
than
most
but
it
still
feels
a
bit
thin
it
was
very
drinkable
on
a
warm
spring
day
but
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
would
have
realy
made
this
shine
in
my
opinion
aboveaverage
lager
very
nice
for
summer
i
has
this
on
tap
at
battery
park
it
has
a
nice
looking
golden
color
not
too
weak
or
lighter
yellow
like
lesser
lagers
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
but
also
not
overly
carbonated
the
taste
is
more
hoppy
than
ive
come
to
expect
out
of
a
lot
of
lagers
but
is
still
refreshing
and
good
for
warmer
weather
very
drinkable
overall
promising
start
but
the
flavor
says
boogie
board
more
than
longboard
d
decent
lager
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
slightly
above
average
i
would
say
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
would
not
turn
down
if
offered
overall
a
straight
and
narrow
lager
not
complex
mild
flavor
no
hoppy
taste
at
all
light
golden
color
ooverall
this
is
a
quality
lager
a
step
up
from
the
macros
but
a
tep
down
from
the
germans
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
developed
a
frothy
white
head
which
laced
a
bit
and
dicipated
quickly
appearance
was
a
light
gold
to
straw
and
clear
aroma
had
grainy
citrus
notes
with
a
slight
sour
on
the
back
tasted
of
grain
and
citrus
very
light
mild
aftertase
cirtus
and
dry
on
the
back
mouthfeel
had
some
cream
notes
not
bad
overall
it
doesnt
look
like
much
and
the
malts
are
fusty
when
they
could
be
more
bready
but
the
body
and
the
bite
are
right
on
point
warm
weather
quencher
superior
version
of
a
macro
lager
final
thoughts
even
though
the
flavor
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
longboard
island
lager
isnt
bad
its
just
another
example
of
brewing
prowess
being
used
for
the
wrong
ends
because
the
flavor
is
so
naked
there
is
nowhere
for
offflavors
to
hide
and
there
are
no
offflavors
in
this
beer
which
is
quite
the
accomplishment
in
my
opinion
would
i
drink
it
again
i
suppose
if
i
was
looking
for
a
beer
to
session
and
was
boycotting
bmc
eric
thanks
to
my
friend
neal
for
this
sample
pours
extremely
pale
yellow
with
a
rocky
head
that
hangs
around
for
nearly
the
entire
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
beery
with
lots
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
lemon
taste
is
extremely
smooth
tasty
sourdough
bread
with
a
hint
of
lemon
hops
this
beer
practically
drinks
itself
i
had
it
with
a
bag
of
barbeque
chips
and
it
was
a
great
midnight
snack
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
and
i
totally
enjoyed
this
beer
could
not
find
a
freshness
date
but
it
was
wellmade
and
made
me
want
to
find
it
in
my
area
this
summer
excellent
grillin
and
chillin
beer
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
brew
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
held
to
some
degree
for
the
whole
serving
there
was
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
as
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
with
mild
hops
that
were
a
little
fruity
and
herbal
the
initial
taste
was
sweet
malt
followed
by
herbal
hops
and
some
bitterness
this
beer
seemed
on
the
full
body
side
and
was
balanced
nicely
by
the
carbonation
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wish
more
american
lagers
were
like
it
served
in
a
pabst
blue
ribbon
pint
glass
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
and
i
will
drink
and
purchase
it
again
especially
when
we
head
back
to
disney
in
june
i
would
not
recommend
it
for
tailgating
or
anything
where
your
goign
to
drink
alot
of
beer
parties
etc
but
if
you
grilling
out
or
just
want
a
few
good
beers
then
this
is
right
up
your
alley
this
seems
like
a
better
than
average
light
lager
though
its
not
what
youd
call
crisp
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
ralphs
supermarket
in
san
clemente
the
feel
is
as
crisp
as
one
might
expect
from
this
type
of
beer
with
a
light
refreshing
body
and
texture
it
has
the
cleanness
that
is
vital
to
a
light
beer
o
overall
this
was
a
huge
letdown
this
beer
brought
me
back
to
a
time
when
i
drank
beer
for
one
purpose
and
it
wasnt
the
taste
everything
was
lacking
in
all
categories
summertime
drinking
would
not
lend
itself
to
this
flat
beer
o
very
delicious
beer
i
normally
like
heavier
beers
but
this
is
a
great
american
lager
full
of
flavor
and
quite
refreshing
i
will
drink
another
when
i
get
the
opportunity
poured
this
pale
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
produced
an
average
white
head
and
retention
and
lacing
were
average
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
grain
and
pears
light
in
bodya
foundation
of
malted
grain
white
pepper
spice
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
smooth
well
balanced
impressive
session
beer
high
marks
within
the
style
overall
though
i
was
disappointed
with
the
taste
the
was
enough
flavor
and
aroma
to
make
it
something
you
should
try
again
and
again
the
flavor
was
pretty
bland
there
wasnt
much
going
on
there
i
could
see
drinking
this
in
hawaii
actually
i
could
see
myself
drinking
any
beer
in
hawaii
tastepale
malts
grain
faint
apple
skin
very
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nice
lager
that
would
appeal
to
the
masses
at
a
backyard
barbecue
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
while
spending
time
in
hawaii
coming
back
to
review
this
brew
on
tap
at
the
crows
nest
in
santa
cruz
served
in
a
pint
glass
without
head
this
pale
yellow
beer
is
clear
and
pretty
bland
looking
aromas
are
clean
pils
malt
with
the
slightest
hint
of
spicy
hops
more
flavor
than
u
would
expect
as
this
beer
is
heavier
on
the
hops
than
your
standard
lager
otherwise
clean
and
crisp
with
just
a
hint
of
a
bitter
lingering
finish
easy
to
drink
with
a
little
character
a
solid
brew
meant
for
sunshine
easilly
light
struck
be
careful
to
keep
in
the
shade
i
had
seen
this
beer
around
quite
a
bit
but
being
on
a
budget
i
never
bought
it
i
had
a
yard
sale
and
someone
gave
me
cash
and
a
case
of
longboard
as
a
payment
i
figured
it
was
a
fair
trade
i
was
very
happy
with
the
taste
right
away
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
color
and
smell
were
very
good
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
if
youre
looking
for
a
lager
dont
pass
this
one
by
this
pours
a
clear
pale
goldenrod
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
of
cheap
grassy
grains
the
taste
and
texture
are
rather
thin
after
all
hawaii
is
a
warm
climate
year
round
but
whats
nice
is
this
beer
also
delivers
a
decent
taste
while
being
lighter
on
the
palette
tastes
a
little
like
a
german
pilsner
its
easy
drinking
while
delivering
some
good
wheat
and
malt
flavors
a
pretty
good
beer
for
its
style
a
good
beer
for
the
beach
but
for
even
a
pale
lager
not
much
going
on
far
better
pale
lagers
around
overall
a
pretty
nice
take
on
the
lighter
lager
style
nice
taste
of
biscuit
and
light
citrus
bottom
line
its
an
allaround
damn
good
session
beer
on
a
friday
night
after
a
hard
week
o
im
so
glad
this
made
it
to
missouri
definitely
a
goto
poolside
beer
overall
this
might
serve
as
an
intro
to
craft
for
some
but
does
not
impress
me
as
some
one
drinking
better
beer
for
several
years
light
bodied
feel
lager
like
refreshing
taste
very
light
and
moderate
carbonation
for
reals
with
all
due
respect
for
big
bottom
girls
this
beer
is
a
very
good
smooth
creamy
mouth
full
of
tasty
hooch
o
probably
everything
an
american
lager
should
be
its
definitely
more
robust
than
an
aal
but
what
is
that
really
asserting
pours
a
pale
hazy
yellow
color
that
is
not
particularly
attractive
nor
is
the
faint
fruity
aroma
the
modestly
pleasant
taste
3
25
is
then
better
than
expected
light
body
with
a
semidry
finish
a
bit
sweeter
and
fruitier
mainly
citrus
than
usual
for
style
that
is
ok
but
too
much
corn
in
this
o
overall
a
decent
lager
lacks
some
excitment
more
or
less
a
backyard
party
burner
wont
wow
but
shows
some
grainy
character
at
times
overall
better
than
most
american
lager
but
nothing
that
great
overall
not
a
bad
brew
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
enough
that
it
will
be
bought
again
enjoy
yourself
and
drink
up
salud
this
poured
out
as
a
very
pale
looking
yellow
color
it
has
a
white
fizzy
head
on
top
the
a
very
minimal
lacing
and
moderate
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
grainy
with
a
very
subtle
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
light
grainy
malty
slightly
spicy
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
decent
carbonation
a
little
watery
though
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
lighter
than
most
lagers
its
not
bad
me
and
my
boy
dkwon
was
gonna
go
to
this
party
by
the
beach
i
told
his
ass
to
get
a
variety
pack
and
he
got
the
local
kind
i
was
hype
to
have
the
seasonal
but
he
gave
me
the
longboard
first
i
took
like
three
sips
and
was
convinced
it
wuz
a
betta
lager
than
most
yall
trippin
if
you
say
its
bland
its
a
lager
and
it
crisp
as
a
mofo
plus
it
got
that
hop
finish
o
this
is
basically
a
bmc
beer
without
the
adjuncts
you
can
indeed
taste
that
they
used
real
malts
here
but
overall
this
beer
is
way
to
meek
and
mild
for
my
tastes
like
drinking
beer
flavored
water
im
afraid
despite
the
exotic
name
on
the
bottle
this
lager
tastes
like
an
overproduced
macrobrew
it
lacked
a
strong
beer
taste
and
had
a
strange
sweetness
to
it
i
need
not
have
this
one
again
when
i
poured
this
one
it
has
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
very
small
fizzy
head
that
dissapears
quickly
the
smell
is
light
of
malt
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
and
apple
the
taste
is
mellow
of
malts
with
undertones
of
hop
the
mouth
feel
is
easysmooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
my
taste
buds
got
kinda
bored
with
it
wanted
something
more
but
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
it
was
very
clean
tasting
but
there
werent
enough
flavors
to
keep
my
attention
it
was
a
little
disappointing
in
a
way
i
might
have
this
again
in
the
future
but
im
not
going
to
try
and
seek
it
out
overall
a
refreshing
lager
by
kona
brewing
perfect
after
a
beach
day
simple
crisp
and
refreshing
qualities
o
i
was
excited
when
i
picked
up
this
beer
and
it
looks
nice
in
the
glass
but
overall
i
have
to
give
it
a
meh
a
very
light
beer
that
might
be
good
when
doing
yard
work
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
kind
of
disappointing
the
crack
revealed
yet
another
beer
that
was
happy
to
see
me
or
at
least
to
escape
the
canfines
of
its
vessel
i
got
an
initial
splash
of
foam
then
it
fizzed
and
refused
to
behave
before
finally
calming
down
for
the
glug
oddy
i
only
produced
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
and
even
that
was
limited
in
its
retention
a
canflicted
beer
color
was
liquid
sunshine
in
the
glass
and
with
its
nequality
clarity
i
wished
that
the
sun
were
still
shining
as
brightly
as
it
had
all
day
for
comparisons
sake
nose
smelled
like
lager
real
lager
unadulterated
without
corn
or
other
adjuncts
that
have
worn
me
thin
i
may
be
in
love
can
i
marry
a
beer
oh
thats
right
i
can
only
rent
them
for
short
periods
at
a
time
mouthfeel
was
light
not
downright
thin
but
kind
of
unobtrusive
it
tasted
like
lager
it
had
a
lightly
sweet
maltiness
along
with
a
mildly
grassy
hops
presence
on
the
tongue
it
was
super
smooth
and
i
had
drank
off
easily
half
of
the
cantents
before
i
was
even
aware
of
how
quickly
it
was
going
finish
was
semidry
and
i
am
marking
it
as
a
definite
candidate
for
my
beach
cooler
dr
it
is
a
nonoffensive
lager
its
actually
pretty
good
compared
to
normal
american
lagers
but
theres
just
not
enough
there
to
interest
me
an
ok
pale
lager
not
much
character
but
tastes
alright
better
than
bmc
3
5
do
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not
a
lot
of
character
bland
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
clear
golden
pour
with
white
head
honeylemon
in
the
nose
with
grassiness
and
slightly
sweet
inviting
aroma
grainy
flavor
with
subtle
sweetness
and
faint
hop
bitterness
very
light
and
crisp
refreshing
easy
to
drink
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
can
definitely
finish
off
this
six
pack
with
no
problems
overall
3
5
really
not
bad
at
all
this
beer
is
really
good
with
food
too
i
could
see
this
as
a
refreshing
and
dependable
session
beer
unfortunately
the
price
for
this
beer
is
insane
i
paid
9
for
a
six
pack
at
a
walmart
in
the
atlanta
area
if
you
can
get
it
for
around
5
for
a
six
pack
i
would
say
buy
it
o
probably
not
fair
to
cast
it
as
a
coors
light
but
it
tastes
uninspired
and
ordinary
one
plus
its
not
heavy
and
would
be
easy
to
drink
but
why
would
you
want
to
i
cant
recommend
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
nothing
to
write
home
about
tastes
like
any
other
macro
straightforward
and
goes
down
no
questions
asked
as
long
as
the
sun
shines
this
stuff
will
reign
benevolently
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
would
be
great
on
a
summer
day
i
first
tried
this
beer
when
i
was
on
vacation
in
florida
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
brief
appearance
of
a
small
bright
white
head
aroma
of
very
light
malt
some
tropical
fruit
notes
and
more
than
a
little
sulfur
palate
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
good
balance
of
pilsner
malt
and
mildly
fruity
hops
with
a
vaguely
tropical
note
ive
had
this
a
number
of
times
without
giving
it
a
critical
thought
but
i
guess
ill
have
to
call
it
a
serviceable
if
unremarkable
lager
o
not
bad
for
a
summer
lager
could
def
drink
a
few
of
these
outside
in
the
summer
with
some
friends
hawaii
has
done
well
here
o
i
can
appreciate
a
good
pale
lager
but
this
just
isnt
a
good
example
a
shame
because
i
like
kona
and
fire
rock
overall
good
mouthfeel
otherwise
an
average
lager
drinkable
but
dont
expect
a
beer
thatll
wow
you
a
clear
golden
yellow
colored
brew
with
a
fair
white
head
and
weak
lacing
the
aroma
is
simple
cereal
grain
with
grassycitrus
hints
of
hops
the
flavor
brings
more
of
a
mellow
malt
and
toffee
some
caramel
and
even
some
grassy
hints
of
chocolate
pretty
decent
for
a
backyard
sort
of
guzzler
it
delivers
a
peppery
effervescence
in
a
light
bodied
brew
not
bad
in
comparison
to
your
macro
lager
types
some
flavor
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
surprise
from
the
attractive
can
it
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
very
fine
head
in
the
glass
the
aroma
every
is
subtle
but
every
time
takes
me
back
to
hawaii
it
hits
on
the
nose
just
right
it
is
a
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
you
can
easily
put
back
several
of
these
without
realizing
it
overall
the
first
one
of
these
was
one
of
the
most
memorable
beers
ive
ever
had
o
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bracing
lager
rife
with
balancing
hops
and
strong
body
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
it
is
a
milder
smoother
and
sweeter
lager
variety
called
an
island
lager
it
is
understandable
why
this
lager
might
be
sweeter
rather
than
braced
by
strong
hops
too
many
hops
might
not
be
as
refreshing
on
the
beach
this
is
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
and
it
would
wash
down
most
food
without
taking
away
from
the
meal
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
of
these
actually
kona
does
a
nice
job
this
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
the
malt
is
close
to
what
i
would
expect
from
a
pilsner
but
theres
a
strong
lemony
feel
that
adds
a
lighter
less
hoppy
character
to
this
beer
its
very
enjoyable
the
flavors
were
the
same
as
the
scents
and
were
also
fairly
typical
although
i
did
pick
up
a
bit
of
skunkiness
on
the
tongue
the
was
the
average
smooth
thinness
of
the
style
drinkability
was
ok
but
with
the
beer
being
generally
boring
it
wouldnt
have
much
attraction
for
me
if
you
want
a
light
beer
to
keep
around
as
a
lawnmower
beer
this
would
be
ok
but
you
could
do
better
as
well
overall
it
doesnt
seem
worth
it
at
10
49
a
six
pack
to
invest
in
such
an
average
lager
this
is
a
a
light
bodied
beer
that
would
be
good
with
a
lawn
mower
its
more
sweet
with
a
little
bitter
and
only
a
slightly
dry
finish
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
rather
refreshing
the
body
is
smooth
and
noncoatingand
the
carbonation
is
just
barely
prickly
light
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
corn
and
wheat
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
light
fruity
notes
heavy
wheat
and
corn
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
slightly
carbonated
not
too
bad
for
a
lager
and
has
good
drinkability
o
bought
a
bomber
for
three
bucks
and
still
feel
like
i
payed
too
much
not
bad
just
lacked
flavor
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
sweet
honey
with
some
grain
and
very
mellow
hops
taste
is
moderately
hoppy
with
a
smooth
malt
edge
sweet
grain
and
wheat
flavors
nothing
to
complex
but
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
american
lager
very
easy
drinking
o
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
very
sessionable
though
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
could
not
beat
the
price
a
free
one
from
the
local
bottle
shop
i
frequent
due
to
difficulty
in
locating
some
inventory
i
will
definitely
procure
this
one
again
when
it
is
more
widely
available
in
my
area

my
first
hawaiian
beer
on
ba
pours
a
watered
down
yellow
straw
color
with
almost
no
head
my
server
didnt
appear
to
be
a
pro
so
this
may
be
on
her
smells
a
little
fruity
trace
amoutns
of
hops
in
the
aroma
but
all
up
smells
like
a
lager
flavor
is
that
of
any
standard
lager
but
this
has
an
island
style
fruity
crispness
to
it
i
can
see
this
being
a
decent
warm
weather
beer
mouthfeel
is
alright
brisk
and
light
could
use
a
bit
more
co2
too
boring
to
keep
me
interested
but
not
a
bad
brew
i
didnt
expect
a
lot
out
of
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
at
least
not
for
a
light
lager
its
got
way
more
carbonation
than
it
needs
and
is
just
mediocre
alltogether
this
is
a
decent
lager
and
can
be
easily
drank
in
large
quantities
the
flavor
body
is
not
rich
and
seems
to
dissipate
quickly
t
sweet
honey
malt
and
some
graininess
right
away
with
a
touch
of
bready
malt
and
some
faint
grassy
hops
actually
not
a
bad
lager
pale
malt
flavors
of
biscuit
and
grass
a
peppery
spiciness
and
light
fruit
toward
the
end
a
very
good
very
drinkable
beer
good
carbonation
and
easy
drinking
in
this
lager
overall
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
great
white
but
with
less
orange
flavor
i
would
definetly
buy
again
and
is
really
easy
to
drink
without
complaint
of
being
too
watery
this
beer
was
a
bit
disappointing
after
having
the
kona
pale
ale
lagers
are
hit
and
miss
with
me
and
this
was
a
miss
o
good
lager
i
havent
had
anything
in
this
style
but
id
say
it
fits
right
in
with
something
like
prima
pils
from
victory
not
up
to
that
standard
but
close
trying
the
longboard
island
lager
at
the
jacksonville
airport
whilst
awaiting
my
flight
home
the
beer
pours
a
golden
clear
with
decent
carbonation
the
forms
a
white
head
bot
however
dissapate
quickly
and
there
was
no
lacing
the
smell
is
primarily
barleygrain
the
taste
has
a
zest
of
lemon
that
helps
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
light
in
body
goood
for
sessioning
and
hot
climate
overall
it
is
ok
it
has
a
perfect
blend
of
taste
and
drinkability
similar
to
newcastle
a
medium
body
lager
with
a
great
finish
robust
but
not
heavy
very
refreshing
for
a
craft
style
beer
kona
longboard
lager
i
have
had
a
few
mix
ups
lately
at
a
bar
in
an
airport
i
ordered
a
boulevard
ale
and
for
sure
it
was
a
wheat
beer
probably
the
leinenkugles
they
had
on
tap
as
well
so
i
passed
on
that
beer
review
due
to
the
uncertainty
of
what
i
was
drinking
back
to
the
longboard
lager
in
the
glass
it
has
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
faint
cloudiness
the
head
is
thin
and
pure
white
looking
at
this
lager
i
was
thinking
it
sure
looks
like
a
wheat
beer
the
aroma
added
more
fuel
to
that
fire
as
did
the
taste
subtle
sweetness
and
the
hint
of
lemon
and
fruit
that
has
me
thinking
its
a
wheat
beer
i
got
the
same
result
from
the
three
remaining
bottles
i
had
so
could
it
be
a
bottling
mistake
i
cannot
say
but
to
finish
the
review
of
what
was
in
the
bottles
i
sampled
i
liked
this
light
sweet
beer
but
is
it
a
lager
certainly
not
like
any
i
have
sampled
to
date
this
was
my
first
hawaiian
beer
pretty
good
overall
this
one
isnt
too
bad
easy
enough
to
drink
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
but
that
really
isnt
saying
much
dr
drinkable
decently
priced
and
average
quality
overall
this
isnt
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
its
just
an
all
around
good
american
pale
lager
i
got
no
complaints
i
would
happily
purchase
this
at
a
store
or
ontap
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
session
beer
o
solid
lager
this
is
an
decent
upgrade
from
the
macro
beers
out
there
when
i
think
of
a
beer
i
think
of
the
budweisers
and
coronas
and
that
sort
of
stuff
the
common
beers
you
always
see
imagine
if
they
were
better
quality
thats
what
island
lager
drinks
like
to
me
its
taking
every
aspect
of
a
typical
beer
thats
drunk
in
any
situation
and
making
it
better
its
crisp
smooth
wellrounded
its
an
everyman
beer
and
its
good
at
it
overall
id
buy
this
beer
for
a
group
of
friends
because
its
different
enough
and
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
citrusy
hop
character
on
the
front
rough
yeasty
bite
on
the
back
clean
taste
but
not
a
refreshing
lager
body
maybe
a
little
overdone
because
the
hops
werent
the
problem
the
big
wave
golden
ale
was
more
satisfying
for
me
kona
is
your
best
bet
on
the
islands
but
skip
this
selection
overall
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
unless
its
really
fresh
7
99
is
a
decent
price
and
their
bottled
on
date
is
clearly
printed
at
the
bottom
of
the
lable
which
is
always
appreciated
in
a
shaker
pint
glass
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
and
just
spotty
lacings
smell
like
grain
tastes
like
sweet
malts
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
follow
the
more
i
tasted
this
beer
the
more
plisner
like
it
became
suspect
some
euro
hops
checked
the
website
and
it
lists
mt
hood
hallertau
and
czech
saaz
hops
nice
mouthfeel
with
appropriate
carbonation
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
excellent
hot
weather
beer
taste
is
fairly
typical
lager
though
substantially
more
flavorful
than
most
again
as
with
the
aroma
i
get
yeast
and
crusty
bread
malty
but
not
too
simple
or
flat
this
one
proved
crisp
and
refreshing
and
among
the
better
lagers
ive
had
lately
overall
would
be
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
im
thinking
out
on
a
golf
course
easy
drinking
and
tastes
great
this
tastes
as
you
would
expect
an
american
lager
would
with
some
light
malt
flavor
and
very
mild
bitterness
but
it
is
refreshing
flavorwise
and
has
a
subtle
fruit
tinge
in
the
yeast
which
gives
a
slight
tangy
residual
flavor
with
an
almost
spicy
effect
from
the
expressive
carbonation
this
is
a
good
example
and
it
goes
down
easy
with
more
flavor
than
most
i
would
drink
this
again
if
given
the
opportunity
a
good
beer
over
all
but
not
good
enough
to
make
it
stand
out
over
other
pale
lagers
overall
i
found
this
brew
to
be
quite
smooth
and
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
especially
keep
this
one
for
those
hot
summer
days
or
warm
climates
o
straight
forward
and
fairly
mellow
a
strong
yellow
pour
with
a
thin
quickly
disappearing
lace
smells
of
straw
and
malt
touch
sweet
a
nice
clean
crisp
lager
a
definite
surprise
as
i
was
not
expecting
it
nothing
crazy
in
the
mouth
but
i
could
see
how
this
would
be
a
good
bbq
or
tailgatin
kinda
beer
its
easy
drinking
doesnt
necessarily
kill
your
palate
yet
you
can
put
down
a
few
if
youd
like
normally
im
not
big
on
lagers
but
this
one
i
could
see
trying
again
o
meh
typical
pale
lager
nothing
special
but
totally
drinkable
have
no
problem
pounding
a
few
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
however
not
impressive
by
any
means
i
would
drink
another
but
will
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
in
the
futre
aloha
nothing
spectacular
about
this
beer
yet
nothing
incredibly
annoying
either
poured
a
bright
yellow
with
a

frothy
white

was
of

slight
tropical
fruit
and
malt
flavor
was
very
clean
slightly
earthy
and
malty
but
not
much
complexity
mouthfeel
was
refreshing
and
average
for
the
style
nothing
spectacular
here
but
a
solid
lager
nonetheless
feel
is
light
bodied
with
very
light
carb
going
on
not
bitter
kinda
like
lightly
carbed
water
with
lemon
and
malt
not
something
i
would
go
for
again
thebeeralmanac
com
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
not
very
memorable
either
rjt
mo
if
the
purpose
of
this
beer
was
to
be
a
refreshing
thirst
quencher
for
tropical
climates
well
then
it
is
a
success
ive
gotta
say
this
one
is
very
disappointing
just
not
impressed
all
around
o
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
a
refreshing
and
crisp
lager
during
summer
but
still
longboard
has
a
tough
time
separating
itself
from
the
sea
of
average
pale
lagers
o
better
than
most
apls
unfortunately
served
in
a
large
frosty
schooner
mug
just
ok
session
beers
that
are
light
in
hue
dont
get
more
full
than
this
the
mouthfeel
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
and
the
alcohol
couldnt
be
tasted
or
detected
even
though
the
aroma
wasnt
there
for
this
beer
everything
else
was
up
to
snuff
those
looking
for
a
clearer
and
more
filling
alternative
to
the
summer
beers
that
are
on
the
shelf
now
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
from
kona
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
foamy
rings
occur
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grains
and
biscuitlike
malt
taste
is
of
sweet
grain
biscuit
and
slight
grassy
flavors
very
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
lager
that
is
neither
that
good
or
that
bad
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
weirdly
bright
good
white
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
a
light
amount
of
grain
and
some
very
faint
hops
the
flavor
has
mild
grain
and
doesnt
have
much
bready
malt
as
ive
come
to
expect
its
more
the
body
of
a
pilsner
without
the
hops
light
body
and
good
carbonation
pretty
good
though
nothing
too
special
not
a
bad
beer
good
for
the
beach
i
guess
o
easy
enough
to
drink
and
rather
refreshing
after
a
day
of
work
sipped
while
relaxing
on
the
back
patio
tasty
benign
doesnt
sway
me
one
way
or
the
other
really
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
more
and
i
could
see
buying
it
for
a
summer
gettogether
to
satisfy
anyone
looking
for
a
clean

then
that

it
papaya
pear
lemon
drying
and
carbonated
a
bit
of
popsicle
stick
lingers
a
low
side
of
average
lager
not
up
to
the
usual
kona
quality
but
might
hit
the
spot
as
a
lawnmower
beer
boring
but
what
did
you
expect
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
pissyellow
in
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
thick
frothy
white
head
toasty
and
cinnamon
smells
with
bready
characteristics
the
flavors
were
muted
and
watery
with
slight
toasted
oats
and
cinnamon
spicing
the
beer
has
light
lemon
zested
toasty
aftertaste
with
a
semisweet
and
slightly
sour
finish
not
ranking
high
on
my
list
right
now
could
be
worse
but
there
are
much
better
in
this
style
narrative
tatums
parents
got
divorced
at
age
8
they
said
it
wasnt
his
fault
he
never
got
those
streetsharks
action
figures
that
he
always
wanted
he
knew
it
wasnt
his
fault
he
got
placed
as
a
second
string
nose
guard
when
he
was
a
senior
on
the
football
team
he
convinced
himself
it
wasnt
his
fault
somehow
this
lackluster
individual
carried
on
day
by
day
he
worked
diligently
at
blockbuster
video
until
netflix
arrived
and
that
really
wasnt
his
fault
either
ultimately
ohios
economy
had
too
many
tatums
too
many
skylers
too
many
aidens
braydens
jaydens
haydens
maydens
raidens
but
i
digress
his
strength
was
his
utter
lack
of
individuality
these
days
when
you
get
your
auto
insurance
claim
handled
just
appropriately
enough
that
was
the
sweet
work
of
tatum
update
his
job
will
soon
be
outsourced
not
a
great
beer
but
definitely
a
worthy
alternative
to
your
adjunct
lagers
though
the
price
will
be
a
bit
high
since
its
from
hawaii
this
is
a
very
nice
lager
i
did
not
pour
so
i
really
cannot
comment
or
judge
the
look
and
head
overall
a
very
hoppy
nice
lager
with
notes
of
citrus
and
popcorn
easy
drinker
with
a
very
easy
going
abv
i
like
this
line
of
beer
kona
they
produce
some
very
complex
flavors
and
taste
for
a
fairly
mainstream
beer
company
enjoyed
with
some
boating
food
and
it
was
great
enjoy
overallwhat
i
expected
from
this
beer
its
clean
and
slightly
refreshing
which
is
good
but
brings
nothing
else
to
the
table
a
fine
pale
lager
and
summer
time
offering
from
kona
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
fair
sized
white
head
smell
is
bready
with
hints
of
citrus
taste
follows
with
smell
malty
bready
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
clean
finish
this
is
an
easy
drinker
especially
on
a
hot
day
i
enjoyed
this
lager
definitely
a
nice
option
and
its
clear
to
see
why
its
konas
mainstay
o
yep
it
is
a
lager
i
cant
complain
about
this
one
but
i
cant
rave
about
it
either
being
under
carbonated
is
somewhat
of
a
turn
off
but
this
lager
is
one
that
really
cranks
up
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
to
a
point
where
it
impacts
how
the
brew
is
viewed
not
intense
hoppiness
but
noticable
and
sets
it
apart
from
a
style
in
which
it
is
easy
to
be
bland
very
bland
with
characters
that
may
well
enough
be
deemed
offensive
a
rather
poor
effort
from
this
brewery
and
not
genuinely
any
better
than
similar
offerings
from
bmc
if
im
ever
in
hawaii
looking
for
craft
brew
ill
stick
to
maui
mouthfeel
is
smooth
fairly
fullbodied
for
the
style
with
a
restrained
effervescence
even
a
touch
of
warming
late
a
very
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
more
like
a
wheat
than
a
mega
lager
i
am
happy
to
add
this
to
my
short
list
of
lagers
i
will
pay
for
certainly
an
easy
drinking
lager
good
on
a
hot
day
nothing
really
special
about
it
highlight
was
its
faint
tropical
fruit
notes
other
than
that
pass
pours
a
clear
yellow
good
sized
foam
aroma
is
lagery
alittle
sweet
grain
taste
is
well
rounded
crisp
body
and
some
bready
malt
sweetness
and
a
slight
citrus
character
quenching
rediculously
easy
to
drink
everything
you
would
expect
from
an
island
lager
d
very
high
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
lager
is
very
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
sweetness
to
the
malt
which
is
pleasant
feels
like
it
would
go
well
with
hawaiian
food
with
its
sweet
and
sour
and
fish
flavor
profiles
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
and
good
for
hot
weather
unlike
san
diego
when
i
was
there
a
refreshing
pale
lager
perfect
for
a
warm
sunny
day
on
the
hawaiian
shores
mild
flavors
wont
get
in
the
way
of
your
meals
and
the
drinkability
factor
leads
me
to
believe
i
could
tackle
more
than
a
few
without
slowing
down
md
light
bodied
crisp
not
too
smooth
but
not
harsh
either
good
drinkability
if
it
wasnt
for
the
weird
aftertaste
not
much
head
on
this
guy
it
smells
nice
bready
with
some
light
floral
notes
almost
smells
kolschlike
smooth
malts
hops
come
in
the
finish
with
a
crisp
end
but
over
all
this
seems
thick
for
a
lager
easy
drinking
and
tasty
but
over
all
not
blown
away
with
this
one
the
beer
on
the
east
coast
is
brewed
in
new
hampshire
instead
of
hawaii
im
not
sure
how
this
effects
the
flavor
etc
had
this
beer
on
tap
there
is
not
much
head
but
for
a
light
ale
it
does
not
need
it
there
is
a
nice
yellow
clear
look
to
it
it
taste
sweet
with
flavors
of
oranges
apricots
and
light
amount
of
hops
this
is
a
great
summer
ale
with
a
lot
of
flavor
this
beer
would
be
great
to
drink
on
the
beach
cheers
drunkability
not
a
bad
brew
but
also
not
super
tasty
a
refreshing
summer
drink
could
tear
through
some
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
this
brew
definitely
could
be
enjoyed
while
basking
in
the
sun
very
easy
to
drink
a
person
could
definitely
pound
a
few
of
these
with
ease
nothing
fancy
however
rather
straight
forward
d
despite
being
modest
in
all
the
above
catagories
this
brew
is
a
great
session
beer
i
could
keep
a
twelve
in
my
fridge
and
it
wouldnt
last
the
night
drinkability
is
good
well
suited
to
the
climate
in
which
it
was
created
this
review
was
from
a
bottle
but
fresh
from
the
tap
on
a
warm
day
in
their
kona
pub
it
is
hard
to
top
cheers
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
appearance
pours
a
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
touch
of
cloudiness
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
i
was
unable
to
get
any
sort
of
head
to
form
aroma
sweet
summer
corn
dry
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
bitter
hop
taste
honey
sweetness
light
dry
buscuity
malt
bitter
metallic
hops
with
a
fruity
light
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
full
bodied
crisp
very
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
that
is
going
to
blow
you
away
drinkability
not
full
on
flavor
but
really
a
decent
session
beer
low
enough
alcohol
to
keep
you
going
if
you
arent
bother
by
the
taste
its
drinkable
unfortunately
this
is
what
american
lagers
have
become
truthfully
its
not
terrible
pours
almost
clear
with
sodalike
carbonation
fizzy
light
more
towards
a
mass
produced
adjunct
than
the
promised
handcrafted
beer
says
on
the
label
brewed
in
new
hampshire
by
kona
brewery
nh
rather
than
hi
three
sips
drain
pour
life
if
too
short
to
choke
this
down
verdict
a
decent
but
not
too
exciting
lager
from
kona
doesnt
near
the
quality
of
the
pale
ale
i
had
a
short
week
or
so
ago
but
has
some
interesting
qualities
like
flakes
in
the
brew
appearance
is
off
flavors
are
pretty
average
and
drinkability
is
decent
but
this
is
probably
a
beer
that
i
will
be
torn
on
returning
to
in
the
future
it
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
c
2
95
d
very
easy
to
drink
good
one
for
a
hot
day
overall
a
solid
lager
just
doesnt
wow
me
in
any
way
nor
does
it
disappoint
me
a
really
solid
offering
from
kona
this
a
flavorful
and
tasty
lager
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
moderate
carbonation
no
adjuncts
here
and
it
shows
the
flavor
is
full
and
somewhat
complex
it
is
light
bodied
and
has
medium
carbonation
kona
certainly
does
the
lager
style
justice
here
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
no
real
flaws
with
this
beer
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
very
exciting
d
better
than
your
average
american
pale
lager
i
actually
rather
enjoyed
it
and
could
see
it
as
a
very
approachable
and
sessionable
beer
a
very
nice
drinkable
lager
for
when
doing
yardwork
dmmm
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
could
have
lots
of
this
the
taste
stays
through
out
the
experience
d
an
uninteresting
and
overpriced
brew
pours
a
transparent
gold
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
leaves
some
traces
on
the
glass
after
it
dissipates
smells
of
grain
sort
of
a
pilsner
smell
taste
is
pretty
easy
going
but
enjoyable
certainly
more
flavor
than
most
lagers
and
good
flavor
at
that
but
it
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
slowly
ease
a
friend
into
craft
beer
taste
is
crisp
with
a
emphasis
on
some
hops
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
but
unlike
bmc
headliners
it
has
a
definite
and
strong
flavor
the
good
flavor
and
low
abv
make
this
very
sessionable
overall
a
good
option
when
faced
with
few
alternatives
i
had
this
at
a
place
where
my
only
other
options
were
bmc
sam
adams
or
harpoon
ipa
ill
gladly
take
this
one
over
those
options
especially
out
for
a
night
on
the
town
however
im
not
to
sure
this
is
going
to
be
one
i
pick
up
a
sixer
off
at
the
store
but
that
is
more
due
to
my
style
preferences
than
the
quality
of
this
brew
d
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
better
tasting
landshark
lager
a
good
summer
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
really
special
or
unique
about
it
taste
light
tiny
bit
of
enjoyable
sweetness
biscuity
hoppier
than
most
lagers
thats
for
sure
an
easy
drinker
but
not
necessarily
worth
8
a
6
pack
given
that
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
youre
prolly
paying
a
little
bit
of
that
just
for
transportation
buy
some
of
their
porter
instead
light
body
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
very
refreshing
excellent
island
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
for
refreshment
probably
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
drinkability
an
extremely
drinkable
lager
and
one
that
stands
out
from
most
of
the
other
lagers
ive
tried
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
sometime
very
impressive
a
bigger
body
than
we
expected
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
as
it
stays
very
drinkable
bottle
to
bottle
just
more
proof
that
brewing
lagers
is
worth
the
effort
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
seemingly
fit
for
warm
weather
but
ultimately
unexciting
to
me
light
in
color
very
similar
to
their
dukes
blonde
ale
this
beer
actually
has
a
significant
amount
of
flavor
for
an
american
lager
nice
malt
flavor
with
a
slightly
wheaty
aftertaste
very
pleasant
actually
aroma
is
also
light
but
pleasant
overall
a
nice
beer
nothing
awesome
but
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
overall
its
actually
a
pretty
good
lager
for
the
price
6
50
6pack
brown
glass
longneck
i
will
enjoy
putting
these
down
especially
over
the
other
crummy
beers
that
fresh
easy
has
been
hawking
these
days
ill
stomach
through
the
6pack
with
some
pizza
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
this
is
a
decent
lager
reminds
me
a
bit
of
harp
only
not
as
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
i
had
no
issues
putting
down
4
last
night
this
is
a
great
island
lager
hawaii
rules
drinkability
this
brew
clearly
won
over
the
pale
ale
there
is
a
nice
malty
backbone
and
there
are
few
flaws
that
youd
expect
from
an
american
pale
lager
overall
i
liked
this
one
and
i
took
a
bunch
down
to
the
fishing
hole
the
next
day
to
sip
away
at
d
maltier
better
balanced
and
more
interesting
than
a
macro
but
equally
appropriate
as
a
lawnmower
beer
the
pour
is
golden
with
a
mild
carbonation
that
was
sort
of
disappointing
didnt
really
hold
too
well
and
the
head
feel
apart
before
even
starting
this
beer
was
basic
i
give
it
a
plus
for
not
taking
like
cereal
it
has
a
grain
quality
to
it
and
some
mild
lemon
grass
but
mostly
husk
and
the
feel
was
terrible
didnt
even
finish
drinks
its
still
a
lager
but
infinitely
more
drinkable
than
the
next
one
d
not
bad
not
great
pretty
runofthemill
drinkable
lager
d
i
could
put
these
down
while
sitting
on
the
beach
no
problem
its
a
drinkable
summer
beer
but
not
something
with
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
a
good
lawnmower
beer
though
d
this
is
a
decent
drinkable
lager
nothing
really
stands
out
but
a
few
of
these
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
afternoon
md
crisp
and
drinkable
chuggable
not
bad
but
not
anything
spectacular
i
had
a
few
of
these
on
board
and
they
provided
a
moderately
good
experience
while
sailing
out
from
the
maui
coastline
into
the
open
ocean
something
id
have
again
if
given
the
chance
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
maybe
the
next
time
im
in
hawaii
d
very
drinkable
like
most
light
beers
would
be
this
beer
is
a
step
up
for
bmc
fans
drinkability
i
was
not
impresed
by
this
at
all
even
if
it
is
miscategorized
i
think
it
should
be
an
adjunct
lager
id
rather
have
bud
original
smells
and
tastes
a
lot
spicier
and
dryer
than
say
bud
heavy
the
aroma
is
intense
enough
and
interesting
enough
that
i
had
some
mediumhigh
hopes
for
the
flavor
but
all
there
is
is
some
mild
dryness
and
basic
pale
barley
no
adjunct
but
some
corn
or
rice
might
have
actually
been
a
little
nice
given
the
dryness
something
to
play
with
d
a
basic
nofrills
summer
thirstquencher
i
was
dying
of
thirst
when
i
drank
this
and
it
hit
the
spot
quite
well
id
say
its
a
small
step
above
yuengling
in
the
pantheon
of
widely
available
pale
lagers
md
mouthfelel
is
smooth
with
a
crispiness
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
and
an
excellent
replacement
for
bmc
if
you
were
in
hawaii
mouthfeel
is
sparkling
and
good
for
the
style
and
this
goes
down
quite
well
certainly
a
good
bridge
into
micros
for
people
who
drink
the
corn
lagers
of
the
world
easy
drinker
with
low
alcohol
and
pleasant
taste
overall
overall
the
beer
wasnt
very
good
i
dont
really
like
pale
lagers
so
maybe
its
me
but
i
wasnt
much
of
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
again
i
think
kona
has
some
better
beers
out
there
as
rated
per
style
this
is
a
beer
for
beer
lovers
not
so
much
for
beer
geeks
drinkability
nothing
too
special
here
but
this
could
be
a
good
beer
for
a
day
at
the
beach
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
id
be
willing
to
drink
it
again
d
on
a
hot
day
i
can
suck
this
down
no
problem
it
isnt
a
beer
to
rave
over
but
it
does
the
job
for
the
style
well
if
i
saw
it
on
sale
id
pick
it
up
on
a
whim
d
smooth
went
well
with
my
lamb
burger
but
dont
plan
on
a
second
round
1255
taste
is
faint
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
but
i
really
get
a
lot
of
wheat
in
there
this
wouldnt
score
well
as
a
white
ale
either
but
it
isnt
bad
its
very
drinkable
and
very
very
light
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
corn
and
wheat
not
very
appetizing
the
flavor
is
wheat
and
corn
with
some
grassy
and
earthy
hop
notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
kona
makes
some
good
beers
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
d
this
is
was
an
average
beer
albeit
better
than
typical
adjunct
beers
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
may
opt
for
better
beers
if
given
the
opportunity
to
have
again
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
to
make
me
want
to
try
this
again
look
this
is
a
average
lager
however
its
super
drinkible
and
actually
has
some
nice
flavor
its
malty
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
the
aroma
is
nothing
special
a
little
malty
and
corny
but
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
on
a
hot
day
these
go
down
very
nice
plus
i
thought
the
price
i
found
them
at
in
mass8
99
a
sixerwas
pretty
good
since
they
came
all
the
way
from
hawaii
i
would
buy
again
fortunately
the
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
its
a
little
bland
nice
carbonation
on
the
palate
mild
nearly
nonexistant
sweetness
on
the
front
of
the
mouth
some
grainy
bitterness
at
the
back
its
an
ok
lager
nothing
special
or
unique
or
worth
going
out
of
you
way
for
overall
this
is
a
below
average
lager
at
a
premium
price
no
thanks
certainly
an
easy
fairly
enjoyable
lager
for
a
hot
day
drinkability
went
very
well
with
crabcakes
for
dinner
had
two
and
could
have
had
another
f
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
again
more
crisp
clean
lager
flavors
little
banana
but
otherwise
pretty
much
gone
d
when
you
have
sa
lager
and
all
the
domestics
on
tap
why
bother
putting
arguably
the
worst
kona
on
tap
eh
gambled
and
lost
on
this
one
so
it
goes
the
flavor
is
similar
to
a
traditional
macro
grainy
with
no
hop
flavor
its
crisp
with
a
decent
body
for
the
style
no
aftertaste
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
ultimately
uninteresting
drinkability
although
not
complex
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
truly
a
good
brew
to
have
after
riding
the
waves
drinkability
i
like
the
subtle
fruit
tones
to
this
and
i
might
have
this
again
on
a
hot
day
nothing
i
would
rush
to
get
but
it
is
better
than
most
in
its
style
maybe
one
step
above
macro
swill
though
a
very
small
step
i
will
avoid
this
from
now
on
not
complex
but
not
hard
to
put
down
a
bunch
of
these
either
drinkability
i
could
easily
grab
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
warm
day
and
enjoy
myself
not
an
overwhelming
beer
and
it
beats
get
bud
coors
and
any
of
that
other
crap
out
of
the
water
buy
a
long
shot
for
a
warm
weather
beer
taste
is
grain
apple
wet
grass
with
a
long
crackercereal
aftertaste
it
has
faint
bitterness
and
sweetness
the
feel
is
a
bit
heavy
and
full
for
the
style
but
uninteresting
it
doesnt
have
enough
interest
or
character
to
warrant
the
full
heavy
feel
for
me
ill
get
this
again
on
a
hot
day
but
probably
not
with
dinner
d
simple
a
slight
step
up
from
most
bmc
offerings
i
would
turn
my
nose
at
up
if
offered
again
in
the
future
but
i
dread
the
scenario
where
this
would
be
my
first
choice
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
dare
anyone
to
find
another
lager
of
this
style
that
is
as
pure
and
yet
on
so
many
levels
so
rich
if
i
were
more
of
a
lager
drinker
this
would
be
a
must
have
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
being
the
first
kona
island
product
i
have
tried
i
look
forward
to
sampling
more
of
their
lineup
excellent
brew
overall
a
good
beer
probably
a
better
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
to
bring
to
the
beach
but
really
it
is
a
nice
high
quality
lager
poured
a
very
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
two
fingers
of
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
subtle
grassy
and
hay
bitterness
not
much
else
to
speak
of
the
taste
confirmed
this
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
somewhat
overly
carbonated
almost
like
this
brewerys
answer
to
a
bud
light
however
if
i
was
stuck
at
a
party
with
light
brews
i
most
certainly
would
session
this
over
any
mainstream
commercial
offering
12
ounce
bottle
on
a
recent
trip
to
hawaii
a
buddy
brought
some
island
brews
for
me
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
straw
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
not
much
to
the
aroma
it
smells
like
grain
and
some
lemon
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
the
flavors
are
stronger
than
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
mouthfeelbody
is
light
it
has
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
for
the
style
its
not
a
bad
brew
it
would
definitely
be
good
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
etc
an
all
around
easy
drinking
lager
this
is
a
real
american
lager
light
yet
still
very
flavorful
a
very
decent
beer
overall
a
good
pale
lager
that
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
just
wanted
to
drink
something
lighter
with
some
flavor
good
for
sharing
with
noncraft
friends
at
a
cookout
or
party
recommend
rotation
available
here
in
tx
probably
good
for
a
6
pack
or
two
a
year
in
the
summer
drinkability
not
a
lot
going
on
here
but
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
nice
on
a
warm
day
d
probably
the
category
that
this
beer
excels
very
drinkable
but
what
lagers
arent
i
dont
think
id
look
to
buy
this
one
again
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
definitely
nothing
to
write
home
about
light
and
clean
on
the
feel
drinkable
as
an
american
pale
lager
should
be
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
out
again
this
style
as
a
whole
is
a
little
odd
to
me
much
better
than
an
adjunct
lager
but
short
of
a
good
pilsener
nine
times
out
of
ten
ill
go
pils
before
turning
to
a
beer
like
this
but
its
still
a
fine
example
of
what
it
is
this
is
an
easily
consumable
beer
and
well
worth
the
experience
longboard
could
easily
fit
into
any
summer
experience
it
is
probably
best
without
food
best
of
luck
in
your
endeavours
cheers
enjoy
a
kona
longboard
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
by
the
restaurant
the
color
was
a
little
green
but
otherwise
golden
the
head
was
thin
with
a
little
retention
and
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
simple
just
a
little
hoppiness
and
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
the
taste
is
equally
simple
its
smooth
light
in
body
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
making
it
a
good
session
beer
d
light
easy
going
lager
nice
session
as
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
albeit
possibly
boring
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
quite
effortlessly
well
made
example
of
the
style
i
think
not
complex
but
not
quite
boring
either
may
get
a
little
sweet
after
a
few
bottles
good
mouth
feel
taste
doesnt
linger
too
long
and
it
goes
down
easy
very
good
gateway
beer
pretty
thin
and
light
bodied
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
but
a
few
steps
above
most
american
lagers
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
high
carbonation
observable
yet
no
head
formation
aroma
is
mild
with
notes
of
crystal
malt
and
a
bit
of
bread
reminds
me
of
natural
light
flavor
is
light
as
well
with
rice
and
corn
detectable
not
unlike
budweiser
there
is
also
a
sourness
that
lingers
into
the
finish
along
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
body
is
medium
and
smooth
the
most
likable
aspect
of
this
beer
to
me
overall
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
maybe
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
not
very
enticing
drinkability
this
beer
does
not
blow
me
away
there
are
pale
lagers
out
there
id
much
prefer
to
drink
in
session
md
pretty
drinkable
lager
very
smooth
no
real
hop
or
malt
bite
my
third
beer
from
kona
good
brew
to
be
had
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
but
if
i
were
on
the
islands
i
would
indulge
in
the
local
brew
overall
it
is
a
good
effort
from
kona
it
would
make
a
great
stepping
stone
from
the
standard
bmc
fare
drinkability
for
a
lager
i
would
have
it
again
to
support
the
kona
brewing
company
but
i
seek
more
character
in
my
brews
i
would
recommend
this
as
an
alternative
to
drinking
bmc
d
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
pale
lager
granted
i
think
i
had
a
old
bottle
so
i
will
rereview
when
i
get
my
hands
on
another
one
mouth
is
light
and
crisp
easily
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
think
twice
about
draining
a
sixer
in
no
time
good
and
a
total
suprise
considering
its
age
ddrinks
like
water
but
not
at
all
in
a
bad
way
very
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
hot
weather
d
a
refreshing
and
flavorful
brew
for
those
hot
days
in
the
islands
first
thought
upon
finishing
a
glass
is
how
long
will
it
take
the
bartender
to
pour
another
pours
a
clear
pilsner
and
cream
soda
yellow
very
quick
head
and
modest
bubbling
the
aroma
is
clean
malts
and
grassy
hops
maybe
just
the
faintest
hint
of
pine
cones
the
taste
is
straight
forward
with
dry
pilsner
malts
lightly
toasted
malt
sweetness
crisp
and
cleaning
hops
with
a
splash
of
astringency
crisp
and
clean
palate
the
overall
tone
of
this
beer
is
simplicity
malty
and
enough
hops
to
balance
and
sharpen
the
palate
no
frills
or
bs
just
easy
drinking
overall
is
is
better
than
a
lot
of
american
light
lagers
but
like
most
it
pales
in
comparison
to
its
european
brethren
the
beer
appears
clear
gold
with
a
short
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
theres
a
little
dms
in
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
very
clean
with
just
a
very
light
caramel
note
over
toasted
bread
im
sure
this
would
be
a
fine
beer
on
the
beach
otherwise
its
still
a
nice
step
up
from
your
average
cheap
macro
lager
even
though
i
am
a
heavy
beer
lover
and
definitely
enjoy
my
overhopped
brews
this
lager
stands
out
to
me
because
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
is
not
your
basic
macro
brew
the
taste
is
smooth
and
the
finish
is
a
little
sweet
just
what
i
would
desire
when
sitting
after
a
long
day
of
work
drinkability
high
drinkability
very
good
this
is
the
first
american
lager
style
ive
tried
that
hasnt
been
packed
with
adjuncts
my
girlfriend
picked
this
one
up
to
try
it
and
i
was
surprised
i
didnt
expect
much
from
something
called
a
longboard
island
lager
i
expected
something
watered
down
or
masked
with
citrus
but
it
was
quite
tasty
some
of
this
review
is
crossposted
on
my
blog
d
yes
this
could
be
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
other
options
out
there
i
would
have
liked
more
flavor
and
less
macro
taste
im
glad
i
could
have
a
beer
from
hawaii
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hints
of
malts
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
some
notes
of
malts
and
hops
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
especially
on
a
hot
day
light
bodied
moderate
co2
a
drinker
rather
than
a
thinker
nothing
here
is
bad
but
it
is
instantly
forgotten
ill
admit
i
dont
drink
many
lagers
and
only
do
so
when
other
choices
arent
available
yet
this
one
is
quite
nice
as
it
actually
has
some
character
i
like
to
notes
of
fruit
and
would
drink
this
beer
again
d
a
good
beer
for
a
nice
hot
days
when
youre
eating
outside
i
will
more
than
likely
drink
this
one
again
it
pours
a
strong
yellow
orange
color
it
smells
like
sweet
malts
and
alfalfa
the
taste
is
not
particularly
pleasant
a
generic
malty
bite
dominates
other
ingredients
in
the
lager
but
there
is
also
another
almost
artificial
and
sweet
syrupy
taste
the
taste
ends
with
an
ever
so
slight
bitter
aftertaste
simply
this
beer
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
it
does
not
seem
creative
it
seems
generic
drinkability
just
not
a
style
i
care
much
for
at
all
though
this
beer
brings
some
flavor
that
is
for
sure
taste
decently
smooth
but
crisp
as
well
not
overly
crisp
though
or
dry
for
that
matter
still
not
to
bad
but
not
too
flavorful
either
dgreat
beer
with
seafood
had
with
some
dungeoness
crabincredible
overall
this
is
one
of
those
fineforitsstyle
brews
that
isnt
really
bad
but
its
just
in
such
a
mediocre
style
that
theres
no
point
in
really
harping
on
about
it
its
your
standard
pale
copper
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissolves
fast
nose
is
light
fruity
sweetness
some
graininess
and
the
flavor
is
likewise
its
basically
a
bmc
but
with
a
fancier
bottle
and
slightly
better
everything
not
worth
picking
up
again
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
that
is
marked
063009
sampled
on
aug
3
2009
in
warm
humid
conditions
the
pour
is
a
bit
and
a
bit
straw
yellow
with
almost
no
head
bubbly
carbonation
and
good
clarity
there
is
definitely
something
akin
to
citrus
in
the
aroma
mixed
in
with
a
distant
hint
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
runs
about
medium
texture
it
sports
a
spicy
and
tart
taste
with
a
little
pineapple
or
lemon
squeezed
in
a
good
beer
for
tropical
weather
drinkability
well
suited
for
south
florida
summer
afternoons
where
consistently
sultry
outdoor
temps
require
a
refreshment
with
equal
and
opposite
energy
to
renew
the
palate
translation
a
fair
lawnmower
beer
overall
just
a
step
above
the
masses
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
negatives
as
far
as
i
can
tell
im
not
saying
its
the
best
thing
youve
ever
tasted
but
it
may
very
well
be
one
of
the
best
lagers
youll
ever
drink
beer
pours
nicely
but
the
head
quickly
disappears
with
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
light
golden
color
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
faint
non
impressive
nose
the
taste
has
hints
of
citrus
finishing
with
slight
hoppy
flavors
overall
this
is
not
a
super
impressive
beer
but
if
youre
sitting
on
the
beach
in
hawaii
with
this
beer
in
hand
i
dont
think
youd
be
disappointed

for

a
nice
one
to
take
out

be
classy
drinkability
a
great
choice
with
limited
selection
great
summer
session
option
d
very
delicious
definitely
have
another
one
the
truth
is
that
im
not
a
huge
lager
fan
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
i
could
probably
drink
4
or
5
before
getting
bored
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
lager
i
could
drink
these
easily
while
grilling
overall
it
went
down
pretty
well
only
had
one
a
gift
and
wish
i
had
a
6
for
the
weekend
not
overthetop
great
but
a
decent
fairly
drinkable
surprise
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
enjoy
it
a
lot
have
had
it
a
bit
in
the
past
it
one
considers
it
to
be
a
tropical
island
session
beer
its
nearly
perfect
aloha
d
mildly
exciting
beer
worth
a
try
and
full
of
summery
dimensions
a
pretty
straightforward
lager
and
notch
above
some
others
of
its
kind
translucent
light
golden
colors
a
cooked
corn
but
clean
malt
aroma
tastes
bring
out
some
light
grassy
hops
and
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
there
arent
too
many
residuals
here
either
this
and
many
other
pale
lagers
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
folks
just
entering
the
craft
scene
from
bmc
d
i
picture
myself
drinking
this
instead
of
a
corona
on
the
beach
it
works
its
definitely
light
enough
to
enjoy
more
than
one
per
sitting
im
glad
i
bought
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
silky
soft
and
seafoamy
the
texture
in
the
mouth
is
liquid
perfection
beginning
very
smooth
and
quickly
gaining
subtle
carbonation
that
just
hangs
right
in
there
for
the
duration
a
wonderfully
simple
yet
complex
beer
that
needs
to
become
available
in
north
jersey
soon
d
easy
to
toss
back
a
sixer
of
these
taste
is
a
bit
thin
after
a
few
though
delisch
nope
outstanding
nope
worth
more
than
7
00
per
six
pack
not
again
but
it
aint
bad
and
i
didnt
dislike
any
of
it
overall
it
was
a
bit
better
than
i
expected
and
i
would
recommend
this
lager
to
most
buyers
mostly
drinkable
beer
this
beer
is
contract
brewed
in
portsmouth
nh
kudos
to
kona
for
reducing
their
carbon
footprint
and
bringing
this
beer
to
new
england
bottle
poured
into
my
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
no
head
at
all
no
lacing
either
smells
grassy
with
smacks
of
sour
lemon
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
flavor
is
of
lemon
bread
mixed
in
with
the
grassy
character
slight
hop
presence
as
it
finishes
just
hintingly
bitter
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
clean
lager
ill
reach
for
this
again
recommend
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
this
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
nice
day
some
sweet
and
slightly
viscous
lemonorange
up
front
with
more
neutral
malts
and
some
spice
on
the
finish
sweet
and
bready
on
the
close
good
carbonation
matches
the
body
and
yields
a
smooth
feel
and
an
easy
drink
drink
is
a
bit
limited
however
by
the
lack
of
defining
characteristics
of
this
beer
might
get
a
little
boring
after
a
while
this
is
a
great
session
brew
and
would
pair
nicely
with
a
simply
dressed
field
green
salad
on
the
pation
or
hot
dogs
at
the
ballgame
i
will
be
buying
this
again
as
the
weather
warms
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
drinkable
and
all
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
lagers
d
pretty
good
i
prefer
a
beer
of
this
style
to
be
a
tad
bit
drier
and
not
so
sweet
on
the
aftertaste
but
it
wasnt
offensive
ice
cold
on
a
summer
day
it
would
be
a
decent
option
d
your
typical
pale
lager
nothing
really
stands
out
with
it
making
it
hard
for
me
to
want
another
one
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
though
i
had
this
at
a
bbq
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
but
barely
detectable
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
mild
bitterness
the
flavor
profile
does
not
have
a
lot
of
depth
the
brew
is
light
bodied
has
adequete
carbonation
and
is
very
quaffable
this
brew
is
great
for
hot
summer
days
and
easy
drinking
just
do
not
look
for
any
big
flavors
d
pretty
good
id
like
to
see
what
it
tastes
like
on
the
beach
in
hawaii
though
d
it
goes
down
easy
enough
but
its
nothing
special
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
this
is
going
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
this
summer
for
sure
not
too
often
that
i
see
or
hear
of
brews
coming
out
of
hawaii
so
there
was
a
little
posterity
behind
getting
this
one
its
a
fairly
average
lager
made
a
bit
more
interesting
by
the
sweet
and
floral
fruity
all
malt
profile
worth
a
try
but
likely
wouldnt
buy
again
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
grain
and
sweet
fruits
like
green
apples
with
a
hint
of
skunk
taste
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
medium
body
stickywatery
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
remarkable
either
i
could
see
downing
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
day
would
be
very
sessionable
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
lots
of
malty
grainy
corn
husk
like
flavors
overall
but
nicely
balanced
with
lite
citrus
flavors
and
a
nice
toasty
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
what
i
didnt
like
is
that
the
appearance
was
lacking
shortly
after
i
poured
it
it
just
kinda
looked
like
its
just
been
sitting
there
so
i
think
i
might
have
gotten
an
old
one
id
say
if
its
old
id
give
it
a
b
and
if
not
c
range
ill
be
sure
to
try
again
and
update
if
there
is
a
difference
but
for
now
its
fairly
decent
overall
while
it
was
nothing
tremendous
i
liked
this
beer
and
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
i
would
look
for
this
one
again
the
flavor
is
a
clean
and
crisp
feeling
herbalwheatieness
with
white
rice
dried
corn
peppery
yeastand
dried
grains
the
snappy
feel
continues
with
a
slightly
smooth
finish
simple
effective
lager
taste
not
huge
complexity
here
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
overall
the
longboard
lager
was
a
great
drink
will
continue
to
taste
kona
beers
as
long
as
i
can
find
them
in
my
area
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
italian
eatery
last
night
and
honestly
was
pleasently
surprised
came
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
light
to
medium
golden
with
some
chill
haze
from
the
glassa
thinner
but
well
retained
head
atop
not
much
in
the
nosea
little
sweetness
and
grain
but
really
not
much
goin
on
was
taken
back
a
little
by
the
herbal
hop
smack
i
got
on
the
palate
really
herbal
with
a
firm
toasty
base
that
did
fade
after
a
few
drinks
but
still
the
hop
flavors
were
a
pleasent
surprise
drinkable
and
firm
in
the
moutha
nice
lager
beer
with
food
12oz
bottle
from
the
local
hannaford
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
crystal
clear
body
with
a
short
lived
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
somewhat
bready
and
biscuity
tastes
sweet
with
some
bready
elements
as
well
as
an
unexpected
citric
hoppiness
supporting
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
very
easy
drinker
even
for
the
style
id
definitely
get
this
one
again
either
to
have
with
macrodrinking
friends
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
stuff
d
very
drinkable
this
might
be
my
new
goto
lager
ill
be
trying
other
brews
from
kona
soon
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
several
others
that
i
would
choose
first
i
had
this
beer
while
on
vacation
in
florida
it
was
a
perfect
beer
for
a
wram
climate
and
io
was
really
glad
that
this
was
a
available
in
the
end
longboard
boasts
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
wispy
white
head
the
nose
is
herbal
with
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
against
a
malt
background
the
taste
is
crisp
with
crystal
malts
and
an
almost
wheatlike
lightness
to
it
tiny
hop
bite
in
the
finish
light
in
body
and
very
appropriate
for
the
beach
or
lawn
in
july
but
otherwise
probably
only
mediocre
review
from
2
bottles
purchased
at
the
davis
coop
pours
a
thin
yellow
with
not
really
much
of
a
head
smells
of
light
malt
a
hint
of
spiced
hops
apples
and
malt
on
the
flavor
some
grass
hint
of
rice
that
my
only
be
in
my
imagination
nice
mild
hop
bite
on
the
finish
refreshing
and
drinkable
also
now
i
know
that
ono
kial
ola
means
delicious
lifeguard
poured
a
straw
color
with
absolutely
no
head
visible
carbonation
but
no
head
formed
very
clear
the
aromas
were
of
earthy
slighty
skunky
hops
which
overpowered
a
toasted
malt
scent
nice
muted
earthy
floral
hop
flavor
that
transitions
into
a
crisp
not
too
bitter
finish
the
malts
were
toasted
and
tealike
in
flavor
however
the
hops
dominate
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
beer
but
i
was
surprised
when
it
actually
tasted
really
good
the
mouthfeel
is
good
not
too
watery
good
carbonation
and
a
smooth
crisp
finish
i
could
drink
these
all
day
a
friend
of
mine
just
literally
gave
me
this
beer
right
after
opening
it
because
he
thought
it
was
flat
i
couldnt
turn
down
a
free
beer
and
figured
that
he
might
have
been
right
given
that
the
package
date
was
7
months
prior
to
the
tasting
date
after
pouring
it
into
a
glass
and
observing
the
carbonation
i
figured
that
it
would
be
alright
to
review
this
as
is
i
enjoyed
the
kona
brews
when
i
was
in
denver
this
one
was
no
different
its
not
great
but
i
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
given
the
style
the
strong
citrushop
tones
were
interesting
as
far
as
im
concerned
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
ill
likely
review
this
again
if
im
able
to
get
my
hands
on
one
with
a
more
recent
packaging
date
d
a
nice
solid
lager
with
clean
flavors
went
well
with
my
13
pound
turkey
burger
and
fries
d
very
drinkable
beer
in
a
drinkable
style
that
actually
has
some
character
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
absence
of
adjunct
flavors
enough
body
and
flavor
to
differentiate
from
macrolagers
d
nothing
horrible
about
this
beer
if
i
ever
had
a
reason
to
drink
a
lot
of
beers
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
choices
wont
get
it
to
enjoy
a
beer
not
particularly
the
greatest
beer
but
very
solid
and
one
of
my
favorites
believe
it
of
not
i
usually
dont
drink
beer
in
a
frosted
glass
but
for
the
longboard
it
is
very
good
super
cold
o
k
so
the
color
is
average
like
most
lagers
not
a
lot
of
head
but
good
longevity
with
the
ring
left
on
top
the
smell
wasnt
very
strong
just
clean
the
taste
was
clean
and
refreshing
just
a
great
beer
to
drink
at
the
kona
brew
pub
at
koko
marina
on
the
back
deck
in
the
mid
afternoon
just
a
bit
better
than
average
in
most
aspects
but
when
drinking
it
it
is
just
great
for
some
reason
i
cant
explain
d
not
bad
at
all
id
choose
this
over
a
standard
macro
but
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
buy
any
more
drinkability
you
could
drink
a
couple
not
sure
why
you
would
want
to
though
lawnmowerfootball
beer
an
average
lager
but
at
least
they
didnt
mess
anything
up
i
can
see
someone
loving
this
on
vacation
then
finding
out
it
wasnt
that
special
after
discovering
it
at
a
bar
or
local
store
d
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
drinkability
id
drink
this
over
bmc
anyday
there
are
times
when
the
best
beer
in
the
world
is
a
good
drinkable
thirst
quenching
lager
and
this
is
a
really
solid
one
appearance
is
very
clear
yellow
with
a
bright
white
head
that
faded
fast
and
left
a
white
film
smells
slightly
of
pears
and
rice
taste
pretty
good
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
decent
lager
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
lake
635311

well
you
could
probably
beer
bong
this
one
an
unimpressive
boring
lager
from
kona
this
beer
was
just
a
half
step
above
the
big
macro
adjunct
lagers
it
almost
tasted
of
adjunct
grains
itself
but
ill
just
chalk
that
up
to
the
general
lackluster
flavor
theres
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
but
its
oppressed
by
the
bland
pale
malt
there
is
little
aroma
at
least
served
cold
from
the
tap
i
had
this
at
a
fairly
random
bar
and
would
have
chalked
some
of
the
flavor
problems
up
to
freshness
but
i
saw
other
people
ordering
it
and
there
was
a
weekly
happy
hour
special
on
it
actually
i
guess
that
could
go
either
way
on
what
it
says
about
the
kegs
freshness
at
any
rate
its
certainly
a
lager
i
kept
writing
boring
after
taking
notes
on
this
beer
there
are
certainly
better
lagers
out
there
and
there
are
definitely
worse
ones
i
just
cant
think
of
a
reason
to
ever
try
this
one
again
short
of
a
convergence
of
great
need
and
extremely
limited
selection
very
drinkable
a
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
a
sixpack
on
the
beach
drinkability
decent
i
will
say
it
certainly
displays
more
malt
and
hop
character
than
your
basic
macro
lager
if
anybody
figures
out
how
the
bcs
is
fair
please
let
me
know
drinkable
i
guess
if
your
into
bland
beer
drinkability
a
pleasant
and
flavorful
lager
im
liking
kona
not
much
for
head
or
lace
which
was
odd
because
there
are
a
lot
bubbles
in
the
body
a
little
line
of
lace
does
encircle
the
top
it
has
balanced
aroma
50
hops
bitterness
and
50
malt
sweetness
it
has
a
crisp
plain
taste
in
all
the
aftertaste
is
grassy
and
sweet
light
bodied
with
mellow
carbonation
i
heard
from
a
local
representative
that
they
had
this
new
beer
from
hawaii
just
in
so
immediately
thought
kona
brewing
company
and
sure
enough
i
was
right
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
as
i
had
wanted
to
try
their
beer
for
a
while
after
my
first
one
i
would
say
it
was
alright
not
worth
the
whole
hype
in
my
opinion
it
pours
a
nice
lightstraw
brown
and
has
the
aroma
of
malt
with
little
hops
has
a
nice
head
but
died
quickly
with
little
lace
it
tastes
like
your
average
lager
couldnt
really
pick
up
on
any
different
flavors
but
i
guess
when
you
brew
in
hawaii
you
dont
get
much
of
a
selection
for
exotic
ingredients
besides
fruit
worth
the
extra
price
for
a
one
time
shot
this
beer
is
in
abundance
on
tap
at
pretty
much
every
bar
i
was
at
in
maui
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
ordered
it
several
times
the
taste
is
apparant
but
not
too
strong
good
for
anyone
that
doesnt
like
their
beer
being
too
dark
or
too
heavy
i
even
went
to
the
extent
to
find
where
they
distribute
kona
brewing
in
the
bay
area
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
i
am
kind
of
a
fan
and
on
the
off
chance
that
i
was
stuck
somewhere
with
the
choice
of
the
longborad
or
some
over
produced
american
lagers
and
light
pilsners
i
would
chose
the
longboard
otherwise
im
good
and
i
will
stick
with
the
stouts
and
pale
ales
america
is
becoming
so
good
at
brewing
comments
ive
been
a
fan
of
kona
beers
since
my
first
visit
to
the
big
island
not
my
favorite
offering
from
them
but
true
to
style
and
drinkable
they
redesigned
the
bottle
to
bring
interest
to
it
i
think
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
while
sitting
around
shooting
bull
with
friends
considering
it
made
the
several
thousand
mile
journey
to
south
carolina
and
was
then
driven
to
ohio
it
tasted
very
fresh
the
smell
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
lagers
i
have
had
the
mouthfeel
was
reasonably
thick
for
being
a
lager
i
definitely
thought
to
myself
i
could
drink
3
or
4
more
as
i
was
finishing
the
one
bottle
i
had
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
if
i
see
it
again
drinkability
is
good
and
one
of
this
beers
strong
suits
all
in
all
a
flavorful
lager
that
i
have
had
quite
a
few
times
before
above
average
and
sessionable
this
beer
was
terribly
disappointing
while
cold
it
seemed
fine
enough
but
the
time
it
took
to
down
a
bowl
of
chili
turned
it
into
an
only
moderately
drinkable
bev
its
not
like
id
never
have
it
again
but
itd
have
to
be
icecold
poured
a
golden
hazy
honey
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
nose
is
truly
malty
grainy
and
some
hops
slightly
effervescent
taste
grain
slight
hops
and
well
malts
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
better
than
most
attempts
by
the
big
breweries
i
actually
finished
it
and
it
was
pretty
good
very
good
compared
to
the
competitiona
nd
the
drinkability
was
good
921
update
had
a
couple
bottles
tonight
still
good
but
wishing
were
crisper
and
slightly
hoppier
carbonation
seemed
a
little
low
so
second
poured
very
carefully
better
could
drink
this
with
ease
and
woul
again
but
nothing
too
special
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a
packaged
on
date
of
july
15
08
pours
a
medium
straw
yellow
with
a
2
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
ok
lace
nice
honey
lemon
and
malt
smells
mixed
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
floralness
big
honey
and
lemon
flavors
and
good
malt
too
nice
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
crisp
spritzy
and
fairly
easy
drinking
a
nice
beer
overall
within
the
class
of
lagers
this
a
really
good
beer
and
should
be
given
a
test
drive
by
all
interested
parties
conclusion
tasted
more
like
a
pilsner
a
good
one
at
that
best
one
i
had
if
it
is
i
dont
think
it
is
much
of
a
allmalt
lager
id
say
it
is
a
pilsner
but
whatever
it
is
you
wont
go
wrong
with
this
beer
trust
me
nothing
too
great
here
but
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
the
kona
brewing
company
on
my
trip
to
maui
pours
a
yellow
color
some
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
pretty
good
flavor
for
a
lager
tastes
like
a
typical
lager
except
for
a
little
lemon
zing
they
put
in
there
which
i
suppose
makes
it
more
appealing
makes
it
a
decent
choice
in
the
hot
weather
in
hawaii
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
id
get
it
again
but
it
ranks
third
out
of
the
three
beers
i
sampled
from
kona
d
a
nicely
balanced
light
lager
that
is
easily
drinkable
the
hops
dominate
the
malt
for
a
refreshing
finish
without
becoming
too
intense
for
the
style
certainly
not
an
exciting
beer
but
easy
to
drink
and
quite
nice
for
what
it
is
overall
this
is
not
a
great
lager
not
bad
but
not
great
tastes
like
heineken
that
grassy
lemony
kinda
flavor
its
not
bad
just
not
what
id
prefer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
this
is
refreshing
probably
great
on
a
super
hot
day
but
overall
id
rather
have
a
brooklyn
lager
d
not
as
good
as
others
but
slightly
drinkable
drinkability
for
those
maltheads
out
there
this
one
is
a
nobrainier
easily
could
drink
these
on
the
lanai
or
at
the
beach
plus
who
doesnt
love
a
beer
company
that
puts
hawaiian
words
under
the
bottle
caps
you
get
smarter
by
drinking
beer
just
fyi
i
got
kiha
burp
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
14
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pilsner
malt
scent
thats
a
bit
sweet
smelling
along
with
a
faint
hop
aroma
its
dry
with
some
mexican
lager
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
with
a
lingering
dryness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
lager
when
compared
to
the
macros
but
thats
not
saying
much
overall
a
fantastic
lager
i
went
into
this
expecting
a
typical
macro
style
lager
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
nice
light
beer
with
pleanty
of
flavor
i
would
love
to
be
sitting
on
the
beaches
of
hawaii
drinking
this
one
first
beer
from
hawaii
isnt
half
bad
i
feel
i
have
had
better
allmalt
lagers
while
any
beer
like
this
will
go
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
may
as
well
pick
something
thats
a
cleaner
grain
flavor
poured
a
pale
orange
with
a
slight
off
white
head
smelled
a
bit
of
ripe
bananas
and
malt
tasted
malty
with
some
nice
fruitiness
and
hops
light
bodied
with
fairly
active
carbonation
not
the
best
of
the
kona
bunch
but
no
big
complaints
here
as
they
now
quality
brews
no
matter
the
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
has
some
characteristics
of
a
belgian
white
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
malt
and
hops
there
same
with
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
well
something
i
wouldnt
expect
to
find
in
the
tropics
but
the
mediumfull
body
and
the
tingly
carbonation
make
it
a
pretty
good
beer
the
head
is
low
on
this
golden
straw
colored
lager
the
smell
is
sweet
lots
of
pale
malt
sweetness
in
there
a
little
husk
and
hoppiness
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
the
aroma
very
malty
for
what
it
is
with
a
pinch
of
the
hops
no
complex
or
offflavors
in
ths
brew
although
fruit
syrup
is
hinted
at
times
an
above
average
pale
lager
a
step
better
than
michelob
and
one
i
would
revisit
from
time
to
time
it
made
sense
after
my
friend
reminded
me
that
one
of
the
most
important
ingredients
in
beer
is
water
hawaii
has
very
clean
pure
water
there
but
they
mustve
done
something
great
to
it
to
be
one
of
only
3
lagers
that
i
find
interesting
and
enjoyable
to
drink
appearing
to
be
the
slightest
bit
darker
than
most
lagers
this
brew
shows
that
there
is
no
fine
carbonation
upon
pouring
all
harsh
smell
is
rather
pleasant
with
good
hints
of
pilsner
malts
being
used
tastes
good
not
an
exceptional
standout
but
easily
drinkable
with
a
meal
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
though
if
youre
having
it
with
a
meal
its
forgotten
all
in
all
its
a
nice
beer
to
compliment
a
dinner
though
not
a
huge
standout
thinbodied
and
a
touch
of
lightlycarbonated
water
blah
im
comfortable
pouring
half
of
this
one
down
the
drain
12oz
bottle
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
apperance
is
gold
with
a
white
head
that
dissolves
quickly
the
smell
is
not
that
impressive
but
not
bad
at
all
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
little
bit
of
tropical
fruit
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
drinkabaility
there
is
something
i
like
about
this
beer
it
is
easy
drinking
with
a
good
clean
taste
not
to
bad
what
it
breaks
down
to
this
is
an
easy
no
thinking
required
sessionable
beer
that
certainly
follows
the
style
and
i
believe
the
goal
of
kona
longboard
lager
could
be
the
perfect
gateway
beer
for
those
few
with
the
mindset
that
bud
light
is
the
king
of
beer
i
enjoyed
mine
after
finishing
up
some
work
around
the
house
and
this
hit
the
spot
i
like
any
kind
of
hop
bitterness
so
i
can
definitely
appreciate
the
flavor
but
its
much
too
highly
hopped
for
the
style
yeah
this
is
really
great
who
knew
picked
up
a
6pack
hoping
it
would
be
enjoyable
enough
to
serve
as
an
everyday
kickback
beer
and
it
sure
is
overall
good
on
a
hot
4th
of
july
down
here
in
virginia
beach
but
otherwise
i
would
avoid
just
to
sweet
and
uninspiring
had
this
out
of
a
keg
at
the
mensa
ag
in
denver
colorado
it
comes
out
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
fairly
substantial
head
better
than
most
lagers
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
hops
flavor
is
strong
and
malty
and
has
a
substantial
hop
component
there
is
just
a
whisper
of
evergreen
mouthfeel
is
lively
zingy
and
sassy
making
it
a
delight
to
drink
poured
a
mediumcolored
gold
with
minimal
head
that
died
quickly
a
weak
smell
but
some
bread
malts
and
yeast
come
through
the
taste
is
better
as
it
has
some
sweetness
and
fruit
flavors
not
as
much
citric
as
tropical
mixed
into
the
malts
think
bready
doughy
malts
gives
the
beer
a
bullish
medium
body
that
fills
the
mouth
and
has
a
nice
touch
as
it
passes
the
tongue
a
filling
beer
somewhat
this
was
nice
to
throw
down
and
id
take
another
one
if
offered
this
one
is
an
above
average
yellow
beer
as
it
actually
has
detectable
flavor
for
the
price
however
id
have
to
recommend
something
else
pours
a
bit
of
a
hazy
amber
with
a
soft
looking
barely
offwhite
head
that
leaves
behind
some
spotty
lace
as
is
rapidly
falls
to
nothing
the
nose
is
slightly
floral
with
some
grainy
notes
the
taste
is
fresh
and
doughy
with
toasted
wheat
breads
and
some
slightly
sweet
malts
in
nice
balance
a
light
thin
body
could
have
used
some
more
ballsoverall
a
easy
drinker
for
the
beach
or
anytime
i
guessfinishes
clean
and
refreshing
pours
a
toasted
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
light
ring
around
the
glass
very
much
looks
like
a
bud
the
aroma
is
quite
faint
but
i
pick
up
some
light
grain
and
honey
notes
perhaps
a
very
subtle
spice
the
taste
is
of
grassy
grains
touch
of
honey
wheat
malt
characteristics
which
gives
it
that
subtle
spice
a
touch
bready
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
nice
tingly
carbonation
finishes
very
balanced
and
neutral
a
very
light
all
malt
lager
that
is
quite
refreshing
i
like
the
initial
wheat
characteristics
but
that
does
fade
away
as
you
get
closer
to
the
end
of
the
glass
a
very
nice
summer
brew
overall
not
bad
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
i
have
to
admit
this
was
much
better
then
most
it
at
least
had
a
slight
variation
and
some
flavor
to
it
an
easy
choice
for
a
party
or
beach
day
i
dont
know
if
i
would
purchase
again
but
if
i
saw
it
around
i
would
have
no
issue
in
having
one
picked
up
a
six
at
greens
in
myrtle
beach
sc
packaged
date
of
051808
so
this
was
a
fresh
bottle
12oz
brown
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
rich
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
grains
hay
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
just
a
little
better
than
your
typical
american
macro
lager
at
least
there
is
a
little
flavor
there
some
malty
grain
with
a
spicy
hop
finish
not
a
bad
lager
really
quite
refreshing
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
light
to
medium
bodiedan
easy
drinking
beer
with
enough
taste
to
keep
me
interested
on
a
nice
summer
day
very
clean
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
nothing
very
special
but
a
nice
summer
time
beer
never
the
less
tasted
on
5708
palatable
decent
id
order
it
over
a
bud
or
other
macrobrew
every
time
golden
straw
color
with
a
sudsy
white
head
clean
barley
smell
with
a
little
sulfur
very
clean
malt
profile
with
a
small
touch
of
caramel
soft
malt
body
has
a
firm
quality
to
it
as
well
does
that
make
sense
medium
body
with
a
very
mild
hop
finish
this
is
a
solid
example
of
an
everyday
european
style
lager
nothing
fancy
just
smooth
and
clean
with
no
off
flavors
certainly
superior
to
macro
lager
although
hop
and
roasted
malt
geeks
will
find
it
bland
good
session
lager
malty
i
think
there
was
some
wheat
in
there
along
with
the
barley
although
predominant
with
barley
there
is
a
kinda
yeasty
bready
faint
cream
flavor
that
sticks
around
making
it
not
as
watery
as
other
lagers
light
hints
of
sweet
fruit
and
maybe
some
spice
it
was
matched
by
an
interesting
yet
quite
subdued
slightly
spicy
hop
profile
that
i
could
not
pinpoint
wasnt
too
pronounced
a
summery
beer
and
a
decent
american
lager
gave
it
an
average
appearance
because
i
couldnt
pour
it
at
the
bar
because
it
maintains
my
interest
while
it
is
light
i
would
match
this
with
any
food
as
long
as
it
didnt
include
too
much
dairy
md
full
bodied
and
very
well
carbonated
an
easy
drinking
lager
great
example
of
what
an
american
lager
can
be
ontap
at
mexicalibrews
in
the
nc
outer
banks
pale
strawyellow
with
good
active
carbonation
followed
by
excellent
retention
the
smell
is
a
little
stale
and
then
it
impersonates
a
typical
macro
from
here
with
a
stale
bready
taste
and
a
heavily
carbonated
finish
nothing
special
here
for
being
affiliated
with
ab
my
experience
with
kona
brewing
has
been
pleasant
with
this
beer
and
also
the
fire
rock
pale
ale
i
look
forward
to
trying
others
from
their
line
up
overall
this
is
a
very
flavorful
lager
that
isnt
too
heavy
a
great
session
beer
for
a
hot
day
d
a
very
good
light
lager
from
kona
lots
of
flavour
but
light
enough
to
be
easily
sessionable
d
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
i
wasnt
knocked
out
by
this
beer
there
wasnt
anything
offensive
about
it
but
it
wasnt
very
memorable
either
i
am
looking
for
the
brew
on
tap
my
new
store
is
a
little
pricy
on
this
one
for
what
it
is
pass
this
one
up
before
it
starts
taking
tap
handles
and
shelf
space
from
quality
stuff
not
quite
ants
at
a
picnic
not
bad
not
bad
i
might
very
well
add
this
to
my
rotation
of
mediumbodied
nobrainer
lagers
smell
is
of
light
hops
and
malts
with
faint
herbaceous
notes
taste
isnt
bad
but
it
is
not
great
either
it
taste
mostly
like
maltadjuncts
just
a
straight
beer
flavor
without
bitterness
or
bad
aftertaste
nothing
major
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
but
still
a
decent
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
not
a
big
head
and
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
looks
to
be
unfiltered
or
at
least
a
chill
haze
the
color
is
a
pale
straw
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
malt
lemon
zest
and
cloves
the
taste
is
slightly
like
a
hefeweizen
but
not
as
much
banana
the
body
is
smooth
and
there
is
a
ligering
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
but
im
not
sure
that
it
is
the
ideal
lager
at
least
imo
im
going
to
try
it
on
draft
this
weekend
to
see
if
there
is
much
difference
hmm
not
impressed
not
bad
but
not
great
an
average
lager
from
the
big
island
drinkability
is
right
up
there
as
a
decent
summertime
refresher
as
the
days
get
warmer
i
can
envision
longboard
being
a
convenient
kickbackandrelax

aloha
goodbye
i
have
never

a

beer
before
i
must
say
i
am
quite
impressed
i
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
and
examined
it
had
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
smelled
mlaty
and
a
bit
citrusy
taste
was
surprisingly
good
with
a
tuch
on
the
malty
side
but
very
drinkable

could
see

the

is

and
just
a

the

taste
with
some
malt
grain
and
a
slightly
spicy

finish
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
lager
it
just
blends
in
with
all
the
rest
and
doesnt
really
offer
anything
that
makes
me
want
to
purchase
again
overall
i
am
an
ale
man
and
tend
to
shy
away
from
lagers
unless
there
is
nothing
else
offered
that
being
said
if
i
am
gonna
drink
a
lager
this
may
be
the
one
its
much
better
than
the
american
lagers
put
out
by
the
big
american
brewers
surprisingly
this
stuff
isnt
bad
i
would
actually
drink
this
stuff
again
d
not
bad
for
a
lager
its
hard
to
do
a
good
lager
usually
it
either
tastes
like
water
tastes
soggy
or
has
some
skuzzyness
this
one
is
really
clean
and
well
done
i
cna
close
my
eyes
and
imagine
sitting
on
a
beach
in
kona
drinking
this
one
12oz
bottle
into
a
mug
glass
it
does
make
a
nice
pour
crystal
clear
very
pale
gold
but
with
a
creamy
halfinch
head
on
top
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
light
touch
of
perfumy
hops
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
too
grainy
with
a
nice
sweetened
breakfastcereal
touch
that
sounds
odd
as
a
pleasant
characteristic
but
it
just
reminds
me
a
little
of
fruit
loops
bitterness
is
low
but
detectable
good
body
for
the
style
a
little
creamy
chillhazed
golden
body
with
an
apricot
tint
topped
by
a
strawcolored
head
the
head
subsides
to
a
very
thin
layer
quickly
leaving
some
hints
of
lacing
nose
is
faint
a
slight
citrus
hop
on
top
of
grain
light
malt
flavors
with
a
wheat
fruit
spice
give
this
an
interesting
if
not
unique
flavor
profile
for
a
lager
as
it
warms
the
banana
becomes
more
evident
and
complements
the
bitter
orange
peel
the
finish
is
clean
with
toasted
malts
lingering
the
carbonation
and
crispness
help
the
subdued
flavors
making
this
a
quintessential
lawnmower
beer
finish
is
extremely
dry
and
almost
forces
you
to
take
the
next
sip
to
requench
your
mouth
pretty
easy
drinking
here
but
nothing
special
pour
is
yellow
lager
like
but
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
and
some
white
dissipating
head
smell
is
light
malt
touch
yeast
and
hops
and
is
decent
taste
is
mild
light
malt
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
a
spiced
hefeweisen
like
taste
in
the
middle
which
im
guessing
is
from
the
wheat
and
it
finishes
pretty
simply
with
a
very
mild
sweet
finish
this
is
worth
a
shot
if
its
available
and
im
sure
especially
if
fresh
in
hawaii
but
nothing
too
spectacular
it
is
a
bit
unique
for
a
lager
ill
say
though
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
pretty
average
lager
nothing
really
special
and
just
a
step
up
from
a
macro
this
may
actually
be
a
macro
perhaps
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
easy
on
the
eye
but
lacked
much
character
this
would
not
be
a
beer
id
seek
out
again
but
it
was
better
than
a
bud
was
served
this
at
a
restraunt
it
was
served
too
cold
in
a
chilled
glass
taste
is
light
malt
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
but
pretty
understated
a
bit
watery
no
very
watery
lively
carbonation
and
a
nice
mouth
feel
i
think
they
have
changed
the
design
on
the
label
since
the
photo
on
here
was
taken
drinkability
after
having
it
on
tap
im
willing
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
but
i
think
ill
have
to
wait
until
summer
in
order
to
do
that
because
i
imagine
it
will
be
much

street
shhh
p
the
longboard
is
a
fairly
regular
part
of
my
brew
rotation
during
the
summer
and
actually
the
quality
is
there
to
make
it
my
lawnmower
beer
no
matter
what
the
outside
temperature
is
d
definately
a
session
beer
maybe
hopefully
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
of
this
but
it
tastes
terrible
and
what
is
there
isnt
enough
to
make
me
bother
trying
it
again
in
the
future
an
exceptionally
good
american
lager
a
category
sadly
lacking
in
credible
competition
amongst
the
oversaturated
pale
ale
market
that
clearly
dominates
the
u
s
microbrew
landscape
an
example
of
a
very
good
beer
simply
as
it
was
meant
to
be
drinkable
extremely
drinkable
i
was
suckered
in
by
the
tap
my
bad
drinkability
easygoing
and
enjoyable
flavor
with
a
body
that
enhances
the
experience
well
crafted
d
this
would
be
a
great
alternative
to
a
macro
on
a
warm
summer
day
very
refreshing
sample
at
firewaters
in
atlantic
city
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissapears
quickly
spotty
lacing
lightly
floral
and
grassy
hops
aroma
light
body
with
a
mildly
bitter
hops
flavor
and
an
underlying
malty
sweetness
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
lingering
straightforward
and
overall
an
average
lager
this
lager
when
poured
was
a
clear
golden
yellow
in
color
with
very
little
foam
that
dissapated
within
seconds
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
carried
a
mild
pleasing
aroma
the
taste
was
of
a
bitter
and
tart
with
a
hoppy
and
spice
spicy
meaning
coriander
not
really
a
bad
lager
of
course
this
lager
taste
better
while
sitting
on
the
beach
in
hawaii
add
a
point
on
this
lager
while
drinking
in
hawaii
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
frosted
mug
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
about
a
half
inch
head
with
little
lacing
this
is
a
fairly
light
lager
without
a
lot
of
hops
it
drank
smooth
and
easy
and
would
probably
be
best
enjoyed
on
a
hot
afternoon
and
in
large
quantities
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
fair
white
head
fair
retention
but
a
good
amount
of
lace
not
much
to
this
aroma
a
bit
of
grain
and
sweetness
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
in
the
back
pretty
basic
pale
malt
not
overly
sweet
this
does
not
get
too
grainy
pretty
simple
and
clean
decent
body
and
carbonation
not
too
exciting
but
ok
good
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
pours
a
crystal
clear
fizzy
lemony
pale
straw
color
a
onefinger
tightly
packed
shortlived
white
head
tops
the
glass
aroma
is
of
pale
malts
and
a
sligth
corn
smell
kinda
sweet
with
a
very
light
grassy
hop
note
coming
through
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
some
citrus
and
floral
hop
flavors
with
a
nice
maltycorn
balance
mouthfeel
is
light
refreshing
and
fizzy
from
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
and
great
for
summers
at
the
beach
especially
if
youre
in
san
diego
for
a
great
labor
day
beachside
riot
had
ontap
in
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
mild
hops
taste
is
pretty
much
like
it
smells
sweet
malts
and
mild
hops
it
tastes
rather
boring
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
drinkability
is
good
it
would
make
a
good
alternative
to
a
bmc
beer
drinkability
is
well
easy
until
the
skunky
aftertaste
good
for
the
style
no
dating
on
the
bottle

i
hope
this
was
just
an
old
bottle
and
not
a
fresh
example
oh
well
theyre
not
all
gonna
be
winners
acquired
at
the
friendly
st
market
eugene
or
it
pours
out
with
a
thin
bright
white
and
bubbly
head
its
orangegolden
in
color
and
very
effervescent
and
not
completely
translucent
the
smell
is
kind
of
weak
and
mainly
dominated
by
the
yeast
taste
is
also
a
bit
bland
theres
just
a
lot
of
yeast
in
the
taste
without
too
much
else
in
terms
of
hops
or
flavor
a
nice
lager
to
drink
cold
in
the
summer
but
no
complexity
drinkability
nice
and
drinkable
not
exactly
a
lawnmower
beer
but
not
a
late
evening
beer
either
well
worth
trying
d
you
could
easily
session
on
this
if
you
liked
it
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
sturdy
carbonation
as
it
goes
down
an
easy
drinking
lager
that
i
can
see
being
refreshing
on
a
very
hot
day
out
by
the
beach
although
its
not
something
id
personally
grab
regularly
its
still
a
tasty
all
malt
lager
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
plenty
drinkable
thanks
to
talisker
for
the
extra
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
slight
fruit
the
taste
is
malts
against
a
subtle
hop
backbone
surprisingly
enjoyable
for
a
lager
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
this
is
an
enjoyable

brew
this
beer

this

sucks
much
better
on

in
hawaii
poured
a
golden
hue
with
a
good
sized
head
not
notes
on
the
retention
but
as
i
recall
it
was
fairly
good
biscuity
malts
are
strong
on
aroma
and
taste
but
this
beer
is
smooth
and
still
fairly
well
balanced
between
bitter
and
sweet
only
thing
that
let
it
down
for
me
was
that
more
often
than
not
carbonation
was
a
little
too
low
im
willing
to
believe
that
this
was
down
to
who
was
serving
but
without
a
bottle
to
hand
to
compare
to
its
not
cutanddried
very
drinkable
perfect
for
sitting
at
the
beach
bar
when
you
cant
face
another
maitai
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
just
shy
of
a
medium
body
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
beer
is
definately
a
good
lawnmower
beer
i
drank
nearly
two
of
these
in
the
time
it
took
to
write
the
review
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
again
this
beer
starts
out
very
average
in
appearance
and
smell
its
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
a
very
thin
head
the
smell
is
grainyalcohol
that
you
get
from
a
standard
macro
lager
the
taste
however
is
pretty
good
a
nice
light
bready
sweetness
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
end
but
not
so
high
as
to
make
sting
your
tongue
and
throat
as
some
other
lagers
do
d
the
lager
is
very
drinkable
smooth
with
a
somewhat
thin
finish
not
really
an
exciting
style
but
a
smooth
quaffable
lager
lightweight
with
some
lingering
sweetness
bottle
poured
a
decent
yellow
color
with
a
big
frothy
white

that
was
gone
in
a
jiffy
and
left
litttle
lacing
in
my
duvel
glass
nose
smells
strongly
of
malts

hops
mouthfeel
is
a

sticky
and

a
decent
lager
im
recreating
this
post
from
4year
beer
notes
i
do
know
i
liked
this
amber
lager
its
something
different
among
lagers
it
has
a
bit
more
of
a
tang
than
most
lagers
with
a
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
smooth
and

another
good
brew
from
kona
now
im
sorry
that
i
didnt
stop
off
as
i
drove
past
there
earlier
today
its
not
bad
but
not
good
either
very
mild
boring
even
an
average
lager
thats
all
nicely
carbonated
light
mouthfeel
to
this
one
easy
drinking
and
smooth
definately
one
to
offer
your
bmc
buddies
to
introduce
them
to
some
craft
beer
allmalt
all
the
time
i
saw
this
in
the
safeway
on
oahu
while
on
a
trip
there
recently
i
had
heard
of
kona
brewing
but
hadnt
tried
any
of
their
products
this
was
definitely
a
good
decision
though
i
now
know
i
should
have
gone
for
the
ale
nice
yellow
to
cloudy
amber
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
all
malt
in
the
nose
and
when
the
beer
hits
your
mouth
its
refrain
all
malt
all
the
time
rich
flavorful
malt
though
just
a
tad
bit
cloying
toward
the
end
which
dropped
it
a
bit
on
my
drinkability
scale
when
in
rome
i
believe
in
enjoying
the
local
beers
when
possible
and
this
was
definitely
a
worthy
aquisition
well
worth
seeking
and
tryingand
available
on
the
us
west
coast
i
understand
an
average
beer
would
be
good
to
wash
down
a
sandwich
at
lunchtime
on
a
college
football
saturday
dont
go
crazy
trying
to
find
one
but
if
you
are
making
a
mixed
six
pack
throw
one
in
to
try
mad
thanks
to
eclipsehts
part
of
our
trade
nice
thick
head
with
good
retention
gives
this
a
high
score
for
appearance
all
other
measures
are
a
little
above
average
nice
and
malty
not
much
hops
flavor
except
for
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
easy
drinking
lager
overall
a
nice
allmalt
lager
i
think
this
style
as
a
whole
is
much
underappreciated
this
beer
pours
clear
golden
a
very
clean
pure
lager
look
there
is
light
head
retention
on
the
crisp
white
head
and
light
occasional
lacing
the
smell
is
bright
and
malty
with
some
fruity
and
grassy
notes
the
flavor
is
all
caramel
and
fruity
very
traditional
lager
taste
but
clearly
all
malt
no
adjuncts
here
this
is
a
throwback
to
the
early
allmalt
lagers
of
the
mid
nineteenth
century
unites
states
the
nondescript
bittering
hops
just
barely
outlast
the
malty
sweetness
for
a
medium
length
finish
this
is
a
very
clean
very
drinkable
lager
this
beer
had
a
nice
bit
of
substance
to
it
and
seemed
adjunctfree
an
interesting
and
rather
unusual
fruityness
popped
up
in
the
hops
at
the
front
and
the
beer
finished
almost
too
cleanly
as
it
warmed
a
bit
a
more
traditional
malt
and
hops
flavor
profile
came
through
and
some
lingering
bitterness
emerged
more
character
than
one
ususally
finds
in
a
lager
overall
this
was
drinkable
since
it
lacked
flavor
and
substance
very
macro
lager
style
that
being
said
ive
had
this
many
times
in
a
bottle
and
while
i
never
liked
it
much
it
was
better
than
this
version
on
tap
as
i
contemplated
my
order
upon
another
bartenders
recommendaiton
i
thought
what
do
hawaiians
really
know
about
beer
apparently
a
little
bit
this
beer
proved
quite
nice
though
typical
in
a
base
pale
malt
beer
the
coler
is
an
improved
strong
straw
with
fair
head
retention
and
carbonation
aromas
are
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
fruit
modestly
sweet
with
pilsner
grains
an
exotic
fruit
flavor
made
things
interesting
mangos
pineapples
appricots
and
kiwi
all
the
while
retaining
a
firm
creaminess
and
consistency
the
beer
fared
well
even
down
to
my
last
sip
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
yet
fullbodied
this
is
the
second
kona
beer
i
have
had
and
while
its
not
as
good
as
the
pale
ale
its
still
a
solid
brew
from
the
islands
mahalo
lightmedium
in
body
moderately
mild
in
the
alcohol
dept
it
has
a
smooth
creamish
mouthfeel
and
could
be
a
good

here
longboard

there
is
a
hop
presence
as
well
a
very
tasty

lager
a
huge
leap
upwards
in
flavor
from
your
typical
macro
lager
this
beer
is
all
about
sweet
malts
light
and
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
hops
fairly
light
in
the
aroma
stronger
in
the
flavor
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
amazing
but
enjoyable
dnot
bad
but
its
more
heavy
than
i
like
my
lagers
still
id
have
another
if
offered
pretty
drinkable
a
little
more
fruitiness
would
help
not
a
bad
lager
tastes
like
i
remember
from
9501
when
i
lived
a
decent
drinker
nothing
special
drinkability
nothing
to
reach
for
here
i
thought
a
simple
lager
would
provide
a
light
crisp
refreshing
beer
but
this
just
didnt
fit
the
bill
go
elsewhere
this
beer
would
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
the
flavor
is
not
aggressive
i
doubt
i
will
buy
it
again
there
are
just
too
many
good
beers
around
that
are
better
a
big
thanks
to
my

always
pick
me
up
something
from

they
make

definitely
recommend
this
i
finally
got
to
taste
a
beer
from
hawaii
ive
been
waiting
on
this
one
for
quite
sometime
luckily
they
carried
it
at
the
bevmo
in
oakland
the
onlt
kind
of
bad
thing
was
that
it
was
sold
only
in
6ers
which
did
turn
out
to
be
a
good
thing
i
think
one
of
the
main
highlights
of
this
brew
was
the
appearance
it
had
a
white
head
that
was
super
duper
fluffy
which
had
pretty
good
retention
the
body
was
a
clean
golden
straw
color
the
smell
wasnt
too
bad
either
i
had
had
elements
of
strong
floral
hops
up
front
with
tropical
fruits
and
a
malty
finish
the
taste
wasnt
great
but
it
wasnt
too
bad
either
it
was
sweet
semihoppy
with
a
lighter
taste
of
malts
in
the
finish
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
at
first
but
then
as
it
warmed
up
it
mellowed
out
a
bit
i
could
stand
for
a
bit
more
hopping
for
my
personal
taste
but
as
a
regular
drinkin
beer

only
a
dissapointing
fizzle
smell
is
of
light
roasted
apples
and
grain
a
light
sweet
malts
lingers
almost
unoticed
taste
is
sticky
with
molasses
and
fruitness
has
a
light
malt
blast
that
makes
it
medium

5medium
gold
color
grainy
malt
with
some
mild
earthy
and
leafy
hop
notes
the
body
is
firmly
medium
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
leaves
it
gently
crisp
and
then
lightly
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
rich
for
the
style
d
all
around
great
refreshing
lager
that
is
nice
on
a
warmer
day
in
wi
bland
and
boring
not
worth
seeking
out
again
my
go
to
when
i
want
something
light
and
crisp
very
nice
great
beer
with
a
clean
taste
this
is
my
wifes
favorite
beer
in
the
winter
i
brew
a
clone
of
it
for
her
and
play
with
the
hops
a
bit
to
mess
with
her
just
finished
off
the
last
one
a
very
good
simple
beer
that
is
what
it
is
lucky
to
have
new
glarus
in
wi
o
a
very
good
refreshing
lager
i
could
drink
this
all
day
ok
so
this
rating
is
for
the
style
not
necessarily
the
overall
beer
the
beer
itself
is
actually
very
tasty
and
smooth
which
one
would
expect
but
for
this
style
i
have
yet
to
try
another
than
comes
even
close
new
glarus
is
one
of
the
best
and
least
appreciated
breweries
in
the
country
overall
a
great
converter
for
bmc
drinkers

a
smooth
easy
drinking
lager
with
an
awesome
balance
of
flavors
pale
hay
colored
with
a
decent
amount
of
lace
grainy
aroma
with
a
fair
amount
of
hop
spiciness
more
hopping
than
the
typical
macro
but
still
much
less
than
your
average
german
lager
light
body
and
carbonation
smooth
and
clean
from
start
to
end
but
much
of
the
flavor
fades
at
the
finish
a
really
good
find
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
but
pleasantly
surprised
would
be
easy
drinking
on
a
hot
day
bottle
at
the
hotel
bar
in
wisconsin
the
beer
is
mostly
clear
and
has
a
straw
yellow
body
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
the
expected
aromas
of
malt
grain
cereal
like
notes
pretty
clean
and
refreshing
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
a
large
step
up
from
the
ubiquitous
macro
crap
that
floods
our
culture
like
a
mudslide
avalanche
from
the
darkest
depths
of
dantes
inferno
anyhow
this
is
light
on
the
palate
and
simple
a
straightforward
easy
drinking
beer
ok

a

slight

tastes
of

little

a

overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
4
new
glarus
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
your
brews
just
wish
i
had
better
access
to
them
poured
my
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
and
had
a
clear
straw
gold
with
a
short
white
head
the
aroma
had
a
mix
of
doughy
toast
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
clean
light
caramel
malts
step
forward
in
the
flavor
with
a
subtle
hop
balance
the
beer
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
is
by
no
means
thick
its
a
tasty
golden
malty
lagera
type
of
beer
thats
hard
to
come
by
and
new
glarus
does
an
excellent
job
o
totally
naked
dan
carey
is
letting
his
skill
hangout
for
everyone
too
see
and
as
their
track
record
might
suggest
its
a
pretty
big
skill
but
i
feel
his
skill
as
a
brewer
is
just
about
all
totally
naked
has
going
for
it
because
theres
little
about
this
beer
thats
otherwise
interesting
as
they
say
this
is
beer
at
its
most
basic
completely
free
of
any
sort
of
flaw
but
also
lacking
much
of
any
reason
to
drink
it
i
feel
just
a
vehicle
for
introducing
alcohol
to
the
blood
stream
totally
naked
along
side
spotted
cow
are
two
perfect
beers
to
draw
the
big
beer
drinkers
into
craft
totally
naked
isnt
a
bad
beer
pretty
good
as
a
matter
of
fact
especially
when
taking
into
consideration
the
style
its
overall
clean
but
rather
boring
basically
its
a
step
toward
craft
before
even
spotted
cow
you
have
to
crawl
before
you
walk
crisp
and
refreshing
but
the
taste
is
fairly
bland
and
isnt
anything
special
too
many
hints
of
bread
flavor
for
my
liking
i
picked
up
a
mix6
of
new
glarus
on
a
family
trip
to
wisconsin
dells
and
totally
naked
was
a
good
representation
of
the
6pack
good
but
not
great
and
that
isnt
my
illinois
bias
showing
as
i
really
wanted
to
like
their
beer
overall
wow
i
usually
avoid
this
style
but
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
ultimately
it
tastes
like
a
homebrewer
brewed
a
better
macro
lager
without
rice
solids
i
like
a
basic
american
pale
ale
done
well
a
clean
refreshing
lager
is
not
always
the
easiest
style
to
find
from
a
brewery
that
is
not
a
macro
it
is
bland
but
refreshing
and
lacks
any
real
flawsdetractors
just
an
easydrinking
lager
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
effortlessly
drinkable
not
a
brew
or
style
with
a
lot
of
flair
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
worth
checking
out
o
an
excellent
helles
style
lager
ill
definitely
buy
more
when
i
go
back
to
wisconsin
o
super
easy
to
drink
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
its
a
good
american
pale
lager
as
i
mentioned
above
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
hwever
this
one
was
decent
and
easy
to
drink
i
pefer
this
others
in
the
genre
but
definitely
not
a
go
to
beer
overall
new
glarus
continues
to
knock
it
out
of
the
park
with
many
styles
that
other
breweries
ignore
and
neglect
the
clean
mouthfeel
of
all
their
beers
has
to
be
their
trademark
for
me
what
am
i
missing
98
by
the
bros
is
this
beer
just
a
master
of
its
style
it
doesnt
have
the
impressive
impression
on
my
palate
its
like
3377
on
ratebeer
as
well
i
think
its
a
great
drinkable
american
pale
lager
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
owhile
not
bad
there
is
no
reason
for
this
beer
to
exist
it
is
not
substantially
different
than
most
adjunct
lagers
but
is
sorely
lacking
in
substance
i
could
barely
tell
i
was
drinking
a
beer
new
glarus
is
either
really
great
or
mediocre
this
fits
into
the
latter
category
no
reason
for
me
to
buy
this
beer
again
as
there
are
dozens
of
much
tastier
beers
out
there
overall
one
of
the
best
american
lagers
ive
ever
had
super
recommended
o
very
basic
yet
very
good
and
thats
what
they
were
aiming
for
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
for
me
to
knock
back
o
a
decent
pale
lager
but
a
touch
too
bmclike
for
my
tastes
poured
into
pilsener
glass
strawyellow
pale
visible
carbonation
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
champagnelike
sweet
clear
malt
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
slight
crisp
herbal
hops
finishes
slightly
dry
and
crisp
delicious
and
simple
lager
o
very
tasty
apl
easy
to
drink
very
simple
but
delivers
on
what
it
advertises
mellow
smooth
and
very
tasty
light
gold
in
color
moderate
head
of
foam
off
of
the
pour
i
smell
corn
and
a
bit
of
a
vinegar
aroma
not
too
enticing
the
flavor
is
corn
and
a
quick
fade
away
drink
this
one
cold
for
maximum
enjoyment
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
like
drinking
water
verdict
a
nice
pale
lager
from
new
glarus
light
refreshing
and
crisp
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
summer
beers
and
a
perfect
lawnmower
beer
overall
it
feels
to
close
to
an
american
pilsner
for
me
not
my
style
it
was
good
it
really
was
nothing
too
intense
but
something
thats
easy
to
drink
nice
and
smooth
but
yet
it
holds
back
on
any
kind
of
pungent
taste
it
carries
a
hop
form
but
its
some
thing
youd
give
to
your
uneducated
beer
friends
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
by
any
means
very
smooth
and
to
the
point
nothing
more
i
love
the
new
glarus
brewing
co
and
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
nothing
but
a
safe
entry
by
new
glarus
a
good
refreshing
summer
brew
although
they
accomplished
what
they
set
out
to
do
i
would
never
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
one
clear
light
golden
body
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
fairly
strong
pale
malt
barely
and
grain
base
with
cracker
and
light
honey
presence
nice
hop
complexity
with
sweet
corn
honey
for
flavor
which
is
a
lot
less
malty
than
the
aroma
forboded
light
body
and
moderate
carbonation
and
crisp
finish
d
nicely
done
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
straight
forward
but
fantastic
pale
lager
light
but
flavorful
crisp
refreshing
and
completely
satisfying
a
great
summer
session
beer
as
the
label
states
this
is
beer
at
its
most
basic
in
this
case
thats
a
good
thing
if
youre
looking
to
try
and
expand
your
palate
and
experience
more
maltcentric
lagers
this
is
the
perfect
place
to
start
poured
into
new
glarus
taster
glass
appearance
is
a
pale
yellow
with
nice
clarity
and
gropius
amounts
of
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
behind
tons
of
lacing
née
features
light
grainy
bread
notes
with
notes
of
orange
and
citrus
in
the
background
the
taste
is
malt
forward
with
a
light
refreshing
citrus
quality
nice
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
pleasant
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
not
the
most
interesting
brew
in
the
world
but
certainly
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
would
drink
nicely
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
nothing
flashy
or
wow
about
this
but
an
extremely
easy
drinking
lager
that
would
be
a
perfect
accompaniment
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
night
i
could
easily
put
away
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
solid
drinking
and
drinking
and
drinking
lager
all
day
and
then
some
i
can
imagine
someone
drinking
this
instead
of
a
macro
lager
but
i
cant
see
anyone
drinking
it
instead
of
a
more
flavorful
beer
sure
its
a
session
beer
and
a
pale
lager
but
theres
just
not
much
to
it
minimal
hops
quite
sweet
and
heavy
on
the
pale
malts
which
makes
for
an
odd
combo
overall
a
beer
that
reminded
me
to
much
of
high
school
and
bad
brew
overall
a
nice
pilsner
lager
style
beer
simple
and
light
but
nicely
tasty
and
refreshing
o
nothing
earth
shattering
just
a
really
nice
flagship
standard
lineup
brew
by
a
truly
great
brewery
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
the
presence
of
acetaldehyde
and
the
lack
of
strong
presence
from
noble
hops
both
surprise
me
on
the
plus
side
it
has
a
solid
malt
presence
and
is
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
i
can
see
this
being
a
great
gateway
beer
crowd
pleaser
here
just
a
great
wisconsin
lager
with
nothing
to
hide
notes
nothing
special
nor
complex
about
this
beer
easy
drinking
light
lager
fits
the
style
nicely
and
it
is
refreshing
but
theres
nothing
that
makes
me
love
it
probably
a
comment
on
the
style
more
than
anything
though
a
good
clean
crisp
refreshing
lager
if
thats
what
you
are
wanting
poured
out
as
a
clear
yellowish
gold
color
there
was
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
with
a
white
head
forming
the
aroma
is
of
some
simple
grains
and
a
some
light
hops
on
the
nose
as
well
as
a
bit
of
yeast
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
light
pretty
clean
tasting
grains
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
sharp
finishes
nicely
overall
its
a
pretty
standard
lager
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
this
is
a
straight
up
pale
lager
no
frills
just
quality
basic
ingredients
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
cap
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
pale
barely
malt
clean
on
the
palate
as
the
grains
lead
into
subtle
hints
of
bitter
hops
the
bready
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
by
the
herbal
character
at
the
end
a
crisp
refreshing
lager
that
is
easy
to
drink
overall
a
new
standard
bearer
for
the
style
super
light
and
refreshing
minus
adjunct
very
clean
i
think
this
is
what
light
lagers
mean
to
be
perfect
hot
weather
beer
i
would
grab
a
six
if
i
could
find
it
locally
this
one
is
from
memory
pours
a
shiny
yellow
inviting
and
purest
and
cleanest
looking
brew
ive
had
for
some
time
smells
like
beer
and
not
much
else
the
nose
didnt
invite
further
investigation
but
to
respect
the
style
i
went
for
it
anyway
despite
that
i
new
the
hops
would
be
hard
to
find
taste
is
beer
just
as
it
was
billed
totally
naked
up
front
refreshing
and
not
at
all
complex
thats
it
mouthfeel
was
smooth
light
and
a
bit
dry
overall
a
fine
straight
up
approach
to
brewing
but
really
not
what
im
looking
in
a
craft
beer
even
in
light
of
my
strong
respect
of
ng
beers
goes
fast
id
buy
something
other
than
this
when
turning
to
ng
and
it
still
deserves
respect
and
should
be
noted
that
my
muminlaw
who
isnt
a
regular
beer
drinker
really
did
appreciate
the
approach
so
for
someone
with
a
bit
of
fear
of
the
bitter
bombs
out
there
this
one
might
just
be
grand
4
0
d
taste
was
borderline
4
0
so
i
made
it
up
a
bit
here
solid
all
around
and
super
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
really
pleasant
and
refreshing
nothing
mind
blowing
but
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
of
this
style
to
be
so
very
much
enjoyed
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
bright
white
one
and
half
finger
bright
white
head
light
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
light

and
fresh
cut
grass
on
the
nose
opens
crisp
and
clean
with
floral
and
grassy
hops
which
continue
until
a
crisp
dry
finish
light
bodied
with
a
abundant
light
carbonation
the
perfect
brew
to
enjoy
while
grilling
as
i
did
and
cant
be
beat
in
warm
weather
crisp
carbonation
very
refreshing
if
it
werent
for
that
odd
colorless
sweetness
dominating
the
whole
thing
this
could
be
highly
drinkable
pours

light

some
white
foam

like
beer
but
not

lightly
pleasant

taste
plain
and
simple
perfect
straightforward
summer
beer
well
done
very
enjoyable
simple
lager
will
have
again
o
overall
very
enjoyable
light
and
refreshing
a
good
summer
brew
to
be
sure
im
only
sad
that
i
didnt
have
the
foresight
to
do
a
half
and
half
with
another
one
of
their
brews
to
get
two
women
totally
naked
i
could
throw
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
spring
day
overall
a
good
light
lager
beer
it
seems
like
it
would
go
well
on
a
hot
day
overall
when
i
first
looked
at
it
in
my
glass
i
expected
the
worst
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
simple
tasting
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
just
dont
expect
this
to
win
any
awards
as
far
as
flavor
goes
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
my
fridge
would
always
be
stocked
with
this
particularly
in
the
summer
months
onot
a
real
big
malt
taste
but
an
easy
to
drink
crossover
beer
from
bmc
styles
a
solid
lager
if
they
were
closer
to
nc
it
could
fall
into
the
light
drink
rotation
pours
a
light
golden
lager
color
with
just
a
hint
of
cloudiness
has
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
without
hardly
any
lacing
smell
is
of
apples
and
pears
a
light
fruity
aroma
is
the
most
prevelant
i
a
hint
of
yeast
is
also
present
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
and
very
smooth
with
a
tiny
bit
of
an
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
good
considering
how
light
the
beer
is
overall
it
is
a
very
fine
lager
has
as
much
taste
as
a
lot
of
ales
which
is
hard
to
do
for
a
lager
overall
its
a
tough
style
to
do
right
but
this
is
well
crafted
its
got
a
nice
connection
with
its
european
roots
and
enough
flavour
to
push
it
far
above
other
beers
in
the
style
i
would
love
to
have
a
case
of
these
at
the
beach
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
suppose
every
brewery
has
to
consider
a
concession
to
the
macro
patron
the
challenge
is
to
come
up
with
something
flavorful
and
nonoffensive
and
tough
combination
new
glarus
got
the
nonoffensive
part
right
but
flavorful
not
so
much
nice
bright
and
clean
malt
flavor
with
a
distinct
lean
toward
grain
low
hops
level
is
appropriate
for
the
style
but
here
the
hops
seemed
washedout
at
just
4
25
abv
these
go
down
so
easy
and
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
definitely
pale
a
light
transparent
gold
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
its
aroma
is
light
with
hints
of
straw
and
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
bit
of
citrus
it
goes
down
very
easy
with
little
aftertaste
i
like
this
one
its
light
tasty
and
unoffensive
nice
job
guys
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
with
an
inch
of
white
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
smell
is
fairly
neutral
with
corn
elements
and
a
very
light
floral
hop
taste
is
essentially
bland
and
inoffensive
somewhere
a
halfstep
up
from
a
macro
lager
corn
and
grain
and
some
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
crisp
its
refreshing
and
not
filling
to
me
this
is
a
just
a
step
up
in
flavor
from
the
standard
bmc
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
but
what
it
has
is
a
compliment
to
the
beer
to
me
this
beer
is
for
those
that
want
to
drink
or
be
seen
drinking
craft
but
think
spotted
cow
has
too
much
flavor
o
this
was
a
favorite
of
mine
in
college
when
i
knew
pretty
much
nothing
about
beer
now
i
now
barely
something
and
i
still
like
it
roommate
brought
a
sixer
back
from
wisconsin
pours
as
pale
as
any
beer
i
have
ever
seen
about
a
centimeter
of
white
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
but
not
much
at
all
at
first
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
off
notes
but
it
sort
of
dissipates
now
i
notice
some
grassy
hop
notes
and
a
very
light
mildly
bready
aroma
taste
is
very
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
mildly
bready
as
well
grassy
floral
earthy
hop
notes
but
all
very
light
and
subtle
mouthfeel
is
exactly
where
it
should
be
light
and
refreshing
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
enjoyable
crisp
and
refreshing
do
while
the
flavor
profile
lacks
the
urgency
of
the
better
pilsners
with
a
hop
presence
that
is
too
timid
it
does
not
transmit
any
suggestion
of
corn
it
generally
lacks
interest
with
the
exception
of
the
aroma
although
it
drinks
effortlessly
a
good
but
simple
beer
its
hard
to
do
anything
interesting
with
a
lager
but
its
a
solid
beer
despite
that
notes
this
is
an
awesome
beer
for
the
style
light
to
moderate
in
body
clean
and
extremely
balanced
easy
as
all
hell
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
that
would
fit
perfectly
in
the
holder
of
my
john
deere
while
tooling
along
across
the
yard
o
a
decent
but
simplistic
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
in
the
same
way
that
water
is
highly
drinkable
however
this
beer
is
flat
out
unexciting
and
relatively
boring
i
get
it
people
dont
like
this
style
i
see
it
as
an
extremely
legitimate
one
out
of
dozens
and
this
a
good
example
of
it
o
a
very
respectable
easy
drinking
brew
yes
i
would
buy
this
again
but
for
sitting
around
on
an
afternoon
with
friends
an
excellent
session
style
beer
unluckily
this
beer
couldnt
hold
up
to
a
burger
and
fries
bottle
from
rileys
in
madison
fairly
runofmill
lager
nothing
against
lagers
but
this
is
passable
in
every
respect
except
for
drinkability
a
spot
of
taste
and
a
good
amount
of
retained
head
average
mouthfeel
more
hop
flavour
would
have
helped
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
below
average
carbonation
definitely
thin
also
leaves
a
dry
feel
on
the
tongue
leaves
you
looking
for
something
to
wet
the
palate
with
overall
an
average
brew
just
your
standard
lager
and
nothing
really
impresses
me
or
blows
me
out
of
the
water
overall
this
is
very
simple
but
strangely
enjoyable
beer
no
hidden
complexity
but
no
overly
sweet
malts
rice
corn
or
anything
else
offputting
this
is
far
from
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
this
is
what
every
pale
lager
should
strive
to
be
o
its
an
easy
drinker
not
my
first
choice
when
it
comes
to
new
glarus
but
its
pretty
good
totally
naked
pours
a
clear
golden
color
almost
like
a
champange
with
a
little
lacing
head
but
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
can
be
seen
the
smell
is
slighty
hoppy
but
mostly
has
an
offensive
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
almost
creamy
but
very
weak
and
watery
the
taste
is
weak
but
has
a
nice
after
lingering
taste
really
nice
amount
of
crabonation
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
overall
better
for
this
style
give
me
a
sunny
beach
an
afternoon
bbq
or
backyard
pool
party
with
a
6
pack
of
this
and
ill
be
happy
for
a
while
good
flavor
for
the
style
and
much
preferred
over
many
examples
ive
found
overall
hell
yeah
i
could
quaff
this
beer
back
any
day
any
time
a
simple
lager
beer
that
just
shows
off
enough
yet
keeps
it
simple
and
very
drinkable
o
overall
a
decent
summer
time
hot
weather
brew
id
drink
another
o
not
a
typically
pale
lager
but
this
one
brings
a
nice
mixture
of
flavor
o
ive
seen
posters
compare
this
to
coors
and
now
i
see
why
on
the
other
hand
and
looking
at
ngs
grain
bill
of
2row
barley
nothing
else
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
beer
in
that
its
so
clean
and
has
no
off
character
then
again
it
has
little
character
to
begin
with
impressed
with
the
craftsmanship
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
malt
to
make
it
more
interesting
oa
bit
too
light
and
nondescript
for
me
to
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
but
overall
this
is
a
solidly
made
easy
drinking
post
lawn
mowing
backyard
cookout
i
only
drink
insert
mass
marketed
macro
lager
here
and
is
exactly
what
you
get
in
the
taste
this
beer
is
an
example
of
the
motto
less
is
more
done
correctly
it
does
not
have
that
weird
offsmell
that
bmc
has
but
really
i
need
more
taste
than
this
more
of
really
any
ingredient
and

the

pretty

for

not

i
would

again
i
would
recommend
it
to
a
noncraft
beer
drinker
to
try
and
turn

i
better

not

and
im
sure
that
this
is
one
of
his
best
selling

look
at
the

its
on

all
over

goes

im
not
really
used
to
this
characteristic
among
pale
lagers
d
this
is
a
very
lackluster
beer
better
than
a
macro
lager
but
not
by
much
will
not
be
picking
up
again
it
had
a
pretty
good
head
retention
to
begin
with
but
deminished
as
time
passed
clear
golden
in
color
no
real
distinct
smell
to
it
smells
like
beer
but
not
skunky
tastes
very
nice
very
crisp
and
light
something
definitely
for
the
summer
its
a
smooth
drink
not
acidic
and
not
too
dry
just
a
very
very
slight
dryness
to
it
and
very
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
again
but
it
im
not
in
love
with
it
though
its
nothing
special
i
have
to
give
them
credit
for
achieving
what
they
set
out
to
do
with
this
beer
it
is
definitely
a
crisp
summer
lager
that
doesnt
make
you
think
too
much
and
it
puts
many
similar
american
lagers
to
shame
worth
trying
for
sure
light
bodied
watery
and
moderate
carbonation
theres
not
really
much
to
this
beer
but
i
think
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
who
dont
know
what
flavor
is
to
begin
with
i
think
they
would
enjoy
this
even
over
spotted
cow
quite
similar
to
bud
or
miller
but
without
the
canned
corn
or
metallic
after
taste
this
truly
is
a
totally
naked
beer
ie
no
flavor
certainly
is
quite
sessionable
though
it
is
a
lawnmower
style
beer
that
executes
its
role
quite
nicely
dno
doubt
its
a
great
beer
for
its
style
but
i
like
them
a
little
more
flavorful
you
know
this
is
what
it
is
for
the
style
but
i
can
tell
you
that
that
fresh
noble
hop
character
really
set
this
apart
for
me
and
got
both
the
aroma
and
taste
over
the
average
hump
light
tasty
and
refreshing
i
could
easily
spend
a
warm
wisconsin
evening
with
a
sixer
of
this
d
delicious
reliable
summer
brew
id
take
this
over
a
bud
or
miller
any
day
of
the
week
and
theres
nothing
better
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
while
standing
over
a
hot
grill
flipping
burgers
its
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
its
not
meant
to
be
congrats
dan
carey
you
never
fail
to
impress
this
is
a
decent
lager
that
doesnt
really
offer
too
much
out
of
the
ordinary
its
a
nice
drinkable
lager
but
nothing
special
pours
light
gold
in
a
pilsner
glass
with
a
very
active
body
full
of
carbonation
and
a
busy
two
finger
foamy
head
that
dissipated
completely
four
minutes
after
pour
smell
is
mildly
underwhelming
malt
and
lemon
stand
out
amongst
a
background
of
grain
nothing
that
catches
my
attention
or
stands
out
so
far
taste
is
malt
driven
with
an
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
of
michelob
golden
light
or
any
other
americanmade
lager
coats
the
throat
in
a
way
that
makes
me
think
back
to
nights
gone
by
where
i
would
have
far
too
many
beers
for
my
own
good
i
had
a
feeling
going
into
rating
this
beer
that
with
my
limited
experience
in
the
craft
beer
world
that
i
would
find
too
many
similarities
to
the
standard
lager
beers
found
in
the
us
nothing
i
would
go
rushing
out
to
get
again
m
d
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
finishing
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
quite
high
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
envision
having
in
a
cooler
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
grilling
out
the
low
abv
defines
this
as
a
session
brew
pours
a
golden
clear
pale
hay
fast
bright
white
head
and
ok
bubbling
the
aroma
is
an
all
grain
with
just
a
touch
of
lemongrass
the
taste
has
mild
but
assertive
pilsner
malts
with
just
a
slight
toast
the
malts
really
make
this
beer
go
down
so
well
the
hop
add
just
a
little
smidgin
of
grass
to
balance
the
awesome
malts
a
bit
they
also
give
a
little
gypsum
dryness
to
the
middle
of
this
lager
great
summer
beer
maybe
my
favorite
summer
beer
d
this
would
be
great
to
order
a
full
pitcher
of
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
almost
like
gatorade
with
carbonation
the
smell
is
lemon
grass
and
malt
faint
hops
the
taste
is
the
same
its
like
lemonade
with
some
carbonation
and
some
malts
with
some
hops
very
watery
tasting
i
guess
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
yeah
you
could
drink
a
sixer
but
why
would
you
that
being
said
ng
is
an
outstanding
brewery
with
many
top
notch
brews
they
are
an
a
brewery
for
sure
with
many
of
my
favorites
in
their
style
this
one
is
just
not
one
of
their
best
not
recommended
at
all
drinkability
incredibly
drinkable
refreshing
and
a
perfect
session
beer
a
very
light
beer
golden
and
clear
a
hay
corn
meal
type
yeast
with
a
mild
sweet
not
fruit
esters
really
good
carbonation
extremely
bare
and
simple
thin
body
but
as
expected
a
bit
of
mint
a
very
mild
apple
a
very
clean
taste
but
not
what
of
the
sizable
styles
im
into
to
the
point
of
paralell
tasting
with
a
bud
overall
just
not
real
good
while
its
not
an
amazing
beer
overall
its
pretty
much
the
best
this
style
has
to
offer
would
be
a
good
one
for
the
bmc
crew
d
outstanding
drinkability
great
session
beer
and
one
that
works
on
hot
days
outside
with
a
burger
drinkability
well
i
must
say
if
i
put
this
up
against
any
other
pale
ale
im
not
sure
if
i
would
be
able
to
have
picked
it
out
as
different
easy
drinking
very
much
so
if
able
to
purchase
this
with
ease
i
would
use
price
to
determine
if
it
would
be
in
my
routine
rotation
food
pairing
recommendations
burgers
hot
dogs
pizza
wings
ballgame
food
basically
personal
recommendation
very
nice
beer
for
the
light
beer
guy
that
wants
a
bit
more
flavor
very
refreshing
easy
to
dink
and
would
would
better
as
a
refresher
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
well
for
what
it
is
i
dont
think
it
could
be
much
more
drinkable
just
pure
taste
wise
its
one
notch
barely
above
a
macro
lager
i
suppose
this
is
nearly
perfect
style
wise
but
thats
not
how
i
score
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
spose
but
not
for
sitting
here
watching
tv
overall
id
get
this
if
my
only
other
choices
were
bud
miller
or
coors
otherwise
ill
probably
pass
good
beer
for
the
style
but
thats
not
saying
a
lot
although
i
will
say
this
might
be
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
of
grilling
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
lager
i
think
i
could
drink
about
800
of
these
on
a
hot
afternoon
in
the
fishing
boat
people
tend
to
shit
on
beers
like
this
just
because
of
what
they
are
but
review
these
for
the
style
and
learn
to
appreciate
them
folks
everyone
preaches
macros
have
there
place
but
when
beer
like
this
is
on
the
table
no
they
dont
great
lager
d
this
is
a
rather
easy
beer
to
drink
but
the
simplicity
of
the
beer
makes
it
hard
to
have
more
than
a
couple
drinkability
is
okay
on
this
beer
there
is
nothing
offensive
with
this
beer
but
there
isnt
much
there
this
must
be
what
new
glarus
makes
to
appeal
to
light
beer
drinkers
it
is
sessionable
but
there
are
more
flavorful
options
d
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
it
offers
little
in
the
way
of
complexity
or
character
not
horrible
but
not
great
either
overall
a
very
solid
light
beer
without
much
in
the
way
of
distractions
i
would
have
no
issue
sessioning
this
but
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
depth
to
it
pours
clear
yellow
golden
with
a
light
white
head
that
dissipates
fast
very
clear
in
glass
i
can
actually
see
through
this
brew
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
drank
a
beer
that
i
could
see
through
it
actually
looks
nice
on
first
pour
aroma
is
corn
and
some
hops
not
too
unpleasant
corn
on
the
flavor
there
is
something
promising
in
the
flavor
but
it
goes
away
fast
hops
leaves
that
nasty
watery
grain
finish
in
your
mouth
i
guess
this
is
how
a
lager
is
supposed
to
taste
though
have
to
get
ahold
of
one
of
those
higher
rated
beers
to
know
for
sure
not
very
carbonated
and
feels
like
slime
in
my
throat
this
is
worse
than
drinking
water
because
it
has
some
flavor
in
it
that
i
have
to
wash
away
using
water
drain
pour
i
have
to
imagine
that
this
is
ngs
run
at
getting
a
piece
of
the
home
states
macro
lager
drinkers
however
i
would
guess
only
limited
success
due
to
the
ubiquity
of
spotted
cow
as
a
more
common
ng
offering
thanks
greg
d
well
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
expected
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
but
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
d
this
is
a
nice
lager
one
of
the
better
ones
brewed
d
not
bad
but
not
great
either
one
of
these
is
enough
overall
a
good
representation
of
style
i
could
drink
all
night
very
crisp
and
drinkable
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
thats
the
style
id
have
it
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
better
than
most
macros
for
sure
though
the
aroma
is
not
utterly
devoid
of
interest
but
it
is
close
certainly
there
is
freshness
and
a
little
bit
of
light
malty
goodness
tastewise
they
are
going
for
simple
and
crisp
but
the
hops
are
so
spare
the
finish
so
absent
that
the
effect
recalls
a
lite
beer
rather
than
a
good
lager
i
think
they
accomplished
the
goal
i
dont
actively
dislike
this
like
so
many
macrolagers
but
i
have
a
hard
time
really
appreciating
blandness
when
there
are
simple
crisp
refreshing
beers
that
offer
a
lot
more
interest
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
very
thin
head
and
spotty
lacing
aromas
of
graincorn
are
dominant
with
some
floral
notes
clean
and
crisp
with
noble
hop
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
light
body
medium
carbonation
an
average
beer
worth
a
try
carbonation
is
pretty
high
and
the
body
is
light
to
medium
the
smell
of
fresh
grain
predominates
but
the
hops
come
in
to
clean
things
up
this
is
a
basic
straightforward
brew
very
solid
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
next
time
im
in
wi
as
its
a
great
alternative
to
macro
lager
d
this
is
the
quintessential
summer
beer
light
and
fresh
a
before
during
and
aftermowing
the
lawn
kind
of
beer
and
its
really
annoying
that
they
pawn
these
lackluster
things
off
in
their
otherwise
stellar
variety
12packs
keep
moving
along
nothing
to
taste
here
folks
pours
a
very
brilliant
straw
blonde
with
a
rocky
white
head
moderate
retention
with
no
lace
smells
like
bready
malts
and
earthy
hops
flavour
is
intially
bready
with
a
grassy
hay
like
hop
flavour
coming
through
in
the
middle
and
then
finally
sweet
a
little
flabby
carbonation
is
rather
mild
for
a
lager
of
this
type
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
full
not
a
bad
beer
and
really
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
liked
it
a
little
drier
and
lighter
on
the
palate
this
brew
is
quite
drinkable
as
it
is
very
light
with
low
bitterness
i
could
easily
drink
these
for
refreshment
but
also
to
pair
with
some
simple
andor
very
complex
dishes
pours
a
clear
yellowish
color
nice
size
soapy
white
head
fades
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
beer
lots
of
clingy
lacing
and
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
lazily
to
the
surface
bit
of
a
generic
beery
smell
some
slight
bready
aromas
and
lemon
taste
really
impressed
me
superclean
and
crisp
a
lemony
zing
gentle
grass
hop
taste
and
a
slight
lingering
sweetness
very
refreshing
perfect
for
the
summertime
this
would
be
a
nobrainer
at
a
cookout
and
drinkability
is
completely
off
the
charts
drink
probably
the
best
drinkability
that
new
glarus
has
to
offer
smooth
open
up
drink
and
its
gone
in
a
flash
great
summer
beer
d
this
could
easily
be
my
new
session
beer
but
to
bad
my
state
cant
get
it
very
thirst
quenching
beer
that
can
be
very
appealing
to
even
the
swill
drinking
crowd
naked
couldnt
be
more
accurate
this
beer
stands
before
honest
and
unassuming
its
a
clear
balanced
german
pilsner
crisp
with
a
cleansing
yet
refreshing
hop
profile
the
head
is
white
and
tall
and
leaves
an
intricite
lacing
the
body
is
crystal
clear
with
a
slightly
sweet
malt
start
cracker
like
finnish
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
its
truly
a
basic
beer
a
starting
point
an
introduction
good
with
anything
basic
for
me
thats
mac
red
beans
with
butter
and
pepper
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
moderate
white
color
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
the
brew
has
a
mild
aroma
slight
hops
smell
with
some
hints
of
yeast
the
taste
is
well
clean
best
way
to
put
it
nothing
too
over
the
top
there
is
a
mild
hop
after
taste
light
carbonation
makes
this
thin
body
brew
nice
for
multiple
bottles
on
a
warm
summer
daynight
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
this
beer
delivers
what
it
promises
a
good
clean
basic
beer
sometimes
thats
all
you
want
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
maybe
theyre
shooting
for
a
miller
clone
here
to
wean
people
off
the
macros
and
i
guess
if
thats
the
goal
its
an
admirable
one
all
the
same
this
tastes
like
a
macro
comparing
to
others
of
the
style
it
doesnt
come
out
badly
its
crisp
and
clean
i
just
dont
see
myself
wanting
to
drink
any
more
of
it
bright
clear
light
gold
with
a
fuzzy
lid
of
pure
white
superlight
nose
contains
some
lightly
sweet
and
lemony
malt
with
a
touch
of
cornish
grains
and
herbal
hops
flavor
is
the
same
but
a
bit
stronger
light
bodied
with
a
decent
feel
to
it
totally
naked
seemed
very
mediocre
to
me
pours
a
clear
light
golden
hue
with
a
puffy
one
finger
white
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
some
stickiness
is
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
but
not
much
smell
is
big
noble
hops
grains
and
lemongrass
sweet
candy
sugar
and
malty
goodness
in
the
nose
as
well
a
nice
summer
aroma
with
this
one
light
and
crisp
noble
hops
with
sweet
grains
and
fresh
cut
grass
creamy
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
lemon
towards
the
end
light
fluffy
body
with
a
smooth
feel
and
subtle
carbonation
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
season
luckily
i
have
one
bottle
left
but
i
know
it
wont
last
long
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
during
the
summer
if
possible
hey
new
glarus
how
about
you
distribute
in
cny
please
md
big
carbonation
low
abv
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
would
be
a
perfect
gateway
beer
for
bmc
freaks
i
would
guess
this
is
what
ng
was
trying
for
a
disappointment
imo
from
dan
carey
and
new
glarus
i
am
hoping
he
was
trying
to
reach
the
average
beer
drinker
with
this
brew
aroma
is
grainy
earthy
and
malty
which
opens
up
to
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
goes
well
in
a
sunny
day
but
has
very
little
complexity
showing
mostly
a
grainy
taste
that
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
pours
a
crystal
clear
macro
yellow
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
but
just
cant
seem
to
foam
anything
up
smell
is
of
cereal
grains
delicate
fruit
and
is
slightly
spicy
the
taste
is
certainly
naked
as
the
name
would
imply
mostly
pale
malts
light
hop
background
very
grainy
and
slightly
dry
smooth
mouthfeel
leaning
towards
crisp
a
good
summer
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
exceptional
if
you
want
a
simple
summer
beer
that
wont
scare
people
away
this
is
certainly
better
than
american
macrolagers
you
get
simple
flavors
without
the
defects
of
cheap
crap
beer
not
bad
but
not
real
good
either
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
simple
brew
hence
the
name
with
a
character
that
lacks
in
overall
solidity
the
finished
brew
comes
out
a
bit
flabby
without
anything
holding
it
together
still
if
youre
sweating
and
need
some
refreshment
a
bottle
of
this
will
totally
fit
the
bill
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
just
a
bit
too
light
and
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
tastes
da
decent
lager
but
truly
as
the
bottle
states
beer
at
its
most
basic
but
i
feel
like
the
skimped
on
everything
except
natural
fresh
spring
water
this
is
my
second
go
at
totally
naked
i
like
it
more
than
the
first
try
but
its
still
my
least
favorite
offering
thus
far
from
new
glarus
no
problem
since
they
have
plenty
other
superior
offerings
i
can
honestly
seeing
myself
putting
back
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
saturday
afternoon
or
after
a
long
evening
biking
im
betting
this
is
a
great
warm
weather
brew
ya
know
the
time
of
year
when
its
warm
enough
to
get
totally
naked
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
poured
a
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
smell
is
a
very
faint
sweet
malt
aroma
taste
is
dry
malt
backbone
with
slight
hop
flavor
light
body
and
easy
to
drink
avery
good
beer
for
a
day
at
the
beach
in
the
summer
heat
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
nice
malt
and
saaz
hops
in
the
taste
a
nice
dry
malt
and
a
balanced
small
hop
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
malt
pilsner
like
aftertaste
malty
pilsner
session
like
pretty
good
d
miller
bud
and
coors
need
to
take
notes
this
is
what
a
lighter
beer
should
taste
like
this
is
a
great
beer
use
to
deglaze
with
make
a
nice
chicken
sauce
the
body
is
not
exactly
big
but
definitely
not
crisp
the
carbonation
helps
overall
rather
simple
i
know
its
easy
to
blame
style
but
really
this
could
be
much
better
small
white
head
tops
off
and
quickly
abandons
a
pale
strawgold
body
small
malt
presence
on
the
nose
hint
of
floral
clean
lager
malt
taste
bits
of
hop
come
in
and
out
thin
to
medium
mouth
not
bad
for
what
it
is
basic
american
lager
much
better
than
your
canned
lager
but
nothing
amazing
overall
this
style
isnt
one
that
is
supposed
to
overwhelm
the
senses
so
i
am
judging
it
on
the
that
i
enjoyed
this
it
was
extremely
refreshing
i
enjoyed
it
a
good
call
i
guess
if
it
is
the
only
thing
available
besides
bud
light
overall
a
very
good
beer
for
the
warmer
weather
around
the
barbque
very
much
a
lawn
mower
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
complex
brew
that
you
can
stare
at
in
amazement
this
is
not
it
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
you
grab
when
you
are
thirsty
standing
around
a
garage
looking
a
car
or
just
something
to
drink
while
you
are
doing
something
active
like
softball
or
ping
pong
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
those
who
want
a
macrobrew
but
have
a
couple
extra
bucks
or
a
macro
chip
on
thier
shoulder
its
a
good
lawnmower
picnic
porch
hanging
or
session
brew
drinkability
is
good
of
course
as
this
is
an
assuming
light
crisp
unoffensive
wellmade
beer
its
just
not
overly
exciting
despite
being
solid
and
clearly
made
with
more
love
than
your
average
macro
not
the
best
by
new
glarus
but
im
not
sure
thats
the
intent
hey
go
for
it
if
you
want
to
session
like
hell
with
a
wellmade
lager
drinkability
is
excellent
for
this
smooth
and
flavorful
light
lager
bottle
courtesy
of
monger
poured
a
golden
color
beer
with
a
big
pure
white
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
is
quite
weak
with
no
noticeable
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
malt
which
at
least
is
pure
malt
and
not
some
kind
of
adjunct
carbonation
is
medium
with
a
nice
body
i
understand
they
wanted
to
brew
something
light
but
this
is
a
bit
too
light

i
suggest
sticking
to
the
yokel
if
you
want
a
refreshing
lager

about

really

really
went
well
with
the
90

here
in
texas
while
cooking
on
the
grill
glad
to
have
brought
back
a
sixer
and
looking
forward
to
the
other
new
glarus
offerings
i
have
i
could
drink
this
all
night
an
excellent
highly
sessionable
simple
summer
lager
very
clean
refreshing
and
approachable
complex
in
its
simplicity
and
in
its
own
way
this
simple
well
made
and
tasty
lager
is
as
much
a
testament
to
the
brewing
skill
of
dan
carey
as
the
more
sought
after
new
glarus
offerings
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
i
poured
this
bottled
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
had
a
really
nice
foamy
head
that
lasted
it
has
a
very
nice
goldenstraw
color
it
doesnt
have
too
much
carbonation
which
i
prefer
and
tastes
very
good
for
its
style
because
of
the
mouthfeel
and
pleasant
taste
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
d
high
smoothness
and
clean
crisp
flavor
make
for
a
highly
drinkable
beer
the
apple
and
pear
linger
in
the
taste
but
the
malt
is
dominant
however
the
malt
taste
doesnt
linger
or
stick
which
is
good
in
my
opinion
leads
to
a
very
nice
finish
and
drinkability
semi
crisp
refreshing
some
might
find
the
sweetness
a
tad
excessive
but
i
like
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
for
its
style
and
is
truly
a
work
of
great
craftsmanship
cool
and
somewhat
refreshing
this
is
another
above
average
effort
from
new
glarus
drinkability
a
decent
lager
good
execution
of
the
style
the
lighter
less
full
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
could
be
great
on
a
hot
day
a
totally
naked
review
for
a
totally
naked
beer
the
pour
aroma
flavors
finish
and
mouthfeel
were
all
clean
crisp
and
smooth
making
this
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
not
my
favorite
from
the
new
glarus
stable
but
that
still
says
a
lot
since
i
believe
that
new
glarus
is
some
of
the
best
around
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
with
an
inch
or
so
white
foamy
head
smell
is
corngrains
and
a
bit
metallic
the
corn
comes
through
in
the
taste
but
with
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
its
a
bit
thin
but
not
bad
overall
theres
nothing
malicious
about
it
its
just
not
that
impressive
i
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
and
light
enough
to
be
highly
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
these
with
some
regularity
this
might
be
a
good
one
to
introduce
to
folks
who
are
macro
loyalists
they
might
be
able
to
taste
some
subtle
qualities
in
this
one
that
are
lacking
in
their
macro
without
hitting
them
on
the
head
with
a
hop
hammer
not
bad
but
not
for
me
to
go
there
again
this
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
the
head
is
twofingers
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
balance
with
malt
and
noble
hops
both
being
present
but
neither
really
shining
the
taste
is
mild
and
lacking
of
anything
memorable
it
leans
more
toward
the
malty
side
of
things
as
the
hops
that
are
in
the
aroma
dont
make
themselves
apparent
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
and
has
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
however
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
soft
lager
i
would
choose
something
else
like
weihenstephaner
original
instead
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
was
glad
that
i
bought
an
extra
six
pack
of
it
it
poured
a
light
clear
hue
with
a
small
bubbly
head
it
smelled
of
malts
yeast
maybe
even
a
little
caramel
i
had
trouble
putting
my
finger
on
a
few
of
the
scents
it
tasted
of
sweet
maltiness
caramel
and
overall
very
smooth
and
sweet
it
was
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
the
best
from
new
glarus
by
far
definatly
worth
trying
however
even
though
i
dont
remember
too
much
about
spotted
cow
i
had
spotted
cow
flashbacks
while
drinking
this
beer
theyre
both
sweet
and
simple
and
probably
fly
off
the
shelves
up
there
in
the
badger
state
naked
beer
sounds
like
a
good
idea
but
a
trip
to
the
hop
haberdasher
would
spiff
this
one
right
up
and
would
turn
it
into
something
that
i
might
be
inclined
to
buy
again
drinkability
i
love
most
of
the
stuff
made
by
new
glarus
this
beer
though
is
totally
unnecessary
i
hope
new
glarus
sells
this
stuff
to
the
general
public
by
the
truckload
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
a
frequent
quaffer
appearance
is
light
yellow
with
some
white
foam
aroma
is
malt
dough
some
hops
and
spice
initial
taste
is
malts
and
some
hops
best
when
very
cold
reminds
me
of
the
grassiness
of
a
sapporo
or
coors
middle
keeps
a
low
profile
crisp
and
clean
finishing
with
a
mild
simple
beer
taste
a
very
mild
beer
pours
a
light
gold
with
thin
white
head
smell
is
malty
very
slight
hops
undertone
very
sweet
flavor
nicely
carbonated
i
liked
it
but
think
that
there
was
more
flavor
in
yokel
this
just
is
a
beer
nothing
spectacular
just
a
good
drinkable
beer
d
light
and
light
not
much
flavor
and
a
bit
boring
without
being
thirst
quenching
not
impressed
with
this
at
all
has
a
slight
sour
taste
and
finish
malt
lends
some
slight
breadydoughy
notes
but
thats
about
it
nose
has
a
light
graininess
to
it
just
a
bad
aftertaste
on
this
ill
take
a
milelr
high
life
over
this
any
day
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
leaving
no
lacing
smell
is
pretty
faint
flowery
and
a
touch
of
honey
taste
is
of
honey
and
corn
paired
with
the
same
soft
flowery
notes
perceived
in
the
smell
i
dont
think
it
could
get
much
better
for
the
style
medium
carbonation
with
lightmedium
body
great
to
drink
a
simple
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it

thin

slight

malty

no

must
dusting

sweet
taste
some
herbs
and
grasses
very
clean
straight
forward
and
one
dimensional
heck
its
almost
only
half
a
dimension
the
only
purpose
of
this
beer
is
to
throw
it
in
a
cooler
chill
it
to
35
degrees
and
slam
a
dozen
or
so
on
a
hot
day
its
kind
of
boring
and
not
really
worth
6
for
a
six
pack
when
held
to
considerably
better
alternatives
12
ounce
bottle
totally
naked
pours
out
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
husk
with
some
spice
in
the
background
husky
grain
flavor
spicy
hops
come
in
at
the
middle
but
there
is
very
little
flavor
in
the
finish
this
is
even
closer
to
a
crappy
macro
than
spotted
cow
the
flavor
isnt
all
that
bad
its
just
very
weak
mouthfeel
is
thin
carbonation
is
very
high
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
less
interesting
beers
from
new
glarus
drinkability
high
i
will
try
this
every
year
but
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
some
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
a
smooth
carbonation
that
rushes
across
the
palate
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
body
here
but
it
suits
the
style
fairly
well
and
makes
for
extremely
easy
drinking
a
laid
back
beer
that
would
do
well
in
the
hot
summer
months
when
i
want
to
have
a
sixer
on
the
beach
also
would
be
a
wonderful
gateway
beer
for
the
macro
crowd
id
say
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
others
have
asked
and
i
guess
i
will
too
which
is
why
make
this
style
i
guess
they
made
a
version
classic
for
style
even
at
times
possessing
an
adjunct
quality
although
not
noted
as
an
ingredient
it
seems
like
the
light
white
corn
the
name
is
pretty
gimmicky
and
so
is
the
beer
its
a
very
very
pale
gold
color
looks
unfortunately
like
watery
piss
has
almost
no
odor
and
taste
except
for
some
maltiness
the
carbonation
at
least
gives
it
an
aboveaverage
mouthfeel
but
otherwise
this
beer
is
by
far
the
weakest
offering
from
new
glarus
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
nice
crisp
carbonation
easy
drinker
would
be
good
with
a
fish
fry
or
other
non
spicy
food
a
very
basic
well
done
beer
i
talked
with
deb
when
i
was
at
ng
a
few
weeks
back
and
she
said
that
this
was
dans
baby
as
he
was
so
proud
of
being
able
to
make
this
beer
i
respect
it
but
its
not
for
me
pours
pale
yellow
with
nice
white
head
smells
of
bready
malts
and
slight
hint
of
hops
tastes
very
eh
citrusy
hops
slight
malt
but
otherwise
nothing
very
kinda
bland
beer
for
me
for
the
style
i
guess
its
one
of
the
better
but
not
by
much
one
new
glarus
i
actually
tend
to
stay
away
from
dont
get
it
again
bleh
its
an
ok
brew
at
best
and
quite
surprising
from
n
g
to
put
out
something
of
this
nature
appealing
to
the
masses
and
keeping
it
simple
as
to
not
offend
i
suppose
poured
a
light
golden
color
white
bubbly
head
thins
but
never
completely
disappears
aroma
is
a
big
turn
off
with
a
slighty
pungent
unappealing
scent
i
coudnt
really
nail
it
down
body
is
thin
with
a
pleasant
crispness
hardly
any
aftertaste
but
something
seemed
oily
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
and
its
a
shame
because
its
the
first
new
glarus
beer
to
let
me
down
new
glarus
has
such
a
fine
stable
of
flavorful
beers
that
totally
naked
leaves
you
totally
unimpressed
nothing
dazzling
here
but
that
is
not
its
purpose
who
says
a
simple
beer
cant
be
decent

pretty
standard
lager
flavor
but
definitely
more
substantial
bodywise
i
look
to
lagers
for
a
clean
crispness
that
this
lacks
dont
get
me
wrong
its
good

kind
of
like
a

a

pours
pale

with
very
little

slight
hops
in
the
finish
to
counter
the
malt
but
not
enough
to
blow
the
back
of
your
head
off
overall
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
stock
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
little
hoppy
below
average
taste
fizzed
over
when
opened
for
no
apparent
reason
o
ehh
its
a
nice
fail
safe
beer
meaning
if
its
between
this
and
a
bmc
brand
i
would
choose
this
o
not
bad
its
a
refreshing
beer
and
one
to
relax
on
which
was
what
i
was
looking
for
o
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
part
of
a
mix
six
but
this
is
one
i
wont
be
getting
again

a
very
good
lager
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
overall
a
decent
fairly
well
balanced
lager
still
a
little
sweet
for
me
very
pleasant
lager
with
a
super
refreshing
citrus
zesty
perfect
for
what
is
made
for
this
offering
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
substantial
head
and
very
little
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
and
simple
yet
very
appealing
it
is
sweet
with
a
slight
alcohol
bite
the
mouth
is
light
and
smooth
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
very
simple
no
complexity
here
just
an
easy
drinking
american
lager
nothing
id
seek
out
but
not
something
id
turn
down
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
recommend
it
its
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
havent
i
bought
the
12
pack
shock
and
awe
variety
sampler
from
fdb
and
this
beer
was
a
really
good
choice
to
put
in
it
worth
checking
out
for
sure
overall
pretty
light
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
overall
and
i
would
get
it
again
easily
drinkable
o
though
the
smell
is
a
bit
offputting
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
exactly
how
a
lager
should
be
refined
clean
and
tasty
the
taste
has
a
very
nice
hop
level
with
some
gentle
green
fresh
noble
type
hop
flavor
a
good
citrus
zest
aspect
the
bitterness
level
is
gentle
enough
that
the
taste
brings
out
a
mild
malt
element
the
taste
is
pretty
full
for
a
lager
of
this
style
i
expected
interesting
things
but
overall
it
is
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
not
quite
an
india
pale
lager
but
assertive
enough
to
fit
the
pilsner
category
perhaps
drinkable
and
flavorful
o
overall
refreshing
nice
session
beer
or
to
relax
after
mowing
the
lawn
just
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
especially
on
the
palate
this
could
be
a
really
good
session
beer
good
taste
and
light
so
i
could
put
a
hurtin
on
a
case
of
these
poured
to
a
good
white
head
with
descent
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
had
hints
of
hay
and
hop
very
mild
appearance
was
a
golden
straw
with
a
slight
cloudy
look
tasted
hints
of
grain
and
some
grass
with
an
earthy
back
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
crisp
clean
aftertaste
a
lager
will
never
get
huge
scores
on
a
ba
ranking
board
but
when
i
want
a
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
this
is
my
new
favorite
mf
medium
light
bodied
crisp
due
to
carbonation
dry
finish
o
plenty
of
flavor
packed
into
small
drinkable
lager
i
like
the
use
of
rye
and
wheat
here
it
really
gives
the
body
a
full
multidimensional
feel
this
beer
was
somewhat
of
a
surprise
to
me
as
its
much
more
fleshed
out
and
wellrounded
than
the
average
americanmade
sessionable
lager
o
the
light
crisp
pithy
flavor
gets
a
bit
bitey
and
not
very
drinkable
without
other
flavors
to
cut
into
that
bitterness
to
me
a
lager
is
all
about
balance
while
im
not
sure
this
delivers
on
that
fully
its
certainly
not
a
bad
brew
the
hops
are
out
in
full
force
especially
for
a
lager
with
pine
citrus
grain
and
general
dryness
on
the
nose
and
mouth
malt
is
minimal
here
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
overall
i
cant
say
im
impressed
as
the
hops
make
this
a
bit
too
dry
and
dont
give
it
enough
complexity
however
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
a
lager
that
tastes
like
a
beer
rather
than
an
adjunctfilled
macro
brew
give
me
a
wider
malt
flavor
and
id
be
a
happy
man
a
much
better
than
average
american
lager
more
hoppy
than
most
but
this
is
still
no
humulus
nothing
is
though
clear
brassy
color
on
this
one
with
an
inch
or
so
of
fizzy
white
head
its
got
aromas
of
citric
hops
which
surprises
and
excites
me
all
at
once
the
grain
bill
is
light
here
pale
and
crystal
only
no
caramel
gimmicks
here
very
straightforward
as
far
as
taste
goes
cereal
grains
up
front
crisp
fruity
hop
complex
on
the
back
end
a
really
nice
finish
on
this
one
citra
hops
maybe
definitely
some
higher
alpha
c
stuff
going
on
nice
carbonation
too
very
lively
aids
drinkability
light
on
alcohol
too
which
makes
this
a
heck
of
a
summer
session
beer
one
of
flying
dogs
better
offerings
i
reckon
cleans
the
palate
well
too
nice
after
pizza
and
wings
and
the
like
o
long
live
the
craft
lager
i
had
this
one
before
from
a
bottle
it
seemed
much
better
from
the
can

overall
is
a
solid
beer
overall
this
is
nothing
groudbreaking
but
its
a
nice
beer
to
style
im
not
sure
what
else
id
really
ask
for
in
a
craft
pale
lager
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
inoffensive
and
its
easy
to
drink
i
probably
was
a
little
hard
with
the
rating
numbers
here
as
this
is
an
okay
brew
i
wont
turn
down
another
but
wont
be
buying
it
again
either
overall
fairly
mediocre
in
every
department
nice
med
gold
in
color
fair
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
weak
in
smell
and
taste
would
be
good
one
to
have
on
a
hot
day
after
yard
work
cool
artwork
on
can
consistent
with
the
whole
flying
dog
brewery
line
overall
a
really
solid
beer
a
great
addition
to
the
summer
lawn
mower
beer
lineup
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
the
finish
does
become
a
bit
too
grainy
and
bitter
without
anything
to
accompany
it
we
applaud
them
for
brewing
something
that
is
yellow
and
fizzy
in
a
sense
something
craft
beer
needs
a
bit
more
of
as
it
should
not
be
forgotten
a
nice
sessionable
lager
looks
and
aroma
are
the
strong
points
with
flavor
good
overall
if
somewhat
mundane
the
carbonation
is
a
little
overdone
too
but
hardly
a
show
stopper
certainly
worth
a
try
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
pour
a
couple
out
by
the
pool
and
watch
clouds
go
by
refreshing
enjoyable
and
an
abv
level
that
wont
have
you
too
full
if
you
bring
it
to
a
barbecue
its
a
great
enjoyable
beer
and
it
will
do
you
right
i
could
see
myself
buying
it
more
often
if
the
price
was
lower
andor
it
was
available
in
12
packs
it
would
make
an
excellent
hot
daylawnmower
beer
overall
decent
lager
but
nothing
outstanding
o
easy
drinking
pale
ale
lightly
hopped
and
incredibly
well
balanced
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
and
a
6er
wouldnt
stand
a
chance
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
and
refreshing
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
dry
fruity
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
real
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
german
hops
in
the
finish
its
an
easy
drinker
with
excellent
malt
flavor
unlike
the
fizzy
macro
lagers
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
american
lager
there
are
no
frills
just
a
tasty
beer
perfect
for
any
occasion
taste
is

a
bit
sharp
hint

bitterness
it
has
light
sweetness
but
is
on
the
dry
and
bitter
side
its
reasonably
good
but
not
great
and
a
bit
tiresome
too
sharp
to
be
really
enjoyable
alone
as
a
warmweather
or
lighter

beer

good
enough
to
drink
with
easygoing

overall
a
clean
balanced
and
crisp
lager
with
unique
character
although
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
strength
at
just
4
7
and
the
malt
isnt
exactly
pilsner
in
character
i
think
i
would
compare
it
mainly
to
a
dortmunderexport
style
lager
enjoyable
and
refreshing
and
wellbrewed
ive
noticed
an
improvement
at
flying
dog
as
of
late
and
this
is
no
exception
overall
this
beer
is
far
from
impressive
i
did
notice
the
best
before
date
was
about
three
months
ago
and
i
can
tell
this
beer
was
on
its
last
legs
still
i
cant
imagine
it
being
too
impressive
even
fresh
this
one
was
a
nice
and
pretty
refreshing
beer
that
was
a
good
lager
with
a
twist
the
tropical
fruit
flavours
were
something
different
and
a
nice
touch
with
the
finish
quite
a
nice
and
crisp
one
this
would
make
a
great
session
lager
this
is
okay
at
best
too
tangy
with
a
sweet
edge
that
doesnt
work
seem
to
be
a
fair
amount
of
malts
in
there
but
the
carbonation
interrupts
the
flavor
delivery
there
really
isnt
anything
showing
that
is
doing
it
for
me
eh
its
called
underdog
for
a
reason
its
not
a
supreme
lager
o
in
the
acceptableaverage
range
for
this
style
overall
one
of
the
more
underwhelming
offerings
from
flying
dog
lacks
flavor
even
for
a
pale
lager
consider
this
an
outside
summer
brew

only

d
i
suspect
this
thing
was
close
to
its
expiration
date
however
i
dont
thing
this
oxidation
happened
overnight
come
on
flying
dog
youre
better
than
this
pass
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
decent
and
but
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
grainy
its
got
a
touch
of
grass
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
earthy
subtle
sweetness
and
more
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
easy
drinking
very
sessionable
with
a
decent
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
nothing
too
special
but
if
you
like
the
style
its
a
good
choice
overall
this
lager
is
not
very
distinctive
from
the
domestic
massproduced
standards
its
easily
drinkable
but
probably
should
come
in
30
pack
cans
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
im
not
a
huge
lager
guy
and
i
guess
im
spoiled
living
near
jacks
abby
and
all
but
this
was
a
bit
lack
luster
for
me
o
pure
warm
day
enjoyment
i
love
it
id
love
another
and
would
buy
6
great
session
beer

being
so

a
very
even
lager
with

complexion
its
smell
is
a
light
citrus
and
its
body
is
perfectly
light
mostly
clear
with
a
thin
line
hew
of
yeast
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
are
where
this
beer
excels
a
perfect
delivery
of
the
expectations
set
by
the
nose
and
look
of
this
beer
excellen
it
pours
very
clear
yellow
excellent
clarity
smells
like
a
lager
what
can
i
say
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
this
would
be
great
beer
for
the
summer
i
am
not
a
huge
lager
fan
so
please
dont
take
this
review
too
seriously
as
far
as
the
style
of
beer
the
body
is
good
but
i
actually
prefer
beers
that
are
bigger
bodied
overall
i
would
probably
go
for
other
lagers
and
save
some
a
really
nice
american
lager
easy
to
drink
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
fullflavored
summer
thirst
quencher
o
pretty
above
average
beer
not
sure
if
i
would
seek
it
out
was
at
an
afternoon
bbq
in
rural
maryland
and
this
beer
was
there
also
there
was
yuengling
lager
i
made
others
at
the
event
do
a
blind
taste
test
between
the
two
beers
they
poured
exactly
the
same
furniture
brownamber
color
moderate
carbonation
there
wansnt
much
originality
to
this
beer
but
a
standard
if
you
are
looking
for
a
session
lager
no
different
than
other
classic
lagers
out
there
d
not
bad
but
slightly
disappointing
the
flavor
is
just
quite
muted
there
is
no
crispness
i
hope
disappointing
isnt
too
harsh
on
this
beer
it
is
a
very
delicious
beer
but
i
feel
it
went
in
a
different
direction
and
somewhat
failed
in
that
respect
i
also
had
a
gusher
issue
with
this
beer
one
other
flying
dog
i
recently
purchased
had
a
similar
issue
pretty
good
not
the
best
craft
lager
ive
tried
but
a
distinct
cut
above
any
macro
crap
the
noble
hops
and
earthy
yeast
add
depth
to
the
aromaflavour
but
both
seem
too
restrained
in
particular
the
flavour
doesnt
linger
and
falls
flat
as
you
finish
a
mouthful
a
decent
brew
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
yknow
ive
been
digging
on
this
hoppy
lager
style
since
i
had
one
from
cricket
hill
a
while
ago
good
times
so
far
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
good
amount
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
lemon
zest
very
light
lime
zest
flowers
and
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
solid
amount
of
biscuit
in
the
background
for
the
sake
of
balance
frankly
i
think
this
overbalances
things
if
that
even
makes
sense
but
its
still
pretty
solid
the
body
straddles
the
border
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
drying
finish
overall
a
solid
atlantic
lager
i
like
that
name
for
the
style
one
that
shows
that
you
can
hop
up
a
relatively
lowalcohol
lager
and
still
make
it
enjoyable
we
need
more
of
these
overall
a
good
beach
beer
and
one
of
the
last
i
had
leftover
from
my
summer
stash
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
perfectly
drinkable
as
a
session
but
isnt
particularly
memorable
a
solid
offering
from
flying
dog
overall
not
a
fan
of
underdog
all
bark
and
no
bite
d
kind
of
bland
and
one
dimensional
when
you
add
in
the
flaws
of
sulphur
in
the
nose
and
harsh
bitterness
it
is
not
something
i
would
drink
again
overall
fairly
standard
for
the
style
nothing
offensive
here
but
not
great
o
overall
a
nice
session
beer
and
could
definitly
drink
a
few
watching
the
penguins
if
they
ever
come
back
this
year
crossing
fingers
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
another
brimful
craft
can
on
the
crack
i
love
my
life
the
inverted
glug
garnered
a
finger
of
dense

head
that
held
up
in
defiance
of
gravity
my
desire
and
everything
and
everyone
color
was
an
ohsoslightly
hazy
lemonyellow
nose
smelled
of
grassy

i
was
sent
talk
about
a
lawnmower
beer
this
would
pair
perfectly
with
the
scent
of
newly
mown
grass
mouthfeel
was
mediumto
full
with
a
great
saaz
hops
bite
on
the
tongue
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
just
the
way
i
like
my
lagers
get
the
unwanted
adjuncts
out
of
the
way
and
gimme
dem
czech
hops
grrr
woof
im
doing
it
doggie
style
get
outta
my
way
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
with
salads
or
lighter
meals
cris
flavors
of
honeyed
crackery
pilsner
malt
and
lightly
grassy
noble
hops
clean
and
easygoing
with
a
moderate

to
it

pretty
dry

clean
very

sweetness
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
a
little
more

presence
than
its
european
counterparts
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
crystal
clear
lemon
yellow
and
gold
coloring
with
a
thin
white
foamy
head
that
coats
the
surface
aromas
of
toasted
grains
citrus
highlights
and
a
light
floral
hops
presence
flavors
are
hop
forward
with
a
bitter
and
green
character
followed
abruptly
by
a
heavily
roasted
grain
profile
with
a
tangy
citrus
overtone
sharp
light
mouthfeel
that
fits
the
palate
perfectly
the
aftertaste
is

crisp
clean

that
dries
slightly
very
smooth
and
flavorful
more
often
than
not
a
lager
is
a
lager
and
that
is
the
case
here
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
to
frown
at
either
so
pour
a
couple
into
a
large
mug
and
go
to
town
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
meringuelike
cap
light
aromas
of
bread
dough
crackers
lemon
zest
and
faintly
grassy
hops
clean
and
uncomplicated
taste
is
similarly
pleasant
and
middleoftheroad
with
biscuit
malt
toasted
crackers
and
grassy
hops
no
complaints
here
and
the
sixer
will
likely
disappear
over
the
course
of
my
footballwatching
day
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
thin
body
and
ample
carbonation
overall
a
solid
pale
lager
that
gets
the
job
done
nothing
more
nothing
less
beer
poured
nicely
with
golden
straw
color
decent
head
for
a
lager
which
held
on
for
most
of
the
tasting
observable
lacing
smells
grassy

grainy
with
citrus
presence
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
with
notable
hops
almost
too
much
i
thought
for
the
style
but
i
liked
it
i
gave
it
its
own
character
mouthfeel
was
bright
overall
pretty
good
beer
would
buy
it
again
when
looking
for
something
light
but
different
not
bad
i
dont
know
that
a
lager
drinker
would
be
crazy
about
it
but
i
enjoyed
it
nice
touch
of
hops
here
very
tasty
and
refreshing
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
burger
or
sausage
poured
the
last
bit
to
deglaze
a
pan
of
hot
italian
pork
sausage
and
it
complimented
the
flavor
very
nicely
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
i
would
get
again
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
some
of
the
other
offerings
associated
with
summer
this
was
a
great
first
beer
to
put
in
a
can
from
flying
dog
its
fairly
hoppy
for
a
pale
lager
but
that
just
gives
it
some
extra
crisp
quaffability
that
pairs
up
nicely
with
that
already
smooth
lager
body
this
is
a
great
one
to
take
on
the
go
with
you
especially
in
the
summertime
overall
more
bitter
than
a
typical
pale
lager
but
im
not
surprisedflying

seems
to
specialize
in
hoppy

very

on

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
in
my
opinion
o
flying
dog
has
always
seemed
like
somewhat
of
an
underdog
underestimated
and
underappreciated
in
many
ways
but
this
beer
is
damn
good
crisp
and
refreshing
its
an
easy
drinker
that
can
be
a
thoughtless
slammer
but
still
provides
enough
subtlety
to
be
interesting
when
you
want
to
kick
back
with
a
good
lager
its
very
german
pilsnerlike
the
nose
emits
a
whiff
of
grass
followed
by
a
lemony
feint
the
palate
is
treated
with
a
crispy
layer
of
mild
hoppiness
very
mild
since
the
28
ibu
rating
wont
appease
the
lust
of
the
hophead
cmon
this
is
a
lager
that
said
it
is
one
that
i
found
airy
crisp
and
refreshing
a
superlative
option
on
any
given
hot
day
it
is
your
basic
low
maintenence
lager
style
nothing
complex
no
need
for
any
furious
debate
among
beer
geeks
simply
put
a
worthy
lager
from
a
damn
fine
brewery
not
every
flying
dog
beer
need
be
a
raging
bitch
o
i
opted
for
the
can
over
the
bottled
version
just
because
this
was
what
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
just
with
a
nice
addition
of
flavoring
citric
hops
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
for
a
pale
lager
this
was
on
the
mark
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
craft
beer
in
the
macro
lager
space
that
beats
out
the
competition
due
to
its
taste
a
good
dose
of
hops
provides
a
crisp
bitterness
and
keeps
this
interesting
for
the
abv
this
packs
some
punch
a
great
summertime
thirst
quencher
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
summer
quaff
for
sure
though
one
i
will
skip
next
time
tasting
this
light
lager
this
rich
complexity
remains
throughout
the
tasting
a
well
balanced
well
brewed
abd
extremly
drinkable
lager
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
enough
to
warrant
a
repurchase
pours
out
a
lightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
brief
burst
of
fizzy
head
no
lacing
really
nice
and
strong
floral
lemon
honeyed
bread
dough
nose
and
flavor
the
flavor
has
slightly
more
breadiness
than
the
nose
though
im
quite
impressed
with
the
richness
of
the
aroma
for
such
a
relatively
low
abv
beer
something
i
value
over
the
concept
of
a
clean
stripped
down
lager
the
texture
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
as
it
ought
to
be
the
only
major
improvement
i
can
think
of
is
that
it
could
use
a
lot
more
head
a
soso
lager
from
flying
dog
brewed
to
specs
but
i
dont
regret
passing
on
a
sixer

oa

beer
im
surprised
i
liked
it
as
much
as
i
did
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
give
to
macro
drinkers
clean
crisp
and
light
in
body
flavors
are
a
bit
more
subtle
than
the
smells
sweet
breads
up
front
with
rich
grains
pungent
spicy
hops
take
hold
of
the
tongue
while
sweetening
spices
balance
the
finish
pretty
well
layered
with
complimentary
flavors
tastes
like
a
spiced
piece
of
pumpernickel
but
in
an
easy
to
drink
liquid
form
slightly
floral
as
well
has
a
lot
going
on
for
a
smaller
beer
aggressive
yet
highly
drinkable
very
flying
dog
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
july
12
2012
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
shortlived
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
light
grains
pale
malts
pepper
and
a
more
abundant
citrus
lemon
note
the
body
is
smooth
and
light
to
medium
with
some
acidity
the
taster
has
a
short
pale
malt
beginning
that
quickly
erupts
into
pine
and
citrus
zest
the
ending
is
tart
but
short
lasting
a
nice
lager
bitterness
is
more
than
i
can
appreciate
for
style
at
the
cooler
temperature
fortunately
balanced
out
in
time
by
the
malt
o
overall
a
lager
with
some
sour
lemony
funk
edge
a
pale
lager
crisp
well
hopped
with
a
lingering
leave
of
lemon
straw
a
bit
assertive
at
first
but
you
warm
up
to
this
about
mid
stride
overall
ok
but
not
great
hops
get
a
little
overbearing
malts
are
nice
at
first
but
turn
a
bit
less
tasty
after
a
few
seconds
not
bad
just
not
great
this
was
a
great
offering
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
temps
have
been
in
the
100s
here
lately
so
i
was
glad
i
had
some
of
these
this
is
a
rather
hoppy
lager
theyre
a
bit
intense
for
the
light
malt
character
otherwise
this
is
a
decent
easy
to
drink
pale
lager
with
good
flavor
its
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
lighter
this
should
be
considered
the
gold
standard
of
apl
highly
enjoyable
and
with
a
low
abu
around
4
7
easily
quaffable
othis
is
a
great
lager
its
a
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
lot
of
this
atlantic
lager
isnt
outstanding
but
it
is
a
solid
welldone
and
enjoyable
lager
the
palate
opens
mildly
bitter
faint
but
noticeable
with
a
grainy
husky
astringency
a
moderate
soapy
flavor
again
a
light
malt
flavor
that
is
mildly
cornlike
and
is
stale
is
present
bitter
on
the
finish
and
a
little
astringent
too
this
beer
is
disappointing
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
this
feels
decent
apart
from
the
astringency
of
course
a
touch
of
sulfur
is
also
present
disappointing
a
light
beer
thats
so
lackluster
that
it
isnt
worth
the
calories
is
always
disappointing
an
excellent
craftbeer
version
of
what
in
other
instantiations
is
normally
dishwater
is
it
a
good
style
not
per
se
this
beer
surpasses
others
like
it
and
as
such
must
be
rated
with
other
pale
lagers
in
mind
that
its
good
beer
by
itself
is
one
thing
but
compare
this
to
any
of
its
kind
and
this
is
head
and
shoulders
above
them
beer
is
light
and
bitter
with
a
mild
sweetness
and
nice
finish
i
like
this
beer
and
it
is
a
wet
easy
drinking
summer
lager
with
a
nice
yeast
body
and
a
clean
finish
not
enough
craft
lagers
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
o
flying
dog
nailed
it
here
a
session
lager
keeping
with
the
old
school
no
frills
lager
beer
that
remains
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
but
definitely
exhibits
quality
with
every
sip
o
flying
dog
has
done
a
good
job
of
stepping
their
game
up
lately
and
this
is
a
very
solid
if
not
quite
exceptional
lager
thats
a
big
improvement
over
tire
bite
which
this
replaces
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
ill
gladly
chug
this
one
down
while
picking
crabs
o
nice
session
beer
not
too
complex
but
refreshing
and
better
than
your
average
lager

for

ill
be
stocking
up
on
some
more
overall
again
flying
dog
impressed
me
with
making
a
pretty
nice
lager
those
who
compare
it
to
bmc
have
had
one
too
many
o
better
than
a
us
macro
only
because
of
the
hops
florals
and
bitters
and
more
like
a
macro
light
with
strong
hops
bitters
sitting
on
my
deck
in
the
woods
and
reviewing
beers
somebody
pinch
me
overall
a
much
more
flavorful
version
of
an
american
lager
than
most
good
session
beer
o
a
very
impressive
all
malt
lager
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
the
best
from
flying
dog
in
a
while
o
better
than
most
light
lagers
but
is
slightly
off
from
being
good
a
decent
brew
with
some
fruity
tastes
enjoyed
this
one
on
a
summer
day
overall
a
far
better
lagerpilsner
than
i
expected
holds
its
own
against
german
lagers
overall
nothing
crazy
here
but
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
and
one
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
could
be
a
bit
crisper
and
exciting
maybe
a
touch
more
carbonation
on
the
tongue
either
way
id
say
give
it
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
decent
spring
or
summer
beer
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
clear
light
golden
with
a
large
fluffy
crown
that
settled
ever
so
slowly
leaving
multiple
broken
chunks
of

behind

toasted

lightly
sweet
caramel
malts
in

not
a

wich
to
me
is
a
good
thing
toasted
bready
malt
with
some
herbal

notes
on
the
palateagain
mild

and
iron
finish
out
the
flavor
profile
this
is
a
damn
nice
lager
hereiam
gonna
be
drinking
this
on
monday
while
out
grilling
o
this
is
a
great
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
beer
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
at
a
summer
picnic
or
as
a
lawnmower
beer
especially
since
it
is
also
available
in
cans
overall
i
was
happily
surprised
by
this
beer
i
would
be
glad
to
quaff
it
again
and
again
if
your
in
baltimore
you
need
to
have
this
with
steamed
crabs
solid
lager
light
perfect
for
summer
spicy
as
well
really
liked
this
one
overall
great
solid
lager
here
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
but
just
sort
of
simple
and
done
well
quite
enjoyable
actually
could
see
myself
having
many
of
these
very
drinkable
i
will
get
this
again
for
summertime
drinking
highly
quaffable
great
example
of
what
this
style
can
be
most
are
adjuct
laden
messes
o
a
pretty
good
lager
actually
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
i
love
all
of
the
american
lagers
on
the
shelves
these
days
this
one
is
solid
bitter
grassy
hops
with
some
herb
and
black
pepper
malt
is
neutral
and
clean
so
is
the
yeast
sessionable
and
great
for
a
summer
bbq
with
a
mixed
crowd
i
wish
we
were
getting
the
cans
of
this
lighter
body
with
carbonation
providing
a
nice
lift
alcohol
is
hidden
well
more
character
particularly
bitterness
than
what
i
thought
there
would
be
nice
overall
crisp
and
clean
with
a
sharp
bite
in
the
finish
not
as
painful
as
the
bite
occurring
in
the
artwork
below
see
the
can
on
the
far
left
youve
got
to
hand
it
to
flying
dog
for
putting
this
one
in
cans
it
should
be
a
great
summer
brew
and
one
that
should
appeal
to
the
masses
so
if
youve
got
some
folks
who
are
lager
drinkers
and
arent
ready
for
anything
else
see
if
theyll
give
this
one
a
shot
its
certainly
several
steps
up
from
some
of
those
industrial
cans
filling
a
lot
of
summertime
coolers
pours
a
brilliant
pale
golden
color
with
a
bright
white
thicket
of
head
forming
so
nicely

has
a
nice

this
is
the
best

beer
around
right
now
light
refreshing
about
the
same
alcohol
content
as
a
bud
light
with
actual
hop
flavor
and
bready

i
fully
approve
of
the
sessionable
alcohol
level
the
label
is
a
bit
weird
as
smaller
dog
sitting
on
a
barrel
trying
to
bite
some
balls
hanging
down
from
a
bigger
dog
what
the
hell
is
ralph
steadman
drawing
i
dont
know
about
the
art
on
the
label
but
the
art
in
the
bottle
is
working
just
fine
excellent
beer
pounding
out
much
drinkability
blended
with
enough
citric
hops
to
keep
anybody
interested
in
the
good
stuff

the

o
i
think
this
may
be
in
my
fridgecooler
over
the
summer
as
i
find
it
not
as
boring
as
most
other
summer
beers
o
good
stuff
for
what
it
is
good
lawnmower
beer
underdog
certainly
doesnt
boast
the
hop
character
than
shines
in
most
flying
dog
brands
but
it
is
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
that
doesnt
command
attention
force
thought
or
provoke
exploration
as
the
brewery
would
likely
have
it
drink
the
beer
and
shut
up
overall
its
a
somewhat
underwhelming
beer
with
that
flying
dog
trademark
harshness
to
it
its
ok
to
drink
but
lots
of
better
offerings
for
the
style
this
is
a
crisp
hopforward
lager
excellent
for
hot
springsummer
days
bbqing
anything
outdoors
think
i
saw
a
picture
of
it
in
a
can
which
would
make
it
even
better
quite
possibly
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
for
an
american
made
lager
beer
this
is
awesome
delicious
its
lager
and
if
you
know
what
this
means
you
know
its
quality
amber
type
of
beer
and
it
tastes
great
you
wont
even
feel
the
5
alcohol
inside
its
that
good
i
love
it
and
living
in
northwest
this
is
one
of
our
most
popular
beer
love
it
my
rating
may
seem
a
bit
overthetop
but
ive
decided
that
in
comparison
with
most
of
the
commercially
produced
american
pilsner
beers
this
one
is
quite
attractive
head
and
shoulders
better
than
a
typical
pudsqueezer
millers
etc
my
taste
for
american
pilsners
has
been
somewhat
warped
by
the
czech
pislner
urquel
which
is
a
magnificent
example
of
what
a
commercial
pilsner
can
be
still
this
beer
is
completely
pleasant
easily
drinkable
even
for
a
novice
fishin
beer
and
in
utah
at
the
liquor
store
it
is
less
expensive
than
average
almost
a
buck
a
bottle
cheaper
than
pilsner
urquel
overall
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
and
decent
lager
it
is
more
akin
to
eurostyle
lagers
than
american
macros
in
flavor
looks
ok
drinks
like
a
bland
smash
without
enough
cascade
to
give
it
some
oomph
feel
wasnt
too
bad
pretty
drinkable
but
overall
not
something
i
was
overly
impressed
with
i
recall
this
beer
being
much
better
than
this
so
i
dont
know
if
thats
from
memory
too
long
gone
or
that
its
changed
for
the
worst
since
days
gone
by
a
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
pleasant
enough
to
drink
without
putting
much
thought
into

overall
a
decent
brew
at

across
it
but
it
isnt
among
my
favorites
glad
i
had
one
for
free
but
this
is
basically
crap
this
is
an
average
beer
and
nothing
else
very
bland
and
boring
but
it
is
what
it
should
be
for
the
style
i
suppose
d

overall
decent
average
american
lager
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
but
there
is
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
that
would
make
me
want
to
purchase
it
again
though
also
nothing
that
turns
me
off
from
it
this
is
just
a
very
mediocre
beer
appearance
was
very
good
pouring
out
a
darkish
yellow
with
a
very
white
fluffy
head
it
had
staying
power
but
with
little
lacing
the
smell
was
a
distinct
barley
which
was
one
of
the
best
ive
experienced
in
a
while
mouthfeel
was
also
good
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
with
no
watered
down
feel
it
was
an
ale
taste
for
a
lager
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
good
lighter
an
less
bitter
than
a
pale
ale
but
with
a
strong
lager
taste
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
i
have
to
say
i
expected
more
from
a
beer
labeled
private
reserve
but
it
will
still
be
something
i
will
be
partaking
of
soon
enough
crystal
clear
gold
with
slight
amber
tinge
head
is
very
thin
and
white
and
disappears
quickly
not
a
great
smell
skunky
oatmeal
scent
very
light
flavor
no
bitterness
and
very
mild
sweetness
would
be
fine
for
session
i
believe
crisp
dry
body
nothing
special
here
might
be
superior
to
some
of
the
macrobrews
such
a
light
taste
that
it
would
be
well
suited
for
the
person
who
says
they
dont
like
beer
wanted
to
try
something
diffrent
a
good
solid
beer
great
color
in
the
not
weak
not
waterd
down
looks
good
in
a
glass
taste
like
yellow
beer
should
taste
like
a
good
strong
beer
that
doesnt
lack
taste
a
beer
to
be
proud
of
enjoy
this
and
have
a
nice
day
d
average
sweet
blend
of
malts
and
hops
to
give
it
a
good
lager
taste
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
i
cannot
say
much
for
head
retention
as
it
fizzed
up
briefly
with
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
but
then
it
dissipated
just
as
quickly
leaving
mere
wisps
in
its
wake
color
was
a
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
evidence
of
carbonation
nose
was
slightly
metallic
with
a
biscuit
malt
base
and
a
grassy
hop
smell
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
about
what
i
remember
from
nearly
27
years
ago
it
was
a
mildly
hopped
grassy
flavor
that
i
first
noticed
in
the
mouth
and
the
finish
had
a
breadybiscuitlike
sweetness
to
it
i
remember
thinking
that
although
it
was
not
something
wildly
different
like
a
belgian
ale
neither
was
it
gaginducing
like
so
many
massproduced
lagers
of
the
time
i
was
not
totally
hip
to
the
difference
between
lagers
and
ales
but
i
knew
that
one
existed
this
was
a
really
pleasant
semidry
lager
and
a
definite
nod
to
the
original
obviously
they
are
not
going
to
cop
to
their
adherence
to
the
original
recipe
but
this
was
a
solid
beer
now
if
they
would
just
start
canning
henrys
the
taste
draws
out
some
grains
and
pale
malts
with
a
good
clean
and
offdry
finish
i
mean
it
really
fits
the
pale
lager
style
but
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
its
just
what
should
be
expected
and
little
more
drinkable
enough
too
grainy
and
no
real
complexity
dime
a
dozen
type
of
beer
o
this
is
a
nice
lager
but
it
really
didnt
wow
me
overall
wateryi
guess
this
is
a
lager
as
i
dont
often
dabble
too
much
into
this
categoryits
very
watery
and
real
basicno
flavor
beyond
the
light
wheat
and
corn
and
it
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
impression
on
the
palettevery
little
experimentation
here
its
just
beeri
would
suspect
that
most
home
brewers
can
make
a
similar
tasting
aleif
you
like
lagers
this
one
is
crisp
and
clean
and
drinkable
but
if
you
are
wanting
for
flavor
dont
look
here1
755
o
nothing
really
stands
out
about
the
smell
or
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
poured
from
a
brown1
2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
and
malts
taste
is
light
mild
some
malts
and
grains
refreshing
but
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
terrible
is
just
meh
overall
about
average
lager
nothing
special
but
decent
overall
not
a
bad
beer
however
it
does
leave
you
wanting
a
little
overall
just
about
average
more
like
a
light
beer
pours
a
clean
deep
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
grains
to
a
small
dry
end
in
the
taste
sweeter
across
the
board
and
a
small
pine
hop
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
and
somewhat
lager
like
after
taste
cascade
hops
and
a
bigger
body
than
a
lager
but
quite
lager
like
overall
smooth
and
drinkable
a
bit
bitter
on
the
finish
but
because
of
the
sweet
spin
on
the
taste
its
a
nice
take
on
an
ipa
that
i
definitely
enjoyed
sampling
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
newcomers
just
starting
out
on
craft
beers
grass
crackers
hay
with
a
crsip
and
pleasant
palate
this
is
a
lager
meant
for
easy
and
enjoyable
drinking
and
enjoyment
good
for
after
a
long
days
work
or
relaxing
with
friends
and
shooting
the
shit
overall
drinkability
i
dont
love
this
style
of
beer
but
this
was
good
enough
i
am
hoping
that
the
amber
and
ipa
are
better
from
this
brewery
o
overall
very
macrolike
in
execution
cascade
hops
were
sparingly
used
a
light
drinking
lager
that
may
appeal
to
the
bmc
crowd
but
got
a
bit
boring
real
fast
for
me
aside
from
classic
lager
appearence
which
i
thought
was
decent
this
falls
off
significantly
thereafter
looks
aint
everything
o
pretty
average
lager
nothing
outstanding
but
not
bud
pretty
decent
lager
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
just
to
quench
your
thirst
it
claims
to
use
cascade
hops
and
i
suppose
they
are
there
but
they
are
very
mild
the
whole
lager
is
mild
inoffensive
but
not
much
different
than
cheap
macro
lagers
henry
weinhards
private
reserve
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
it
smells
like
a
macro
lager
perhaps
a
touch
of
citrus
is
noticeable
tastes
like
a
typical
macro
too
some
cereal
like
flavors
just
a
hint
of
hops
here
actually
probably
a
bit
more
hop
taste
than
most
macros
overall
very
decent
for
a
macro
lager
unspectacular
overall
last
one
of
these
i
drank
had
to
be
more
than
twenty
years
ago
the
bottle
and
label
have
changed
the
beer
is
largely
the
same
perhaps
with
some
minor
tweaks
overall
sigh
not
even
gonna
finish
this
the
only
two
times
i
could
see
drinking
this
are
frat
party
or
when
youre
dying
of
thirst
after
walking
through
the
desert
for
40
days
and
40
nights
with
nothing
but
sandy
water
then
maybe
this
may
be
an
improvement
i
should
have
known
at
the
price
it
was
that
it
would
suck
ill
probably
pound
through
the
other
two
some
night
when
i
can
whip
up
a
few
reviews
in
a
few
minutes
decent
for
the
style
is
the
best
i
can
say
here
medium
bodied
and
smoother
than
most
lagers
by
far
somewhat
fizzy
carbonation
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
great
overall
a
pretty
good
example
for
the
style
an
unexciting
lager
with
little
depth
or
complexity
drinkable
but
not
something
to
get
firedup
about
better
than
their
ipa
that
i
had
despite
the
fact
that
theyre
different
styles
i
guess
its
all
in
the
approach
and
they
approached
this
style
admirably

here
pretty

overall
a
very
good

that
really
isnt
a
huge
leap
over
the
macros
but
definitely
wont
be
confused
with
them
when
somebody
tries
one
a
good
cold
weather
beer
that
ill
buy
again
at
the
5
99
price
for
a
6er
btw
drank
3
of
these
with
my
nachos
and
they
went
great
together
easy
drinking
all
the
way
from
notes
bottle
into
beer
mug
nice
golden
appearance
with
lacing
here
and
there
when
swirled
but
not
that
great
looking
nose
is
nice
probably
cascade
pale
malty
notes
the
taste
well
i
just
chewed
up
two
vs
so
that
made
the
flavor
a
bit
medicinal
yes
have
a
script
for
all
the
baomoves
out
there
who
were
wondering
light
carbonated
mouthfeel
but
not
bad
this
would
make
a
good
hot
sun
brew
i
bought
it
at
a
local
supermarkt
marked
down
to
5
something
it
was
worth
the
price
better
than
bud
volks
taste
is
mild
and
watery
no
sense
of
hops
at
all
despite
the
bottles
claim
not
sure
if
this
was
a
better
beer
before
sabmiller
bought
the
name
but
this
ones
really
pretty
uninteresting
avoid
light
graininess
to
the
taste
a
little
bitter
noble
hops
maybe
a
cascade
or
two
thrown
in
there
high
carbonation
keeps
the
beer
lighter
on
the
palate
the
yeast
or
something
still
stands
out
a
different
bitter
twang
although
this
may
be
exacerbated
by
the
lack
of
a
malt
bill
i
dont
even
know
if
this
is
two
row
this
could
be
six
row
reachin
into
the
old
mans
private
stash
eh
im
always
up
for
a
little
mischief
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
straight
corn
in
the
form
of
both
kernel
and
syrup
and
what
may
or
may
not
be
some
mild
wheat
sad
insipid
smell
really
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
my
suspicions
regarding
the
wheat
are
confirmed
and
the
culprit
is
shown
to
be
pigpenstyle
dirty
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
a
watery
feel
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
sad
mostly
lifeless
little
beer
one
hardly
deserving
of
its
title
id
hate
to
see
what
he
throws
away
i
am
really
putting
time
into
this
review
im
trying
to
be
very
fair
and
aware
of
what
works
it
almost
seems
like
they
took
an
adjunct
recipe
and
pulled
out
all
of
the
bad
elements
but
didnt
replenish
with
anything
good
it
is
not
the
flaw
of
content
but
what
is
missing
this
is
a
safe
beer
brewed
to
appeal
to
the
bmc
crowd
but
marketed
as
better
than
that
private
reserve
what
kind
of
shit
is
brewed
for
the
common
man
then
i
saw
2
other
offerings
from
this
brewer
and
while
i
usually
give
multiple
shots
at
redemption
this
will
not
be
the
case
for
these
guys
astringent
feel
sharp
co2
bite
of
carbonation
fizzy
light
corn
aftertaste
lingering
unpleasant
cooked
veggie
flavors
of
dms
thin
and
fleeting
feel
not
much
in
terms
of
redeeming
qualities
starting
to
feel
a
headache
coming
on
also
a
bit
harsh
and
unrefined
with
the
dms
off
flavors
being
a
dealbreaker
big
pass
on
this
overall
insufficient
on
many
levels
o
this
one
is
just
kind
of
meh
i
mean
its
really
not
bad
for
the
style
but
it
is
also
not
great
either
just
sort
of
a
mediocre
effort
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
or
if
it
were
the
best
option
i
had
ontap
but
i
highly
doubt
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
it
down
again
poured
a
1
14
finely
frothed
white
head
of
average
life
the
body
is
the
classic
clear
straw
yellow
but
seems
a
touch
brighter
smells
of
malt
and
mild
hops
and
less
grassy
than
some
other
bmcs
taste
is
a
light
smooth
malt
very
clean
with
cracker
undertones
and
a
slow
zing
of
a
fizz
easy
drinking
uplifting
satisfying
yet
not
a
big
departure
from
mainstream
lagers
either
decent
note
although
its
apparently
an
oregon
brand
mine
came
from
milwaukee
overall
i
still
have
the
ipa
but
feel
i
paid
too
much
mixing
and
matching
these
for
10
bucks
a
sixer
ow
well
its
not
my
favorite
style
to
boot
3
5
will
try
to
buy
again
in
the
future
12
oz
bottle
purchased
in
a
sixpack
at
market
basket
in
somersworth
pours
a
very
light
yellow
crystalclear
body
with
a
good
inch
of
persistent
white
head
grainy
malty
aroma
lightly
wafts
from
the
beer
grain
cooked
vegetable
and
a
slight
sweetness
comprises
the
flavor
aqueous
body
with
ample
carbonation
fairly
quaffable
not
bad
not
great
a
parforthecourse
americanstyle
pale
lager
worth
the
five
dollars
per
sixpack
but
no
more
not
too
shabby
for
an
apl
id
take
a
few
more
of
these
down
no
problem
taste
is
semi
sweet
with
some
off
flavors
slightly
sour
a
little
too
acidic
definitely
some
strange
off
flavors
going
on
not
sure
what
they
are
but
not
liking
them
not
a
good
beer
even
at
the
cheap
price
for
whats
supposed
to
be
a
lager
to
much
off
fruit
flavors
not
as
clean
as
it
should
be
o
its
ok
a
nice
balanced
beer
a
good
drinkable
american
pale
but
nothing
special
im
not
sure
why
whole
foods
was
carrying
this
the
private
reserve
makes
as
little
sense
as
michelob
ultra
its
a
pretty
label
but
its
all
show
with
no
substance
dont
buy
overall
one
of
the
better
reasonably
priced
lagers
on
the
market
drinks
closer
to
a
pale
ale
than
a
lager
at
warmer
temps
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
pale
lager
would
be
a
good
session
bbq
type
beer
on
a
hot
day
nothing
special
here
smells
like
a
slightly
more
malty
version
of
the
american
adjunct
stuff
bittering
hops
only
and
in
small
doses
flavor
is
fairly
bland
as
well
some
english
style
malts
give
it
a
decent
profile
but
its
rather
watered
down
it
does
have
a
fairly
crist
finish
which
serves
it
well
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
serves
the
purpose
of
being
a
better
than
mass
produced
lagers
but
not
being
too
offensive
to
the
less
adventurous
palate
not
a
beer
id
suggest
to
any
of
my
mates
but
i
might
buy
a
6er
for
my
molson
drinking
old
man
the
appearance
turned
out
to
be
actually
pretty
darn
good
the
lacing
was
really
outstanding
for
a
lager
for
the
first
half
of
the
glass
the
lacing
was
literally
just
one
big
lace
no
wholes
or
anything
on
the
lacing
as
i
got
down
to
the
second
half
the
lacing
started
to
break
up
a
little
bit
but
it
was
still
thicker
than
your
average
lacing
and
it
followed
me
all
the
way
down
the
glass
to
boot
really
the
body
wasnt
very
good
but
it
was
a
lager
after
all
the
lacing
and
head
were
so
great
that
i
think
im
going
to
have
to
give
it
a
4
for
appearance
even
if
that
is
too
generous
while
im
a
fan
of
lagers
there
arent
many
that
wow
me
this
beer
is
among
that
group
but
its
still
very
good
for
a
basic
delicious
lager
with
a
nice
smoothe
easydrinking
taste
with
no
aftertaste
the
pricepoint
at
under
1
for
a
stubby
bottle
is
nice
too
im
a
fan
of
supporting
henry
weinhards
brews
so
i
would
always
consider
this
a
beer
id
gladly
purchase
again
in
the
future

pretty
good
for
a

it

6pack
purchased
for
5
99
at
fred
meyerballard
seattle
on
8292010
found
one
in
the
fridge
while
visiting
family
in
seattle
so
popped
it
open
and
poured
it
into
a
tall
glass
bright
orange
yellow
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
cloudwhite
head
smell
had
that
typical
macro
aroma
flavor
was
pretty
good
a
bit
bready
some
malt
not
a
lot
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
a
bit
watery
but
that
made
this
beer
just
smooth
enough
to
be
easily
drinkable
if
you
like
lagers
then
its
an
ok
choice
but
with
all
the
choices
in
wa
this
beer
falls
towards
the
bottom
of
my
list
as
to
what
i
would
spend
money
on
d
well
it
beats
a
bud
or
miller
in
terms
of
flavor
even
if
its
in
that
it
lacks
the
odd
essences
of
those
macro
brews
to
put
it
simply
high
drinkability
due
to
low
funk
otherwise
its
about
on
a
par
with
them
fits
the
apl
style
pretty
well
in
my
opinion
comes
off
as
a
kind
of
a
light
beer
yet
better
than
a
light
beer
if
that
makes
sense
i
like
it
but
overall
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
a
poor
drinkability
yes
it
would
be
easy
to
put
away
a
lot
of
these
but
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
it
the
flavor
just
isnt
there
d
needs
to
be
a
hot
day
and
a
cold
beer
but
this
is
better
than
bud
or
heiny
without
a
doubt
i
rate
this
one
as
being
good
an
ok
pale
lager
it
leans
a
bit
too
much
toward
the
stank
of
much
more
lowly
competitors
rjt
drinkability
not
the
most
impressive
lager
out
there
but
nothing
too
terribly
wrong
with
it
if
i
may
damn
it
with
faint
praise
it
is
good
for
the
price
but
only
in
the
northwest
d
about
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
you
could
really
session
this
one
all
night
its
very
simple
clean
and
cheap
i
got
a
12pack
for
9
bucks
id
buy
it
again
but
in
place
of
my
usually
quaff
lager
schlitz
nothing
wows
me
about
this
beer
but
its
good
a
decent
lager
very
drinkable
then
last
week
i
bought
a
12
pack
of
hpr
after
having
ignored
it
for
about
a
year
it
is
clean
solid
unpretentious
and
uncomplicated
finishes
well
no
lingering
aftertaste
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
surprise
my
expectations
were
fairly
low
so
that
would
be
a
factor
its
surprisingly
robust
for
a
cheap
lager
and
were
it
not
for
the
slight
lingering
aftertaste
it
would
be
rated
higher
although
i
will
say
by
the
end
of
a
24
oz
can
i
had
had
enough
ill
probably
keep
getting
it
until
the
store
runs
out
of
it
drinkability
quite
drinkable
this
is
another
brew
which
makes
frequent
appearances
at
band
practice
9
for
a
halfrack
doesnt
hurt
either
keeps
you
hydrated
overall
a
very
clean
and
very
enjoyable
lager
incredibly
drinkable
and
refreshing
very
well
done
this
is
the
single
best
session
beer
i
have
ever
had
as
far
as
beers
meant
for
enjoying
with
friends
at
a
bbq
etc
this
is
perfection
overall
henry
weinhards
private
reserve
gets
my
highest
recommendation
its
a
fantastic
allpurpose
beer
with
an
exceptional
blend
of
highquality
ingredients
classy
enough
to
impress
the
microbrew
crowd
drinkable
enough
for
your
next
chugging
session
the
foam
was
very
light
wheat
in
color
bubbly
and
dissapated
quickly
color
was
light
golden
yellow
with
hints
of
amber
smell
had
bitter
fruit
notes
with
an
even
amount
of
hops
and
wheat
taste
a
dominate
bitter
introduction
with
hops
and
barley
balance
and
wheat
undertones
mouthfeel
light
to
mediumbodied
and
not
too
carbonated
drinkability
its
ok
but
better
than
the
mainstream
american
pils
ans
lagers
d
a
great
beer
to
introduce
bmc
drinkers
into
the
craft
world
a
bit
more
complexity
than
what
those
folks
would
be
used
to
but
nothing
overwhelming
on
the
palate
d
while
i
wouldnt
complain
about
drinking
this
over
an
extended
period
out
or
watching
a
hockey
game
at
home
id
more
likely
have
23
of
these
then
move
on
to
something
with
more
character
it
is
refreshing
and
makes
a
nice
summer
beer
it
is
definitely
better
than
the
average
north
american
lager
i
recommend
at
least
giving
this
one
a
try
overall
not
impressed
do
not
recommend
and
wont
be
buying
it
again
pours
a
light
yellow
with
good
head
which
fades
to
a
lace
then
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
some
hop
smell
and
light
hop
taste
little
malt
taste
the
corn
grit
comes
through
good
mouth
feel
for
a
beer
of
this
type
they
used
to
make
this
beer
with
a
hazelnut
flavoring
which
was
interesting
i
always
have
a
hanks
when
im
in
portland
or
d
i
actually
enjoy
this
beer
it
tastes
above
average
which
makes
it
all
the
better
one
of
the
best
ive
had
especially
not
bad
seeing
as
how
a
pait

for
a
sixpack
just
because
it
was
one

golden

that
dissipates
quickly
into
a
narrow
collar
slight

is
musty
barley
with
a
slight
hoppiness
taste
is
primarily
cereal
grains
with
a
bit
of

thin
and
water
texture
not
a
terrible
beer
might
work
on
a
hot
day
sitting
outside
not
recommended
as
a
session
beer
the
brew
taste
a
bit
better
than
is
smells
with
some
decent
malt
flavors
coming
through
but
the
could
be
support
by
a
slight
hop
kick
there
also
a
bit
of
that
sweet
corn
dms
in
there
body
is
medium
light
and
carb
is
fair
overall
this
is
a
beer
than
id
try
again
d
had
this
with
christmas
dinner
at
my
grandparents
house
not
much
better
if
at
all
than
the
big
three
certainly
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
at
the
store
finish
nill
overall
very
good
easy
drinking
beer
why
do
you
continue
to
perpetrate
this
fraud
upon
us
your
beer
is
not
a
micro
or
a
craft
brew
i
know
this
is
not
actually
out

you
claim
this
beer
has
an
outstanding

not

the

were
just

visited
the

a

thought
this

beer
by

the
best
canadian
brewed
pilsner
ive
tried
good
fresh

if
you
like

grab

on

flight
big
strong
dry
biscuit
flavor

mildly
astringent
hops
not
particularly
memorable
but
could
be
refreshing
in

man
that

really
makes
one
think
theyre
drinking
a
rolling
rock
great
beer
pours
with
a
decent

a

is

its
a
decent

there
is
nothing
off
but
nothing
amazing
here
it
is
a
solid
understated
pilsner
the
dry
finish
leaves
a
lingering
hop
taste
in
your
mouth
nothing
overbearing
but
definitely
fullerbodied
than
most

best

other
ratings

for
me
this
beer
is
too
corny
to
be
really
worthwhile
o
crisp
clean
and
light
tasting
pilsner
i
drink
this
all
year
round
sometimes
one
or
two
sometimes
a
good
many
more
o
i
am
slightly
conflicted
as
this
is
really
light
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
but
mild
throughout
very
drinkable
but
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
but
i
would
drink
this
again
thank
goodness
the
porter
light
isnt
very
long
the
aroma
was
very
grassy
with
a
similar
grassy
lemony
or
peppery
taste
balanced
by
a
biscuity
backbone
a
very
nice
tasty
beer
with
a
bitter
base

nice
hop
flavour

little

the

do

a
bit
of
bakers

quite
sweet
for
a
pale

for

and
one
of
my
goto
brews
in
a
pinch
nothing
mind
blowing
here
but
itll
easily
please
the
masses
an
absolutely
fantastic
canadian
beer
this
is
my
absolutely
favorite
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
to
try
the
color
is
pale
the
carbonation
is
refreshing
the
smell
is
intriguing
and
the
taste
is
phenomenal
ive
got
all
of
my
buddies
drinking
it
now
and
anyone
who
tries
it
seems
to
say
the
same
thing
its
an
all
around
awesome
beer
is
it
the
best
pilsner
around
probably
not
is
it
the
best
in
canada
when
compared
to
the
macros
absolutely
pale
straw
color
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
dry
slightly
bready
aftertaste
but
still
refreshing
nonetheless
its
the
beer
that
got
me
into
micros
its
one
of
my
go
to
beers
always
in
my
fridge
from
where
i
expand
and
experiment
with
other
micros
olooks
and
feel
is
right
but
the
strange
flavor
throws
off
its
crispness
very
possible
it
got
like
struck
due
to
the
green
bottle
final
thoughts
now
that
ive
looked
back
on
this
one
it
becomes
clear
that
my
old
can
review
was
likely
infected
as
this
is
the
overpriced
steamwhistle
that
ive
come
to
moderately
like
this
is
a
beer
that
your
macro
drinking
buddies
will
enjoy
but
overly
complex
it
is
not
and
if
the
brewery
didnt
put
such
an
effort
towards
environmental
sustainability
having
cool
marketing
and
being
a
general
comrade
of
the
craft
beer
movement
id
call
foul
on
the
price
its
worth
trying
though
no
question
this
is
very
much
a
summer
beer
for
me
love
the
carbonation
factor
the
clean
crisp
finish
and
the
mild
hops
in
the
aroma
and
taste
a
simple
beer
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
airy
and
light
although
i
really
like
it
in
the
bottle
i
do
not
care
for
it
in
the
can
or
on
tap
as
much
people
rant
and
rave
about
this
one
as
being
the
best
pilsner
they
have
ever
had
well
those
people
have
never
been
to
germany
or
the
czech
republic
heck
even
hungary
makes
a
better
pilsner
than
this
one
however
i
can
appreciate
what
these
guys
are
doing
and
i
give
them
credit
for
changing
hearts
and
minds
the
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
nice
lacing
and
its
got
that
sweet
citrus
aroma
that
most
pilsners
do
it
looks
like
your
typical
canuck
lager
but
it
tastes
much
better
than
any
adjunct
lagers
out
there
this
is
the
beer
you
give
to
someone
who
declares
that
they
will
never
drink
that
expensive
craft
beer

this
beer
is
quite
good
while
it
is
a
bit
sweet
for
a
pilaster
quite
dry
aftertaste
interesting
lager
that
is
tequila
flavoured
has
a
hidden
6
abv
due
to
its
sweetness
and
is
better
than
the
common
economic
lagers
you
find
in
the
supermarket
the
tequila
taste
is
not
at
all
awful
okay
not
really
a
beer
but
given
the
unique
flavor
profile
i
cant
say
it
was
bad
its
yellow
and
has
bubbles
the
aroma
is
funky
there
is
a
hint
of
tequila
in
this
i
think
the
taste
is
like
a
bad
flatish
beer
with
a
half
shot
of
tequila
in
it
it
is
as
bad
as
that
sounds
the
big
can
was
just
as
bad
as
the
bottle
taste
is
too
much
lime
for
my
liking
not
fresh
lime
either
fanta
orange
not
sure
is
there
tequila
but
isnt
that
bad
too
overall
not
my
type
of
beer
it
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
for
those
who
like
this
style
having
said
all
that
i
have
to
say
the
beer
isnt
that
bad
once
you
get
over
the
initial
shock
at
all
the
sweet
tastes
you
do
grow
into
it
and
it
does
become
a
relatively
smooth
enough
beer
to
drink
i
think
these
beers
would
be
a
great
accompaniment
to
a
night
on
the
town
perhaps
have
two
or
three
to
give
you
a
little
kick
in
your
drinking
during
the
night
or
before
you
hit
the
clubs
any
more
than
that
and
im
not
sure
how
they
would
go
down
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
two
or
three
to
be
honest
but
overall
its
a
good
effort
and
i
like
the
idea
of
desperadoes
have
i
found
the
taste
of
the
tequila
not
sure
but
then
does
it
matter
the
beer
has
a
certain
function
which
is
to
set
you
up
for
the
party
or
the
night
and
this
beer
does
that
perfectly
a
good
party
beer
this
beer
is
absolutely
atrocious
bad
beer
with
an
artificial
flavor
watery
at
first
but
with
an
awful
aftertaste
which
should
be
like
tequila
but
is
something
between
detergent
and
artificial
sugar
disappointing
at
best
light
sodalike
headless
beer
with
a
good
dose
of
ginger
disappointed
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
unless
there
are
no
other
choices
this
sweet
tasting
beer
says
tequila
but
really
has
a
very
sweet
agave
and
citrus
taste
to
it
lightly
carbonated
i
served
this
extra
cold
and
it
was
liked
by
most
at
the
tasting
it
couldve
had
something
to
do
with
it
being
over
40
degrees
celsius
at
the
time
but
who
knows
tastes
like
champagne
slightly
sweet
but
poor
aftertaste
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
its
become
one
of
my
most
favorite
beers
originally
tried
it
in
gatlinburg
tn
cant
find
it
in
texas
but
am
looking
overall
this
is
a
definite
pass
the
beginning
deceives
because
the
taste
that
goes
down
the
adams
apple
and
is
left
in
the
mouth
is
very
bad
should
be
good
for
those
who
love
tequila
but
i
was
desperate
after
i
took
it
tastes
like
sprite
or
gatorade
its
not
a
real
beer
appearancewise
it
wasnt
anything
that
started
out
overly
impressive
to
me
decent
head
but
no
staying
power
the
smell
though
was
the
first
hint
that
this
was
special
the
perfectly
mixed
odor
of
tequila
with
the
barley
and
malt
was
so
sweet
to
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
accentuated
the
smell
thick
crisp
and
bold
the
taste
was
what
really
blew
me
away
the
lager
flavor
mixed
oh
so
well
with
the
tequila
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
this
idea
myself
overall
its
a
great
beer
i
am
so
glad
i
still
quite
a
few
of
these
left
overall
when
i
first
moved
to
germany
in
2002
a
mate
of
mine
and
myself
drank
this
stuff
by
the
boatload
it
was
everywhere
in
the
north
and
people
in
their
late
teens
and
early
twenties
drank
it
at
bars
and
clubs
quite
regularly
it
still
is
quite
popular
in
europe
among
young
people
and
i
see
why
its
much
more
palatable
than
some
of
the
grainy
lagers
that
are
readily
available
at
bars
and
for
a
young
person
just
wanting
to
get
a
buzz
without
having
to
choke
something
nasty
down
this
is
a
fine
option
it
doesnt
exactly
taste
like
beer
per
se
but
its
not
trying
to
either
most
people
just
rate
it
into
the
ground
because
its
easy
and
accepted
however
its
certainly
decent
for
what
it
is
and
brings
back
some
fun
memories
picked
this
up
as
well
as
others
while
grabbing
a
la
familiar
at
a
tiny
hispanic
store
probably
in
the
minority
here
but
i
thought
this
was
ok
in
fact
better
than
tequiza
to
me
it
almost
tasted
like
ginger
ale
beer
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
woodiness
not
saying
i
would
regularly
pick
up
a
6er
or
deucey
duce
of
it
but
it
was
palatable
overall
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
just
a
gimmicky
beverage
that
will
run
its
course
and
disappear
shortly
of
course
you
never
know
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
but
if
youre
like
me
and
you
just
have
to
try
it
to
see
what
its
like
i
can
give
the
go
ahead
for
that
you
probably
wont
want
a
second
one
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
you
wont
have
any
trouble
finishing
it
16
a
6er
tax
deposit
id
never
buy
this
for
any
reason
but
i
dont
quite
understand
its
reputation
as
one
of
the
worlds
worst
o
overall
a
really
bad
beer
in
my
opinion
struggled
to
drink
half
the
33cl
bottle
and
drain
poured
the
other
half
tequila
and
sweet
sugar
throughout
and
the
nose
sucked
would
not
recommend
md
medium
bodied
lite
carbonation
and
the
taste
throws
the
mouthfeel
overall
very
hard
to
drink
and
i
will
by
tossing
the
rest
of
the
beer
on
the
good
side
it
seems
they
used
just
malts
and
the
5
9
alcohol
cannot
be
felt
whatsoever
o
interesting
beer
available
abroad
probably
cant
drink
more
than
one
overall
very
interesting
beer
not
something
you
want
or
see
everyday
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
one
any
time
soon
since
i
dont
use
to
mix
my
beer
with
any
other
alcoholic
drinks
maybe
if
i
was
15
again
and
this
one
was
really
really
cheap
i
would
prefer
it
pours
bright
gold
in
color
clear

white
crown
large
bubbles
surprising

thick

on
nose
citrics
hues
of
alcohol
sweet
at
first
sip
develops
a
honeysirupy
tasting
a
real
alcoholic
soda
pop
well
this
is
not
a
cocktail
at
all
but
artificial
flavors
aromas
indeed
not
refreshing
at
all
light
bodymedium
carbonation
drinkability
just
a
beverage
to
forget
avoid
even
if
you
like
tequila
andor
beer
you
mustn
try
this
overall
not
a
beer
more
a
soda
o
i
would
try
another
one
if
you
point
a
gun
to
my
head
every
picture
ive
since
seen
of
the
beer
online
has
a
lime
wedge
or
two
in
the
glass
and
i
wonder
why
this
thing
already
tastes
like
50
lime
cordial
why
does
it
need
more
lime
taste
to
it
a
beer
brewed
with
tequila
should
actually
attempt
to
highlight
the
naturally
dry
tangy
flavors
of
tequila
this
did
nothing
of
the
sort
i
could
hardly
finish
this
it
took
all
of
us
at
the
table
to
drink
it
down
i
can
see
why
mexico
would
want
no
part
of
this
beer
this
was
terrible
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
its
unique
intent
while
the
aroma
is
questionable
to
say
the
very
least
it
takes
some
bravery
to
produce
a
beer
that
is
supposed
to
share
some
aromatics
with
something
as
stark
as
tequila
as
lovers
of
tequila
on
the
side
we
were
not
able
to
detect
anything
of
the
sort
the
utter
lacking
of
the
advertised
flavors
with
a
beer
instead
as
sweet
as
key
lime
pie
makes
for
little
to
be
desired
the
more
of
this
i
drink
the
worse
it
seems
to
get
it
has
an
odd
aftertaste
but
never
fear
add
some
lime
or
lime
juice
as
you
would
reular
tequila
clears
up
the
aftertaste
and
finishes
it
off
well
more
beer
stuff
on
my
blog
abarwithnoname
wordpress
com
dr
please
let
me
have
another
but
lower
the
price
i
dont
know
why
all
the
other
reviews
are
so
poor
but
i
genuinely
think
this
is
a
great
and
underappreciated
beer
it
challenges
the
conventions
of
what
a
beer
ought
to
be
according
to
the
snobs
if
youre
truly
a
beerlover
you
really
ought
to
give
this
one
a
try
if
only
to
see
how
they
handle
the
unique
flavour
of
tequila
or
perhaps
more
importantly
how
they
hide
it
beneath
the
mouthfeel
once
i
got
used
to
the
tequila
it
wasnt
too
bad
but
not
what
my
mouth
was
looking
for
when
my
eyes
saw
a
nice
cold
beer
the
tequila
in
the
beer
also
hampers
its
ability
to
calm
down
the
jalapenos
on
the
nachos
very
drinkable
it
pairs
very
well
with
pizza
or
a
steak
in
a
warm
summer
night
50cl
can
after
seeing
this
everywhere
in
france
the
last
few
years
and
having
a
few
coworkers
who
drink
the
stuff
regularly
i
broke
down
and
tried
one
big
mistake
this
one
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
that
is
absolutely
crystal
clear
there
was
a
fairly
foamy
white
head
on
it
that
dropped
away
rather
quickly
it
has
sort
of
an
artificial
lime
aroma
to
it
as
well
as
a
bit
of
hay
to
the
nose
maybe
a
whiff
of
some
bad
tequila
also
beer
i
really
didnt
smell
any
in
there
the
taste
is
a
bit
astringent
some
artificial
lime
and
tequila
taste
sort
of
sickly
sweet
beer
didnt
taste
any
of
that
either
i
dont
think
ill
be
trying
the
other
2
in
their
lineup
dlike
i
said
i
used
to
find
these
highly
drinkable
but
then
i
grew
facial
hair
might
go
well
with
nachos
and
guacamole
but
not
better
than
a
real
margarita
or
a
decent
lager
notes
is
fairly
reminiscent
of
a
lemonlime
soda
pop
tequila
isnt
all
that
present
and
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
detected
any
if
i
werent
looking
for
it
the
weird
lime
sweetness
is
as
bad
as
some
of
the
american
macro
faux
lime
taste
though
well
hardly
the
car
wreck
i
was
anticipating
this
is
actually
not
a
bad
tipple
the
overall
effect
to
me
is
that
of
a
decent
i
know
lime
lager
the
tequila
sure
wasnt
particularly
evident
as
i
have
a
pretty
strong
aversion
to
that
particular
flavour
the
best
part
about
this
whole
deal
is
however
the
ingredients
listed
on
the
bottle
the
first
listed
is
beer
well
no
shit
a
gimmick
brew
that
doesnt
fall
flat
whod
a
thunk
it
the
nose
reminds
a
little
lime
and
some
strange
and
dubious
mexican
condiments
the
mouth
is
almost
similar
although
the
taste
of
beer
and
that
of
tequila
although
it
is
usually
flavored
with
it
or
completely
absent
the
finish
is
very
sweet
but
the
body
seems
very
artificial
and
does
not
differ
much
in
a
simple
lemonade
somewhat
boosted
by
a
touch
of
alcohol
overall
i
didnt
find
it
as
bad
as
most
reviewers
did
this
could
make
a
good
summer
refreshment
overall
i
found
this
to
be
quite
gross
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
finish
off
the
last
few
mouthfuls
avoid
this
one
not
sure
id
put
this
in
the
euro
plae
lager
category
but
then
where
do
you
put
it
have
to
admit
it
would
be
killer
served
ice
cold
on

but
then
again
i
could

make

of

and
some

bought
tequila
lime
mixer
drinkability
lessoned
learded
somethings
from
your
past
should
be
left
alone
it
also
drinks
like
a
soda
meaning
its
watery
and
insubstantial
but
also
very
drinkable
its
something
you
can
sit
and
enjoy
with
a
bud
but
its
not
something
youll
remember
as
great
strange
thats
what
comes
to
mind
with
this
beer
from
a
clear
bottle
with
a
decidedly
southwestern
theme
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
flavored
with
tequila
its
a
light
gold
color
with
a
soft
and
small
head
the
flavor
is
odd
it
honestly
smells
more
like
a
lemonlime
soda
than
a
beer
sweet
and
citric
the
taste
is
similar
sodapop
citrus
and
sugar
its
less
like
beer
than
like
candy
its
clearly
aimed
at
someone
who
doesnt
like
the
taste
of
beer
looks
like
beer
but
tastes
nothing
of
the
beverage
the
beverage
is
moderately
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
it
would
be
cloyingly
sweet
except
for
the
lemonlime
tang
at
the
finish
no
hop
and
no
malt
character
sodapop
disguised
as
beer
this
was
actually
far
better
than
what
my
expectations
had
me
assume
when
i
feel
like
a
beer
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
couldnt
really
be
satisfied
with
this
although
even
despite
being
very
a
subpar
beer
this
certainly
would
have
its
place
among
many
myself
perhaps
included
i
cant
drink
those
alcopop
coolers
i
find
them
far
too
sweet
sugary
and
artificial
but
this
desperados
beer
would
make
a
welcome
substitute
sweet
and
fruity
across
the
board
but
not
cloying
suitable
for
washing
down
a
load
of
hot
chicken
wings
but
not
something
to
be
seeking
out
avoid
this
drink
like
you
would
the
plague
beer
imitating
soda
pop
thats
all
this
stuff
is
this
one
time
at
a
bar
in
france
called
latin
club
pronounced
lahteen
cloob
i
was
eating
a
cheese
pizza
with
arugala
latin
food
and
drinking
a
7up
when
all
of
the
sudden
i
tasted
a
little
tequila
in
my
7up
i
looked
down
at
the
bottle
and
noticed
that
it
was
brown
rather
than
the
usual
green
i
looked
at
the
labeldesparados
wtf
i
looked
around
the
joint
and
as
some
sort
of
new
kids
like
song
started
playing
all
these
french
and
arab
kids
starting
dancing
like
michel
stipes
circa
1987
i
couldnt
figure
out
why
they
were
acting
so
ridiculous
until
i
looked
at
their
hands
desarados
everywhere
everybody
was
drinking
these
things
even
the
arabs
and
arabs
dont
drink
i
suddenly
realized
that
i
was
in
the
twilight
zone
so
i
got
the
f
out
of
there
and
rinsed
my
mouth
out
with
a
tall
boy
can
of
bavaria

that
i
bought
off
an
anarchist
bum
on
the
corner
fischer
in
france
has
put
out
some
gimmicky
beers
in
the
past
and
this
seems
to
fit
the
mark
a
pale
lager
with
tequila
flavour
the
bottle
fits
the
south
americanmexican
genre
clear
with
a
green
and
red
embossed
label
the
beer
poured
with
a
decent
head
large
bubbled
a
clear
honey
colour
the
head
actually
stayed
quite
nicely
at
about
4
cm
and
did
not
seem
to
move
till
i
drank
from
the
glass
it
was
actually
the
best
part
of
the
beer
staying
creamy
and
consistent
throughout
my
drinking
the
lacing
is
superthick
the
beer
smells
like
a
mexicanstyle
lager
with
lime
in
it
there
is
a
soft
hint
of
tequila
making
for
a
unique
if
not
wholly
appetising
aroma
however
the
malting
smells
good
enough
sweet
and
sugary
with
just
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
is
like
light
limeflavoured
water
at
first
the
finish
is
more
palatable
with
some
good
pilsnerstyle
maltiness
and
a
little
bitterness
this
really
tastes
like
limeflavoured
water
though
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
little
carbonation
this
is
probably
fine
freezing
cold
on
a
hot
day
but
as
for
redrinking
marks
this
rates
pretty
low
interesting
concept
gimmicky
execution
got
this
in
germany
i
was
getting
a
doener
similar
to
a
gyro
only
better
and
saw
this
in
the
beverage
case
figured
what
the
heck
give
it
a
try
beer
was
a
golden
color
with
an
okay
head
smell
was
almost
citrusy
and
a
smell
of
tequila
taste
had
some
honey
to
it
and
tequila
to
it
mouthfeel
well
it
was
there
but
it
wasnt
pleasant
drinkability
sure
i
was
able
to
finish
the
bottle
its
not
as
terrible
as
it
sounds
but
its
no
where
close
to
good
i
have
learnt
my
lesson
i
will
never
drink
novelty
beers
again
ok
maybe
the
chilli
beer
i
really
wanna
know
how
bad
can
it
be
one
finger
head
medium
to
dark
medium
yellow
color
and
quite
clear
smells
a
typical
pils
profile
plus
i
definitely
smell
tequila
i
like
beer
not
tequila
there
is
a
strong
tequila
smell
and
flavor
here
lightly
carbonated
heavier
mouthfeel
than
expected
no
i
did
not
buy
this
it
was
a
gift
i
very
much
appreciate
the
spirit
it
was
given
in
i
did
not
finish
this
i
poured
it
out
the
taste
was
sweet
i
thought
like
honey
but
you
could
definetly
taste
the
tequila
they
said
they
have
it
it
i
still
dont
understand
why
a
french
beer
has
tequila
in
it
i
think
this
one
is
one
to
try
but
i
gave
it
a
bad
drinkability
because
it
cost
like
7
euros
for
a
bottle
and
that
it
wasnt
so
balanced
with
the
tequila
tequila
youve
really
done
it
here
i
didnt
know
anything
could
ever
be
so
wrong
apparently
they
also
left
out
punctuation
i
popped
the
cap
and
began
a
hard
pour
which
netted
me
three
fingers
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
crystalclear
palestraw
srm
1
2
nose
had
the
honeylike
sweetness
that
i
usually
associate
with
lagers
but
this
was
supposed
to
be
gf
wtf
mind
blown
mouthfeel
was
medium
taste
was
reminiscent
of
summers
on
the
farm
honey
hay
mown
grass
clean
light
easydrinking
this
was
better
than
many
aals
that
i
have
been
exposed
to
and
it
is
gf
holy
finish
was
clean
semisweet
and
unquestionably
the
best
of
the
lot
so
far
brew
pours
a
clear
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
thin
foamyfizzy
head
that
settles
down
to
mostly
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
less
than
10
minutes
ringlacing
is
seen
at
first
then
slides
back
down
after
a
few
sips
the
aroma
is
of
grains
for
the
most
part
with
a
light
hint
of
corn
also
more
going
on
with
the
flavor
as
this
actually
doesnt
taste
like
the
typical
pale
ale
and
even
leaning
towards
a
hefeweizen
wheat
beer
even
great
taste
and
goes
down
easy
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
unlike
some
pale
ales
tasty
brew
lighter
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
liked
this
one
and
dont
care
if
if
is
glutenfree
or
not
overall
this
surprised
me
i
cant
help
but
view
it
throught
the
lens
of
gimmick
by
being
gluten
free
but
on
its
own
its
just
a
damn
good
lager
i
like
it
and
would
have
it
again
terrible
skunky
is
the
highlight
of
this
beer
actually
the
appearance
is
ok
that
is
the
best
i
can
say
o
3
50
this
is
a
beer
you
could
transition
someone
from
bmc
to
craft
with
it
has
a
mild
taste
but
is
slightly
more
complex
than
an
aal
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
if
i
had
celiacs
i
would
be
all
over
this
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
missing
anything
in
the
flavor
profile
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
grassy
taste
is
mild
grains
grassy
some
malts
very
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
it
would
make
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
forget
glutenfree
this
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
period
that
ive
had
in
a
long
while
crisp
tasty
and
wellrounded
with
a
few
oldworld
nods
the
kind
that
make
me
shake
my
head
when
i
see
what
this
is
listed
as
here
light
lager
really
ok
things
and
recipes
may
have
changed
over
the
intervening
years
but
i
think
this
offering
deserves
a
whole
shitload
more
respect
than
to
be
lumped
into
that
category
serving
type
bottle
excellent
gluten
free
bier
light
crisp
taste
nice
to
find
a
glutenfree
bier
that
isnt
made
from
sorghum
or
rice
dont
look
for
much
in
the
way
of
a
challenge
here
think
pbr
budweiser
etc
its
a
straight
forward
lager
the
value
here
is
that
it
is
a
gluten
free
tailgatestyle
beer
a
pale
yellow
color
should
set
you
up
for
a
clean
albeit
simple
taste
it
finishes
with
the
slightest
hint
of
bitterness
to
this
beers
merit
it
is
slightly
more
complex
than
your
generic
murcian
lager
price
tag
aside
this
beer
is
great
option
for
ingredientconscious
drinkers
who
appreciate
a
cold
consistent
lighter
beer
overall
a
completely
refreshing
tasty
lager
probably
wouldnt
choose
this
over
a
cheapest
macro
though
due
to
the
price
o
lowering
the
gluten
ppm
or
not
they
made
a
fine
lager
here
cant
say
if
the
extra
malt
heft
will
turn
off
those
who
prefer
their
lagers
to
taste
damn
near
like
water
but
the
rest
of
its
close
enough
a
light
lager
that
drinks
more
like
an
import
german
helles
thought
lagers
were
usually
heavier
i
like
the
lightness
of
this
one
has
a
bit
of
a
citrus
taste
like
a
blue
moon
but
is
crispier
pretty
tasty
for
a
gluten
free
beer
i
poured
a
bottled
beer
into
a
chilled
mug
it
was
refreshing
the
after
taste
is
so
so
its
better
on
the
lips
rjt
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
ok
but
not
worth
seeking
out
the
taste
of
this
lager
is
lightly
grainy
with
a
very
light
toasted
accent
with
slight
hint
of
yeast
adding
a
mild
fruit
element
with
light
grass
almost
a
spicelike
flavor
as
it
finishes
overall
i
like
this
about
as
well
as
most
other
light
lagers
but
this
seems
to
have
a
little
more
body
than
most
which
makes
it
a
skosh
more
enjoyable
i
would
probably
not
be
able
to
tell
it
is
a
gluten
free
product
if
i
tried
this
blind
but
i
probably
would
not
purchase
this
again
even
though
it
is
ok
for
the
most
part
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
impressive
as
most
say
not
bad
for
a
glutenfree
beer
i
like
beer
but
not
the
beer
belly
and
hope
omission
will
stay
available
at
my
local
rovers
in
austin
overall
decent
experience
not
outstanding
but
not
bad
niche
product
that
is
drinkable
and
bodes
well
given
glutenfree
overall
a
pretty
decent
gluten
free
beer
o
this
is
not
half
bad
for
the
style
gluten
or
not
id
put
this
neck
above
the
big
three
any
day
good
mouthfeel
but
overall
this
is
another
very
ordinary
brew
whose
subtleish
flavours
dont
do
anything
for
my
taste
buds
its
about
as
exciting
as
the
label
on
the
bottle
this
beer
prizes
itself
for
being
brewed
gluten
free
it
uses
a
special
process
to
remove
the
gluten
and
by
doing
so
the
beer
is
free
from
an
ingredient
that
some
people
cannot
consume
and
that
makes
it
a
beer
that
most
anyone
can
consume
it
is
a
decent
effort
from
widmer
certainly
nothing
amazing
but
not
bad
overall
overall
slightly
above
average
i
only
bought
it
so
i
could
sample
a
representation
of
the
style
it
perhaps
fails
at
that
but
i
prefer
its
failure
to
the
success
of
its
bmc
counterparts
o
pretty
average
light
lager
but
miles
above
the
big
macro
brews
pretty
low
abv
makes
it
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
little
brew
overall
a
really
solid
brew
nothing
to
run
out
and
go
get
but
if
you
can
pick
it
up
in
a
mix
six
some
time
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
nice
afternoon
beer
very
good
for
a
light
lager
the
flavor
is
grainy
with
a
vague
hope
bite
finishing
things
off
it
really
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
would
be
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
day
they
did
a
good
job
of
making
a
gluten
free
version
of
the
a
typical
bad
american
light
beer
but
otherwise
nothing
to
see
here
continuing
the
expansion
of
my
glutenfree
beer
horizons
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
nearly
nonexistent
though
theres
a
wafting
of
pure
cellulose
like
the
water
dripping
from
a
piece
of
split
celery
i
cant
say
its
necessarily
a
bad
thing
just
a
feeling
like
they
werent
at
all
trying
here
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
wheat
light
flowers
dried
honey
and
a
vague
sense
of
something
sweetish
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
weak
brew
one
that
seems
to
compound
some
of
the
negative
things
ive
heard
about
gf
beers
d
for
what
it
is
it
is
actually
pretty
well
done
it
doesnt
compare
to
a
truly
full
flavored
beer
ii
it
is
intended
to
be
a
gluten
free
substitute
for
light
lager
its
a
home
run
as
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
other
than
the
poor
foam
that
screams
gluten
free
and
i
would
say
it
actually
tastes
like
real
beer
o
overall
an
average
drink
really
nothing
to
brag
about
no
chance
at
repeat
less
chance
of
a
reccommendation

an

and
a

i
think
people
are
forgetting
the
style
of
this
beer
this
beer
kills
most
anything
in
its
style
category
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer
small
dots
of

on

down
smell
is
of
grains
and
a
slight
skunky
aroma
taste
is
mainly
of
grains
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
isnt
too
bad
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
drink
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
almost
completely
clear
with
a
tinge
of
yellowgold
and
no
head
whatsoever
i
could
read
one
of
those
optometrists
eye
charts
through
this
thing
wow
very
clean
aromas
of
toasted
grains
a
slight
buttery
highlight
and
some
floral
notes
flavors
of

and
cereal
initially
with
a
slight
roasting

of
the

light

this
beer
is
clean

very
well
put

it
just
lacks
a

interesting
idea
behind
this
line
of
brews

overall
nothing

really
go
out
of
the

i
didnt
know
this
was
gluten
free
until
i
started
this
review
an
excellent
gluten
free
beer
drink
cold
a
friend
gave
this
to
me
to
try
but
i
didnt
realize
it
was
gluten
free
until
now
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
straw
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
spicy

and
sweet

with
a
bit
of
a
strange
tartness
that
i
cant
put
my

on

a
bit
of
spicy
noble
hops
a
bit
of

flavor
and
again
a
strange
tartness
that
i
wasnt
expecting
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
watery
spritz
y
mouthfeel
decent
beer
really
nothing
special
but
probably
the
best
gf
beer
ive
tried
i
rated
this
a
bit
higher
just
for
the
gluten
free
factor
if
i
were
gluten
intolerant
i
would
probably
get
used
to
this
o
to
be
fair
the
light
lager
style
does
not
allow
brewers
to
make
a
truly
great
beer
that
being
said
this
one
succeeds
in
making
a
beer
true
to
the
style
but
doesnt
do
anything
more
than
that
kind
of
a
misfire
for
a
light
glutenfree
lager
i
applaud
the
result
by
all
appearances
it
is
a
superior
product
to
most
other
light
lagers
but
it
still
doesnt
make
me
want
another
one
o
good
by
light
lager
standards
clean
with
decent
flavors
i
didnt
buy
this
because
its
gluten
free
in
fact
i
didnt
know
until
i
came
to
do
this
review
so
they
truly
accomplished
a
normal
beer
without
gluten
poured
only
an
18
inch
white
head
which
didnt
last
long
the
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
very
little
effervescence
smells
of
malt
and
grass
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
yet
id
say
its
richer
and
creamier
than
mainstream
lagers
short
finish
but
fairly
long
aftertaste
better
than
id
have
expected
this
has
a
lot
of
the
signature
gluten
free
characteristics
its
sweet
and
a
bit
fruity
with
a
very
little
if
any
hop
character
its
also
a
bit
thin
and
very
light
bodied
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
decent
little
fizzy
white
head
which
leaves
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
kinda
sweet
with
some
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
more
on
the
light
body
side
but
still
pretty
nice
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
would
not
buy
again
o
nice
summer
thirst
quencher
but
not
much
more
the
4
6
abv
makes
is
sessionable
but
i
didnt
find
it
interesting
enough
to
do
so
pours
a
clear
light
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
a
bit
of
retention
and
decent
lace
nose
is
of
grainy
malts
nice
but
weak
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
grainy
up
front
with
a
bittersweet
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
decent
summer
session
beer
a
quite
easy
beer
to
forget
very
similar
to
any
number
of
light
american
lager
beers
odprobably
the
best
gluten
free
brew
i
have
had
can
stand
up
to
most
light
lagers
without
a
problem
good
job
by
widmer
overall
not
bad
light
overall
but
quite
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
nice
maltlike
flavors
although
lighter
and
not
quite
the
same
as
if
they
used
real
malts
hops
are
practically
non
existent
but
nice
lagering
as
well
so
pretty
decent
for
a
gluten
free
beer
or
possible
just
because
i
was
so
thirsty
and
it
was
so
hot
overall
very
tasty
light
lager
gluten
free
beer
you
wouldnt
expect
it
but
a
keeper
in
my
minds
happy
to
have
gotten
this
after
volunteering
at
the
acbf
and
good
to
find
out
that
it
is
made
by
widmer
i
think
they
omitted
much
more
than
just
the
gluten
here
it
isnt
nearly
offensive
but
hardly
brings
any
flavor
or
interest
to
the
table
overall
for
a
beer
this
is
average
with
no
faults
or
off
flavors
for
a
gluten
free
beer
this
is
the
best
one
i
have
ever
tasted
i
am
astounded
that
this
is
glutenfree
yet
it
is
still
a
standout
lager
in
the
craft
world
you
could
hand
this
beer
to
someone
and
never
mention
the
fact
that
it
is
glutenfree
and
i
bet
they
would
still
thoroughly
enjoy
it
more
so
than
any
canned
macro
on
the
market
kudos
to
widmer
i
hope
they
continue
to
stay
on
this
awesome
path
they
have
paved
kinda
plain
some
good
bitter
in
there
glass
shaker
pint
similar
to
what
sierra
nevada
tried
with
their
beer
camp
hoppy
lager
and
what
pyramid
did
with
their
ipl
i
guess
i
crave
the
malt
backing
that
a
normal
ipa
provides
to
counter
the
bitter
hops
lots
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
but
no
real
malt
presence
i
think
ill
just
steer
clear
of
this
style
its
not
for
me
i
know
we
are
supposed
to
rate
beers
according
to
style
but
i
still
dont
understand
the
point
of
ipls
when
you
have
ipas
o
the
flavor
is
a
little
disappointing
overall
if
youre
a
fan
of
india
lagers
or
ales
this
is
right
up
your
alley
this
is
for
sure
a
bitter
and
potent
india
style
pale
on
its
own
merit
its
a
decent
offering
good
for
a
taste
but
unfortunately
overwhelming
for
me
so
im
gonna
drain
the
rest
and
save
my
workout
calories
for
an
old
standby
or
two
clear
golden
pour
with
minimal
headno
lacing
aroma
of
grass
and
biscuit
flavor
is
semisweet
malty
with
a
herbal
bitterness
very
enjoyable
up
front
but
a
lingering
dryness
to
the
finish
overall
simply
not
a
great
beer
weak
nose
fairly
bland
for
an
india
style
hoppy
beer
dense
body
feel
and
a
very
strange
but
faint
chlorinelike
offnote
consumed
within
best
by
date
so
freshness
is
not
an
issue
theres
just
not
a
lot
good
to
say
about
this
one
of
the
things
you
look
for
in
a
lager
is
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
beer
and
this
one
just
doesnt
really
deliver
its
not
the
worst
beer
but
it
sure
aint
a
great
one
very
mediocre
aroma
is
citrus
light
pine
and
malts
the
flavor
is
citrus
light
tropical
fruit
hop
resin
malts
and
a
bittermildly
earthy
finish
o
this
was
ok
the
sweet
flavors
are
a
bit
cloying
and
the
mouthfeel
is
too
sticky
making
it
not
very
refreshing
overall
an
interesting
hybrid
beer
that
truly
tastes
like
you
combined
a
lager
with
an
ipa
as
decent
beer
pale
straw
color
in
the
glass
crisp
dry
and
with
noticeable
carbonation
some
fruit
notes
noticeably
lemon
and
pine
a
hint
of
wheat
and
a
long
dry
finish
nothing
too
bold
or
overly
original
here
but
a
drinkable
ipl
worth
a
try
at
9
for
the
six
poured
straight
down
into
a
large
tulip
one
finger
head
that
settles
down
in
under
two
minutes
into
white
froth
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
with
noticeable
lacing
appearance
is
clear
deep
gold
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
and
features
sweet
light
malt
with
hints
of
sweet
toasted
grains
light
orange
and
apricot
subtle
grassy
notes
and
florally
hops
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
hitting
on
the
midpalate
the
flavors
are
nicely
arranged
with
bittersweet
grapefruit
dominating
though
not
completely
overpowering
a
very
pleasant
floral
light
honey
sweetness
showing
sweet
orange
peel
mouthfeel
is
slightly
slick
and
very
light
with
moderate
pleasant
carbonation
the
finish
which
is
surprisingly
thin
and
short
is
dominated
by
the
bitter
grapefruit
as
well
as
a
slightly
fruity
sweetness
with
hints
of
ripe
honeydew
orange
and
apricot
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
an
india
pale
lager
ipl
and
if
theyre
all
like
this
then
im
sold
as
others
have
pointed
out
you
get
a
light
crisp
beer
that
also
features
both
the
floral
complexity
of
a
hoppy
ipa
as
well
as
a
nice
dose
of
bitter
citrus
this
is
almost
the
definition
of
perfect
sessionable
warm
weather
beer
though
the
wellhidden
abv
of
6
7
could
pack
an
unexpected
wallop
o
i
liked
the
beer
but
thought
it
was
a
little
harsh
on
the
finish
i
love
ipas
and
was
expecting
the
bitterness
but
it
didnt
feel
balanced
to
me
onice
hoppy
lager
pretty
solid
flavor
and
easy
drinking
drank
this
in
maui
and
i
must
say
that
this
is
spot
on
for
the
style
hoppy
and
yet
clean
as
the
style
demands
great
nose
and
great
finish
on
this
beer
would
buy
it
quite
a
bit
if
it
was
available
in
bc
i
can
see
this
style
becoming
a
common
one
just
like
dipas
and
idas
id
buy
this
on
tap
happily
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
i
havent
seen
before
and
it
more
reminds
me
of
a
session
ipa
than
an
ipl
the
content
makes
it
a
tough
session
though
not
sure
what
this
beer
is
aiming
for
but
i
suppose
thats
why
it
is
rotational
not
bad
but
not
impressive
this
was
a
suprisingly
lovely
iplwe
didnt
realize
it
was
an
ipa
until
inspecting
the
label
closer
a
nice
take
on
hoppy
beers
worth
a
try
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
summertime
staple
taste
is
thin
almost
pilsnery
for
an
ipa
idunno
easy
going
down
for
sure
very
easy
not
very
stylish
or
authentic
i
suppose
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
and
for
the
abv
that
would
be
a
good
thing
but
it
calls
itself
an
ipa
i
dont
think
so
date
on
side
is
oct
13
could
it
be
old
the
medium
body
leans
a
bit
light
its
got
a
nice
crispness
and
is
pretty
clean
but
not
as
clean
as
the
bottle
boasts
o
this
was
my
first
ipl
before
the
purchase
i
was
not
even
familiar
with
the
style
and
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
nor
did
i
have
a
frame
of
reference
for
this
tasting
it
turned
out
to
be
exactly
what
i
would
think
it
would
be
based
on
the
name
of
the
style
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
of
a
lighter
lager
with
the
pleasant
hop
profile
of
an
apa
since
im
getting
too
old
to
knock
back
46
ipas
or
even
pale
ales
this
is
a
wonderfully
sessionable
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
someone
who
likes
hop
profile
but
wants
something
nice
and
easy
ill
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
the
hopside
down
is
a
decent
ipa
from
widmer
there
is
nothing
that
separates
itself
from
other
westcoast
ipas
but
it
is
a
decent
and
sessionable
offering
the
scent
is
mild
with
fresh
hop
that
provides
hints
of
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
is
a
decent
balance
between
bitter
hops
and
a
sweet
malt
the
bitterness
starts
and
then
the
sweetness
takes
over
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
6
or
12
would
be
in
order
o
could
have
been
hopped
more
in
my
opinion

a
bad

this

very
good
i
like
the
style
and
the
widmer

always
make

like

drinks

it

not

this
is
almost
a
sessionable

from
widmers
rotator
series
its
exceptional
medium

light
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
long
finish
its
what
i
expect
from
the
series
which
has
featured
amazing
others
including
oryely
and
falconers
ipas
its
a
perfect
ipa
choice
for
someone
who
normally
doesnt
like
ipas
overall
an
ipl
i
dont
like
them
as
much
as
ipas
im
sure
its
possible
to
make
one
ill
like
but
i
havent
found
one
yet
this
one
is
middle
of
the
road
nothing
wrong
not
much
to
love
the
hops
are
loud
and
forward
but
the
blend
is
a
bit
bitter
and
earthy
some
dried
orange
taste
comes
close
to
fruity
but
almost
cloved
orange
big
punch
for
the
abv
worth
a
shot
but
ill
pass
on
a
6er
drinkability
is
low
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
craving
hops
as
its
really
interesting
but
i
would
never
want
two
of
these
in
a
row
nonetheless
pretty
clean
and
goodtasting
start
to
finish
and
overall
an
interesting
very
hopforward
take
on
the
hoppy
lager
trend
a
clear
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
this
is
a
solid
ipl
the
nose
is
full
of
hops
bright
citrusy
mildly
rindlike
and
moderately
pithlike
clean
snappy
and
refreshing
this
is
solid
a
touch
of
sweetness
is
present
the
palate
opens
with
a
moderate
bitterness
rather
resiny
with
pine
and
citrus
this
is
followed
with
a
rather
clean
hop
flavor
grapefruit
pine
some
orange
with
no
real
grassy
flavors
the
midpalate
has
a
little
bit
of
caramel
but
what
is
striking
is
the
mineral
character
on
the
finish
that
works
really
nicely
with
the
snappy
resiny
hops
mediumlight
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
this
feels
decent
on
the
palate
and
has
a
nice
hoppy
finish
alcohol
is
a
lot
higher
than
it
needs
to
be
imo
but
otherwise
this
is
a
winner
india
style
pale
lager
quite
a
handle
that
sums
up
how
this
beer
tastes
and
drinks
a
very
tasty
hybrid
that
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
and
one
i
would
consume
on
a
regular
basis
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
recommend
trying
it
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
refreshing
and
very
easy
drinking
worth
having
a
go
at
for
sure
its
a
great
mixture
of
lager
and
ipa
nicely
hopped
with
a
clear
body
and
a
clean
finish
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
and
some
perfumelike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grapefruit
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
interesting
mix
of
citrus
and
perfumelike
hop
aromas
that
makes
the
smell
slightly
better
than
the
taste
in
my
opinion
good
to
drink
if
your
thirsty
not
looking
to
enjoy
which
side
is
the
hopside
is
it
the
same
as
turning
something
topwise
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mixed
greens
mild
pine
resin
and
a
soft
caress
of
cereal
grains
im
leaning
toward
clean
oatmeal
here
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
pine
a
bit
sharper
and
the
grains
coming
across
more
like
a
light
bit
of
cornbread
the
body
straddles
the
border
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
hoppy
lager
nothing
worth
writing
poetry
over
but
itll
do
for
a
clean
hop
fix
b
overall
this
is
a
decent
ipa
the
lager
yeast
does
not
lend
additional
crispness
than
what
a
normal
bitter
ale
does
worthy
of
a
try
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
not
bad
at
all
o
interesting
style
i
cant
say
ive
ever
seen
something
advertised
as
an
indiastyle
lager
before
this
keeps
true
to
the
style
with
its
lightness
pure
flavors
even
so
it
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
not
sure
how
different
a
ipl
is
from
an
ipa
but
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
hoppy
brew
big
citrus
and
herb
nose
slightly
piney
and
resiny
with
a
malted
cereal
smell
like
cream
of
wheat
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
very
caramel
toasted
flavor
coming
in
after
the
initial
hop
charge
not
as
bitter
a
backbone
as
other
ipass
even
though
this
is
not
an
ipa
and
slightly
drier
than
one
would
expect
considering
the
strong
caramel
flavors
the
lager
yeast
gives
this
beer
a
clean
and
dry
finish
that
is
very
appealing
leaving
only
the
flavor
of
citrus
hops
and
malty
bread
to
linger
not
the
bitter
hop
bomb
that
most
drinkers
seem
to
want
but
still
a
drinkable
and
everyday
hop
heads
beer
man
i
was
anxious
i
popped
the
cap
got
an
aggro
pour
going
and
i
was
off
to
the
races
baby
two
dense
foamy
fingers
of
french
vanillacolored
head
with
great
retention
and
i
had
to
wait
it
looked
like
the
top
of
an
ice
cream
cone
before
it
began
to
fall
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
allowing
me
to
see
into
the
future
i
will
be
drinking
beer
srm
5
to
6
and
the
triumvirate
of
croesus
mammon
and
king
midas
were
all
slathering
not
today
boys
nose
smelled
like
the
interior
of
a
pine
forest
this
is
a
lager
what
hath
man
wrought
mouthfeel
was
big
full
and
creamy
soft
as
well
and
the
pine
hops
were
like
everything
of
baby
bears
just
right
man
i
wonder
how
long
they
had
to
tweak
this
recipe
becuase
it
could
have
easily
been
overpowered
by
the
hops
one
long
draught
later
and
sticky
lacing
was
already
beginning
to
appear
finish
was
indeed
clean
and
crisp
with
a
lingering
taste
of
hops
gimme
more
o
they
accomplished
what
they
wanted
with
gets
the
hops
of
an
ipa
combined
with
the
crispness
of
a
lager
but
i
wouldnt
be
jumping
at
the
bit
to
buy
a
case
any
time
soon
had
from
bottle
in
sam
adams
glass
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
light
to
medium
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
persists
as
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
estery
orange
family
juice
banana
and
light
tropical
fruit
light
grassy
hops
very
refreshing
fruit
smell
flavor
follows
with
sweet
bready
malt
nicely
mixed
citrus
and
stone
fruit
juices
and
some
suprisingly
robust
citrus
hops
in
the
flavor
and
finish
good
balance
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
a
nice
lager
that
could
pass
as
a
low
key
american
ipa
which
probably
would
be
a
better
style
designation
for
it
although
it
would
be
in
tougher
competition
much
better
than
i
expected
and
fun
to
drink
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
when
i
want
a
nice
malty
ipa
style
but
not
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
the
body
was
smooth
and
even
although
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
thick
and
sticky
and
had
a
nice
dry
finish
drinkability
was
good
i
could
see
a
few
of
these
disappearing
too
easily
at
a
cookout
overall
a
nicely
enjoyable
brew
not
one
thatll
make
the
uber
beer
nerds
wet
themselves
but
one
thats
certainly
worth
throwing
a
sixer
of
in
the
fridge
or
cooler
o
found
this
one
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
with
really
well
hidden
alcohol
this
india
pale
lager
hybrid
style
is
becoming
more
popular
recently
and
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
versions
that
i
have
come
across
easy
to
drink
and
one
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
during
a
session
enough
complexity
interest
to
keep
me
from
getting
bored
with
it
but
not
a
palate
wrecker
o
this
would
be
hard
to
pick
out
as
a
lager
in
a
blind
tasting
because
of
the
pronounced
hops
specifically
the
pineapple
and
grapefruit
that
come
through
it
is
more
like
a
pale
ale
but
there
is
enough
of
that
pale
stale
bread
and
big
carbonation
to
see
that
its
a
lager
extremely
drinkable
you
could
easily
pound
a
sixer
of
this
a
good
balanced
malt
and
hop
87
o
an
aggressive
lager
that
shows
how
far
widmer
has
come
along
does
a
lot
of
things
right
including
allowing
for
the
consumption
of
multiples
if
youre
so
inclined
a
little
more
complexity
and
this
would
be
a
real
stunner
at
a
great
price
the
verdict
its
ok
hophead
may
love
it
but
i
was
rather
disappointed
widmer
generally
brews
some
good
balanced
beers
but
this
one
just
came
off
as
a
bitter
lager
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
in
a
uniquely
brewed
package
i
like
hoppy
lagers
and
this
one
reminds
me
somewhat
of
the
sa
varieties
a
few
years
back
recommended
o
not
bad
but
there
are
definately
better
ipas
out
there
o
a
nice
beer
appealing
appearance
and
aroma
a
tasty
brew
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
relative
to
other
ipas
appears
pale
copper
bright
white
head
with
fine
lace
aroma
has
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
clean
cereal
grains
flavor
brings
out
a
clean
rolling
bitterness
mainly
citrus
pith
from
the
hop
additions
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
pulls
off
a
crisp
finish
much
like
a
lager
except
for
more
oily
alpha
acids
here
overall
enjoyable
but
lacks
some
complexity
crisp
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
crisp
which
is
expected
from
lagering
but
has
a
nice
amount
of
tangy
hop
flavor
up
front
too
it
is
somewhat
peach
from
first
taste
until
mid
palate
and
becomes
a
little
more
citrus
and
grapefruity
into
the
finish
with
light
astringency
in
the
taste
and
slight
malt
toastiness
backing
up
the
hops
with
a
gently
sweet
finish
overall
i
am
pleased
to
try
this
it
has
a
fresh
hop
vibrancy
and
is
very
drinkable
well
done
widmer
overall
good
beer
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
pleasant
to
drink
as
none
of
the
flavors
are
particularly
overpowering
and
has
a
light
crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
what
id
imagine
an
ipa
would
taste
like
if
it
came
as
a
light
beer
youd
never
know
this
thing
was
almost
7
abv
i
enjoyed
this
definitely
something
you
could
have
23
of
if
the
abv
wasnt
so
heavy
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
o
the
taste
is
very
strong
at
first
but
once
you
get
used
to
it
is
fairly
basic
its
easy
and
enjoyable
but
nothing
that
stands
out
this
is
really
a
solid
offering
i
think
ipl
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
emerging
styles
this
can
hang
with
any
ipa
that
widmer
has
put
out
in
the
rotator
series
the
hops
are
aggressive
assertive
bitter
and
balanced
and
the
malt
character
is
sweet
which
i
like
in
ipas
and
offers
a
solid
backbone
well
done
a
good
stab
at
the
india
pale
lager
pretty
drinkable
even
for
its
size
bottle
im
actually
quite
a
fan
of
this
emerging
style
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
nose
is
decently
hoppy
with
some
grass
elements
coming
off
this
one
to
me
and
just
a
little
bit
of
that
lager
corn
smell
in
there
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
hefty
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
hint
of
the
lagery
sweetness
at
the
end
overall
a
tasty
and
brawny
hop
bomb
a
bit
disappointed
when
comparing
it
to
their
other
seasonal
ipas
good
beer
for
the
summer
i
suppose
o
i
always
have
high
hopes
for
an
ipa
coming
from
the
west
coast
because
of
the
long
line
of
amazing
ipas
that
comes
from
that
part
of
the
country
but
this
does
not
fall
into
that
category
overall
kind
of
a
mess
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
crisp
clear
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
bright
white
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
sparse
surface
coating
aromas
of
biscuit
cedar
pitch
pepper
canibus
and
a
lemon
and
grapefruit
tart
sweetness
very
balanced
nose
flavors
are
very
bitter
forward
with
a
dry
resinous
cedar
and
grass
character
blended
with
floral
highlights
and
a
toasted
grain
backbone
resin
and
citrus
sweet
plows
straight
through
to
the
aftertaste
with
a
bitter
dry
slightly
resinous
finish
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
much
more
hopcentric
than
other
ipls
have
been
able
to
accomplish
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
the
widmer
crew
great
flavor
and
easy
drinkability
real
easy
to
get
34
or
deep
on
this
stuff
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tasted
this
year
overall
this
a
nice
hoppy
lager
at
an
agreeable
price
point
i
just
wish
it
was
a
touch
lighter
in
body
and
with
a
bit
less
abv
widmer
has
been
putting
out
some
pretty
good
beers
lately
and
this
is
another
solid
offering
overall
a
solid
brew
in
this
relatively
new
style
though
the
style
doesnt
seem
necessary
imo
as
there
are
several
lightbodied
ipas
on
the
market
taste
is
really
pleasingly
wellhopped
with
a
bitter
citrus
bite
and
underlying
toastiness
backing
it
all
up
would
easily
pass
for
a
solid
ipa
from
some
breweries
very
enjoyable
and
a
welldone
stylistic
twist
bravo
decent
but
a
little
to
light
in
taste
if
the
taste
had
been
anything
like
the
aroma
all
i
could
say
would
be
ill
have
another
and
another
and
another
i
generally
find
all
of
widmer
brothers
rotating
ipas
to
be
solid
though
not
necessarily
memorable
brews
hopside
down
continues
this
trend
certainly
a
unique
brew
combining
the
aspects
of
both
an
ipa
and
an
all
malt
lager
however
this
proves
to
be
a
double
edged
sword
while
this
beer
is
more
refreshing
than
your
standard
ipa
thanks
to
the
cleaner
finish
and
lighter
mouthfeel
it
also
looses
complexity
and
aroma
characters
on
the
flip
side
it
is
more
interesting
than
your
standard
lager
but
not
nearly
as
refreshing
due
mostly
to
the
strong
hop
aftertaste
i
commend
this
beer
for
trying
something
new
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
but
dont
see
myself
going
too
far
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
odthe
hot
new
style
i
respect
the
attempt
i
am
spoiled
because
i
can
get
jacks
abby
whenever
i
feel
the
need
so
this
brew
sadly
cant
beat
that
out
o
certainly
one
of
the
best
ipls
ive
tried
but
then
there
havent
been
many
nonetheless
this
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
is
recommended
for
those
seeking
something
like
an
apa
also
may
serve
as
a
major
upgrade
from
a
macrobrewed
lager
nice
hop
snap
to
this
one
very
refreshing
indeed
i
would
not
recommend
this
widmer
offering
c
i
really
love
this
beer
and
its
an
incredible
bargain
in
va
going
for

a

most
craft

have
creeped
up

with

that
melds
into

hoppy
finish
i
gotta
say
i
really
liked
this
beerwidmer
did
themselves
proud
on
this
hybrid
beer
wich
to
me
is
alot
like
a
uber
hopped
spring
bock
finish
is
a
lingering
bitterness
and
dry
a
very
interesting
and
well
made
ipa
lager
o
ipl
isnt
something
you
see
everyday
this
is
a
solis
example
an
easy
drinking
good
beer
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
widmer
thoroughly
decent
real
hop
presence
round
body
and
a
bite
in
the
aftertaste
a
pleasant
surprise
o
better
than
most
of
the
american
pale
lagers
youll
find
out
there
but
a
bit
uneven
still
a
drinkable
enough
beer
atmosphere
is
really
nice
lots
of
effervescence
giant
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
malty
earthy
and
hoppy
malt
hop
citrus
with
plenty
of
pungent

overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
1
finger
width
offwhite

bubbles
rapidly
raise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
and
tastes
of
floral
hops
along
with
a
balance
of
toasted
bready
malts
the
mouthfeel
starts
with
some
strong
carbonation
with
a
light
to
medium
body
a
bitter
finish
as
well
a
solid
india
pale
lager
would
be
a
great
sessionable
flavorable
brew
if
it
werent
for
its
6
7
abv
overall
a
good
brew
for
an
overhopped
lager
i
think
there
are
better
ipas
even
in
the
widmer
rotator
series
more
complex
in
aroma
than
flavor
bitterness
is
on
par
for
the
style
albeit
but
the
crisp
finish
makes
it
too
overwhelming
for
my
palate
and
malt
supports
the
hops
fairly
well
hop
character
is
a
bit
too
resiny
for
my
liking
overall
im
a
fan
of
where
this
style
is
headed
and
glad
to
see
widmer
jumping
on
it
a
good
one
for
not
only
hopheads
but
some
more
adventurous
lager
drinkers
a
good
addition
the
their
rotating
ipa
series
and
keeps
me
interested
in
trying
more
of
their
new
offerings
3
out
of
5
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
because
it
was
cheaper
than
sam
adams
double
agent
ipl
and
i
was
hoping
for
the
same
effect
dark
orange
color
good
suds
aroma
was
some
hops
bit
of
malt
boring
alas
this
is
not
as
good
it
does
have
a
grassy
hop
flavor
and
it
is
definitely
a
lager
but
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
much
for
me
given
the
style
id
go
back
to
the
sam
adams
offering
every
time
43

picked
this
up
from
the
widmers
brewery
an
indian
styled
pale
lager
i
classified
as
an
ipa
since
it
is
part
of
widmers
rotator
ipa
series
poured
from
the
bottle
clear
looking
amber
color
and
a
decent
one
finger
head
this
is
a
weird
one
from
a
smell
and
taste
perspective
has
all
the
crisp
clean
features
you
like
from
a
lager
but
there
is
a
nice
follow
through
of
hops
that
makes
it
a
much
more
interesting
beer
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
widmers
did
well
on
this
one
o
a
bit
better
than
any
big
manufactured
lager
ive
had
but
overall
average
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
but
it
seems
a
cut
above
most
american
adjunct
lagers
its
easy
to
drink
and
seems
like
it
would
pair
well
to
cool
off
some
spicy
vindaloo
if
you
are
eating
indian
food
ok
brew
the
malt
and
bitterness
isnt
cloying
or
horribly
out
of
balance
worked
well
with
my
meal
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
light
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
fairly
faint
but
i
am
getting
some
malt
grain
and
some
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
fruit
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
all
that
memorable
in
my
opinion
flying
horse
royal
lager
beer
35
somewhere
between
a
german
pilsner
and
an
american
light
adjunct
lager
this
beer
was
light
and
easy
drinking
with
german
bittering
hops
a
nice
strain
of
lager
yeast
and
corn
being
the
predominant
flavors
the
color
and
nose
were
nothing
special
inoffensive
at
best
boring
at
worst
mouthfeel
was
what
you
would
expect
heavy
carbonation
and
thin
without
being
watery
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
much
better
than
taj
mahal
brand
lager
but
not
something
would
willingly
drink
again
as
pedestrian
light
lagers
arent
my
thing
this
pours
what
is
worthy
of
calling
a
piss
yellow
color
with
a
carbonated
head
that
disappears
quickly
pour
this
in
a
glass
and
hand
it
to
someone
they
might
think
its
tainted
water
the
aroma
is
cheap
full
of
cheap
grains
with
that
classic
adjunct
scent
wow
this
light
taste
rivals
that
beer
called
miller
64
really
light
and
taste
less
other
than
cheap
corn
syrup
you
really
can
skip
over
this
one
i
got
a
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
from
my
pour
nose
was
grainy
and
malty
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
its
classification
as
an
aal
was
correct
color
was
a
lightyellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
honeylike
the
hallmark
of
real
unadulterated
lager
the
canquest
tm
has
caused
me
to
come
in
contact
with
far
too
many
aals
not
to
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
refreshing
i
was
very
glad
that
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
whirl
that
and
the
price
was
well
worthwhile
nice
yellow
golden
in
color
fuller
than
expected
for
a
lager
with
a
14
inch
of
bubbly
head
that
quickly
fades
smells
of
common
cereal
grains
mild
lager
yeasts
and
a
bit
of
fruity
corn
taste
was
better
than
expected
for
an
average
beer
with
good
sweetness
and
a
crisp
bite
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
worth
trying
lagers
of
india
o
a
little
more
character
than
im
used
to
for
the
style
not
something
is
go
back
to
but
good
its
own
right
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
pay
the
relative
expensive
price
for
yellow
beer
that
doesnt
even
have
a
funnystupid
ad
campaign
i
mean
what
exactly
does
this
stuff
cost
more
than
sierra
nevada
for
anyways
might
fool
some
chicks
into
thinking
you
drink
exotic
palatable
beer
but
i
cant
recommend
that
greasy
lifestyle
based
on
a
lie
all
that
said
it
is
an
adjunct
beer
the
flavors
are
mild
but
for
a
lawnmower
beer
it
is
good
so
i
would
order
it
again
in
a
pinch
o
not
a
bad
lager
really
refreshing
and
rather
crisp
and
went
very
well
with
my
spicy
chicken
tikka
masala
www
goodbeerhunting
com
tried
this
out
of
curiosity
but
id
have
to
call
it
even
worse
than
usual
deck
wash
apparently
countries
can
do
without
a
national
airline
but
they
still
have
to
have
a
cheap
lager
apologies
to
frank
z
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
it
again
but
im
happy
that
something
from
india
presented
itself
for
me
to
try
overall
flying
horse
is
decent
and
drinkable
nothing
more
nothing
less
this
is
a
olden
colored
beer
slightly
hazy
with
a
very
slight
head
there
is
a
serious
cereal
smell
vegetable
grass
and
healthy
dose
of
sulfurlike
scents
dry
and
grainy
this
beer
is
not
really
complex
still
the
slight
pale
malt
and
bitterness
is
not
distasteful
its
a
typical
macrostyle
lager
light
in
body
moderately
effervescent
and
soft
not
a
bad
particularly
beer
although
also
not
very
drinkable
it
pours
a
straw
yellow
but
has
a
heavier
body
than
it
looks
goes
down
very
easy
i
would
have
liked
more
head
but
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
when
i
go
to
another
indian
restaurant
drinkability
was
good
clean
and
light
profile
unremarkable
uninteresting
and
rather
forgettable
good
drinker
but
again
too
spritzy
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
this
beer
presents
with
a
decent
112
head
on
top
of
a
goldish
color
beer
there
is
a
dank
light
barley
smell
on
the
pour
which
is
followed
by
the
typical
lager
taste
there
is
a
malt
undertone
to
the
crisp
flavor
that
is
present
in
this
brew
sour
undertones
to
the
effervescent
nature
of
this
beer
it
is
very
light
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
in
your
mouth
and
there
is
little
to
no
aftertaste
it
would
be
easy
to
consume
multiple
bottles
of
this
beer
but
i
can
think
of
many
better
ways
to
spend
an
afternoon
d
very
much
your
runofthemill
indian
macrolager
but
refreshing
nonetheless
not
as
torturous
to
drink
as
one
might
think
and
also
a
good
complement
to
flavorful
indian
food
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
at
cork
and
fork
in
gainesville
650ml
bottle
poured
into
a
eggenberg
pilsner
glass
paired
with
chipolte
apple
glazed
steak
over
rice
with
green
beans
aroma
is
sweeter
and
more
fragrant
than
expected
from
an
adjunct
lager
carbonation
is
beautiful
thick
two
inches
of
pure
white
head
and
continual
fine
streams
of
bubbles
throughout
the
beer
flavor
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
has
a
strong
corn
backbone
almost
no
hop
bitterness
in
this
beer
this
is
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
and
great
to
get
a
cautious
bmc
drinker
into
deeper
waters
boring
and
not
recommended
d
this
is
not
a
good
beer
theres
no
reason
to
buy
this
beer
its
that
bad
this
is
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
dont
waste
your
money
on
it
ordered
for
6
75
while
at
himalayan
bistro
in
west
roxbury
split
with
my
wife
and
poured
into
pilsner
glasses
average
looking
beer
clear
yellow
color
lots
of
carbonation
smells
like
a
macro
lots
of
rice
and
corn
qualities
taste
was
not
horrible
but
nothing
great
matched
well
with
spicy
food
as
it
did
not
overpower
slightly
sticky
on
the
palate
at
the
end
worth
trying
once
but
price
would
probably
steer
me
towards
a
different
alternative
with
my
next
meal
not
even
the
suitable
environment
could
save
it
not
awful
not
particularly
memorable
either
and
i
could
have
had
a
decent
sixer
for
the
price
drinkability
this
beer
is
good
for
what
it
is
an
adjunct
lager
it
is
drinkable
and
i
could
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
either
drinkable
alone
but
if
thats
the
case
you
can
do
better
but
if
youre
having
a
curry
then
your
meal
will
benefit
from
this
beer
took
this
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
pilsener
pours
a
nice
crystal
clear
light
straw
yellow
with
a
wispy
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
like
superficial
and
light
malt
the
some
citrusy
notes
noble
hops
taste
is
just
average
not
too
much
more
than
a
mass
produced
lager
mouthfeel
is
thin
drinkability
isnt
bad
flying
horse
royal
lager
is
a
descent
beer
to
enjoy
while
dining
on
indian
cuisine
stand
alone
i
would
not
buy
it
off
the
shelf
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
out
of
a
22oz
bottle
with
a
moderately
sized
foamy
head
smell
is
somewhat
yeasty
taste
is
pleasant
with
a
crisp
pale
yellow
with
huge
carbonation
bubbles
coming
up
keeping
a
firm
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
that
didnt
last
long
aroma
is
very
interesting
its
not
quite
skunked
but
has
some
very
herbal
earthy
and
grassy
aromas
theres
also
a
certain
toastiness
to
the
nose
flavor
matches
up
with
the
nose
some
sweet
honey
like
malts
cooked
veggieness
with
a
dose
of
herbal
earthy
hoppiness
not
tasting
much
in
the
way
of
adjuncts
such
as
corn
this
is
light
to
medium
bodied
utterly
drying
and
crisp
fairly
drinkable
but
these
particular
flavors
arent
really
my
thing
d
easy
enough
to
drink
just
not
very
interesting
d
as
lagers
go
this
one
is
decent
that
doesnt
make
it
a
good
beer
some
components
of
it
were
alright
but
on
the
whole
it
was
an
uninteresting
beer
im
not
quite
sure
why
this
beer
is
rated
so
low
my
buddy
and
i
split
a
bomber
and
found
it
an
exceptional
lager
maybe
another
tasting
will
disappoint
but
this
one
was
memorable
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
and
malty
with
pear
and
grain
as
well
as
hints
of
apple
and
hay
this
is
offset
with
a
light
hoppy
bitterness
with
faint
light
grass
and
apple
peel
it
has
a
faint
interesting
musty
quality
as
well
its
also
clean
and
easy
to
drink
split
a
bottle
of
this
with
a
friend
over
a
meal
of
spicy
indian
food
undistinguished
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
and
all
kinds
of
carbonation
the
latter
is
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
as
the
fizz
helps
cut
the
spice
in
the
food
just
like
seltzer
water
does
in
fact
the
body
is
akin
to
seltzer
water
and
the
taste
isnt
far
from
that
either
i
detected
a
bit
of
lemon
and
hay
plus
some
green
vegetables
in
both
the
taste
and
the
aroma
not
much
else
of
interest
in
this
one
i
imagine
this
is
best
taken
with
food
as
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
on
its
own
and
is
suitable
for
rinsing
before
taking
the
next
bite
comments
too
bad
i
didnt
have
any
spicy
curryladened
foods
to
go
along
with
this
beer
as
the
annoying
bitter
aftertaste
wouldnt
dissipate
on
its
own
this
was
a
gift
and
i
am
glad
that
i
didnt
pay
money
for
this
beer
d
an
ok
macro
style
lager
that
paired
well
with
spicy
indian
food
the
flavor
is
rather
clean
with
the
emphasis
on
cereal
grain
flavors
i
like
the
carbonation
level
that
prickles
the
tongue
the
finish
is
provides
a
mini
hop
snap
a
middle
of
the
road
lager
that
is
quite
drinkable
this
one
pours
a
bright
straw
yellow
with
a
tall
slightly
offwhite
head
that
retains
suprisingly
well
and
also
leaves
small
amounts
of
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
with
hints
of
corn
and
grains
the
taste
upfront
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
malts
controling
the
startmidway
a
nice
shift
to
some
slightly
spicy
hops
blends
with
a
earthy
dryness
that
lasts
longer
than
expected
the
finish
is
semi
burnt
feelingstrange
for
such
a
light
brew
and
very
dry
uniquebut
not
offensive
or
that
interesting
either
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
light
foamy
head
of
23
fingers
easily
that
quickly
dissipates
nose
is
not
skunky
but
not
complex
taste
isnt
skunky
either
and
light
but
good
reminds
me
of
the
steel
rail
of
indian
beers
i
could
kick
back
a
few
large
bottles
without
a
problem
stuff
like
many
asian
lagers
this
is
best
suited
for
drinking
with
food
in
my
opinion
while
decent
on
its
own
it
fails
to
impress
me
thus
i
will
probably
only
have
this
again
unless
im
at
an
indian
restaurant
or
something
similar
overall
i
tried
this
along
with
authentic
indian
food
at
a
local
restaurant
cafe
tandoori
and
was
a
good
compliment
to
the
spicy
food
by
itself
though
the
flavors
seemed
a
bit
offmaybe
due
to
an
old
bottle
like
stale
bread
and
cardboard
drank
below
average
not
sure
id
have
this
one
again
probably
only
if
it
was
a
choice
between
bmc
this
then
its
more
about
princible
than
taste
left
about
4ozs
in
the
glass
i
usually
never
waste
beer
it
wasnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
it
went
well
with
the
spicy
indian
food
we
were
eating
same
thing
as
drinking
kirin
at
a
japanese
restaurant
its
just
about
right
for
the
food
the
more
i
drink
this
it
gives
a
sourish
flavor
d
this
beer
must
go
with
food
which
is
how
i
enjoyed
it
i
scored
it
slightly
above
average
for
that
reason
my
dinner
was
masalaspiced
prawns
and
aromatic
rice
the
beer
provided
a
nice
clean
backdrop
on
which
to
enjoy
those
flavors
i
suppose
i
could
have
said
the
same
about
any
of
a
number
of
macro
lagers
still
it
was
a
novelty
trying
one
from
india
and
having
it
paired
with
indian
cuisine
though
probably
my
first
and
last
flying
horse
it
was
good
enough
for
me
on
this
night
as
far
as
united
breweries
beer
goes
flying
horse
loses
to
taj
mahal
by
a
nose
and
finishes
quite
a
few
lengths
ahead
of
kingfisher
like
most
beer
from
this
country
i
would
never
buy
a
bottle
to
enjoy
on
its
own
but
would
have
no
problem
ordering
it
in
an
indian
restaurant
to
douse
the
heat
from
a
plate
of
vindaloo
curry
drinkability

this
was
drinkable
barely
so
but
drinkable
meh
an
overall
average
beer
nothing
special
but
not
terrible
either
id
drink
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
i
will
mention
that
it
went
very
well
with
my
lamb
curry
i
did
notice
that
the
carbonation
level
was
a
bit
high
as
noted
by
other
reviewers
but
i
didnt
have
a
problem
with
it
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
was
definitely
superior
to
nails
but
thats
about
the
highest
praise
i
can
give
it
mouthfeel
is
round
with
a
little
bite
on
the
tongue
a
very
refreshing
lighter
style
of
beer
thats
worth
a
try
cheers

the

on
the
finish
its
crisp

refreshing
but
lacking

i
still
wont

bad

overly
aired

with
hints
of

some

nothing
offensive
nothing
attractive
average
taste
is
not
good
at
all
really
poor
imo
it
has
some
wheat
undertones
that
give
way
to
spice
which
is
not
what
id
expect
the
hoppiness
that
i
did
experience
felt
like
it
was
coming
from
a
jar
really
strange
kick
to
it
the
carbonation
really
hurt
any
attempt
at
having
it
with
the
food
being
served
as
it
amplified
all
the
tastes
and
aromas
while
simultaneously
contaminating
them
i
went
to
pick
up
my
indian
carryout
order
a
few
minutes
early
so
i
could
belly
up
to
the
bar
and
drain
one
i
initially
picked
taj
mahal
but
at
the
last
minute
changed
my
mind
to
this
one
i
dont
think
ive
had
it
before
and
in
comparison
i
was
getting
an
extra
0
3
abv
bang
for
my
buck
its
to
the
point
now
where
any
new
lager
i
try
is
expected
to
be
fairly
boring
but
im
always
hoping
for
some
unique
characteristic
to
shine
through
with
flying
horse
there
is
a
noticable
hint
of
sweet
corn
the
morningurine
yellow
appearance
reinforces
this
trait
which
is
normally
a
reminder
that
im
drinking
cheaply
produced
swill
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
red
stripe
which
i
think
also
imparts
this
same
sweet
grain
flavor
but
flying
horse
is
more
extreme
in
this
regard
did
i
just
use
the
word
extreme
in
a
lager
review
well
not
extreme
but
very
noticable
when
put
up
against
any
other
standard
import
lager
from
europe
or
elsewhere
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
though
in
the
macro
lager
catagory
it
doesnt
take
a
whole
lot
to
impress
not
much
to
speak
of
bland
adjunct
crap
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
standard
run
of
the
mill
lager
but
my
first
from
india
why
is
it
that
everyone
but
europe
and
america
makes
ultralight
beers
650
ml
bottle
this
was
a
drain
pour
for
about
450
ml
not
recommended
ok
after
finishing
my
bottle
of
taj
mahal
i
decided
to
try
something
different
and
picked
this
baby
oh
my
was
it
bad
taj
mahal
is
not
a
great
beer
but
paired
with
indian
food
i
find
it
tasty
and
satisfying
this
was
neither
pale
tasteless
and
the
faint
smell
of
straw
was
all
this
beer
could
muster
they
cant
all
be
5s
or
4s
for
that
matter
maybe
the
kingfisher
will
be
better
ill
try
that
next
time
pretty
wellcharged
a
big
fizzy
head
of
an
inch
on
a
slow

though

and
clear
appearance
little

on
the

aroma
quite
a
bit
of
green
apple
skin
some
honey
to
the

but
very
fruity
flavor
tart
and
with
more
decided
apple
tones
approaching
fermented
cider
mid
mouth
light
body
medium
carbonation
hands
off
to
a
crisp
hoppiness
near
the
close
but
with
tangy
notes
remaining
has
a
little
character
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
makes
more
of
an
impression
than
other
united
breweries
lagers
like
taj
mahal
i
look
forward
to
ordering
more
of
these
flying
horse
pours
an
absolutely
crystalclear
deepgolden
body
that
teems
with
swirling
clouds
of
tiny
effervescent
bubbles
beneath
a
longlasting
head
of
frothy
brightwhite
foam
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
about
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
a
soft
grainy
maltiness
and
a
mildly
herbal
and
grassy
hoppiness
thats
very
european
the
body
is
medium
with
a
finebubbled
carbonation
thats
crisp
on
the
tongue
before
allowing
it
to
smoothly
fade
away
the
flavor
delivers
a
unusual
maltiness
thats
a
touch
sweetish
and
grainy
with
an
odd
nuttiness
to
it
as
if
some
wheat
was
included
in
the
grain
bill
the
grassy
herbal
and
delicately
spicy
hop
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
against
the
malt
and
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
that
could
be
a
bit
sharper
but
still
gets
the
job
done
its
less
bitter
than
most
german
pilseners
but
theres
definitely
something
going
on
it
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
maltiness
thats
bumped
by
a
swirl
of
hops
and
then
residual
bitterness
its
an
impressive
lager
considering
that
its
coming
out
of
india
a
country
not
known
for
its
beer
and
interestingly
this
pils
has
a
softness
and
lingering
quality
to
it
that
works
really
well
with
indian
foods
it
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
the
creaminess
delicate
spiciness
subtle
raisin
fruitiness
and
cashew
nuttiness
of
navratan
korma
more
of
a
food
beer
than
a
friday
night
quaffer
but
still
pretty
good
regardless
an
ok
brew
drinkable
yet
different
perfectly
clear
and
golden
straw
in
color
topped
with
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
dies
out
and
leaves
little
lace
sweet
grains
dominate
the
rather
nondescript
nosenot
unpleasant
but
lacking
depth
and
daring
the
same
is
true
of
the
taste
which
is
dominated
by
the
almost
syrupy
malts
that
far
overshadow
the
hops
though
theres
a
pleasant
bit
of
crispness
at
the
outset
the
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
wellbalanced
and
this
beer
is
surely
quite
drinkable
but
im
bound
to
reach
for
something
that
promises
more
character
the
taste
is
fairly
subtle
but
decent
like
most
indian
beers
ive
had
the
taste
is
not
all
that
broad
however
elements
such
as
the
slight
woodiness
and
sweetness
round
out
the
taste
enough
to
bring
it
up
one
notch
above
average
it
has
a
lovely
way
of
bringing
out
a
kind
of
pepperiness
in
the
indian
food
but
aside
from
that
pairing
i
doubt
id
seek
out
this
beer
this
came
in
a
big
22oz
bottle
with
a
little
note
attached
very
impressive
and
made
me
expect
a
good
quality
beer
to
the
review
pours
a
boring
yellowgolden
color
with
little
head
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
skunky
and
yeasty
with
a
breadlike
appeal
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
but
still
has
a
slight
bit
of
skunkiness
to
it
clean
taste
mostly
malt
in
the
flavor
very
average
for
a
lager
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
wonderful
either
nothing

i
think
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
had
a
medium
sized
white
creamy
head
with
small
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
with
carbonation
present
the
hue
was
light
gold
and
the
lacing
was
only
fair
on
the
sides
of
glass
the
nose
was
citrusy
and
fruity
the
flavor
was
bitter
with
an

and

along
with
an

of

clean

good

and
throughly
enjoyable
with
a
little
note
tied
to
the

and
a

sort
of
anticipated
something
special

alas
a

relieves
itself
the

as

with

desired
hops
the
white

disappeared
before
i
could
fully
examine
it
the
hops
appear
to
be
an
afterthought
that
said
this
mildly
sweet
and
dry
beer
is
still
quite
drinkable
pours
a
light
yellow
with
thinly
bubbled

malty
slight
yeast
presence
but
not
really
very
prevalent
nicely
balanced
bready
yesty
flavors
come
through
with
a
clean
finish
not
overly
sweet
but
still
a
touch
of
sweetness
though
its
not
a
beer
i
would
activrly
seek
out
it
went
well
with
indian
food
and
had
a
nice
palate
cleansing
effect
not
a
bad
lager
but
nothing
special
either
wasnt
expecting
muchbut
i
was
somewhat
pleasantly
suprised
poured
straw
color
with
good
head
smelled
rather
yeasty
and
breadlike
tasted
like
a
traditional
lager
was
somewhat
floral
and
to
me
very
yeasty
to
me
it
was
the
equivalent
of
molson
in
a
lotta
ways
so
it
was
to
bad
got
it
for
free
so
i
am
not
complaining
the
prototypical
lager
pour
a
translucent
gold
color
the
head
impressive
the
color
bright
white
and
the
texture
frothy
as
it
evanesces
the
lace
left
behind
is
a
fine
covering
sheet
upon
the
glass
quintessential
lager
nose
all
malt
somewhat
sweet
with
the
start
also
mostly
malt
and
lightly
sweet
the
top
thin
and
unimpressive
the
finish
lightly
hopped
mild
on
the
carbonation
the
aftertaste
dry
and
lingering
another
average
lager
drinkable
but
nothing
that
would
make
me
buy
it
again
notes
a
decent
pale
lager
that
does
a
good
job
of
cleansing
the
mouth
for
the
next
sip
beer
or
bite
of
food
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
on
its
own
or
with
spicy
hot
indian
food
very
nicely
hopped
not
bad
for
the
lager
category
only
issue
is
the
carbonation
i
would
like
to
like
more
i
usually
have
1
everytime
i
go
to
indian
dinner
goes
well
with
indian
curry
they
say
a
combination
that
could
lead
to
a
day
sat
on
the
toilet
not
a
bad
drop
really
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
may
not
wow
the
ipa
hophead
crowd
but
delivers
a
decently
crafted
lager
experience
for
those
seeking
a
mild
refreshing
maltforward
beer
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
to
be
fussed
over
its
a
beer
for
when
you
want
something
that
pairs
well
with
spicy
downanddirty
curry
certainly
gets
the
job
done
refreshing
easy
drinking
food
beer
no
am
in
india
sippin
on
the
suds
tasted
decent
enough
fair
bit
of
carbonation
stong
malt
aftertaste
that
lingers
good
flavors
up
front
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
finish
poured
into
a
nonic
glass
pours
a
light
straw
amber
with
gold
tints
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
to
patches
served
too
cold
at
a
restaurant
aroma
is
light
grainy
malt
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
flavor
is
similar
grainy
malt
and
light
grassy
hops
but
has
some
nice
biscuit
malt
flavors
in
the
finish
that
redeemed
it
and
made
it
a
nice
accompaniment
to
an
indian
restaurant
meal
light
bodied
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
so
this
light
slightly
grainy
lager
was
fine
for
dinner
the
biscuity
finish
was
more
enjoyable
than
i
expected
and
i
would
consider
this
again
for
a
similar
meal
rather
than
a
sweeter
adjunct
style
lager
my
review
its
from
india
nice
taste
but
look
while
being
poured
was
well
interesting
overall
whilst
this
is
still
just
a
pretty
standard
macro
lager
it
is
better
than
your
average
pretty
good
for
au43
a
case
too
good
only
for
cooking
sausages
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
final
grade
3
00
a
c
grade
kingfisher
premium
is
actually
a
decent
industrial
lager
but
not
at
canadian
import
prices
the
flavour
grew
on
me
a
little
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
glass
but
not
enough
to
give
this
anything
more
than
a
mediocre
grade
because
it
is
just
a
mediocre
pale
lager
if
youre
at
an
indian
restaurant
and
the
beer
selection
is
limited
this
would
be
a
viable
option
but
i
cant
envision
a
situation
where
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
again
its
usually
what
i
can
find
at
an
indian
restaurant
its
okay
for
cutting
spiciness
but
overall
a
pretty
mediocre
brew
its
grainy
and
dry
without
any
real
character
this
beer
tasted
so
much
better
in
india
i
had
it
in
the
states
and
didnt
care
for
it
if
you
get
a
chance
to
go
to
india
definitely
give
it
a
try
overall
this
is
a
less
than
average
lager
definitely
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
a
hell
of
a
long
way
removed
from
the
worst
when
i
drank
this
in
india
you
had
to
up
end
it
in
water
to
let
the
glycerine
fall
out
or
it
gave
the
runs
that
said
in
the
thar
desert
it
was
pretty
drinkable
but
we
were
so
thirsty
we
may
have
settled
for
camel
piss
and
this
beer
i
suspect
is
not
far
removed
the
flavour
lingers
for
a
good
time
which
is
always
nice
if
you
are
drinking
something
good
but
in
this
case
it
is
not
kingfisher
in
the
uk
is
noticeable
higher
of
quality
there
are
so
many
worse
examples
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
bland
beer
its
a
decent
beer
i
grabbed
only
one
of
these
at
my
local
liquor
store
where
you
can
awesomely
make
your
own
6pack
i
was
excited
to
try
something
new
and
out
of
the
ordinary
i
thought
it
might
be
tasty
in
likeness
of
a
stella
or
maybe
some
other
familiar
green
bottle
beer
like
moosehead
i
was
wrong
and
i
wont
ever
try
it
again
overall
if
im
going
to
drink
a
green
bottled
lager
ill
choose
any
beer
but
this
one
next
time
if
there
ever
will
be
a
next
time
only
reason
i
would
ever
drink
this
crap
is
because
it
is
the
only
blind
option
on
tap
at
bengal
brasserie
wetherby
i
felt
sick
from
the
oily
old
hops
beer
does
go
with
curry
ipa
perhaps
i
am
told
but
this
does
nothing
to
support
the
dishes
at
all
ok
and
drinkable
but
not
much
taste
there
i
have
been
able
to
procure
this
beer
at
various
binnys
beverage
depots
in
the
chicago
red
robin
liquors
in
berwyn
illinois
and
feldmans
market
in
mcallen
texas
it
was
one
of
the
more
popular
indian
brands
in
the
united
states
it
pours
clear
golden
small
but
persistent
head
and
above
average
carbonation
it
has
pleasantly
bitter
set
taste
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
grains
it
goes
down
smooth
without
much
of
an
edge
leaves
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
and
is
light
and
less
filling
o
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
but
it
does
pair
really
well
with
spicy
indian
food
and
really
cuts
through
the
spiciness
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
beer
i
will
be
getting
regularly
pours
a
mostly
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
leaving
a
moderate
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
light
sweet
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
very
light
spicy
hops
the
flavor
is
light
sweet
bready
malt
with
light
hop
and
little
else
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
watery
mouthfeel
straight
forward
macro
lager
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
loaded
with
bland
i
could
drink
this
if
i
had
to
or
if
it
were
105
degrees
but
given
the
chance
i
would
pick
something
else
first
o
theres
nothing
really
special
that
stands
out
about
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
have
too
much
in
the
way
of
adjunct
aromas
or
flavors
it
seems
like
it
would
help
take
the
bite
out
of
spicy
indian
food
o
this
certainly
isnt
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
anytime
soon
this
is
domestically
mass
produced
under
supervision
from
kingfisher
i
think
there
are
better
indian
beers
out
there
worth
trying
in
this
case
i
think
kingfisher
is
trying
to
mimic
other
major
domestic
lagers
if
this
is
the
case
the
set
the
bar
low
and
just
cleared
the
bar
o
typical
aa
lager
reminding
me
of
pabst
blue
ribbon
but
more
watery
still
its
got
more
taste
than
some
aa
lagers
the
taste
has
a
big
grainy
and
husky
flavor
with
a
low
pale
lager
like
hop
finish
vaguely
dry
o
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
has
more
flavor
than
typical
adjuncts
but
not
something
i
would
reach
for
again
good
only
if
youre
eating
indian
food
not
worth
a
separate
purchase
overall
im
not
at
all
impressed
with
this
beer
refreshing
floral
and
sweet
pale
lagers
aint
so
bad
when
you
dont
throw
a
bunch
of
rice
in
it
kingfisher
premium
lager
beer
35
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
interfere
with
the
flavor
of
the
indian
food
i
was
eating
but
i
cant
see
myself
ever
ordering
this
utterly
unremarkable
beer
ever
again
considering
my
overall
aversion
to
the
sweetness
i
was
surprised
to
find
a
couple
of
sips
somewhat
enjoyable
perhaps
it
was
the
freshness
of
the
can
i
drank
it
on
12
november
and
the
can
was
manufactured
on
07
november
or
maybe
the
seasoned
puffed
rice
that
i
snacked
on
as
i
sipped
cut
some
of
the
sweetness
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
golden
color
and
quite
nice
looking
with
its
nice
white
head
however
the
head
did
not
hang
around
long
the
beer
also
had
a
little
bit
of
that
skunky
becks
smell
thank
goodness
it
did
not
taste
that
way
it
did
have
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
though
not
bad
i
will
buy
again
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
very
small
head
there
is
a
slight
scent
of
grains
and
hops
but
nothing
all
that
strong
the
taste
is
pretty
average
for
an
imported
lager
there
is
a
decent
taste
of
grains
and
citrus
mixed
with
some
slight
hops
smooth
and
mellow
that
delivers
an
overall
light
and
refreshing
taste
a
lot
better
tasting
then
you
would
expect
from
an
indian
beer
overall
a
fairly
typical
euro
lager
although
it
is
not
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
just
does
not
finish
dry
enough
for
me
o
there
arent
too
many
good
things
to
say
about
kingfisher
premium
lager
other
than
its
a
fairly
inoffensive
clean
crisp
lighter
beer
to
wash
down
food
or
perhaps
quench
your
thirst
on
a
humid
day
i
wouldnt
turn
one
away
though
because
this
allmalt
no
frills
4
8
abv
lager
is
just
slightly
above
average
in
my
book
in
all
its
forms
this
beer
is
pretty
sub
par
pours
a
clear
yellow
wheat
color
with
nice
rising
carbonation
but
a
quickly
fading
head
smells
a
bit
skunked
possibly
a
product
of
the
green
bottle
but
a
bit
rancid
in
odor
also
some
undigested
sugars
that
still
remain
are
present
flavor
is
about
the
same
as
the
nose
a
little
like
cold
white
toast
but
with
some
sweetness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
redeems
it
its
cold
and
crisp
lively
on
the
tongue
and
clean
very
light
body
easy
drinker
if
you
dont
mind
the
taste
overall
a
beer
that
is
impossibly
unsatisfying
as
a
last
drink
before
2
weeks
of
sobriety
but
one
that
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
as
a
first
drink
after
those
2
weeks
thats
about
all
i
say
for
kingfisher
this
beer
is
lucky
while
it
tastes
pretty
bad
compared
to
any
craft
beer
it
is
the
most
popular
and
most
available
beer
in
india
the
colour
is
pale
golden
and
always
served
very
very
cold
almost
get
a
head
freeze
very
very
carbonated
and
will
keep
you
gassy
and
burping
not
to
mention
pissy
for
a
long
time
goes
well
with
indian
food
most
lagers
go
well
with
spicy
food
gets
warm
very
soon
and
tastes
terrible
when
at
room
temperature
undrinkable
actually
edit
noticed
a
bottle
of
this
in
the
back
of
my
dads
fridge
last
time
i
visited
maybe
ill
crack
it
open
and
see
if
its
actually
as
bad
as
it
was
on
tap
at
the
brewery

color

day
bit
too
much
of
a
bud
lightlike
aftertaste
for
an
unremarkable
beer
but
enjoyable
in
cultural
context
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
light
and
crisp
overall
not
a
bad
lager
which
really
doesnt
deserve
the
below
average
rating
not
my
best
style
so
it
would
only
be
something
i
would
order
again
if
at
the
restaurant
a
friend
brought
it
over
for
me
to
try
so
i
split
it
with
him
golden
yellow
pour
good

the
aroma
at
first
is
off
after
a
minute
or
2
kinda
bland
the
taste
is
light
some
grassy
hops
finishes
slightly
bitter
the
body
is
light
good
carbonation
not
something
i
would
pick
up
but
if
offered
it
is
not
terrible
poured

my
only
clean
glassware
at
the
time
appears
straw
yellow
with
a
fading
collar
of
white
foam
presents
a
very
strong
cooked
corn
aroma
combined
with
a

aroma
tastes
like
a
helping
of
overcooked
corn
and
gym
socks
on
a
slab
of
wet
moldy
cardboard
light
body
but
i
didnt
get
too
far
into
it
before
pouring
the
rest
of
it
down
the
drain
if
this
is
what
they
consider
premium
i
shudder
to
think
what
the
normal
version
would
be
like

guess
dthis

of
a
six
pack
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
the
best
lager
that
i
have
ever
had
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
great
brewed
in
ny
from
a
beers
of
the
world
mix
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
smell
would
lead
you
to
believe
but
it
is
just
lightly
flavored
macro
weak
malt
skunk
and
wisps
of
hops
would
sum
up
this
beer
light
bodied
with
abundant
carbonation
i
would
definately
pass
on
this
beer
in
the
future
d
scored
a
4
because
you
can
drink
these
all
day
and
thats
the
problem
aftertaste
is
minimal
but
present
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
bunch
of
this
brew
because
it
is
pretty
disappointing
d
i
would
not
under
any
circumstances
order
another
one
though
i
might
be
willing
to
try
a
bottle
and
see
if
there
was
simply
a
problem
with
it
on
tap
where
i
had
it
though
the
lines
on
the
bud
seemed
fine
so
i
do
not
think
that
was
the
problem
d

have
to

versions
of
this

a
try

but
not

no
stickiness
to
speak
of
pretty
sad
looking

word

but
stronger
taste
is
pale
noble

buttery
flavors
i
dont
see
myself

it
skunky
or
just
how
this
should
taste
either
way
drain
pour
overall
watery
and
characterless
adjunct
lager
on
the
bright
side
it
can
be
quite
refreshing
better
than
the
others
beers
from
india
that
i
have
already
tasted
d
not
very
tasty
doesnt
go
down
too
easily
not
filling
at
all
which
is
about
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
it
if
were
going
to
drink
a
beer
that
tasted
like
this
i
would
prefer
to
spend
very
little
money
and
drink
something
that
i
know
isnt
supposed
to
be
very
good
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
about
a
half
inch
head
mild
carbonation
remained
throughout
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
sweet
fruit
tones
and
lemonycitrus
hop
flavor
nothing
overwhelming
here
but
after
the
fairly
awful
taj
mahal
this
was
welcome
i
found
the
smell
agreeable
with
malt
barley
grain
of
some
sort
nothing
too
skunky
a
dry
hoppy
taste
and
mouthfeel
with
a
crisp
clean
lager
finish
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
thats
pretty
typical
overall
this
is
better
than
typical
i
agree
with
jettjon
and
with
the
more
recent
reviews
of
kingfisher
this
beer
was
likely
reformulated
or
quality
control
has
been
improved
overall
pretty
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
i
am
not
overly
impressed
nor
am
i
overly
disappointed
it
is
about
what
i
expected
yet
another
exotic
standard
lager
a
wiessbier
would
have
suited
the
tandoori
dish
better
note
the
bottle
stated
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
saratoga
springs
ny
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
a
bit
like
a
quality
german
lager
only
not
quite
as
good
better
than
i
would
have
expected
from
an
indian
brewer
for
some
reason
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
i
tried
this
beer
on
september
4
2007
after
purchasing
it
from
my
local
lcbo
this
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
it
poured
into
the
glass
smoothly
with
a
small
white
head
the
colour
was
a
translucent
gold
with
tons
of
effervescence
the
aroma
was
putrid
too
much
like
budwesier
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
and
watery
none
of
the
carbonation
as
seen
in
the
glass
the
taste
was
very
reminiscent
of
north
american
pale
lagers
as
well
dpretty
drinkable
with
indian
food
i
would
never
choose
this
for
a
relaxing
drink
but
it
served
its
purpose
well
green
12oz
bottle
with
no
visible
date
of
bottling
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
some
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
mimics
the
aroma
with
some
malt
and
a
spicy
and
grassy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
am
looking
for
from
a
lager
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
that
is
recommended
drinkability
kingfisher
is
a
tiny
stepup
from
the
average
macro
lager
and
it
does
a
good
job
of
rescuing
those
like
me
with
acid
reflux
from
indian
food
anyway
it
does
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
do
which
is
counterbalance
the
spiciness
of
the
cuisine
no
real
adjuncty
notes
in
the
aroma
or
flavour
which
is
good
colour
is
pale
but
not
sickly
carbonation
is
very
high
but
again
its
supposed
to
be
to
clear
the
hot
from
your
palate
honestly
in
the
category
of
american
macro
lagers
id
probably
rather
have
this
one
than
most
others
and
it
was
great
to
drink
it
in
its
homeland
not
really
so
sure
why
i
picked
this
one
up
probabaly
because
i
had
not
seen
it
before
which
is
the
reason
i
pick
up
most
of
my
brews
anyway
hell
it
was
worth
a
shot
right
poured
a
dull
golden
yellow
small
fizzy
white
head
quickly
faded
leaving
only
some
token
lace
behind
which
iteslef
left
leaving
a
dull
non
carbonated
yellow
liquid
smell
was
musty
and
grainy
with
no
really
depth
too
it
the
taste
followed
suit
dull
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
but
otherwise
pretty
non
descript
decent
light
mouth
feel
and
a
easy
drinking
are
about
it
on
this
one
served
cold
could
be
a
session
beer
but
i
would
rather
have
it
as
a
forget
it
beer
nothing
really
to
see
move
on
d
this
is
a
fairly
typical
american
macro
lager
it
is
better
than
their
light
beer
din
the
end
this
is
an
alright
beer
doesnt
offend
and
it
doesnt
thrill
i
suppose
this
is
one
of
the
better
indian
beers
available
so
if
i
were
at
an
indian
restaurant
i
would
probably
choose
this
overall
a
regular
lager
slight
hint
of
hops
in
aroma
pours
a
clear
yellow
it
tastes
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
and
nice
balance
of
bitterness
to
the
malts
nothing
special
about
this
lager
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
on
tap
in
bangalore
india
leaves
a
hint
of
hops
in
aftertaste
d
goes
down
smooth
this
is
actually
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
ive
had
much
more
allaround
taste
than
the
standard
bmc
beers
i
had
it
with
indian
food
and
it
the
taste
still
came
through
all
of
the
curry
spices
certainly
wouldnt
buy
it
to
have
at
home
but
its
not
a
bad
option
at
an
indian
restaurant
this
one
is
a
little
hoppier
than
others
in
the
style
but
its
still
relatively
flavorless
and
plain
mf
grippy
stingy
would
pass
if
ice
cold
and
i
was
in
india
and
couldnt
get
anything
else
beer
wise
but
seeing
as
im
not
in
india
pass
im
amending
this
because
im
now
having
another
terrible
one
and
overall
ive
just
had
too
many
bad
examples
and
the
reader
if
there
is
one
for
my
dribble
deserves
to
know
what
theyre
getting
into
if
you
get
one
thats
been
handled
badly
it
tastes
like
vinegar
wow
just
undrinkable
really
really
retchingly
horrible
makes
me
want
to
do
a
shot
of
formaldehyde
to
cleanse
my
palate
tastes
alright
not
good
not
horrible
definitely
better
than
it
smells
or
feels
somehow
i
doubt
they
use
only
the
finest
malted
barley
and
hops
as
it
screams
cornrice
at
me
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
cold
free
one
if
i
was
thirsty
this
beer
tasted
rather
light
with
tones
of
malt
up
front
there
were
some
faint
hints
of
caramel
and
some
sweetness
in
the
flavor
the
malt
was
followed
up
by
a
slight
hint
of
dry
hop
flavor
in
the
after
taste
it
seemed
to
be
very
balanced
and
medium
bodied
decent
offering
that
went
down
easy
tasted
good
with
the
buffet
of
indian
food
we
ate
this
brew
certainly
provided
a
good
mouth
feel
and
a
decent
flavor
it
is
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
decent
beer
to
try
again
not
the
worst
american
macro
i
have
had
before
it
certainly
captures
the
style
had
ontap
at
an
indian
curry
house
dec
2011
a
lot
better
when
taken
with
a
hot
dish
as
i
intimated
in
my
original
review
not
altered
the
scores
just
letting
anybodyeverybody
know
it
isnt
as
bad
as
my
score
indicates
had
this
at
an
indian
restaurant
one
night
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
it
was
brewed
in
saratoga
springs
ny
pours
a
golden
yellowish
color
somewhat
hazy
a
one
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
not
a
whole
lot
of
nose
going
on
here
some
faint
malt
taste
upfront
is
tangy
and
some
mild
hop
bitterness
i
found
this
be
a
rather
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
certainly
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
would
order
again
if
at
an
indian
restaurant
poured
the
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
a
nice
light
appearance
with
a
thick
white
head
that
kind
of
had
a
soapsuds
look
to
it
similiar
to
corona
the
head
was
well
retained
throughout
the
beer
with
some
decent
lacing
a
interesting
malty
smell
that
reminded
me
very
much
of
an
american
macro
interestingly
enough
while
claimed
to
be
from
india
it
was
listed
as
brewed
and
bottled
by
an
american
company
not
very
pleasing
to
me
considering
it
came
in
a
beer
from
around
the
world
sampler
i
picked
up
a
smooth
malty
taste
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
here
but
it
was
similiar
to
bud
mixed
with
miller
lite
it
was
an
okay
mouthfeel
but
wasnt
overly
impressed
pretty
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
or
just
prefer
a
beer
with
an
american
macro
flair
i
suppose
this
would
be
ideal
with
a
hot
curry
but
by
itself
its
not
very
good
perhaps
ill
pair
with
food
next
time
and
give
another
opinion
good
to
drink
with
a
curry
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
test
on
its
own
d
pretty
standard
lager
could
drink
a
fair
amount
but
get
bored
very
easy
this
is
a
typical
american
macro
on
the
bottle
it
said
it
was
brewed
and
bottled
in
new
york
served
in
a
pint
glass
at
an
indian
restaurant
in
the
village
gold
with
halfinch
head
smelled
skunky
and
tasted
skunky
similar
to
heineken
but
not
as
good
it
was
easy
to
drink
though
but
after
a
few
youd
probably
get
bored
skip
it
pours
to
a
dark
golden
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
has
the
typical
grainy
aroma
yet
not
to
the
point
of
skunky
like
many
cheap
import
lagers
taste
was
light
and
decent
with
no
real
outstanding
aspect
and
the
finish
was
slightly
bitter
yet
smooth
overall
this
was
better
than
many
of
its
brethren
ive
had
enjoyed
this
one
with
some
bengal
lentils
i
whipped
up
for
the
ohio
stiowa
game
tonight
pours
a
handsome
clear
golden
without
more
than
a
cap
of
head
but
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
nose
is
fresh
with
yeast
but
mostly
contains
sour
adjuncts
taste
is
dry
and
has
a
chunk
of
chasing
bitterness
but
its
not
as
clean
as
id
normaly
like
although
decent
for
cleaning
up
extra
turmeric
and
ginger
from
the
palate
the
spicier
the
food
the
better
this
will
hold
up
mouthfeel
is
ordinary
at
best
too
many
bubbles
that
hinder
the
already
injured
taste
good
for
curry
chutney
etc
but
not
really
for
everyday
consumption
a
light
yellow
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
eight
of
an
inch
white
head
the
scent
of
roasted
barley
with
a
touch
of
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
the
flavor
of
the
barley
is
evident
but
nothing
to
spectacular
watery
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
leaves
a
tinglingsensation
on
the
palate
nothing
to
great
a
below
average
beer
drinkability
ill
pass
thanks
ive
had
three
indian
beers
now
and
none
of
them
have
been
at
all
impressive
for
the
sake
of
the
subcontinent
i
hope
its
just
that
the
good
stuff
isnt
being
imported
opinion
well
i
was
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
from
the
appearance
to
the
flavor
this
beer
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
the
sad
part
about
it
is
i
believe
that
these
are
no
defects
due
to
handling
or
age
but
in
the
processes
at
the
brewery
it
may
be
too
alkaline
of
water
but
i
think
that
it
is
over
sparging
the
result
of
pinching
the
pennies
too
tight
i
suggest
drinking
something
else
kingfisher
lager
is
indian
beer
contract
brewed
in
new
york
it
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
it
has
a
fairly
nice
aroma
citrusy
and
a
bit
of
malt
not
too
bad
flavor
wise
nice
hoppy
touch
decent
malt
flavor
as
well
somewhat
grainy
too
better
than
i
expected
id
take
this
over
bmc
overall
not
one
i
doubt
i
will
ever
get
again
but
not
a
horrible
beer
d
overall
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
its
quite
nice
for
a
macro
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixpack
but
if
it
was
offered
to
me
id
certainly
drink
it
it
was
quite
pale
which
is
to
be
expected
with
very
minimal
head
the
flavor
wasnt
too
bad
it
tasted
a
lot
like
premium
american
lager
with
an
interesting
flavor
at
the
backend
a
little
more
bitter
i
suppose
the
best
quality
was
how
it
is
engineered
to
be
eaten
with
the
indian
dish
the
beer
and
the
dish
went
very
well
and
while
the
flavor
isnt
anything
special
and
in
fact
quite
ordinary
it
goes
very
well
with
the
meal
which
is
its
designated
purpose
and
i
found
it
to
be
not
a
bad
brew
when
i
eat
indian
ill
be
sure
to
order
another
next
time
im
out
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
physically
but
mentally
i
might
burn
out
around
3
or
4
not
too
bad
with
a
good
meal
it
wouldnt
fair
as
well
alone
this
is
an
unpretentious
macro
lager
that
is
a
passable
drink
but
certainly
not
one
i
would
seek
out
with
enthusiasm
d
alright
i
guess
not
good
not
bad
easy
drinking
drank
this
stuff
like
water
during
my
10
days
in
india
its
not
bad
has
an
entertaining
sweetness
to
the
malt
that
makes
a
welcome
appearance
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
spectrum
good
drinkability
and
above
average
taste
for
a
macro
lager
reminds
me
of
pbr
its
probably
the
best
beer
youll
find
in
the
country
fast
bland
lightly
sweet
but
clean
flavor
a
wee
bit
of
lemony
hop
mixed
with
drying
brewers
rice
tastes
and
overpowering
carbonation
fast
dry
clean
finish
a
very
bland
dry
rice
beer
tarted
up
with
some
pilsner
aromas
actually
theres
nothing
revolting
about
this
beer
at
all
its
just
an
average
run
of
the
mill
macro
lager
all
in
all
this
is
certainly
no
better
than
any
euro
lager
ive
ever
had
very
similar
to
grolsch
in
many
respects
but
without
that
great
swingtop
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
medium
fluffy
white
head
some
lacing
and
decent
retention
smell
is
skunky
sweet
malt
and
citrus
vanilla
taste
is
malty
with
some
skunk
citrus
and
grains
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
not
bad
other
than
the
skunk
refreshing
drinkabilityoverall
not
a
bad
brew
would
go
down
a
real
treat
with
some
butter
chicken
on
a
hot
day
the
taste
was
mild
and
again
just
a
lttle
citrusy
richer
than
most
macros
but
still
somewhat
watery
and
then
a
fairly
fast
finish
and
done
im
amazed
to
discover
that
kingfisher
lager
is
the
best
selling
indian
lager
worldwide
and
is
now
brewed
by
17
breweries
around
the
world
this
particular
bottle
was
brewed
in
saratoga
springs
ny
ive
had
a
bottle
or
two
with
indian
food
in
the
past
and
wasnt
impressed
solo
its
even
less
impressive
bottom
line
avoid
unless
dehydrated
surprisingly
complex
for
a
lager
atleast
there
arent
many
lagers
that
ive
tasted
that
are
available
in
this
area
that
display
as
many
characteristics
as
kingfisher
the
lack
of
head
retention
mild
aroma
and
metallic
twang
at
the
finish
hold
it
back
some
but
its
still
one
best
lagers
ive
had
available
in
this
area
very
similar
to
a
budweiser
golden
straw
color
little
head
or
carbonation
corn
smell
and
taste
not
a
bad
aftertaste
easy
to
finish
but
nothing
exciting
for
a
beer
from
india
its
better
than
most
imports
from
nongerman
or
belgium
coutries
i
used
to
drin
this
all
the
time
in
atlanta
in
my
fav
indian
in
little
fives
i
was
impressed
then
though
im
far
from
impressed
now
its
still
a
good
lager
imo
very
clean
and
grainy
taste
grass
rice
barley
and
corn
flavors
mostly
with
a
slight
hop
snap
on
the
finish
a
rather
neutral
tasting
beer
that
would
probably
work
well
with
a
variety
of
different
foods
my
advice
hold
your
nose
pour
it
into
a
glass
leave
the
room
breath
come
back
in
5
minutes
to
let
the
skunk
aroma
disipate
after
that
its
a
drinkable
beer
not
great
but
drinkable
it
has
the
solid
straw
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
small
lacing
head
tastes
mildly
sweet
with
barley
corn
and
rice
distinctively
hop
flavor
and
aromas
are
of
the
noble
hop
variety
but
skunked
through
the
green
bottle
carbonated
to
the
mouth
and
lacks
a
bit
of
creaminess
subtle
apple
fruits
in
the
finish
crisp
and
moderately
dry
weak
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
its
got
the
look
of
a
great
beer
without
the
taste
somewhat
bland
and
rather
generic
in
its
overall
taste
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
intense
carbonation
not
much
to
detect
scentwise
the
taste
is
more
like
a
mediumbodied
pilsener
nothing
extraordinary
or
overtly
complex
it
goes
down
smoothly
but
not
very
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
2
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
it
does
pair
nicely
with
indian
food
and
its
a
summer
beer
because
of
its
hoppy
presence
smells
citrusy
and
floraly
nothing
too
deep
or
complex
tastes
similar
with
a
good
bite
of
lemon
in
there
reminded
me
of
heineken
but
a
better
tasting
one
mouthfeel
is
on
the
watery
side
and
not
the
most
pleasant
thing
in
the
whole
wide
world
however
very
drinkable
i
would
much
rather
drink
this
than
bud
its
not
attacking
to
the
palate
its
light
easy
to
drink
and
the
taste
is
not
offensive
at
all
an
excellent
macro
brew
and
a
decent
beer
having
tasted
this
beer
in
various
corners
of
india
as
well
as
in
europe
both
on
bottle
and
on
tap
i
have
to
say
that
the
taste
varies
a
lot
it
probably
falls
back
on
the
quality
of
the
water
source
at
best
kingfisher
lager
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
at
worst
it
can
taste
like
ditch
water
that
said
its
a
southasian
equivalent
of
heineken
or
carlsberg
lager
dependable
but
not
very
exciting
in
the
bars
of
bangalore
or
the
posh
restaurants
around
delhis
connaught
place
kingfisher
tastes
fine
but
in
the
northindian
ladakh
region
where
only
two
brands
of
beer
are
available
in
the
market
kingfisher
is
thouroghly
defeated
by
devans
modern
breweries
blessed
godfather
super
strong
high
power
beer
enjoy
with
a
vindaloo
or
rogan
josh
clear
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
for
a
lace
the
smells
is
very
clean
faint
hops
and
grainy
malt
a
oily
hop
up
front
and
background
of
slighty
grassy
grains
finishes
very
clean
and
is
light
of
the
palate
this
is
a
nice
average
lager
to
keep
around
for
cookouts
on
hot
summer
days
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
tight
head
that
fades
away
pretty
quickly
has
a
slight
floweryyeasty
aroma
theres
some
hop
flavor
in
it
overriding
the
very
weak
malt
flavor
finishing
with
a
lingering
bitterness
actually
quite
refreshing
especially
with
indian
food
chicken
korma
masala
rice
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
bottle
pours
clear
bubbly
gold
with
very
little
white
head
that
mostly
dissipates
quickly
leaving
just
a
footprint
of
foam
on
top
fruit
hop
and
sweet
malt
aroma
with
soapy
notes
malt
flavor
to
start
with
a
hoppy
finish
and
a
tad
spicy
light
bodied
and
fizzy
palate
crisp
and
refreshing
not
the
best
of
lagers
i
wont
return
for
a
second
glass
of
this
perhaps
the
trip
from
ny
to
az
was
too
much
and
it
would
be
better
closer
to
the
brewery
taste
is
not
bad
good
hops
no
malt
taste
grassiness
and
faint
copper
tinge
to
it
refreshing
on
a
hot
afternoon
would
go
nicely
with
spicy
food
in
need
of
something
to
review
i
picked
up
a
green
bottle
of
this
indian
brw
which
is
actually
brewed
in
the
states
no
freshness
dating
pours
light
clear
amber
typical
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
not
much
taste
or
interest
here
mostly
adjuncts
account
for
the
lack
of
malt
notes
best
that
can
be
said
here
is
that
this
washed
my
sandwedge
down
nicely
and
cut
through
the
tahini
sauce
a
small
white
bubbly
head
sits
on
the
clear
clear
gold
beer
just
a
touch
ambery
sweet
corny
nose
with
some
sugary
sponk
major
corn
in
the
front
a
little
spicy
maybe
even
cinnamon
middle
is
tangy
with
major
sweet
corn
sugar
some
nice
bitterness
in
the
end
with
some
grainsy
crackers
its
not
bad
the
hops
save
it
in
the
end
from
being
completely
nondescript
pretty
decent
beer
and
i
cant
argue
with
the
statement
on
the
label
as
it
being
the
best
indian
lager
its
the
best
ive
had
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
wispy
little
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
a
a
pleasant
mix
of
cereal
grains
and
a
faint
yeast
skunkyness
the
taste
is
worse
than
the
smell
some
light
maltiness
and
wet
paper
come
together
with
an
all
too
faint
hoppiness
the
moouthfeel
is
thin
and
pastuerizey
this
is
nothing
more
than
an
average
adjunct
lager
its
also
not
even
brewed
in
india
after
a
sip
had
to
wash
out
my
mouth
even
after
toothpaste
terrible
taste
remained
not
a
good
ambassador
looks
like
watered
down
beer
dry
bitter
thin
with
awful
carbonation
maybe
grass
and
hops
thin
goodbye
beer
hello
drain
useful
for
inducing
nausea
stay
out
of
sight
with
this
one
truly
a
terrible
beer
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
under
a
1
5
finger
white
head
that
settles
quickly
to
thick
film
theres
a
strong
grainy
skunk
nose
typical
of
a
macro
lager
the
mouth
is
very
pirckly
and
light
the
taste
starts
with
standard
adjunct
malt
and
skunky
hops
theres
a
slightly
sweet
moment
followed
by
a
fairly
substantial
metallic
hoppy
bite
the
bite
is
stronger
than
most
macros
would
produce
and
lasts
a
bit
longer
pushing
this
beer
just
slightly
ever
so
slightly
above
average
i
agree
with
the
label
that
is
it
most
thrilling
chilled
along
the
lines
of
the
standard
euro
pale
lager
thx
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
boasts
of
mainly
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
but
it
comes
across
as
light
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
a
little
above
average
it
is
light
with
a
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
on
top
of
a
dry
lager
yeast
finish
that
refreshes
on
the
way
down
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
easy
but
it
has
nothing
to
brag
about
it
does
a
lot
right
but
not
a
lot
more
than
others
still
this
is
a
decent
lager
i
happened
upon
this
beer
at
the
fancy
food
show
in
new
york
city
i
have
seen
it
many
times
in
liquor
stores
but
never
thought
much
of
it
well
i
am
not
one
to
pass
on
free
samples
of
beer
and
this
booth
was
giving
away
full
bottles
not
a
bad
sample
huh
needless
to
say
i
was
very
surprised
at
the
taste
it
has
a
noble
hop
aroma
and
a
taste
that
was
crisp
and
refreshing
it
is
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
still
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
for
but
for
free
it
is
great
part
of
a
beers
of
the
world
package
received
as
a
christmas
gift
but
comically
enough
this
is
brewed
in
new
york
state
a
nearly
opaque
color
that
poured
a
fine
head
that
disapated
quickly
there
is
almost
a
sweet
alcohol
smell
to
this
brew
not
a
bad
taste
considering
all
a
sweet
beginning
ends
up
with
a
decent
hop
finish
this
is
an
extremely
thin
beer
but
a
drinkable
one
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
fast
fading
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
cut
grass
and
corncob
with
a
trace
of
metallic
scent
the
lightbodied
sweet
malt
is
a
bit
grainy
and
lightly
herbal
a
mildly
spicing
hop
bitterness
peeks
through
as
does
a
hint
of
alcohol
mellow
smooth
sweet
ok
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
glad
i
didnt
let
the
skunk
drive
me
away
at
the
get
go
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
but
id
have
one
if
it
was
offered
to
me
boring
but
nicer
than
most
all
of
the
macros
pours
a
light
but
healthy
golden
colour
evocative
of
heineken
or
peroni
or
the
like
the
smell
is
just
bad
at
first
smells
of
sulfer
and
skunkiness
thankfully
this
cleared
out
almost
entirely
after
a
couple
of
minutes
the
taste
here
was
pretty
standard
for
a
pale
lager
minimal
overall
hopgrain
taste
that
was
kind
of
watery
unlike
the
smell
there
was
no
skunk
flavour
here
mouthfeel
was
quite
smooth
overall
but
a
bit
too
highly
carbonated
the
smell
was
what
really
turned
me
off
here
otherwise
this
is
a
pretty
average
brew
sinkability

yes
this
is
going
down
the
drain
a
lager
lager
pale
gold
color
small
head
a
light
bodied
lager
light
malts
and
hops
light
flavor
nearly
sort
of
bland
but
wellbalanced
and
nice
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
an
ok
lager
but
there
is
a
touch
of
green
bottle
skunyness
doesnt
work
for
me
the
smell
of
clean
laundry
is
a
wonderful
thing
but
not
in
your
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
inturuptingly
annoying
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
therefore
i
would
not
turn
one
down
for
free
if
there
were
not
any
better
beers
around
that
i
could
pay
for
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
european
style
lager
its
not
very
bold
but
considering
the
climate
of
its
country
of
origin
it
probably
hits
the
spot
quite
nicely
there
it
would
probably
do
quite
well
alongside
a
plate
of
chicken
vindaloo
or
simply
as
a
companion
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
poured
a
small
white
head
that
contained
smallmedium
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
and
there
was
no
lacing
with
this
beer
this
beers
nose
was
hoppy
there
is
nothing
very
special
about
this
beer
in
my
opinion
i
found
it
to
have
a
somewhat
of
a
bitter
taste
to
it
and
it
is
a
beer
that
went
down
rather
smoothly
this
brew
poured
a
small
white
head
of
small
to
medium
bubbles
which
left
a
small
lacing
as
it
receded
it
body
is
a
transparent
light
amber
orange
color
its
aroma
is
a
mild
hoppy
one
and
its
taste
is
a
bit
carbonated
and
like
a
typical
lager
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
there
is
nothing
really
noteworthy
here
but
it
is
a
good
all
around
drinkable
brew
a
tasty
brew
when
its
fresh
and
not
skunked
my
local
indian
restaurant
seems
to
about
the
only
one
that
can
manage
that
trick
came
in
a
green
330ml
bottle
the
back
label
said
to
see
the
neck
for
a
freshness
date
but
there
was
none
to
be
found
its
a
nice
golden
colour
but
upon
closer
inspection
i
could
spot
a
fair
amount
of
yeast
sediment
suspended
in
it
so
much
for
a
clear
lager
nose
is
too
faint
for
me
to
pick
up
taste
is
quite
hoppy
and
leaves
an
astringent
aftertaste
very
good
summer
session
beer
light
easy
drinking
simple
beer
this
is
a
fairly
confusing
beer
it
says
in
one
spot
that
it
indias
best
selling
beer
but
it
appears
to
be
brewed
in
new
york
the
color
is
a
pretty
pale
straw
color
fluffy
white
head
pretty
similar
to
other
green
bottle
beers
not
as
skunky
as
the
european
ones
though
actually
a
bit
of
hops
somewhere
in
there
didnt
rock
my
world
nice
colorful
labeling
notes
that
this
is
brewed
under
supervision
from
india
and
references
saratoga
springs
new
york
among
the
indians
i
know
this
beer
is
not
highly
regarded
golden
eagle
is
considered
to
be
a
much
better
beer
according
to
them
this
version
is
quite
similar
to
the
domestic
product
brewed
in
india
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
whispy
white
head
of
medium
bubbles
and
10
second
duration
no
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
corny
but
with
a
slight
sense
of
hay
and
yeast
flavor
is
falldown
in
quality
to
my
tongue
sparsely
malty
and
slighly
phenolic
and
offputting
sharp
astringeny
at
the
finish
almost
like
white
vinegar
not
much
body
to
speak
of
and
unsettling
in
the
manner
of
too
much
carbonation
nothing
here
to
see
folks
especially
at
premium
prices
pours
a
superpale
straw
with
little
aroma
light
and
fizzy
with
some
carmel
malt
and
green
apple
notes
although
an
indian
beer
it
is
brewed
in
new
york
and
is
not
particulary
distinguishable
from
other
u
s
lagers
rolling
rock
came
to
mind
nothing
terrible
about
the
brew
it
just
fails
to
make
any
noteworthy
statement
this
lager
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
tall
white
foam
and
medium
carbonation
the
smell
was
sweet
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
this
sweet
aroma
malt
corn
i
am
not
sure
but
the
smell
was
rather
pronounced
and
not
altogether
unpleasant
the
taste
was
thin
and
had
the
same
sweetness
that
i
detected
in
the
smell
there
was
a
mild
but
pleasant
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
but
was
clean
with
mild
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
ok
i
had
this
beer
while
eating
in
an
indian
restaurant
and
it
went
well
with
the
spicy
food
available
at
all
indian
restaurants
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
a
fizzy
white
beer
however
i
must
say
this
brew
does
pour
a
solid
golden
hue
with
a
decent
head
it
does
its
duty
in
pairing
with
some
really
spicy
indian
dishes
and
according
to
my
roomate
from
last
year
chaitanya
its
the
only
thing
drinkable
in
his
hometown
of
bangalore
a
very
sweet
corn
and
rice
filled
aroma
this
beer
is
definitely
swill
but
it
is
swill
i
would
rather
pay
for
than
our
swill
here
bud
miller
coors
when
i
went
to
eat
with
my
exroomate
at
an
indian
restaurant
in
pittsburgh
pa
he
said
it
doesnt
taste
the
same
as
it
does
back
home
in
fact
i
think
its
brewed
somewhere
in
new
york
overall
very
light
bodied
and
drinkable
it
has
a
sweet
crisp
lemon
grass
finish
that
goes
very
well
with
the
food
i
have
eaten
with
it
so
this
ones
for
you
chai
tried
this
one
in
an
indian
food
joint
not
too
good
a
light
bodied
lager
pale
gold
color
small
head
light
malts
and
hops
light
flavor
nearly
sort
of
bland
but
wellbalanced
and
nice
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
somewhat
skunky
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
think
and
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
yeast
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
nice
crispness
taste
is
fresh
grains
with
some
citrus
notes
and
a
nice
amount
of
spicy
hops
a
very
refreshing
brew
that
is
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
macros
a
small
pale
white
head
sits
atop
a
very
pale
yellow
body
aroma
is
zesty
and
clean
slight
hints
of
citrus
seafoam
and
straw
a
dry
hoppy
play
upon
the
tongue
and
mouth
with
a
short
but
nice
finish
light
in
body
texture
and
just
about
every
other
way
compared
to
other
lagers
of
this
type
its
one
the
best
just
enough
flavor
to
make
it
palatable
but
its
real
purpose
is
to
wash
down
the
heat
of
hot
and
spicy
food
and
keep
those
tastebuds
cooled
for
the
next
onslaught
if
you
want
boldness
in
body
and
flavor
youre
barking
up
the
wrong
bodhi
tree
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
the
head
brilliant
white
average
in
size
with
a
frothy
consistency
with
fair
lace
to
coat
the
glass
malt
nose
the
start
is
slightly
sweet
top
cadaverous
finish
is
bitingly
acidic
sparsely
hopped
dry
aftertaste
not
much
to
redeem
this
beer
in
my
eyes
and
palate
but
one
persons
trash
is
anothers
treasure
this
is
really
not
a
good
beer
at
all
weak
yellow
color
with
virtually
no
head
or
effervescence
no
aroma
insipid
uninspired
dry
grass
flavor
i
poured
most
of
this
one
out
the
product
itself
overall
was
poor
the
colour
was
very
light
and
the
head
was
nonexistant
there
was
no
substance
to
the
body
as
it
was
very
watery
the
taste
was
hollow
well
balanced
but
hollow
and
here
i
thought
i
was
getting
a
beer
from
india
its
actually
brewed
in
sarasota
springs
ny
the
twist
off
cap
should
have
been
a
dead
give
away
upon
opening
a
skunky
aroma
emerges
before
you
can
even
pour
the
clear
yellowish
gold
body
topped
by
a
full
foamy
bright
white
head
the
head
drops
quickly
leaving
a
decent
collar
and
some
spotty
lace
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
fine
moderate
carbonation
that
leaves
it
lightly
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
of
a
clean
malt
thats
well
infused
with
a
light
grassy
hop
flavor
and
moderate
bitterness
it
finishes
with
a
mild
herbal
hop
flavor
and
gentle
residual
bitterness
reminiscent
in
many
ways
of
heineken
but
lighter
all
around
actually
somewhat
refreshing
giving
it
a
little
bit
of
drinkability
certainly
more
engaging
than
a
light
beer
and
if
it
werent
for
the
skunkiness
it
might
score
even
better
tried
this
one
in
an
indian
restaurant
nice
appearance
gold
color
and
nice
smell
this
beer
has
some
great
glasses
that
add
to
the
enjoying
of
the
beer
definitely
to
be
enjoyed
with
spicy
foods
clear
golden
color
little
head
and
no
lace
a
very
pleasant
aroma
of
graininess
and
hops
not
unlike
a
euro
lager
but
not
necessarily
skunky
a
nice
malty
flavor
followed
by
some
soft
hops
to
balance
i
found
this
very
appealing
for
a
lager
and
very
refreshing
ive
mentioned
this
before
but
why
in
the
hell
cant
american
macro
brewers
try
to
brew
something
close
to
this
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
pleasant
surprise
id
pass
on
this
one
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
can
understand
why
some
people
like
this
beer
upon
opening
the
bottle
there
was
a
definite
skunk
smell
but
once
i
poured
it
it
dissipated
and
gave
way
to
a
decent
eurolager
aroma
that
was
not
overly
skunky
nice
clean
flavor
that
balances
malt
and
hops
in
a
way
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
refreshing
dry
finish
with
a
little
sweetness
on
the
tongue
to
make
it
special
this
is
an
alright
beer
id
buy
it
again
brewed
by
kingfisher
brewing
co
in
saratoga
springs
and
they
get
technical
supervision
from
united
breweries
in
bangalore
india
this
is
too
far
away
to
make
any
difference
and
this
native
brew
is
pale
as
old
harry
skunky
smell
good
head
but
bland
taste
i
guess
the
one
thing
and
thing
only
that
saved
this
beer
is
that
it
is
brewed
in
the
us
and
not
india
still
a
mediocre
brew
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
kingfisher
a
relatively
popular
import
from
india
very
light
green
bottle
with
a
faint
and
pleasant
aroma
of
yeast
the
taste
is
not
dramatic
at
all
but
does
have
a
nice
closing
tang
of
hops
that
really
redeems
this
beer
at
least
on
a
very
hot
july
evening
not
bad
straw
colored
with
a
quicklydying
white
head
a
little
more
bitter
than
other
american
lagers
and
also
more
complex
it
would
be
easy
to
put
away
a
bunch
of
these
at
a
sitting
golden
yellow
with
thin
head
fizzy
with
crisp
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
very
pleasant
hop
fruity
bite
finishes
a
little
grainly
and
bitter
good
with
my
spicy
indian
food
im
just
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
quite
a
bit
better
based
on
all
the
raves
of
my
indian
friends
itll
hit
you
hard
and
itll
dampen
the
burn
of
indian
food
its
not
worth
ruining
a
meal
over
though
ill
take
a
budweiser
over
this
easily
quite
bland
but
its
easy
to
drink
good
for
a
hot
day
i
suppose
but
id
probably
look
elsewhere
first
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
indian
food
although
i
prefer
taj
mahal
some
nice
malt
flavor
little
if
any
noticable
hop
content
but
again
go
with
it
when
eating
indain
cooking
aah
knocked
back
plenty
of
these
trying
to
wash
down
the
dust
of
delhi
refreshing
when
ice
cold
pleasantly
balanced
when
it
warms
a
bit
notes
there
was
a
card
on
the
table
that
went
into
some
interesting
detail
of
this
brew
i
wrote
it
down
and
it
goes
as
follows
a
time
when
a
strong
smooth
beer
was
needed
to
quench
the
thirst
and
beat
the
heat
in
hindustan
india
snip
high
gravity
lager
is
kept
in
copper
urns
for
over
2
months
copper
stimulates
the
yeast
and
imparts
its
flavour
in
the
beer
used
this
to
make
mexican
beer
chili
and
micheladas
con
ojo
rojo
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
would
definitely
choose
this
one
over
dos
equis
or
a
corona
if
forced
this
beer
is
extremely
smooth
that
is
an
understatement
to
be
honest
i
was
not
sure
what
to
think
about
this
brew
as
ska
are
hit
or
miss
this
beer
poured
very
average
out
of
the
can
with
no
distinct
hints
or
aromas
i
thought
it
would
be
average
but
it
wasnt
this
beer
has
an
extremely
crisp
and
pure
taste
to
it
and
a
great
mouthfeel
as
it
goes
down
smoothly
the
taste
is
of
malted
hops
and
barley
and
i
would
definitely
give
props
to
ska
for
this
one
even
though
i
havent
been
as
kind
to
them
in
the
past

d
a
real
session
beer
missing
on
quality
taste
but
if
you
can
find
em
cheap
guzzle
away
at
least
its
better
than
bud
this
is
a
craft
cervaza
i
guess
pair
this
icecold
with
some
spicy
taco
truck
food
on
a
blisteringly
hot
day
and
this
beer
is
a
winner
crisp
refreshing
easy
drinking
dont
look
for
too
much
in
this
one
just
drink
it
and
remember
not
all
beer
needs
to
be
complex
to
be
pretty
damn
good
d
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
it
remains
tasty
even
after
hitting
room
temperature
o
this
beer
is
dry
and
fizzy
without
much
flavor
and
the
hops
that
are
a
bit
dull
and
onedimensional
pours
out
to
a
1
inch
white
foamy
head
that
falls
to
a
18
inch
permanent
head
with
intermittent
lacing
color
is
pale
strawgold
aroma
is
sweet
grains
and
grassy
herbal
hops
flavor
picks
up
with
the
aroma
on
sweet
grains
slightly
biscuity
note
and
mildly
hoppybitter
finish
it
has
good
balance
and
a
clean
crisp
taste
mouthfeel
suffers
from
something
i
get
this
rough
afterfeel
from
some
canned
beers
that
is
hard
to
describe
its
not
astringency
just
a
dry
chalky
feel
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
better
than
corona
and
tecate
but
not
by
much
overall
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
mouthfeel
i
would
love
this
very
refreshing
beer
i
find
this
to
be
a
really
lovely
lager
and
an
exceptional
summer
beer
on
tap
for
awhile
at
illegal
petes
near
du
it
was
served
with
a
lime
wedge
which
i
dont
think
it
needs
but
it
helps
bring
out
some
of
the
fruity
and
floral
notes
in
the
aroma
which
is
light
and
summer
with
a
touch
of
citrus
the
color
is
clear
and
light
with
a
quarter
inch
of
thick
white
fluff
well
beyond
what
i
am
used
to
in
a
lager
the
head
doesnt
last
but
the
creamy
texture
it
represented
does
this
beer
is
expansive
in
the
mouth
yet
always
light
i
love
that
marriage
of
feelings
here
the
flavor
is
mild
good
crisp
finish
and
flavor
from
the
lager
yeast
and
only
enough
hops
to
clean
up
the
soft
malt
sweetness
this
is
infinitely
sessionable
at
a
super
low
abv
and
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
for
the
style
its
no
bruery
humulus
the
standard
by
which
i
will
measure
every
other
lager
i
ever
drink
but
its
a
good
summer
session
beer
and
its
damn
good
with
a
burrito
i
think
this
is
savagely
underrated
here
on
ba
a
nice
lightbodied
lager
overall
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
this
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
scent
is
weak
with
some
cheap
grains
the
taste
is
weak
and
not
too
flavorful
some
basic
malts
and
hops
in
the
mix
there
is
crispness
to
the
beer
with
a
slight
spice
nothing
all
that
special
other
than
the
fact
this
tastes
a
100
times
better
than
cheap
mexican
beer
very
drinkable
but
also
one
of
those
you
can
skip
over
o
very
refreshing
and
very
thirst
quenching
super
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
great
beer
for
lawn
mowing
or
other
yard
work
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
or
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
happily
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
this
has
potential
the
saaz
hops
are
fantastic
but
the
malt
character
is
a
bit
unbalanced
if
theyre
trying
to
make
a
hoppier
version
of
a
mexicanstyle
lager
theyll
have
to
scale
back
the
bread
notes
and
lighten
the
malt
its
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
a
light
bodied
beer
that
just
seemed
to
lighten
my
pocket
without
giving
me
much
needed
tastes
sorry
folks
i
didnt
have
a
pilsner
to
pour
this
one
into
so
i
used
a
pint
glass
it
pours
out
a
nice
crystal
clear
blonde
color
topped
off
with
a
light
white
head
that
quickly
thins
out
into
a
layer
of
sporadic
bubbles
hugged
by
some
minor
lacing
it
has
a
very
light
aroma
some
wheat
smells
and
mild
spice
comes
through
but
not
much
else
light
on
the
tongue
and
light
in
mouthfeel
too
this
beer
does
have
that
skunked
quality
some
mexican
lagers
have
its
not
very
powerful
but
the
mild
skunked
taste
is
therebut
is
absent
in
the
aroma
its
slightly
bitter
on
the
side
of
your
mouth
and
you
can
pick
up
some
orange
and
lemon
zest
malts
are
present
when
its
heads
toward
the
back
of
your
throat
not
a
bad
lager
overall
do
this
beer
appears
to
be
an
allmalt
pale
lager
that
follows
the
archetype
closely
but
does
it
well
flavors
and
textures
seem
under
tight
control
if
not
particularly
exciting
the
smell
has
less
appeal
not
really
matching
the
sensory
profile
of
the
flavor
while
the
beer
appears
to
try
to
hide
in
the
glass
and
not
draw
attention
to
itself
the
mexican
logger
is
a
sound
good
american
pale
ale
its
appearance
is
typical
average
smell
includes
the
saaz
hop
similar
to
others
the
taste
to
me
is
much
better
balanced
than
the
big
marcos
put
out
the
body
is
a
nice
medium
to
loght
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
tastee
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
american
pales
ive
had
from
the
12
oz
can
courtesy
of
grapevine
liquors
in
denver
this
has
the
new
politicallycorrect
artwork
on
the
can
more
saaz
less
snooze
close
to
two
fingers
of
very
loose
and
dimpled
bright
white
foam
sizzles
down
to
the
surface
in
no
time
the
lacing
forms
thicker
stripes
and
sticks
better
than
expected
simple
golden
hued
liquid
a
few
lazy
bubbles
drift
here
and
there
sweet
and
full
nose
of
corn
syrup
malt
cocoa
honey
peach
fuzz
and
a
brief
shot
of
grassy
hops
not
that
interesting
yet
plenty
of
richness
in
whats
there
mediumbodied
some
carbonation
tickle
while
overall
heavy
and
clings
to
the
palate
more
sweetness
via
honey
corn
molasses
and
malted
milk
balls
peach
to
apricot
fruit
and
a
splash
of
mixed
citrus
simple
bread
grains
and
oats
little
about
it
seems
hoppy
mild
metallic
ring
near
the
finish
certainly
not
offensive
just
leaves
you
with
very
little
to
say
about
it
so
thats
all
there
is
to
say
o
good
summer
beer
that
goes
down
easy
nothing
fancy
just
a
nice
relaxing
beer
without
all
the
hype
botg
48
is
ska
mexican
logger
its
pretty
freakin
hot
outside
and
nice
to
get
a
craft
alternative
to
mexican
shitty
lager
from
ska
poured
from
can
into
brooklyn
tulip
pours
a
super
cloudy
sunshine
yellow
color
crazy
not
what
i
expected
for
color
no
head
whatsoever
smell
not
much
of
anything
maybe
a
little
whiff
of
corn
taste
very
smooth
clean
crisp
some
sweetness
on
the
end
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
this
neither
smells
or
tastes
like
anything
but
i
could
see
pounding
this
at
the
pool
this
summer
much
better
than
aal
but
nothing
special
here
but
i
will
buy
this
instead
of
corona
dos
equis
etc
anyday
overall
fantastic
and
so
refreshing
and
i
love
that
its
canned
and
low
abv
perfect
warm
weather
beer
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
very
similar
to
other
adjunct
lagers
but
with
distinctly
fresher
more
aggressive
notes
i
guess
the
only
thing
that
makes
it
mexican
is
the
marketing
but
thats
consistent
with
authentic
mexico
beers
ive
had
great
summer
party
beer
for
sure
paired
well
with
uptomedium
spicy
mexican
dishes
and
cake
o
sorry
ska
but
this
one
fails
for
me
not
worth
the
price
if
i
want
a
mexican
beer
i
will
go
for
modelo
over
this
anyday
better
price
same
quality
overall
drinkability
possibly
the
best
lager
ive
had
a
big
shout
out
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
grains
slightly
sweet
taste
is
the
same
grains
malts
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
good
session
beer
o
you
could
drink
these
all
day
a
great
summer
beer
to
have
at
a
partybbq
out
on
the
water
or
just
to
cool
off
after
some
yard
work
i
also
feel
like
this
could
be
a
good
beer
to
show
people
who
think
corona
the
fancy
shit
theres
an
old
saying
life
is
like
a
bag
of
tacos
sometimes
you
get
the
chorizo
however
this
chorizo
is
the
premium
stuff
may
i
have
another
overall
above
average
really
enjoyable
i
will
return
again
and
again
dramatically
better
than
bud
while
not
being
complex
or
taking
itself
too
seriously
quaffable
the
scores
i
posted
are
an
average
of
the
river
review
and
the
more
serious
review
though
i
think
this
beer
is
made
to
be
gulped
while
participating
in
outdoor
activities
in
which
case
it
is
worth
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
o
better
than
the
macros
and
its
nice
that
its
in
a
can
but
id
prefer
mamas
little
yellow
pils
overall
impression
as
expected
this
was
a
lighter
beer
however
it
was
obvious
that
this
wasnt
a
watered
down
beer
made
with
rice
it
had
a
good
almost
pilsnerlike
bready
maltiness
and
the
saaz
hops
flavor
in
the
finish
added
a
nice
bit
of
bitterness
the
flavors
proved
the
quality
of
the
beer
but
it
was
very
drinkable
and
went
down
very
easily
dont
let
the
name
make
you
think
youre
getting
something
watery
like
a
corona
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
for
a
hot
day
o
pretty
boring
but
would
be
a
decent
beer
to
share
with
people
around
the
campfire
or
to
go
with
tacos
i
have
to
say
that
im
a
little
disappointed
and
expected
a
little
more
from
ska
with
this
one
i
know
pale
lager
is
not
a
popular
style
around
these
parts
but
i
am
surprised
how
low
the
scores
are
for
this
this
is
a
beer
that
i
plan
on
enjoying
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
i
find
that
it
is
a
great
example
that
a
light
colored
lager
can
buck
the
trend
and
have
a
full
flavors
if
you
are
looking
for
something
to
quench
in
this
crazy
summer
heat
look
no
further
ska
steps
outside
the
box
of
typical
brewing
and
makes
a
beautiful
lager
prost
would
i
buy
more
of
it
id
love
to
get
some
more
of
these
as
were
heading
into
another
week
of
heat
and
humidity
if
youve
passed
this
one
up
for
any
reason
its
time
to
go
back
and
grab
a
sixpack
or
two
the
crack
revealed
a
beer
ready
to
come
out
and
greet
the
day
it
had
a
nice
twoday
ride
from
media
back
to
lancaster
with
a
hiatus
in
the
30th
street
station
baggage
room
so
it
may
have
been
shaken
to
some
extent
the
glug
got
me
two
foamy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
fizzy
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
kind
of
weak
as
if
the
chainsaw
was
the
only
thing
going
saaz
instead
it
was
more
on
the
malty
side
with
some
light
grassiness
underneath
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
slight
malt
sweetness
and
a
mild
grassiness
what
i
did
not
like
was
a
metallic
taste
on
the
finish
and
i
do
not
want
to
hear
about
it
being
in
a
can
i
decanted
it
into
a
glass
and
if
you
are
not
aware
of
modern
cans
lining
i
am
not
going
to
explain
it
to
you
it
just
was
not
a
very
tasty
beer
and
not
worthy
of
cooler
space
easy
drinking
for
the
summer
months
but
i
can
think
of
quite
of
few
others
that
i
would
gravitate
towards
before
this
one
dthis
one
is
alright
but
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
again
im
just
not
digging
the
taste
on
this
one
o
not
meant
to
be
anything
more
than
a
lawnmower
beer
this
is
something
that
could
probably
appeal
to
the
masses
id
easily
take
one
over
the
things
they
usually
drink
anyways
easy
enough
to
put
a
dent
in
my
sixer
after
an
evening
overall
impression
summer
time
beer
this
is
pretty
light
but
highly
drinkable
and
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
your
average
offering
from
one
of
the
bigger
brewers
local
bar
servers
these
as
a
20
oz
imperial
and
on
a
warm
day
it
is
highly
appreciated
the
taste
is
a
little
corny
but
still
has
a
strong
malt
base
with
some
zesty
grass
and
citric
hops
for
balance
the
palate
is
watery
and
dilutes
some
of
this
lagers
flavor
all
in
all
a
good
lawnmower
beer
in
my
opnion
in
fact
i
reviewed
this
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
today
o
expected
a
little
bit
more
from
this
beer
a
definite
step
up
from
all
the
macros
out
there
still
prefer
gusto
schlitz
overall
this
beer
is
about
as
good
as
you
can
expect
i
intentionally
had
it
on
a
hot
day
after
working
in
the
yard
since
i
think
that
is
kind
of
the
point
of
this
beer
this
is
a
step
up
from
an
adjunct
and
fits
its
purpose
very
well
the
problem
though
is
the
price
point
9
a
6er
is
just
too
much
for
this
style
and
in
the
end
kind
of
defeats
the
purpose
2
5
d
not
impressed
im
drink
this
over
a
lot
of
aals
but
not
because
its
good
rather
because
its
slightly
less
bad
taste
shows
some
grainy
malt
but
it
really
lacks
the
cleanliness
of
a
wellbrewed
lager
the
yeast
is
biscuity
and
even
has
some
light
fruit
hops
provide
a
snappy
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
hop
flavor
here
not
really
all
that
impressed
with
this
one
and
waaay
too
expensive
at
10
a
sixer
to
compete
in
a
mundane
style
category
id
rather
buy
michelob
at
less
than
7
bucks
if
i
want
a
crisp
allmalt
pale
lager
overall
ill
be
honest
there
are
much
better
readilyavailable
american
lagers
out
there
and
having
this
pack
next
to
modus
hoperandi
isnt
helping
its
case
either
in
the
end
it
struggles
to
be
average
i
expected
more
from
ska
iam
not
sure
what
a
mexican
style
lager
isi
guess
this
is
it
poured
two
cans
into
a
steinlight
golden
with
a
thinner
clingy
white
head
clean
aromasonly
light
toasted
grainand
a
hint
of
honey
very
light
feel
to
the
beerwich
is
ok
for
a
hot
dayflavors
are
pretty
clean
but
there
is
a
decent
toastiness
to
ita
subtle
honey
sweet
ending
hops
provide
a
light
smattering
of
herbalness
as
i
drink
more
hey
its
not
anything
great
but
it
fits
a
good
role
for
summertime
drinking
overall
what
can
you
say
really
they
were
targeting
a
mexican
lager
they
nailed
it
if
i
had
the
choice
between
this
and
some
other
mexican
lager
i
would
choose
this
but
its
just
not
a
style
i
particularly
like
so
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
beer
getting
a
b
isnt
to
bad
considering
the
top
beers
in
the
style
only
gets
a
b
pleasant
lager
ideal
for
kicking
back
in
the
summer
months
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
the
flavors
were
full
and
finishes
clean
leaving
you
ready
for
another

this
is

that
fades
quickly
into
a
clean
pilsner
crackeriness
vague
grassy
spice
from
the
saaz
the
taste
doesnt
linger
long
on
the
palate
just
for
a
few
moments
and
its
gone
dry
crisp
aftertaste
body
is
light
no
off
flavors
at
all
a
bit
nondescript
overall
tailored
for
warm
weather
session
drinking
went
well
with
the
blt
i
had
and
id
imagine
it
would
compliment
most
foods
d
not
bad
for
a
lager
better
than
most
macros
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lot
heavier
than
a
typical
mexican
lager
like
corona
even
though
there
is
more
body
it
finishes
dry
it
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
have
been
enjoying
this
six
pack
steadily
over
the
last
couple
of
days
picked
up
a
couple
of
cans
of
this
one
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
last
week
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
an
inch
or
so
of
white
foam
on
top
very
mild
on
the
nose
a
little
hops
and
some
light
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
light
bodied
with
some
spicy
hops
and
a
little
malt
a
decent
but
unremarkable
beer
o
with
the
great
name
ska
is
hitting
what
they
have
aimed
for
a
step
above
the
macro
brews
of
the
style
3
12oz
can
i
think
the
sixer
was
8
49
gold
color
about
what
you
would
expect
from
this
style
smell
is
cheap
lager
nothing
special
the
taste
was
good
and
while
it
distinctively
reminded
me
of
corona
it
was
much
better
with
an
earthy
quality
great
beer
for
summertime
overall
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
feared
its
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
mexican
lager
and
a
pilsner
a
pretty
well
balanced
light
beer
a
bit
too
much
corny
malt
for
me
though
its
not
going
to
win
any
awards
or
wow
any
geeks
but
this
is
a
warm
weather
beer
i
can
get
behind
golden
with
a
fair
amount
of
haze
and
a
thin
head
with
little
retention
muted
aroma
mostly
grains
light
carbonation
malty
sweetness
around
the
middle
more
than
id
expect
barely
perceptible
back
end
bitterness
light
body
not
bad
but
boring
i
had
this
on
tap
at
local
option
pours
a
pissy
clear
light
gold
with
some
watery
carbonation
not
much
aroma
a
little
hops
mostly
light
skunk
the
taste
is
the
same
light
watery
boring
tasteless
just
plain
old
garbage
from
ska
the
feel
is
lighter
than
water
d
this
beer
is
light
and
would
make
a
great
barbecue
or
beach
drink
out
of
the
bomber
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
some
lacing
but
not
much
retention
the
aromas
were
quite
subtle
malty
sweetness
with
some
herbal
hops
undertones
the
taste
was
dry
and
crisp
a
lean
hops
character
with
pale
malts
very
sessionable
and
quite
understated
in
general
but
obviously
done
on
purpose
and
done
well
too
the
flavors
are
mild
but
enjoyable
the
body
is
quite
light
and
the
moderate
carbonation
good
but
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
light
the
beer
dispenses
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
sun
bleached
straw
color
with
a
modest
bright
white
frothy
head
that
evaporates
leaving
a
thin
but
concealing
sheet
of
lace
nose
is
fresh
and
crisp
with
a
fair
malt
sweetness
pretty
much
standard
for
a
lager
start
is
mildly
sweet
grain
presence
adequate
top
is
light
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
the
customary
lager
acidity
with
the
hops
understated
dry
and
thirst
quenching
on
this
110
degree
day
in
arizona
cant
complain
about
that
the
taste
is
light
up
front
initially
dry
but
quickly
picks
up
a
sweet
grain
note
that
carries
through
to
the
finish
the
finish
has
that
sort
of
adjunct
grain
thinness
to
it
that
makes
me
think
they
must
have
added
something
other
than
malt
to
this
very
light
and
refreshing
the
hops
add
a
nice
spiciness
to
this
beer
that
almost
offsets
the
adjunct
notes
i
get
hints
of
lemon
zest
and
an
herbal
sort
of
grassy
note
they
really
hit
the
parameters
for
this
style
darn
clean
to
nonexistent
yeast
profile
and
it
even
gets
the
macro
brew
taste
down
having
said
that
there
are
a
million
other
beers
that
i
would
rather
be
drinking
but
that
is
because
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
very
nice
balance
between
a
lager
and
ipa
poured
from
bottle
pale
gold
and
clear
with
fairly
good
lacing
aroma
is
light
and
fresh
florals
and
some
lemon
citrus
also
a
fairly
nice
crisp
maltiness
taste
starts
with
some
bready
malts
and
light
floral
hops
crisp
lager
yeast
and
a
fairly
subdued
hoppiness
gets
a
bit
tired
near
the
finish
some
stale
skunky
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
lots
of
carbonation
and
overall
its
some
and
easily
sessionable
a
decent
ipl
that
gets
a
fairly
boring
quickly
but
works
decently
as
a
session
option
hops
are
mostly
floral
with
a
bit
of
a
fruity
edge
and
are
decently
robust
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
tasted
too
light
with
little
body
and
didnt
hold
head
retention
well
mouthfeel
wasnt
there
as
well
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
just
alright
only
really
had
me
dreaming
about
my
next
better
beer
this
pours
a
copper
golden
color
nicely
rounded
floral
aroma
notes
with
some
light
citrusy
hops
and
a
light
hoppy
kiss
on
the
flavor
i
havent
had
much
from
magic
hat
but
the
other
brews
i
had
were
more
enjoyable
than
this
one
i
did
not
care
for
this
in
my
opinion
there
is
nothing
that
really
jumped
out
at
me
with
this
beer
it
was
borderline
bland
good
taste
smooth
and
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
deep
goldpale
amber
producing
2
fingers
of
foamy
shortlived
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thick
island
cap
leaving
sheets
webs
streaks
of
lace
aroma
is
mostly
grapefruit
pineapple
hints
of
pine
in
terms
of
hops
pound
cake
and
little
caramel
malt
in
a
background
of
pilsner
yeast
taste
is
bready
lemon

resinous
pine
tropical
fruit
lager
yeast
a
little
honey
up

through
midsip
finishes
with
a
prominent
grapefruit
note
becoming
drier
more
bitter
with
a
rapidly
diminishing
bitter
but
noticeably
astringent
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
moderate
carbonation
silky
slightly
creamy
with
a
tongue
coating
bitterness
that
becomes
an
astringency
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
palate
not
really
an
ipa
as
it
is
made
with
lager
rather
than
ale
yeast
an
interesting

are

this

good
tasty
beer
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
first
ipl
ive
tried
decent
lager
my
camping
beer
not
a
very
good
one
overall
wow
what
a
really
nice
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
never
having
tasted
an
ipl
but
this
is
really
nice
theres
a
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
recommended
o
not
my
favorite
but
i
could
drink
it
if
it
was
available
not
hoppy
enuff
for
an
ipl
little
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
but
could
be
the
draft
equipment
at
this
place
i
would
give
it
another
shot
at
a
different
place
maybe
the
brewery
a
very
well
rounded
and
drinkable
pale
lager
nice
ipl
clear
hoppy
taste
wellcrafted
lager
for
hopheads
having
this
fresh
in
my
opinion
this
is
definitely
under
rated
i
would
rather
have
this
to
almost
all
standard
lagers
serving
type
bottle
i
like
dream
machine
but
i
dont
love
it
its
bitter
enough
to
want
to
cook
with
rather
than
drink
and
as
a
beer
for
cooking
its
quite
good
ive
used
it
in
the
crock
pot
with
chicken
a
half
dozen
times
and
it
really
adds
something
to
it
a
nice
discovery
for
a
nonhophead
good
balance
between
hops
and
malt
plenty
of
malty
sweetness
especially
toward
the
end
this
beer
is
ok
it
doesnt
stack
up
to
the
magic
hat
the
beer
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
the
color
is
a
hazy
orangeish
yellow
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
taste
is
more
bitter
than
anything
glad
to
have
tried
it

wouldnt

to

and
undeniable
leafy
astringency
of
the

cone
its
chlorophyll
linger
onward
along
with
bitter
resins
and
waining

herb
overall
i
enjoyed
it
though
its
not
necessarily
something
id
pick
up
again
its
wellbalanced
but
doesnt
really
offer
much
id
seek
outdrinkable
and
enjoyable
in
an
interesting
style
but
not
something
ill
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
great
citrus
palet
with
a
smooth
finish
well
balanced
magic
hat
keeps
their
tradition
with
me
of
solid
easy
drinking
beers
none
of
which
is
outstanding
and
few
that
suck
o
drinkable
ipa
that
stays
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
fizzes
away
pretty
quickly
the
smell
is
full
of
floral
notes
but
there
is
a
little
bit
of
caramel
from
the
malt
the
taste
is
hop
forward
in
the
beginning
and
then
mellows
out
to
a
refreshing
finish
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
as
well
a
bit
average
on
all
fronts
but
a
nice
beer
none
the
less
this
dream
machine
style
ipl
was
new
to
me
i
enjoyed
the
different
notes
of
flavor
it
provided
o
there
isnt
much
to
review
with
this
brew
it
seems
bland
but
decent
new
summer
seasonal
is
probably
underrated
here
its
pretty
nice
on
tap
and
while
obviously
a
step
or
two
below
the
quality
of
say
a
jacks
abby
ipl
i
think
its
a
pretty
reasonable
take
on
the
style
darker
than
most
lagers
deep
honey
colored
and
a
little
hazy
head
is
tall
and
frothy
in
my
pint
glass
it
looks
real
nice
nose
is
generic
but
hoppy
like
an
ipa
they
certainly
didnt
short
cut
the
india
part
of
this
some
bittering
citrus
peel
notes
to
the
finish
but
mostly
sappy
bitterness
lots
of
texture
for
a
lager
which
i
like
a
lot
well
carbonated
and
refreshing
but
not
finishing
up
as
quick
as
other
lagers
the
hops
outlast
the
attempted
quick
finish
it
doesnt
work
out
real
well
but
it
doesnt
affect
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
just
makes
it
feel
more
like
an
ipa
not
sure
why
all
the
negative
feedback
on
magic
hat
lately
i
think
they
still
do
a
really
good
job
with
a
lot
of
their
beer
and
have
enjoyed
most
of
the
new
releases
o
unlike
most
of
the
lackluster
posts
ive
read
i
really
like
this
and
feel
it
is
an
underrated
brew
go
get
some
cheers
o
overall
not
a
great
beer
for
a
beer
toting
itself
as
a
hoppy
beer
it
is
veyr
malty
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
the
appearance
was
an
rich
amber
color
the
smell
had
some
fruit
notes
in
it
apricot
not
bitter
or
strong
when
going
down
smooth
when
poured
a
nice
thick
head
forms
nothing
special
otherwise
about
the
beer
although
i
could
see
my
self
purchase
another
should
the
occasion
arise
purchased
at
eskimo
hutt
lubbock
if
this
is
what
comes
out
of
dream
machine
id
be
frightened
to
taste
nightmare
machine
overall
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
from
magic
hat
essentially
a
hopped
up
vienna
lager
and
not
a
bad
option
magic

this

with

dream

is
a

brew
you
can
see
right
though
it
the
appearance
is
decent
to
this
brew
the
smell
is
bitter
with
hops
and
grains
there
is
some
richness
to
this

in
this

not
too
big
on
the
smell
of
this
brew
dream
machine
taste
is
ok
with
a
bitter
after
taste
of
hops
the
taste
at
first
is
smooth
but
it
is
over
powered
by
bitterness
the
bitterness
to
this
brew
is
to
much
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
at
first
but
bitter
at
the
end
not
a
bad
finish
to
this
brew
overall
inm
giving
this
brew
a
3
out
5
o
an
exceptional
version
of
this
style
overall
if
i
deciphered
the
code
right
this
was
bottled
on
march
18th
so
probably
not
too
old
to
kill
the
hops
this
is
just
a
very
average
ipl
that
shows
more
malt
than
hop
it
will
be
quickly
forgotten
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
hops
some
malts
taste
is
refreshing
malts
some
hops
a
bit
of
citrus
smooth
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
how
a
pale
lager
should
be
overall
great
beer
and
glad
itll
be
yearround
this
was
a
very
unique
and
interesting
pale
lager
and
i
liked
it
a
lot
quite
lagery
in
flavor
and
body
has
some
component
that
is
reminding
me
of
using
flaked
corn
in
the
grist
in
that
theres
a
consistently
sweet
element
in
a
beer
thats
really
pretty
dry
body
is
fairly
light
and
refreshing
with
a
sweet
finish
possibly
a
touch
of
diacetyl
present
hoppiness
is
pretty
pronounced
but
not
quite
to
the
scale
of
any
given
modern
american
ipa
its
more
like
a
crisp
pale
ale
an
interesting
choice
not
really
similar
to
other
ipls
ive
had
pours
a
clear
copper
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
earthy
malt
hops
slight
alcohol
hint
of
yeast
and
slight
pine
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
alcohol
hops
hint
of
floral
slight
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
earthy
malt
overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
blend
the
body
is
a
little
weak
nice
with
some
good
flavor
overall
a
nice
blend
between
the
two
at
first
it
is
almost
taste
like
an
ipa
but
then
the
malt
kicks
in
i
would
have
it
again
o
sometimes
you
gotta
tick
this
beer
is
not
horrible
it
is
drinkable
but
extraordinary
it
is
not
ill
not
buy
more
but
id
not
turn
down
a
free
one
either

fine

overall
a
favorable
slot
i
was
very
impressed
on
how
this
brew
truly
does
maintain
a
great
balance
of
ipa
and
lager
tastes
and
sensations
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
dark
honey
and
somewhat
cloudy
with
a
quarter
inch
quickly
dissipating
head
but
good
lacing
a
fresh
scent
but
nothing
of
note
on
the
nose
nice
carbonation
and
drinkable
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
but
lacks
the
fruitiness
of
the
ipas
i
prefer
a
decent
beer
overall
not
bad
i
would
have
this
one
again
rjt
final
thoughts
ive
had
very
few
ipls
since
the
style
has
started
taking
off
but
dream
machine
is
definitely
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
the
metallic
flavor
and
lack
of
hop
character
make
that
decision
an
easy
one
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
this
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
refuse
try
it
yes
its
actually
pretty
good
no
or
is
not
amazing
bit
it
has
a
nice
bit
to
it
on
my
palate
and
it
has
a
drinkable
factor
to
it
because
it
is
a
lager
is
it
my
favorite
beer
no
is
it
am
awesome
version
of
a
lager
yes
i
would
definitely
give
this
brew
a
shot
before
you
judge
it
has
the
awesome
aroma
of
an
ipa
along
with
the
hoppy
bite
however
its
got
the
clean
finish
like
a
lager
just
drink
one
and
decide
that
is
all
overall
meh
not
a
well
done
lager
on
top
of
that
not
the
best
grain
profile
and
even
more
so
the
poor
hop
choice
more
like
an
english
bitter
than
ipl
forest
floor
herbal
medicinal
hops
that
are
not
tasty
starts
with
almost
no
bitterness
then
huge
bitterness
on
the
back
and
and
finish
just
not
a
well
done
beer
all
around
overall
decent
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
overall
i
didnt
think
was
a
great
beer
and
i
didnt
think
that
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
when
i
got
to
the
aroma
i
thought
it
was
going
in
the
right
the
direction
but
it
seemed
like
it
took
a
turn
for
the
worse
when
it
got
to
the
taste
and
all
i
was
left
with
a
bland
lager
with
an
almost
equally
bland
hop
profile
this
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
a
little
clean
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
a
little
more
than
enough
for
me
no
way
i
would
want
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
aroma
and
mouthfeel
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
and
they
seemed
to
all
be
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
just
bland
all
around
and
this
is
the
first
time
in
awhile
that
i
have
had
a
beer
that
didnt
have
any
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
trying
it
either
its
priced
nicely
but
it
isnt
a
great
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
didnt
like
this
beer
it
had
some
nice
aspects
but
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
let
down
and
it
just
didnt
deliver
what
i
wanted
it
too
so
far
this
is
one
my
least
favorite
beers
from
magic
hat
and
theres
not
doubt
that
it
is
now
my
least
favorite
ipl
or
hoppy
lager
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
beer
need
some
major
work
in
the
taste
department
a
hoppy
brown
lager
seems
what
its
like
to
me
strangely
and
not
too
bad
either
to
style
i
am
not
so
sure
or
what
but
its
a
decent
beer
o
okay
i
drank
the
damn
thing
now
wheres
my
untappd
badge
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
small
thin
foamy
head
the
aroma
gives
off
a
pale
lager
malt
notes
no
hops
present
the
tastefirst
starts
off
with
a
lager
flavor
then
some
citrus
hop
come
in
on
the
finish
thw
mouthfeel
is
definitely
more
like
a
lager
than
a
ipa
overall
its
good
but
in
my
own
opinion
it
needs
to
be
more
balanced
man
how
long
has
it
been
since
i
last
had
a
magic
hat
regardless
this
one
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mixed
greens
nutty
toffee
and
grass
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
small
wave
of
sweet
fruits
but
things
quickly
degenerate
into
a
lasting
riot
of
rotting
greens
bad
cabbage
and
pennies
the
echoes
resonate
for
minutes
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
i
have
no
idea
what
to
say
about
this
mess
beyond
it
is
pretty
terrible
maybe
there
was
a
reason
i
havent
had
a
magic
hat
brew
in
a
while
overall
nothing
special
but
a
decent
ipl
try
it
that
first
bit
sounds
like
a
a
canadian
version
of
dr
timothy
leary
eh
hoser
my
aggro
pour
netted
two
fingers
of
dense
rocky
tawny
head
with
great
retention
they
know
how
to
engineer
their
beers
in
vermont
ill
tell
you
nose
smelled
much
like
being
on
a
working
farm
and
not
in
a
bad
way
the
malts
were
prevalent
very
fresh
and
grainy
and
the
hops
provided
a
freshmown
grassiness
that
put
me
in
mind
of
summers
at
my
grandparents
house
color
defined
amber
srm
7
9
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
full
a
nice
change
from
some
of
the
abrasive
aipas
that
i
have
been
drinking
of
late
taste
was
not
really
up
to
expectations
however
it
had
an
odd
finish
of
hydrogen
peroxide
a
taste
that
i
remember
from
having
contracted
trench
mouth
from
someone
at
summer
camp
gentian
violet
and
hydrogen
peroxide
were
the
watchwords
and
i
have
never
forgotten
the
tastes
initially
it
was
okay
but
the
finish
finished
me
off
oof
easy
on
carbonation
they
skimped
a
little
there
the
body
is
comparable
drinks
like
a
cinch
could
easily
follow
up
with
another
one
good
stuff
o
quite
bitter
for
only
being
50
ibus
it
could
definitely
do
with
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
definitely
feels
more
like
an
english
ipl
than
an
american
ipl
if
you
get
my
drift
overall
this
one
should
please
the
bitter
hop
lovers
the
flavor
is
not
what
i
expect
from
a
beer
that
promotes
itself
as
an
india
pale
lager
it
has
the
lager
characteristics
with
smooth
flavor
but
bitterness
level
is
medium
a
little
like
a
highly
hopped
pilsner
with
toasted
malt
taste
and
noble
accent
as
it
finishes
very
clean
overall
it
is
a
decent
lager
but
doesnt
fit
the
india
pale
lager
label
in
my
opinion
drinkable
for
what
it
is
overall
forgettable
beer
ill
pass
this
over
for
something
with
more
flare
and
flavor
o
overall
this
is
between
a
3
25
and
a
3
5
but
will
go
higher
to
give
benefit
of
the
doubt
would
not
revisit
honestly
expected
more
from
this
beer
this
dissapointing
ale
pours
a
handsome
amber
hue
with
a
nice
white
head
and
lasting
lacing
the
nose
is
an
overly
sweet
floral
mix
of
hops
malt
and
european
yeast
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
given
the
taste
why
would
you
want
to
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
way
too
much
sweetness
and
a
floral
hop
bill
that
does
not
help
the
sweetness
i
enjoyed
the
last
few
magic
hat
releases
but
this
is
definitely
a
miss
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
earth
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
earth
and
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
smells
pretty
good
but
there
is
an
odd
metallic
taste
at
first
that
only
goes
away
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
taste
is
in
the
opposite
order
with
a
quick
introduction
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
then
an
eruption
of
citrus
hops
to
finish
it
off
but
altogether
it
is
entirely
smooth
fairly
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
but
the
flavor
profile
feels
funny
this
beer
is
quite
amber
hued
which
is
a
nice
lead
that
turns
into
a
pretty
bland
ride
minimal
hop
influence
minimal
everything
really
its
just
bland
too
bad
my
next
beer
isnt
chilled
yet
otherwise
id
be
finishing
this
one
as
quickly
as
possible
and
moving
on
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
while
pours
a
classic
light
pilsner
color
pretty
modestweak
head
smell
is
classic
pilsner
with
a
nice
subtle
shot
of
citrusy
hops
taste
is
similar
you
can
absolutely
taste
the
hops
and
this
would
be
an
enjoyable
twist
on
the
classic
pilsner
on
a
nice
hot
day
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
good
id
drink
it
again
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
ive
had
hoppier
lagers
that
didnt
boast
the
ipl
label
im
not
sure
how
magic
hat
let
such
a
weak
miserable
example
of
this
style
out
of
their
tanks
i
have
had
several
other
examples
that
kick
the
ass
of
this
pathetic
shit
such
as
brewmaster
mikes
citra
mantra
represent
overall
this
is
an
impressive
beer
well
worth
the
wait
from
magic
hat
it
has
a
great
hoppiness
to
it
that
hopheads
will
love
without
being
too
much
as
some
ipaipls
can
be
3rd
beer
of
taste
eve
hazy
straw
body
not
much
head
aroma
is
all
citrus
very
tasty
is
this
citra
hops
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
o
its
pretty
agressive
for
an
ipl
but
solid
none
the
less
excellent
brew
overall
mmmkay
is
easily
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
shorts
the
beer
really
drinks
like
a
session
ipa
and
its
lager
characteristics
lend
themselves
well
to
the
beer
o
this
one
would
be
great
if
they
toned
down
the
pine
but
that
is
my
problem
with
a
lot
of
shorts
hoppy
offerings
its
especially
disappointing
when
all
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
are
great
okay
this
surprised
me
big
time
and
im
digging
it
big
time
what
a
treat
and
theres
even
a
bit
of
a
malty
touch
way
in
the
background
a
bit
of
a
mess
but
a
beautiful
mess
it
could
use
some
refining
and
has
the
potential
to
be
a
knockout
recommended
for
sure
this
brew
packs
a
serious
punch
o
not
bad
by
any
means
there
is
a
lot
going
in
this
beer
its
basically
another
solid
beer
from
shorts
it
pours
a
tan
strawgolden
color
the
beer
has
a
rounded
floral
character
with
a
soft
hoppiness
to
the
aroma
theres
a
pleasing
bitterness
with
a
rounded
feel
to
it
the
beer
has
a
mellow
toastedstraw
flavor
character
with
a
light
yet
lingering
body
its
a
hoppy
pilsner
thats
far
better
than
its
name
yet
another
hopped
up
lager
that
kind
of
strips
the
lager
qualities
away
by
the
overuse
of
hops
not
to
say
that
it
isnt
an
enjoyable
beer
though
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
you
better
be
ready
for
a
fullon
bitter
assault
as
the
hop
sidekicks
are
rather
pushed
to
the
side
just
a
bit
im
weird
though
because
id
take
an
aggressively
bitter
lighter
beer
with
pale
malt
before
a
hop
heavy
dipa
thats
sticky
and
sweet
from
caramel
malt
nevertheless
another
good
drinking
shorts
brew
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
just
aint
my
speed
i
can
actually
appreciate
the
effort
but
the
combination
leaves
me
with
metaphorical
hives
mediocre
doesnt
begin
to
describe
it
crisp
and
clean
in
a
light
to
medium
body
the
feel
displays
some
depth
smoothness
rolls
lightly
beneath
the
bite
and
into
a
drying
finish
if
i
didnt
have
plentiful
access
to
jacks
abby
this
would
be
killer
as
it
stands
its
a
bit
out
of
whack
leaving
too
much
bitterness
with
little
support
its
solid
but
not
enough
to
draw
me
away
from
the
local
goodness

good

with

and
very

o
overall
a

and
another
winner
from

looks

smells
good
feels
good
and
tastes
good
but
the
aftertaste
is
so
unpleasantly
bitter
that
it
really
ruins
the
rest
of
the
experience
theres
hop
bitterness
theres
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
then
theres
just
bitter
and
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
just
bitter
im
not
a
fan
o
overall
not
too
shabby
good
hop
presence
and
balance
overall
that
would
keep
me
interested
if
i
lived
closer
to
a
source
i
might
get
this
again
if
fresh
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
the
hops
were
pretty
aggressive
in
this
beer
but
they
still
allowed
the
malts
to
provide
a
little
balance
to
this
beer
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
a
little
smooth
clean
and
the
flavors
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
the
lingering
bitterness
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
more
than
two
since
i
think
it
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
so
i
think
one
might
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
very
nice
with
a
good
hop
profile
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lingering
bitterness
it
just
lingered
for
too
damn
long
and
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
where
the
bitterness
stuck
around
this
long
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
they
release
it
next
year
but
i
think
i
would
just
grab
a
few
bottles
and
not
a
six
pack
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
hoppy
lagers
it
certainty
isnt
lacking
in
the
hops
department
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
and
i
liked
the
beard
of
zeus
a
little
more
than
this
beer
this
beer
had
some
great
qualitys
but
i
think
the
really
lingering
bitterness
held
this
beer
back
a
little
this
was
another
nice
beer
from
shorts
but
i
think
they
make
better
hoppy
lagers
but
im
happy
to
have
a
chance
to
try
it
overall
another
great
beer
from
shorts
who
deserve
to
be
in
the
talk
for
best
year
2013
very
tasty
pretty
drinkable
and
nice
and
complex
mmmkay
is
a
light
amber
color
a
slight
somewhat
creamy
head
mostly
good
lacing
though
it
tapers
off
about
halfway
through
the
glass
it
smells
and
tastes
of
hops
really
tastes
like
a
light
ipa
or
something
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
theres
a
significant
hop
bitterness
throughout
each
sip
so
this
is
a
good
choice
for
the
hop
heads
for
sure
the
hops
in
this
are
really
grassy
with
a
sort
of
citrus
flavor
as
well
mmmkay
is
a
super
solid
beer
but
its
nothing
that
blows
me
away
as
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
stands
out
and
puts
it
above
anything
else
another
tasty
brew
from
shorts
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
by
shorts
surprisingly
complex
for
the
style
without
being
overly
bitter
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
high
and
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
the
only
real
problem
going
on
with
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
limited
beer
and
i
will
only
be
able
to
drink
it
for
a
limited
time
would
love
to
see
this
one
around
year
long
this
beer
looks
like
a
simple
ale
but
dont
let
that
fool
you
it
hits
your
tongue
with
a
bomb
of
hops
and
flavor
it
was
completely
caught
off
guard
from
then
color
even
though
i
knew
this
was
a
great
beer
its
a
great
beer
and
a
definite
try
if
you
love
beer
try
it
you
wouldnt
be
disappointed
o
without
enough
grain
to
back
up
the
massive
bitterness
from
an
early
hop
addition
this
beer
falls
short
of
anything
worth
drinking
no
pun
intended
because
shorts
actually
manages
to
brew
some
pretty
good
stuff
o
it
should
get
hammered
as
an
american
pale
lager
but
i
cant
bring
myself
to
do
it
its
more
like
the
everpopular
session
ipa
and
a
good
one
at
that
just
enough
malt
backbone
that
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
hopwater
given
the
options
id
take
this
over
most
session
ipas
maybe
a
sidebyside
with
founders
all
day
is
in
store
though
id
generally
rather
buy
two
hearted
huma
lupa
ect
and
just
drink
less
im
still
baffled
at
the
pricing
points
of
the
lower
abv
beers
please
somebody
brew
the
low
abv
stuff
and
drop
the
sixer
price
by
a
buck
or
two
id
be
all
up
on
it
