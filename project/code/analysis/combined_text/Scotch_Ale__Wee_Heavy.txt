was
pleasant
but
not
outstanding
not
sure
the
rum
element
was
for
me
its
presentation
is
pretty
good
though
and
its
only
sold
in
establishments
where
its
promoted
skillfully
cheers
o
flavor
wasnt
as
complex
as
i
expected
but
this
was
quite
nice
very
nice
beer
with
an
amazing
hint
of
rum
strong
abv
but
very
subtle
beautiful
taste
nice
balance
of
flavours
mahogany
in
color
with
a
fingers
worth
of
head
smell
is
sweet
sugar
with
a
mixture
of
vanilla
oak
and
rum
taste
is
initially
sweet
dominated
by
rum
with
oak
more
towards
the
finish
mouthful
is
thin
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
for
rum
lovers
i
keep
trying
all
the
different
beer
from
innis
gunn
and
just
cant
find
one
i
like
finished
in
oak
rum
barrels
this
beer
imparts
the
sweet
and
spicy
characters
of
the
barrels
simply
delicious
i
love
beer
and
i
love
rum
so
i
thought
id
love
this
but
i
dont
i
still
love
the
idea
but
this
one
didnt
work
for
me
not
bad
but
ultimately
a
light
taste
the
most
curious
beer
ive
ever
had
and
my
favorite
i
love
these
beers
the
flavor
profile
is
balanced
easy
to
drink
understated
very
smooth
it
is
light
with
a
nice
malt
base
and
doesnt
allow
the
hops
to
overwhelm
the
pallet
with
a
low
abv
of
6
8
it
is
highly
drinkable
while
the
rum
from
the
oak
chips
adds
a
sweetness
instead
of
the
sting
of
pure
alcohol
that
too
many
barrel
aged
beers
hit
you
with
smells
and
tastes
like
rum
without
the
bite
of
the
alcohol
the
pint
that
i
got
was
solid
its
not
totally
my
thing
but
it
will
probably
appeal
to
many
pretty
nice
if
it
is
your
bag
i
love
the
burbon
flavor
and
feel
delicious
mix
of
malty
sweetness
with
a
smooth
finish
making
it
available
year
round
as
part
of
their
core
brands
and
switching
all
their
bottles
from
clear
to
brown
was
a
great
idea
an
should
help
preserve
the
taste
people
are
looking
for
in
a
rum
oak
aged
beer
better
maltbone
and
mouthfeel
than
in
original
but
still
im
dissapointed
overall
disappointing
a
couple
of
friends
rate
this
quite
highly
but
im
finding
it
difficult
to
see
where
theyre
coming
from
theres
a
fair
bit
of
depth
in
the
smell
but
the
taste
is
completely
overhauled
by
the
spiritrum
flavours
meaning
that
ultimately
this
is
a
bit
onedimensional
worth
trying
but
not
really
worth
the
bother
of
actively
seeking
it
out
imo
didnt
enjoy
this
at
all
truly
wonderful
a
definite
beer
for
a
special
occasion
the
rum
finish
is
outstanding
definitely
has
the
spice
of
a
demerara
rum
like
ovd
mmmmm
so
good
coming
out
of
the
bottle
it
pours
a
translucent
brown
which
once
in
the
glass
settles
into
an
almost
opaque
brown
as
the
name
suggests
there
is
a
rum
aroma
and
taste
you
can
also
taste
the
oak
i
am
not
crazy
about
the
finish
since
rum
has
never
been
my
favorite
liquor
there
is
too
much
of
a
medicine
like
after
taste
for
me
the
feel
is
refreshing
in
a
soda
like
way
perhaps
the
mouth
feel
and
color
makes
me
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
coke
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
this
style
and
perhaps
need
to
get
used
to
it
will
try
other
examples
of
this
style
and
perhaps
reevaluate
my
rating
however
for
now
i
do
not
see
myself
buying
this
one
anytime
soon
o
great
stuff
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
beers
that
arent
very
beerlike
poured
a
nice

that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
little

with
a
nice
rim
ring
the
smell
from
the
rum
cask
and
red
was
great
very
sweet
with
honey
and
caramel
the
taste
balanced
with
the
rum
and
oak
being
on
the
backside
and
blended
perfectly
a
perfectly
aged
beer
with
light
enough
flavors
for
anyone
to
enjoy
not
a
stand
out
beer
but
one
that
stands
on
its
own
i
will
buy
this
again
the
aging
on
this
beer
appears
to
have
been
properly
done
the
beer
certainly
picked
up
the
rum
notes
without
tasting
as
if
they
were
merely
flavor
additives
however
i
like
scotch
ales
and
didnt
rate
this
beer
higher
because
it
lacked
some
of
the
fullness
i
look
for
in
a
wee
heavy
ive
never
had
an
innis
gunn
without
the
rum
aging
and
dont
know
if
that
is
indicative
of
this
beer
or
if
the
beer
was
mellowed
too
much
during
the
aging
process
still
a
good
beer
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again

that
skunk

are
a
poor
combination
overall
its
been
quite
a
while
since
ive
had
the
innis
gunn
original
but
i
think
i
like
this
one
just
a
bit
more
very
nice
i
didnt
think
this
beer
wouldve
been
this
good
by
the
bottle
clear

backing
it
was

it
has

it
has
a
strong
but
great
smell
it
tastes
very
good
not
an
overpowering
taste
of
rum
or
oak
just
perfect
imo
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
o
a
very
nice
aged
scotch
ale
o
good
drinkability
very
pleasant
beer
strong
scottish
character
o
pretty
good
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
still
pretty
good
final
words
if
you
can
acquire
this
brew
it
is
worth
your
effort
even
domestic
lager
drinkers
will
enjoy
this
change
from
the
ordinary
also
unlike
the
canned
data
on
this
brew
it
is
actually
7

abv
overall
another
great
beer
from
innis
gunn
very
different
a
bit
of
a
riot
in
the
mouth
to
be
honest
on
balance
taking
price
into
consideration
i
would
probably
prefer
their
spiced
rum
finish
as
it
is
around
75
the
cost
o
a
terrific
scotch
ale
from
i
g
smooth
heavenly
the
rum
really
makes
a
difference
a
step
up
from
their
regular
scotch
ale
wish
id
bought
more
recommended
this
is
the
third
offering
from
innis
gunn
which
i
have
tried
one
good
one
bad
and
this
one
soso
it
meets
the
type
criteria
well
but
just
doesnt
taste
very
good
to
me
perhaps
without
the
clear

and
very

overall
a
decent

but
wouldnt
rush
out
to
get
it
agin
may
have
got
a
bottle
that
had
too
much
sun
o
i
really
like
this
beer
i
think
it
would
be
best
as
a
standalone
to
enjoy
its
complex
aroma
a
possible
food
pairing
would
be
with
a
roasted
game
and
root
veggie
dinner
something
rich
and
hearty
worth
another
try
i
was
anxious
eager
to
get
started
so
i
went
with
a
very
heavyhanded
pour
from
the
outset
this
resulted
in
a
pseudocascade
which
netted
me
two
fingers
of
dense
lighttan
head
that
slowly
fell

brilliant

with

smelled

smoke
and

phew
i
remember
smoking
cigars
that
smelled
like
this
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
man
was
it
sweet
it
was
a
bit
much
for
me
as
a
selfavowed
hophead
but
i
liked
the
way
that
the
beer
commingled
with
the
oak
and
rum
to
create
a
very
evocative
taste
finish
remained
wildly
sweet
so
much
so
that
one
of
these
would
be
plenty
for
me
i
am
keeping
an
open
mind
as
i
open
some
of
my
other
bottles
from
this
brand
tasty
i
will
get
it
again
i
got
this
beer
for
christmas
and
it
has
slowly
become
my
favorite
beer
very
tasty
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
oakiness
it
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
whisky
when
you
smell
it
itll
make
your
mouth
water
its
really
hard
to
find
in
stores
but
it
can
be
ordered
online
shipping
is
expensive
but
its
worth
it
overall
i
always
bypassed
this
beer
due
to
the
clear
bottles
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
it
was
a
very
flavorful
beer
both
in
smell
and
taste
it
was
very
drinkable
as
well
o
a
pleasant
beer
enjoyable
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
search
out
again
o
the
bottle
says
serve
at
4
6
c
fuck
that
let
this
warm
up
like
any
other
fine
british
ale
to
unlock
the
flavour
once
again
this
is
quite
similar
to
the
tasty
original
though
surprisingly
less
explosive
of
a
taste
little
head
is
formed
on
the
pour
and
what
is
created
fizzes
away
in
a
short
time
the
color
below
is
crimson
with
red
hues
its
aroma
is
sweet
likened
to
rum
theres
a
fun
toasted
bananas
foster
note
too
giving
me
the
impression
of
a
bananas
foster
the
fun
parades
into
the
taste
where
an
overall
mellow
flavor
is
impressive
the
notes
of
oak
chips
a
clear
rum
flavor
soft
nuttiness
a
kiss
of
toasted
malt
all
pleasing
notes
to
my
palate
paired
with
a
lighter
medium
sized
body
with
gentle
carbonation
the
run
cask
version
is
just
as
worth
a
purchase
as
the
original
innis
and
gunn
this
is
part
of
a
unique
caskaged
style

that
came
with

basically
a
decent
beer
not
outstanding
not
horrible
the
rum
aging
adds
some
interesting
flavor
notes
although
i
would
have
rated
it
higher
if
it
had
a
little
more
flavor
and
complexity
worth
a
try
just
because
it
is
a
bit
different
love
a
good
oak
aged
beer
and
this
doesnt
disappoint
tasty
and
flavoursome
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
to
have
at
the
end
of
a
night
cheers
o
innis
and
gunn
may
not
be
the
best
beer
you
ever
have
but
they
are
always
tasty
complex
and
certainly
interesting

im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
benefits
of
pairing
a
rum
barrel
with
the
wee
heavy
style
overall
not
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
as
the
richness
i
recall
wasnt
there
this
time
around
also
while
the
rum
finish
does
put
a
twist
on
the
standard
ig
i
dont
think
it
makes
it
any
better
but
rather
a
bit
worse
im
thinking
this
one
may
have
seen
too
much
light
nonetheless
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
best
in
an
imperial

glass
i
switched
glasses
mid
tasting

it

its
just
wrong
sorry
innis
all
that
oak
aging
gone

for

i
know
some
must
appreciate
you
o
a
very
nice
dessert
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
balanced
by
the
oak
and
fruitiness
a
solid
example
of
using

to
add
a
nice

complexity
to
a

complain

would

the

i
dont
like
scotch

i
did
review
this
to
the
best
of
my

ability
this
is
a
nice
wee
heavy
though
not
as
full
flavored
or
full

as
i
would
like
the
flavors
that
are

are
definitely
pleasant
balanced
and
enjoyable
i
think
i
would
have
this
beer
again
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
too
special
to
my
taste
other
than
the
flavors
from
the
barrel
i
could
stand
to
drink
it
again
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
it
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
liquor
though
very
sweet
aroma
fairly
sweet
and
complex
flavor
with
enough
savory
character
to
reign
it
in
from
being
overwhelmingly
cloying
very
complex
but
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
o
really
delicious
beer
this
brewery
knows
how
to
use
their
wood
a
treat
pours
a
dark
red
and
brown
with
a
nice
reddish
white
hue
head
the
smell
is
slightly
better
than
ok
not
overpowering
on
any
level
or
better
said
sort
of
a
duller
smell
for
a
rum
oak
beer
the
taste
is
dreamt
sweet
oak
taste
the
rum
hides
in
the
background
probably
the
sweet
taste
impn
the
oak
the
nice
part
is
the
oak
isnt
too
crazy
like
many
oak
beers
can
be
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
too
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
the
only
knock
would
be
is
on
the
flatter
side
kind
of
feels
like
the
beer
has
been
sitting
around
too
long
overall
im
on
an
innis
and
gunn
kick
this
is
another
very
well
put
together
beer
i
guess
they
are
perfecting
barrel
aging
process
medium
bodied
and
slightly
watery
on
the
finish
the
sweetness
in
the
malt
is
offset
by
the
bitterness
which
takes
priority
pours
a
brownish
ruby
red
with
a
medium
slowly
dissipating
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
rum
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
sweet
alcohol
esters
taste
is
sweet
rum
flavor
and
alcohol
brown
sugar
toffee
and
caramel
palate
is
a
medium
to
full
body
smooth
and
sweet
mouth
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
caramel
rum
barrel
flavor
brown
sugar
toffee
and
some
dry
sweet
alcohol
ending
overall
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
by
a
good
flavorful
and
enjoyable
brew
a
smooth
beer
with
not
a
lot
else
going
for
it
a
friend
of
mine
loves
it
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
not
for
me
it
smells
and
tastes
overly
malty
not
very
bitter
at
all
just
not
great
it
sort
of
tasted
stale
or
flat
i
had
it
once
more
to
make
sure
it
was
not
just
a
bad
bottle
or
something
it
was
not
not
recomended
overall
very
drinkable
but
has
much
more
of
the
wee
than
the
heavy
o
a
favorite
taste
treat
stiff
competition
from
founders
backwoods
bastard
and
one
or
two
other
cask
aged
brews
but
still
an
affordable
yearround
imbibers
confection
taste
has
the
same
oakiness
brown
sugar
and
rum
flavors
but
doesnt
over
power
the
scotch
ale
base
complex
with
new
flavors
in
every
sip
malt
base
is
bready
minimal
hops
alcohol
warms
going
down
yet
still
smooth
i
have
enjoyed
most
innis
gunn
but
this
may
be
the
favorite
so
far
overall
i
am
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
once
the
skunky
nose
subsided
this
beer
opened
up
and
it
was
great
it
is
definitely
softer
and
more
mellow
than
american
craft
scotch
ales
and
barrel
aged
ales
in
general
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
hope
to
drink
it
again
in
the
future
very
pleasing
taste
smooth
multiple
flavors
coming
through
unique
touch
of
oak
from
the
aging
process
well
balanced
with
a
long
finish
now
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
have
this
on
a
winters
night
itll
get
you
closer
to
the
hearth
without
burning
your
bum
my
favorite
beer
so
i
am
biased
im
sorry
ive
tried
a
few
other
wee
heavys
but
this
one
takes
the
cake
with
no
competition
in
sight
im
not
saying
theres
not
a
better
wee
heavybeer
out
there
but
rum
cask
is
exceptional
other
wee
heavys
ive
had
had
a
bit
more
umph
to
it
rum
cask
is
smooth
which
is
amazing
being
its
aged
in
casks
to
me
the
cask
beers
usually
are
the
ones
with
the
umph
i
dont
have
the
greatest
sense
of
smell
but
the
smell
was
good
great
carbonation
which
made
a
two
finger
head
that
stayed
very
long
with
sticky
lacing
very
complex
mouthier
but
again
very
smooth
and
layered
perfectly
i
really
cant
taste
too
much
alcohol
burn
barely
taste
that
its
there
but
it
is
in
the
nose
it
also
may
be
more
subtle
because
i
like
to
drink
it
a
tad
colder
than
the
recommended
wee
heavy
temp
still
tatstes
great
at
its
temp
love
the
rum
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
m
surprisingly
light
although
ive
had
the
original
and
its
similar
in
body
very
little
carbonation
not
sure
why
this
beer
gets
so
much
hate
on
this
site
for
the
price
it
is
hard
to
find
a
more
complex
yet
well
balanced
beer
that
has
been
barrel
aged
malty
soft
notes
of
vanilla
and
rum
blended
together
very
well
make
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
and
also
a
must
try
overall
some
good
things
going
on
but
id
like
to
see
the
flavor
profile
developed
a
little
more
wonderful
beer
no
nasty
aftertaste
just
dark
enough
ale
for
a
stout
drinker
lovely
aroma
very
smooth
now
on
my
top
of
the
heap
ale
list
the
seacoast
area
of
new
hampshire
is
becoming
a
beer
destination
many
new
micro
breweries
and
i
actually
get
a
great
selection
at
the
supermarket
this
bottle
was
from
a
market
basket
and
they
were
3
for
12
i
am
visiting
edinburgh
in
two
weeks
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
on
tap
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
woody
aromas
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
aroma
that
comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
much
the
same
with
rum
vanilla
and
woody
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
caramel
sweetness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
rum
presence
is
only
coming
through
in
the
taste
and
even
then
its
pretty
subdued
the
taste
has
a
fullness
to
it
with
the
fruit
and
toffee
and
a
small
bitterness
at
the
end
there
is
a
smokiness
which
i
am
not
fond
of
however
some
minor
dings
clear
bottle
though
no
hint
of
skunkiness
here
and
an
odd
suggestion
on
the
bottle
to
serve
at
46
celcius
thats
way
too
cold
and
hides
the
complexities
of
this
beer
nice
rocky
head
that
leaves
some
lace
here
and
there
very
clear
light
mahogany
color
all
the
right
smells
with
dark
molasses
toffee
and
rum
personality
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
an
oaked
rum
over
the
whole
thing
vanilla
and
mild
cherry
merge
with
rum
and
dark
sugar
and
roasted
grains
thickish
weight
and
feel
with
a
delightful
smooth
and
mild
carbonation
an
excellent
brew
that
in
spite
of
the
elevated
abv
lends
itself
to
session
drinking
at
a
slightly
slower
pace
the
rum
cask
innis
gunn
is
definitely
my
favorite
among
the
regularly
available
offerings
and
is
a
great
afterdinner
beer
overall
i
am
going
to
consider
this
beer
world
class
i
think
that
it
would
be
i
have
had
only
a
few
but
i
could
see
this
as
something
for
a
brewer
to
aspire
to
or
learn
from
4
out
of
5
would
be
on
the
low
side
i
may
have
to
give
this
more
overall
its
highly
drinkable
and
while
it
doesnt
pack
a
punch
it
has
enough
flavour
to
keep
it
interesting
i
can
see
this
working
well
as
a
gateway
beer
to
get
others
away
from
macros
o
again
a
great
beer
by
these
guys
the
feel
is
pretty
well
refined
considering
that
this
beer
has
the
potential
to
swing
to
one
of
at
least
two
unpleasant
extremes
cloying
and
sticky
or
overly
thinned
as
such
the
body
is
just
a
touch
light
but
the
smoothness
makes
for
pleasant
drinking
and
theres
a
nice
bite
o
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
i
loved
the
way
the
booze
toffee
caramel
and
oak
all
were
evident
but
tied
together
well
i
was
also
impressed
on
how
quaffable
this
was
at
7
4
one
might
consider
it
a
sipper
but
because
of
the
body
and
impressive
taste
two
would
be
justified
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
being
partial
to
both
rum
and
barrel
aged
beers
i
can
see
how
the
sweetness
could
be
a
little
much
for
some
poured
from
a
330
ml
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
red
almost
maroon
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
the
fizzy
malty
rum
aroma
dominates
but
it
is
not
surprising
at
all
by
the
description
tastes
of
fizzy
rum
with
nice
dark
malt
base
beer
is
highly
carbonated
lightmedium
bodied
beer
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
definitely
a
sipper
finishing
off
my
innis
gunn
holiday
gift
pack
this
was
definitely
the
stand
out
of
the
bunch
i
bought
a
case
of
this
awhile
back
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
had
a
vanilla
note
to
it
and
was
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
i
liked
it
on
the
cooler
side
40f
but
it
was
not
bad
once
it
warmed
it
up
either
i
still
have
a
bottle
or
2
tucked
away
but
so
far
i
havent
found
a
reason
to
drink
them
overall
its
decent
but
not
worth
the
money
id
enjoy
this
more
if
id
never
have
traquir
backwoods
bastard
too
mild
on
the
flavors
kind
of
like
a
starter
wee
heavy
not
a
fan
of
any
innis
beers
so
far
come
on
guys
this
stuff
is
amazing
smooth
drinkable
not
anything
like
a
typical
scotch
ale
this
is
sooo
drinkable
it
sucks
its
12
99
a
4
pack
even
there
regular
brew
one
is
awesome
but
all
beers
are
not
creteated
equal
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
another
must
try
overall
this
ale
is
a
combination
of
whiskey
and
ale
given
my
scottish
roots
maybe
this
ale
hit
my
drunken
funny
bone
but
this
is
a
fine
and
top
notch
ale
just
give
it
a
try
o
still
certainly
lightstruck
and
a
little
oxidized
but
this
one
and
the
other
two
in
the
pack
were
actually
drinkable
and
didnt
result
in
a
drainpour
im
gonna
consolidate
the
scores
from
the
two
bottles
first
one
got
an
even
2
second
one
got
an
even
3
and
give
it
a
2
5
obviously
these
guys
have
serious
quality
control
issues
they
really
need
to
start
considering
shelling
out
the
extra
capital
to
invest
in
colored
bottles
at
least
go
for
green
glass
if
not
brown
guys
330ml

poured
into
leffe

colour
hint
of

clear
no

minimal

aroma
was
bourbon
and
not
much
else
tasted
oak
rum
bourbon
and
a
hint
of
vanila
finish
was
long
and
boozy
eventhough
the
beer
didnt
taste
too
boozy
mouthfull
was
smooth
but
texture
was
slightly
thick
and
sticky
no
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
cant
understand
barrel
aging
a
beer
and
putting
it
in
a
clear
glass
bottle
reviewed
from
notes
body
may
be
just
a
bit
light
but
carbonation
is
adequate
alcohol
is
felt
slightly
but
adds
to
the
sipping
character
very
nice
beer
such
a
tasty
brew
unique
tasty
and
complex
and
an
easy
drinker
up
there
with
the
other
i
g
versions
try
them
all
overall
for
fans
of
rum
and
unique
beer
alike
this
is
a
must
try
an
unassuming
scotch
ale
with
a
nice
kick
of
sweet
rum
barrel
flavor
pretty
good
scotch
ale
less
rich
than
some
of
the
other
ones
ive
had
which
makes
it
a
bit
easier
going
down
good
flavor
a
little
different
from
others
ive
had
in
that
department
as
well
like
this
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
these
brewers
taste
is
caramelised
dried
fruit
and
wood
a
lot
of
candied
and
dried
cherry
spicy
raisiny
warmth
it
is
a
little
sweeter
fuller
and
more
characterful
than
the
winter
beer
2011
smooth
and
malty
brew
more
sweet
caramel
malts
and
again
cola
and
just
perhaps
some
woodrum
cask
decent
enough
brew
but
not
really
doing
much
for
my
senses
worth
a
try
but
ultimately
this
seems
to
be
over
priced
and
underwhelming
a
dark
mahogany
pour
with
reddish
edges
and
a
lightly
tan
head
the
aroma
has
sugary
caramel
oak
and
some
earthy
notes
the
medium
body
has
a
slightly
sticky
texture
with
soft
carbonation
it
has
a
sweet
taste
with
rum
flavor
and
slight
warmth
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
different
type
of
beer
decent
but
in
my
eyes
not
as
good
as
the
original
oak
aged
brew
from
innus
gunn
even
though
it
is
stronger
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
not
a
big
fan
of
the
innis
and
gunn
beers
seem
kind
of
mellow
to
me
and
a
bit
bland
all
of
the
beer
flavors
malt
and
hops
were
very
muted
overall
drinkability
interesting
not
an
amazing
scotch
ale
just
simply
interesting
im
on
the
fence
about
having
another
one
i
think
i
wouldnt
mind
a
proper
full
pint
of
this
rather
than
11
2oz
but
i
also
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
definitely
worth
a
try
though
to
see
how
a
beer
aged
in
a
rum
cask
turns
out
all
in
all
a
clean
drink
smooth
and
has
a
nice
kick
of
abv
buy
this
beer
it
tastes
too
much
like
rum
and
not
enough
like
beer
if
you
like
rum
this
is
a
beer
you
should
definately
try
its
not
something
i
would
drink
again
overall
out
of
all
the
ig
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
this
one
tastes
the
best
and
goes
down
easy
would
be
cool
to
find
this
guy
out
on
draft
someday
easy
drinking
but
still
a
sipping
beer
perhaps
this
one
is
best
with
dessert
glassware
innis
and
gunn
occasion
shark
tank
retruns
to
tv
aroma
rummy
for
certain
with
its
trademark
ig
whisky
maltiness
intriguing
as
with
all
their
brews
appearancecognacbodied
thinly
headed
with
an
unassuming
white
rim
palate
thick
sodalike
fizzy
body
that
has
a
syrup
drip
taste
definitely
vanilla
and
fruity
esters
combine
wth
an
aggressive
bold
strength
overall
a
challenging
brew
that
doesnt
quiet
have
the
spive
that
the
bottle
proclaims
it
is
noticeably
alcoholic
in
its
exhale
o
this
beer
is
far
superior
to
innis
gunns
original
the
rum
cask
is
a
big
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
this
year
and
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
would
get
again
overall
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
few
bucks
and
on
a
whim
id
definitely
try
it
again
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
small
alcohol
notes
rum
and
a
small
oak
presence
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
and
a
small
presence

rum
and
alcohol
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
note
of
dark
rum
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
sweeter
in
the
wood
than
bourbon
whiskey
but
nice
nonetheless
this
is
a
big
heavy
beer
however
it
remains
really
interesting
the
sweetness
and
syrupiness
are
a
bit
too
pronounced
i
find
but
the
do
succeed
in
bringing
some
dark
fruit
and
spice
character
to
this
beer
one
to
seek
out
and
experience
o
not
bad
but
not
something
that
i
would
grab
for
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
it
was
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
barrel
aged
ale
it
had
good
balance
which
made
it
good
pretty
smooth
but
i
wish
the
flavors
were
a
little
bolder
i
wouldnt
mind
sacrificing
a
little
bit
of
drinkability
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
go
down
smooth
and
quickly
the
flavor
held
my
attention
and
i
would
mind
drinking
more
then
a
couple
of
these
by
the
campfire
what
i
like
most
about
this
beer
was
the
great
mouthfeel
and
the
great
balance
this
beer
had
thats
what
made
this
beer
above
average
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
rum
wasnt
as
bold
as
i
would
like
and
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
if
those
were
worked
on
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
an
affordable
and
good
barrel
aged
beer
i
can
see
getting
this
often
and
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
if
barrel
aged
beers
are
your
thing
this
was
my
first
rum
barrel
aged
beer
and
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
impressed
and
im
interesting
in
checking
more
of
there
different
beers
out
good
job
guys
you
can
bet
i
will
be
a
repeat
customer
overall
a
good
beer
but
the
rum
is
understated
more
than
i
would
like
this
beer
is
very
unusual
it
has
a
rich
amber
appearance
with
little
head
and
very
light
carbonation
making
for
a
smooth
and
refreshing
drink
it
has
a
nice
aroma
of
oak
and
rum
blended
with
a
spicy
and
hoppy
ale
the
flavor
is
the
same
you
can
taste
the
rum
but
peppery
spice
is
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
this
and
the
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
perfect
sipping
beer
best
served
after
a
meal
or
paired
with
a
cigar
or
pipe
this
is
not
one
that
i
would
drink
more
than
a
glass
or
two
in
a
sitting
because
of
the
bold
and
rich
flavor
not
alcohol
content
rich
one
bottle
is
plenty
as
even
though
its
not
a
huge
beer
its
quite
sweet
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
3
ive
had
the
oak
aged
the
irish
whisky
cask
and
this
so
far
clear
deep
red
in
color
with
2
fingers
of
head
which
quickly
diminished
smells
of
vanilla
rum
wood
plum
grapes
very
sweet
vanilla
flavor
with
a
wood
backbone
definitely
taste
the
rum
cask
aging
aside
from
that
there
is
a
fruity
taste
leaning
towards
apples
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
barely
any
lacing
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
dessert
beer
very
sweet
very
rich
however
i
do
wish
it
was
a
bit
heavier
in
the
mouthfeel
maybe
a
bit
of
creaminess
worth
trying
if
you
cant
stand
the
sweetness
of
the
regular
version
poured
from
a
clear
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlight
and
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
rum
alcohol
taste
is
also
rum
up
front
oak
alcohol
a
touch
of
malts
different
and
unique
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
not
a
bad
beer
a
little
unusual
for
me
and
i
cant
really
get
in
to
it
o
i
was
so
hopped
up
to
try
this
beer
a
scottish
ale
in
rum
cask
why
wouldnt
this
be
good
when
i
had
it
i
was
slightly
disappointed
the
beers
rum
notes
are
almost
not
there
they
tease
you
in
the
back
round
there
oak
flavor
saves
this
beer
and
is
steady
and
is
there
through
out
the
hole
tasting
proses
nice
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
on
the
back
end
all
and
all
this
beer
is
really
good
not
great
but
pretty
damn
good
im
leaning
toward
the
rum
cask
version
but
after
trying
two
innis
gunn
specialties
im
growing
a
little
exhausted
of
the
brewery
not
to
cut
them
short
i
mean
this
is
what
they
do
but
i
certainly
get
the
schtick
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
a
prime
example
of
a
wee
heavy
but
ill
take
it
now
and
have
another
again
sometime
down
the
road
4
0
then
second
and
so
on
o
pretty
amazing
for
something
rather
easy
to
access
at
least
in
my
area
fragrant
and
smooth
o
decent
and
different
the
rum
aspect
of
this
is
evident
but
i
dont
think
they
got
the
balance
of
it
right
there
are
a
lot
of
other
good
casked
beers
out
there
in
my
opinion
similar
to
innis
gunn
original
this
beer
is
darker
in
color
and
has
a
roasted
flavor
slightly
higher
in
alcohol
at
7
4
abv
this
beer
hides
it
really
well
full
mouth
feel
and
strong
flavors
make
this
a
great
stand
alone
beer
or
enjoy
with
a
cigar
o
i
want
to
drink
this
beer
after
i
smoke
a
cigar
delicious
beer
overall
i
really
want
to
love
this
beer
but
i
cant
but
i
cant
hate
it
either
it
seems
to
me
that
the
balance
is
off
the
rum
flavor
sweetness
and
alcohol
begin
to
dominate
soon
after
the
pour
if
the
abv
was
lower
i
could
see
this
being
a
very
interesting
session
beer
but
unlike
most
brews
i
enjoy
this
becomes
less
complex
as
it
warms
certainly
give
it
a
try
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
35
for
me
its
making
me
crave
a
90
shilling
ale
from
my
favorite
brewpub
okay
not
bad
but
the
whole
thing
sounds
better
than
it
tastes
d
not
bad
but
the
rum
character
is
a
bit
disappointment
the
dark
sugars
of
the
base
beer
work
nicely
with
the
oak
but
there
really
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
rum
specific
character
kind
of
a
let
down
overall
wonderful
drink
the
rum
cask
did
an
awesome
job
with
the
beer
o
not
sure
how
long
this
is
cask
aged
possibly
1
day
if
this
was
a
heavier
brew
more
full
bodied
it
would
rate
much
higher
here
no
roasted
notes
no
smokiness
the
disconnect
between
the
style
and
the
sweetness
and
body
are
a
little
hard
to
overlook
a
for
effort
but
b
for
execution
overall
ive
been
impressed
by
innes
and
gunn
and
will
be
looking
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
and
only
a
slight
note
of
the
alcohol
overall
for
my
first
rumbarrel
aged
brew
im
decently
impressed
with
the
flavors
and
would
recommend
this
brew
overall
9
5
out
of
10
ill
be
looking
for
this
to
bring
home
a
beer
very
well
thought
out
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
but
with
the
proper
carbonation
to
make
it
highly
quaffable
of
course
its
not
a
beer
youll
tear
through
but
its
not
disgustingly
thick
good
stuff
o
i
had
previously
called
this
one
of
the
best
beers
around
time
has
changed
me
a
bit
still
its
a
lovely
tasting
beer
for
sipping
and
i
admire
a
great
deal
about
it
grab
a
bottle
and
hang
out
on
the
deck
this
spring
the
pioneers
of
barrel
aging
beer
havent
really
kept
up
with
the
times
imo
decent
stuff
but
not
the
best
barrel
aged
offering
ive
had
recently
not
my
fav
style
but
its
ok
i
wouldnt
get
again
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
is
slightly
creamy
with
mild
carbonation
overall
i
liked
it
but
not
somethin
id
buy
again
overall
if
you
like
sweet
you
will
like
this
i
do
overall
lives
up
to
its
name
but
really
not
that
interesting
innis
gunn
presents
its
nicely
colored
beers
in
pretty
packaging
but
doesnt
seem
to
pay
much
attention
to
whats
inside
the
bottle
at
least
thats
what
ive
consistently
found
this
one
is
right
in
line
with
the
others
ive
tried
gorgeous
color
but
weak
aroma
rather
flat
body
and
bland
taste
i
detected
some
buttery
oak
in
the
flavor
but
there
wasnt
much
in
the
way
of
scotch
ale
for
me
this
was
just
too
light
and
thin
the
koolaid
aftertaste
was
i
suppose
the
rum
part
pass
poured
from
a
bottle
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
vibrant
rubycopper
coloring
with
a
thin
foamy
light
beige
head
aromas
are
roasted
and
woody
with
dark
fruit
spices
and
floral
notes
the
nose
is
dark
and
subtle
flavors
are
sweet
with
a
candied
sugar
initial
taste
followed
by
some
subtle
oak
and
brown
sugar
characteristics
im
assuming
from
the
rum
barrels
i
mean
im
sure
its
not
just
a
clever
name
roasty
and
currant
fruit
undertones
keep
the
sweetness
from
being
overpowering
the
body
is
somewhat
light
but
smooth
overall
the
aftertaste
is
syrupy
sweet
and
imparted
with
oaky
characteristics
it
almost
has
a
maple
syrup
like
profile
only
oak
because
its
not
a
maple
barrel
the
finish
has
a
slight
linger
that
slowly
shrinks
away
leaving
a
semisweet
touch
on
the
palate
not
bad
but
im
not
blown
away
i
had
had
one
oak
aged
beer
from
ig
before
and
i
recall
being
underwhelmed
not
this
time
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
looks
and
smells
great
tastes
and
feels
good
has
excellent
balance
and
good
complexity
totally
worth
a
try
i
wish
i
had
more
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
again
a
noble
attempt
to
add
character
to
ordinary
ales
may
i
suggest
they
use
brown
glass
next
time
overall
i
am
quite
happy
with
this
beer
the
rum
is
not
too
overpowering
and
the
sweetness
is
held
in
check
an
excellent
sipper
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
it
pours
out
a
nice
rubybrown
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
very
complex
the
alcohol
comes
out
and
says
hello
first
but
deep
wiffs
gets
oak
dark
fruits
sweet
malts
vanilla
toffee
and
a
bit
of
spices
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
alcohol
on
the
nose
but
otherwise
very
nice
the
taste
reverses
the
sensation
from
the
nose
with
some
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
and
vanilla
coming
first
then
the
oak
rum
spices
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
come
roaring
in
finishing
with
a
bit
more
of
the
sweetness
its
a
sipper
but
one
that
youll
really
enjoy
over
the
course
of
an
hour
as
it
warms
up
mouthfeel
smooth
and
drinkable
the
oak
isnt
too
over
powering
and
the
complexity
goes
on
for
days
working
my
way
through
the
ig
offerings
at
hand
good
times
thus
far
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
rusty
brown
topped
by
a
minimal
amount
of
offcreamwhite
foam
the
nose
is
dizzominated
by
a
blast
of
buttercream
and
caramel
there
might
be
a
bit
of
marshmallow
and
oak
in
there
too
but
theyre
drowned
out
by
the
big
boys
in
the
room
the
taste
holds
notes
of
vanilla
cinnamon
buttercream
toffee
rum
spice
very
light
oak
and
light
ginger
this
stuff
is
very
complex
each
flavor
inhabiting
its
own
layer
and
its
own
wave
across
the
tongue
nice
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
no
surprise
from
the
ig
crew
this
was
a
nice
pairing
with
a
plate
of
spicy
shrimp
fried
rice
which
did
not
overpower
the
depth
of
flavor
in
this
visually
deceptive
brew
this
is
a
solid
beverage
with
good
character
super
smooth
goodness
with
a
nice
abv
that
treats
your
gut
like
soul
food
would
comfortable
and
pleasing
couldnt
drink
a
ton
of
it
at
one
sitting
but
had
plenty
of
space
for
two
before
calling
it
a
night
ah
loch
thes
swally
a
lot
slainte
o
it
drinks
pretty
light
overall
especially
for
its
abv
it
tastes
decent
and
i
did
enjoy
it
but
it
is
not
worth
its
price
in
my
opinion
i
like
the
original
ig
better
strong
aroma
is
rather
sweet
and
has
a
definite
overtone
of
rumsoaked
wood
as
well
as
caramel
and
malty
notes
it
pours
a
beautiful
clear
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
pale
tan
head
sublime
flavor
has
tones
of
rum
caramel
malt
and
wood
and
is
rather
sweet
but
not
cloying
fullbodied
syrupy
texture
has
just
a
little
fizz
though
a
truly
satisfying
beer
to
be
sipped
and
savored
from
the
25
ouncer
the
packaging
is
beautiful
sampled
on
january
13
2012
the
pour
is
dark
amber
with
a
longlasting
foamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweeter
than
you
might
think
with
a
nice
supply
of
malts
brown
sugar
and
a
small
note
of
rum
the
body
is
medium
to
heavy
after
aging
in
rum
barrels
you
would
think
the
taste
might
come
across
as
boozy
but
this
is
hardly
the
case
it
is
very
sweet
and
caramellike
with
toffee
and
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
on
the
tail
end
well
recommended
sidenote
i
have
a
policy
not
to
buy
beer
in
clear
bottles
a
friend
gave
me
this
after
he
tried
it
and
said
it
tasted
like
shit
i
dont
agree
i
think
theres
worthwhile
beer
here
but
its
destroyed
by
the
brewerys
dumb
choice
d
delicious
and
a
product
i
would
certainly
drink
again
best
characteristic
of
this
is
the
detectable
rum
taste
o
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
its
worth
a
shot
if
you
find
a
single
of
it
i
wouldnt
buy
a
4
pack
but
its
good
enough
to
buy
once
nice
use
of
oak
with
a
solid
ale
the
rum
part
is
mild
which
is
fine
this
is
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
fan
of
oakaged
beer
with
a
twist
of
rum
this
poured
out
as
a
clean
looking
brownish
amber
color
with
a
thick
creamy
looking
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
on
the
nose
lots
of
earthy
grains
and
vanilla
there
was
a
little
bit
of
the
rum
spice
in
there
too
but
not
much
the
taste
of
this
brew
compared
to
the
other
oak
aged
ale
by
innis
gunn
to
me
was
much
nicer
here
the
flavors
were
still
pretty
intense
but
in
a
more
balanced
manner
here
the
rum
flavors
kind
of
die
off
midway
through
the
bottle
leaving
you
with
a
sweet
dry
flavor
in
your
mouth
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
smooth
overall
its
a
decent
brew
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
them
but
either
way
still
pretty
good
just
not
my
style
i
suppose
o
one
of
my
first
scottish
ales
the
rum
cask
touch
was
nice
and
something
im
not
normally
used
to
or
have
seen
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
i
could
have
a
few
more
of
these
this
is
a
decent
little
sipper
but
the
rum
doesnt
do
enough
for
me
i
prefer
the
regular
oaked
version
o
quite
tasty
really
enjoyed
this
one
great
for
a
cold
night
around
the
holidays
well
balanced
and
really
good
overall
this
beer
is
a
disappointment
for
me
the
barrel
aging
didnt
do
much
to
affect
the
flavor
add
little
oak
and
hardly
any
rum
the
abv
is
nicely
masked
but
its
just
kind
of
boring
im
glad
i
found
a
smaller
bottle
so
i
didnt
have
to
dump
the
majority
of
a
bomber
overall
i
was
a
pit
disappointed
with
this
one
the
complexity
lacks
in
comparison
to
similar
aged
beers
from
the
us
its
a
drinkable
beer
just
nothing
special
overall
one
great
beer
a
great
blend
of
sweetness
with
the
rum
flavor
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
o
damn
fine
brew
here
has
great
flavors
which
all
compliment
one
another
adding
to
my
list
to
pick
up
more
great
on
a
cold
night
winner
all
the
way
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
perfect
with
breadspastas
pours
a
onefinger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
opaque
brown
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
light
rum
and
oak
nose
and
flavor
is
toffee
and
vanilla
with
a
sweet
rum
finish
10
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
pamplemousse
salem
ma
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
if
drank
too
often
this
could
become
rather
ordinary
definitely
worth
a
try
quite
nice
of
a
beer
overall
a
nicely
flavored
beer
that
drinks
fairly
quickly
for
the
style
the
rum
barrels
did
not
impart
that
much
flavor
but
it
is
interesting
worth
trying
this
one
o
a
different
beer
nice
and
tasteful
a
little
les
sweetness
would
have
helped
overall
the
beer
is
decent
but
not
great
i
feel
he
alcohol
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
i
do
enjoy
the
rum
flavor
and
as
usual
the
oak
tastes
and
aromas
o
overall
spicy
and
dry
with
oak
barrel
notes
and
a
warmth
of
dry
rum
alcohol
the
alcohol
seems
a
bit
forefront
at
times
but
there
is
enough
complexity
that
comes
through
to
make
things
interesting
moderate
drinkability
o
i
honestly
do
not
understand
the
aboveaverage
scores
from
others
for
this
beer
ive
already
had
a
superlative
rum
barrelaged
scotch
ale
this
month
ccb
ba
big
sound
this
beer
bears
no
resemblance
to
that
one
it
barely
tastes
like
a
wee
heavy
and
i
have
no
idea
why
they
bother
putting
the
rum
barrel
information
on
the
label
not
worth
the
time
the
money
or
the
calories
down
the
drain
it
goes
d
off
the
charts
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
be
seeking
it
out
again
for
sure
never
had
a
rum
casked
beer
before
poured
a
dark
amber
maple
syrup
color
with
a
quarter
inch
cream
head
that
lasted
about
30
seconds
smelled
like
a
manly
version
of
a
tropical
drink
definitely
attributable
to
the
rum
i
tasted
no
beer
in
at
all
though
like
a
watered
down
liquor
drink
it
was
hard
to
call
this
a
beer
for
me
with
almost
none
of
the
requisite
ingredients
identifiable
in
the
palate
still
though
a
pretty
nice
unique
flavor
very
woody
and
a
little
sweet
dried
fruits
molasses
not
bad
overall
the
mouthfeel
could
have
made
this
beer
but
it
broke
it
instead
almost
entirely
flat
and
losing
much
of
its
most
redeeming
characteristics
as
it
warmed
i
did
not
dislike
this
brew
but
it
missed
the
mark
for
me
extra
points
for
doing
something
original
though
and
worth
a
try
for
the
wood
beer
freak
salud
o
very
tasty
and
a
big
improvement
imo
over
their
standard
oak
aged
beer
as
a
big
fan
of
rum
this
brew
really
hits
the
spot
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
the
style
o
a
really
flavorful
beer
but
it
is
unbalanced
by
its
high
sweetness
had
a
bottle
of
this
with
my
meal
at
bertas
in
wanaque
nj
poured
a
reddish
mahogany
with
a
beige
head
one
finger
average
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
revealed
large
caramel
apple
pear
cherry
oak
vanilla
and
maple
syrup
notes
i
must
say
that
after
reading
some
reviews
i
was
bracing
myself
to
be
underwhelmed
but
i
was
in
fact
impressed
then
the
taste
very
similar
to
the
nose
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
maple
side
midpalate
dissolving
to
a
sweet
cherrymaple
syrup
finish
punctuated
by
some
alcohol
hints
medium
bodied
and
almost
no
carbonation
slick
viscous
feel
despite
the
sweetness
and
the
viscosity
i
actually
found
this
beer
to
be
pleasantly
drinkable
paired
very
nicely
with
my
cream
tart
dessert
overall
a
reasonably
good
beer
but
for
60
sek
per
liter
i
am
not
sure
at
all
whether
i
would
care
for
this
again
this
one
is
a
unique
beer
and
rather
tasty
if
a
bit
sweet
and
onedimensional
i
wish
there
was
more
malt
complexity
in
the
flavor
but
its
got
to
be
one
of
the
better
beers
youll
find
in
a
clear
bottle
like
i
said
of
the
two
gunns
offered
on
the
regular
here
in
tn
id
much
rather
drink
this
rum
aged
version
a
bit
bigger
alcohol
suggests
a
more
robust
maltiness
which
was
a
great
improvement
along
side
the
drier
spicier
flavors
12
oz
into
a
snifter
even
though
i
dont
love
this
beer
i
tried
to
give
it
decent
marks
for
uniqueness
seems
a
little
light
in
color
for
a
wee
heavy
although
i
guess
the
brewery
is
located
in
scotland
so
maybe
i
should
stfu
and
all
the
other
wee
heavies
ive
ever
had
were
too
dark
head
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
theres
tons
of
rum
notes
in
the
nose
as
well
as
oak
ditto
on
the
tongue
it
delivers
as
promised
in
that
respect
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
not
something
ill
drink
again
for
awhile
but
i
recommend
trying
it
unique
but
id
love
to
try
a
scottish
ale
more
deserving
that
has
been
put
through
the
cask
treatment
not
as
rich
or
robust
as
i
would
like
to
for
a
wee
heavy
drinkabilityoverall
overall
this
beer
is
very
nice
and
enjoyable
in
a
similar
kind
of
way
as
the
regular
innis
and
gun
beer
is
nice
mellow
some
what
sweet
oaky
ale
while
i
really
do
like
this
style
of
beer
they
make
i
cant
say
i
was
getting
as
much
of
the
rum
as
i
thought
that
i
might
good
beer
for
sure
but
not
sure
i
like
it
more
then
the
regular
beer
of
theres
which
is
few
bucks
cheaper
its
good
that
i
got
this
in
a
mix
pack
given
that
it
would
be
hard
to
down
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
thats
not
because
this
beer
turned
me
off
but
because
its
more
like
a
cordial
or
something
that
should
be
poured
into
a
snifter
or
rocks
glass
like
the
other
innis
and
gunn
offering
that
ive
had
so
far
this
certainly
pushed
the
boundary
of
what
i
think
a
beer
is
and
even
if
not
everyone
enjoys
the
end
results
this
is
much
more
likely
to
stand
out
for
me
over
time
this
was
a
solid
effort
at
pushing
the
envelope
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
coppergarnet
color
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
the
retention
was
nice
and
the
lacing
in
small
bands
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
toffee
oak
booze
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
the
flavors
were
similar
with
the
oak
being
strong
but
behind
that
were
lots
of
subtleties
of
rum
tobacco
toffee
butterscotch
molasses
and
nuts
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
average
complex
and
nuanced
despite
being
strong
a
great
example
of
the
of
a
wee
heavy

thoughts
im
glad
to
see
innis
and
gunn
win
some
redemption
in
my
eyes
after
that
somewhat
lackluster
blonde
id
say
it
was
nearly
as
enjoyable
as
the
canadian
cask
and
it
really
comes
out
as
it
warms
it
doesnt
yet
beat
the
standard
innis
and
gunn
though
but
not
over
the
top
rum
is
heavy
with
its
influence
without
creating
a
boozy
trick
a
little
oak
involves
itself
too
pretty
tasty
and
fairly
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
as
sweet
as
it
is
not
too
shabby

the

the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
if
you
like
a
heavier
beer
than
normal
with
a
great
after
taste
then
i
would
recommend
to
try
this
beer
its
one
of
a
kind
it
also
has
a
very
nice
smell
the
glass
for
the
bottle
is
transparent
it
tastes
good
on
its
own
or
even
with
pretzels
or
other
snacks

but
the
effect
wears
off
after
a
while
too
sweet
little
vanilla
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
it
is
definitely
different

drunk
at

yes
it
has
the
requisite
foundation
of
a
north
american
take
on
the
style
however
it
comes
across
extremely
dull
whether
due
to
it
being
old

from
a
hitch
in

not

the
concept
is

the
amount

sweetness
really
ruins
it
for
me
very
dark

with
small

rich

of
dark

medium

lighter

a

not

would

buy
this

by

on

the
addition
of
maple
really

the
hint
of

do
not

bitter

the

either
from
roast

i
enjoy
a

i
find
them

beers
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
and
how
light
it
felt
compared
to
others
of
the
style
a
nice
change
i
also
like
the
use
of
maple
in
this
beer
o
a
really
solid
scotch
ale
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
the
maple
syrup
merged
so
well
with
the
sweet
nutty
malt
flavors
the
brewers
presented
so
well
i
also
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
hops
were
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
unfortunately
many
north
american
brewers
seem
to
be
under
the
impression
that
scottish
ales
should
be
made
hoppier
though
this
is
not
exactly
a
traditional
wee
heavy
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
north
american
take
on
the
style
that
manages
to
be
quirky
and
individualistic
but
does
not
break
entirely
with
tradition

favorite
but
not
a
bad
beer
i
really
like
a
bit
more
body
to
my
wee
heavy
brews
and
i
find
everything
thus
far
from
dieu
du
ciel
to
be
extremely
light
on
the
palate
for
the
styles
scotch
ales
rarely
wow
me
but
this
one
is
quite
good
i
like
the
added
complementary
sweetness
of
the
maple
syrup
id
certainly
drink
it
again
without
hesitation
o
pleasant
surprise
my
second
dieu
du

experience
and
both
have
been
stellar
the
complexity
is
awesome
the
maple
syrup
lingers
which
is
unique
to
beers
brewed
w
maple
ill
buy
another
to
see
how
it
ages
no
hiding
the
alcohol
in
this
one
dont
taste
much
in
the
way
of
maple
very
grainy
bitterness
not
a
hoppy
beer
certainly
not
as
smooth
or
sweet
as
other
scotch
ales
overall
a
very
dry
beer
not
a
thirst
quencher
something
to
have
on
occasion
when
you
want
to
explore
unique
flavors
overall
a
decent
scotch
ale
with
that
signature
ddc
complexity
i
doubt
id
buy
this
one
after
having
tried
it
but
very
glad
to
have
had
it
once
the
most
noticeable
attribute
about
this
beer
is
its
incredibly
low
carbonation
when
i
poured
it
not
even
a
slight
head
formed
the
body
is
very
befitting
of
a
beer
with
such
a
low
carbonation
very
smooth
and
slightly
syrupy
speaking
of
syrup
the
maple
syrup
the
sweet
maple
flavor
blends
very
well
with
the
natural
flavors
befitting
of
scotch
ales
and
especially
with
this
one
sweet
caramely
malty
peaty
slightly
smokey
etc
but
overall
this
beer
is
sweet
not
overly
sweet
but
sweet
nonetheless
good
beer
to
try
once
but
this
is
something
i
definitely
will
not
be
buying
again
slightly
dissapointed
since
not
only
have
i
heard
such
amazing
things
about
dieu
du
ciel
but
i
also
love
wee
heavies
ive
had
brown
ales
flavored
with
maple
syrup
before
but
never
any
scottish
ales
it
seems
like
a
great
idea
and
i
definitely
wouldnt
mind
trying
another
one
like
this
in
the
future
o
a
solid
scotch
ale
with
a
nice
mellow
sweetness
from
the
maple
syrup
nothing
in
your
face
but
its
decently
complex
and
interesting
the
9
5
is
nowhere
to
be
found
and
sneaks
up
on
you
not
around
for
very
long
as
its
only
brewed
once
a
year
so
get
some
if
you
find
it
light
to
medium
body
slightly
syrupy
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
a
nice
scotch
ale
i
wasnt
overly
fond
of
the
maple
maybe
it
made
it
too
maple
syrupy
for
me
i
would
have
like
some
drier
flavors
in
there
this
would
probably
blossom
if
aged
in
whiskey
barrels
a
solid
beer
from
a
great
canadian
brewery
o
decent
but
not
that
great
has
a
weird
sweetness
to
it
not
a
huge
fan
probably
wont
drink
again
although
i
havent
had
many
i
can
say
there
are
definitely
much
better
scotch
ales
out
there
o
nice
take
on
this
scotch
ale
especially
with
maple
syrup
crazy
for
the
price
through
but
still
something
nice
to
grab
for
a
change
up
nice
complex
beer
worth
trying
no
head
to
speak
of
on
a
murky
amber
body
aroma
is
pretty
boozy
with
raisins
caramel
and
candy
sugar
this
one
is
pretty
hard
to
drink
at
first
some
of
the
most
prevalent
toffee
notes
of
any
beer
i
have
had
also
fig
raisin
caramel
lots
of
maple
syrup
the
malts
are
strong
too
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
this
one
was
too
hard
to
drink
for
me
lots
of
flavor
but
a
little
too
much
of
a
boozy
and
sweet
combination
overall
this
was
really
good
with
very
complex
flavors
and
a
nice
well
measured
touch
of
maple
syrup
a
touch
boozy
perhaps
and
head
could
be
a
little
more
impressive
but
this
is
solid
beer
for
sure
recommended
certainly
an
acceptable
scotch
ale
warrants
a
try
if
youre
into
the
style
otherwise
you
can
get
traquair
house
for
a
similar
price
at
least
in
the
us
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
orange
hue
head
rises
upon
pour
but
goes
quickly
smell
has
a
fig
note
and
theres
a
trace
of
maple
the
taste
goes
similarly
alcohol
is
present
keeping
sips
small
the
maple
isnt
as
strong
as
i
was
expecting
and
definitely
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
liked
aftertaste
is
a
little
odd
i
cant
pin
it
but
i
really
wish
it
didnt
linger
like
it
does
overall
i
would
say
its
a
interesting
beer
that
i
dont
regret
trying
but
for
the
price
tag
it
isnt
exactly
the
best
choice
at
the
store
i
do
applaud
the
brewery
for
their
continued
creativity

notes
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
cloudy
redorange
amber
slight
head
with
slight
lacing
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
maple
sugar
aroma
delicious
sweet
malty
scotch
ale
with
distinct
maple
flavor
heavy
bodied
and
almost
viscous
a
bit
sweet
but
flavors
carry
it
through
a
later
tasting
with
a
year
old
properly
cellared
bottle
had
almost
identical
characteristics
overall
a
little
disappointing
the
charred
flavor
and
tangy
note
dont
feel
like
they
belong
though
truly
masculine
in
taste
the
beer
is
not
without
refinement
the
combination
creates
a
gentlemanly
approach
that
challenges
the
palate
with
each
sip
but
also
comforts
the
taste
buds
charm
and
strength
overall
i
think
its
great
and
i
hope
this
review
and
score
helps
bring
up
the
average
on
it
great
flavors
and
would
make
for
a
solid
dessert
on
its
own
definitely
a
sipper
but
hey
with
everything
going
for
it
ill
sip
it
all
night
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
i
would
have
liked
a
slightly
fuller
body
decent
creaminess
fairly
dry
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
didnt
delver
the
maple
i
was
looking
for
o
a
solid
scotch
ale
with
a
nice
twist
i
enjoyed
this
effort
from
dieu
du
ciel
but
the
qpr
isnt
really
there
in
the
end
this
beer
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
carbonation
just
barely
nips
at
the
tongue
and
the
beer
feels
a
little
thicker
this
is
a
sipper
and
i
would
say
is
best
enjoyed
on
a
slightly
chillier
spring
day
over
the
warmer
day
i
am
experiencing
overall
pretty
good
as
somebody
who
is
neither
a
big
of
scotch
ales
nor
maple
syrup
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
body
if
full
and
chewy
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
tasty
enjoyable
and
balanced
offering
from
these
guys
overall
very
impressed
this
is
really
good
if
served
at
the
right
temperature
maybe
about
14
degrees
celcsius
this
is
amazing
and
delicious
it
would
definitelly
be
worth
putting
away
to
cellar
yum
drank
just
fine
out
of
me
guinness
goblet
overall
although
i
purchased
this
bottle
from
a
new
store
i
wonder
about
the
age
here
as
0
and
9
are
notched
into
the
label
and
i
havent
seen
this
elsewhere
ill
try
it
another
time
in
case
i
have
an
off
bottle
but
this
doesnt
much
taste
like
any
wee
heavy
i
have
encountered
before
other
than
the
peat
element
which
i
enjoyed
for
a
brief
moment
t
big
maltiness
upfront
with
some
raisin
plum
and
something
that
definitely
tastes
like
scotch
booziness
fades
on
the
finish
and
a
big
maple
syrup
note
takes
over
definitely
a
sipper
but
really
good
stuff
o
a
very
strong
beer
and
that
is
something
you
can
tell
from
the
hints
of
alcohol
and
the
sweetness
definitely
more
of
a
sipping
beer
but
not
one
that
you
want
a
large
serving
a
little
moderation
with
this
is
a
good
thing
i
like
the
flavors
in
the
beer
that
complement
the
sweetness
overall
an
enjoyable
scotch
ale
the
maple
brings
a
nice
twist
to
a
classic
flavour
very
unique
but
was
hoping
to
get
more
of
the
aroma
the
flavours
are
quite
potent
perhaps
due
to
this
bottle
being
aged
from
february
2011
definitely
worth
a
try
for
those
interested
in
the
style
overall
reminiscent
of
a
good
belgian
ale
with
a
perfect
malty
flavour
very
drinkable
only
fault
is
that
the
promised
maple
is
just
a
bit
too
subtle
o
nice
enough
beer
though
advertising
the
maple
makes
me
wonder
where
it
is
and
dock
it
a
bit
in
my
book
good
beer
for
a
cold
winnipeg
night
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
color
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
powerful
there
is
a
good
amount
of
maple
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
medium
to
heavy
with
a
bit
of
an
oily
feel
to
it
overall
its
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
i
would
try
it
again
if
i
came
across
it

a

on

noticed
nice
smooth
drinkability
for
the
level
of
alcohol
but
is
still
a
sipper
nice
balance
of
flavors
overall
a
really
nice
scotch
ale
the
maple
syrup
definitely
has
a
strong
presence
in
this
o
this
one
is
well
worth
a
shot
and
offers
something
a
little
different
has
quad
like
qualities
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
wee
heavy
and
a
cool
example
of
maple
in
a
beer
after
most
of
a
year
the
maple
is
still
very
evident
in
this
and
its
drinking
quite
smoothly
ill
probably
hold
onto
my
other
bottle
for
another
few
months
or
so
and
see
how
it
is
d
pretty
drinkable
especially
considering
the
richness
and
the
9
5
abv
i
really
like
the
mix
of
maple
syrup
into
the
scotch
ale
it
is
a
bit
unbalanced
and
richly
sweet
but
i
kind
of
like
that
fullbodied
with
a
creamy
texture
it
took
me
a
while
to
decide
if
i
was
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
i
couldnt
decide
if
id
rather
have
a
more
syrupy
texture
but
near
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
glad
it
wasnt
the
alcohol
is
only
occasionally
noticeable
in
the
taste
and
instead
provides
a
nice
liptongue
numbing
effect
this
beer
became
significantly
better
with
warmth
a
fairly
easy
drinker
for
the
style
abv
had
on
tap
at
the
blue
monk
last
night
came
to
the
table
in
a
goblet

i
really
enjoyed
this
warming
wee
heavy
been
looking
forwards
to
this
one
for
a
while
since
i
have
found
a
new
found
love
for
sawhs
and
it
pours
the
deepest
mahogany
hue
which
leaves
a
two

creamy
head
and
clingy

and
finished
with
a

mixed
with

and
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
as
the
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
behind
the
sweetness
and
i
find
it
hits
most
of
the
notes
for
this
style
and
is
definately
one
of
the
better
examples
going
around
and
i
would
buy
again
cheers
a
beer
that
really
grew
on
me
as
i
waded
through
it
with
touches
both
subtle
overt
a
lovely
mix
very
good
beer
best
ive
had
from
this
brewery
overall
while
the
taste
of
alcohol
does
prove
detrimental
equinoxe
is
a
great
beer
i
only
wish
i
didnt
have
to
drive
to
montreal
every
time
i
wanted
one
d
if
you
have
patience
and
appropriate
cellar
conditions
this
eventually
develops
into
a
very
good
scotch
ale
its
still
a
one
and
done
type
of
beer
but
i
find
myself
constantly
reaching
for
another
sip
im
quite
curious
what
the
barrelaged
version
tastes
like
still
drinks
a
little
bigger
than
the
listed
abv
overall
i
enjoyed
the
combination
of
flavors
in
this
one
and
would
have
it
again
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
velvety
nice
alcoholic
warmth
but
not
overpowering
i
like
this
one
a
lot
i
should
have
bought
more
than
one
bottle
fairly
light
in
mouthfeel
for
a
sweeter
than
normal
scotch
ale
very
pleasant
overall
a
really
nice
scotch
ale
probably
one
of
my
personal
favorites
to
date
really
hoping
to
visit
their
brewpub
someday
and
sample
their
offerings
on
tap
overall
this
is
a
tasty
scotch
ale
from
dieu
du
ciel
and
another
great
offering
in
their
strong
line
up
of
brews
nothing
really
stands
out
but
the
maple
syrup
is
a
nice
touch
and
plays
well
with
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
then
im
sure
youll
like
this
beer
od
no
complaints
here
just
a
solid
beer
from
ddc
couldnt
say
i
would
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
but
its
tasty
and
the
maple
adds
a
nice
element
i
find
that
maple
is
a
common
different
ingredient
in
canadian
beers
that
doesnt
often
work
but
ddc
got
it
right
here
d
a
fairly
nice
showing
for
dieu
du
ciel
nothing
mind
blowing
but
it
was
above
average
i
dont
know
how
much
my
girlfriend
paid
for
this
but
i
would
buy
this
again
if
it
were
in
the
67
range
im
guessing
it
was
closer
to
9
the
pour
was
by
far
the
best
part
as
a
rich
caramel
colored
mixture
came
forward
right
out
of
the
gate
rich
looking
and
almost
opaque
except
for
the
lightest
bit
of
color
poking
through
on
the
sides
and
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
huge
head
of
light
tan
color
then
came
up
and
over
the
top
settling
down
only
lightly
into
a
nice
pillow
that
seemed
to
stay
on
top
throughout
the
rest
of
the
session
lots
of
lacing
here
as
well
really
starting
to
show
off
with
how
good
this
one
really
is
rich
caramel
malts
here
hints
of
herbal
notes
and
a
touch
of
grass
round
it
out
very
nicely
and
as
i
take
the
first
sip
i
am
amazed
at
how
big
this
one
is
really
very
full
feel
here
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
really
a
very
well
put
together
profile
smooth
silky
as
it
rolls
across
the
tongue
with
loads
of
sweetness
and
an
wonderful
sense
of
grainy
malts
and
nice
touches
of
an
almost
brown
sugar
like
taste
very
drinkable
i
could
have
done
this
one
all
day
long
not
the
best
scotch
ale
out
there
but
definitely
fantastic
if
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
or
was
offered
one
by
a
friend
id
have
it
nurse
it
and
enjoy
it
would
not
buy
again
d
people
are
greatly
mistaken
if
they
say
they
can
drink
this
all
day
long
its
a
good
session
beer
this
was
pared
with
a
grilled
pork
chop
with
dijon
mustard
and
spice
rub
sweet
potatoes
fries
and
steamed
broccoli
it
blended
well
however
the
alcohol
content
9
5
abv
would
prevent
me
from
going
more
than
one
per
session
for
the
flavor
i
feel
that
it
needed
to
be
bigger
to
match
the
alcohol
content
this
high
the
beer
needs
a
big
flavor
otherwise
it
gets
buried
overall
a
winner
and
a
unique
take
on
a
scotch
ale
highlights
all
the
classic
features
youd
expect
but
the
maple
syrup
compliments
it
without
undermining
the
integrity
of
the
style
wonderful
another
gold
star
for
dieu
du
ciel
i
really
like
this
beer
and
bought
it
after
loving
the
kaiser
curmudgeon
on
tap
at
founders
this
is
a
decent
substitute
for
kc
which
i
cant
get
anymore
d
relatively
new
to
the
scotch
ale
variety
but
this
is
probably
my
favourite
one
to
date
alcohol
level
up
there
but
ill
be
looking
forward
to
sipping
this
again
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
like
the
maple
flavors
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
like
this
one
overall
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
its
not
the
best
ive
had
from
ddc
but
it
is
surely
worth
seeking
out
as
the
scots
are
fond
of
saying
failing
means
yer
playin
in
other
words
this
may
not
have
hit
the
mark
as
a
scotch
ale
but
its
a
unique
concept
an
intriguing
recipe
and
all
considered
an
absorbing
beer
to
drink
besides
far
be
it
for
me
to
tell
dieu
du
ciel
how
to
do
their
job
if
any
canadians
know
their
way
around
the
brewkettle
its
those
guys
on
the
whole
this
one
is
interesting
the
intense
malt
borders
on
boozy
barrelaged
qualities
that
im
not
crazy
about
but
the
vibrancy
that
the
maple
lends
is
interesting
enough
to
counteract
it
im
definitely
digging
this
one
wee
heavy
is
one
beer
style
i
am
not
too
fond
of
but
this
dieu
du
ciel
offering
is
quite
pleasant
with
the
expected
big
taste
and
array
of
flavours
complimented
by
subtle
underandovertones
created
by
addition
of
maple
syrup
again
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
one
of
these
every
so
often
would
be
more
than
welcome
the
texture
is
amazing
smooth
and
fairly
viscous
despite
the
light
golden
color
this
drinks
really
smooth
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
for
its
abv
its
quite
drinkable
but
this
is
definitely
a
brew
to
be
sipped
and
savored
good
with
cheese
after
dinner
sampled
at
a
beer
tasting
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
great
for
a
taster
not
something
im
going
to
seek
out
happy
to
have
tried
it
a
bit
boozy
but
flavors
are
so
good
i
could
still
have
a
few
of
these
really
superb
malt
flavor
here
jd
if
you
enjoy
a
good
scotch
ale
heres
one
to
taste
not
terrible
on
the
price
around
6
and
very
warming
just
what
a
scotch
ale
should
be
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
diel
du
ciel
puts
out
and
they
have
a
nice
portfolio
of
high
abv
beers
easy
drinkability
and
very
smooth
pours
an
apple
cider
like
brown
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
and
a
skim
head
that
is
slightly
off
white
and
goes
away
quickly
little
to
no
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
raisins
sweet
brown
sugar
alcohol
and
maple
syrup
it
is
an
inviting
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
of
dark
fruits
raisins
and
figs
along
with
brwon
sugar
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
a
nice
smooth
maple
syrup
taste
the
taste
like
the
nose
has
an
inviting
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
low
carbonation
and
slightly
thin
a
little
watery
the
drinkability
it
good
it
is
a
very
smooth
drink
with
well
blended
flavors
and
a
well
hidden
alcohol
character
a
great
beer
to
sip
and
savor
overall
very
tasty
but
was
expecting
more
maple
very
drinkable
hides
the
abv
very
well
very
interesting
beer
this
is
one
of
those
pricey
beers
that
i
would
actually
buy
again
and
pull
out
for
a
special
occasion
this
comes
in
as
my
second
favorite
for
the
style
behind
backwoods
bastard
a
really
tasty
beer
with
discernible
maple
syrup
no
problem
finishing
this
in
a
moderate
time
frame
too
bad
this
puppy
is
so
spendy
it
is
worth
the
money
at
least
once
though
i
dont
shy
away
from
the
sweet
and
this
takes
it
beyond
in
a
very
good
way
mmmm
genius
taste
is
nutty
sweet
and
maplesyrupy
interesting
enough
but
a
little
disappointing
very
onedimensionally
sweet
a
yeasty
presence
gives
this
one
a
praline
pie
overall
taste
and
feel
doesnt
quite
come
together
for
me
not
very
scotch
aleesque
and
has
too
much
residual
sweetness
delicious
and
surprisingly
complex
another
dieu
du
ciel
winner
d
i
typically
dont
care
for
scotch
ales
but
this
one
is
good
and
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
with
out
taking
away
form
the
style
drinks
very
well
a
tad
boozy
but
could
be
worse
for
the
style
and
strength
the
maple
is
well
integrated
and
makes
this
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
so
far
i
wouldnt
say
this
with
any
of
their
beer
but
this
one
i
believe
this
was
meant
to
be
had
fresh
and
after
some
time
in
the
bottle
every
one
of
there
beers
seem
to
gain
quite
a
character
and
some
definition
between
the
expected
and
something
quite
unique
this
is
no
different
with
their
scotch
ale
i
just
believe
once
settled
in
the
bottle
it
gets
a
tad
syrupy
there
is
definitely
maple
added
and
the
predominate
quality
nose
and
palate
with
notes
of
warmth
honey
and
toasted
malt
some
cinnamon
and
subtle
coriander
i
can
feel
the
sugar
from
on
the
glass
even
rich
esters
that
are
taken
over
by
maple
sweet
although
there
are
walnut
notes

poured
a
dark
brown
with
brwon
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aromas
had
dark
fruits
caramel
slight
maple
brown
sugar
and
a
significant
amount
of
booze
the
flavor
was
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
consisting
of
caramel
toffee
and
brown
sugar
dominating
the
palate
with
maple
and
dark
fruit
accents
the
brew
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
sticky
and
slightly
boozy
it
drank
pretty
good
and
was
a
solid
interpretation
of
a
wee
heavy
this
brewery
is
definitely
growing
on
me
d
a
commendable
scoth
ale
from
ddc
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
pours
a
somewhat
murky
medium
brown
that
is
mostly
opaque
thin
head
nose
brings
dark
fruits
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
hints
of
maple
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
touch
if
booze
and
some
fruit
moderate
feel
with
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
drinks
quite
well
another
hit
from
the
folks
up
north
getting
back
to
the
aroma
it
really
is
quite
spicy
earthy
and
woody
too
with
notes
of
pepper
ginger
even
some
cardamom
some
clove
a
rich
prune
character
concentrated
dark
figs
and
rum
soaked
raisins
this
is
definitely
note
your
typically
cleanly
fermented
scotch
ale
instead
it
is
a
belgiantake
via
canuckinterpretation
that
has
graced
my
glass
the
balance
is
really
the
key
for
this
beer
it
is
sweet
but
the
earthy
spicy
woody
is
this
last
where
the
maple
comes
in
really
helps
to
balance
this
in
the
end
this
is
a
fantastic
desert
beer
to
finish
my
night
yeah
a
usable
ale
less
sweet
than
worse
scotch
ales
ive
had
but
retaining
that
heat
so
while
its
good
its
not
that
drinkable
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
flavors
are
incredible
the
alcohol
taste
is
minimal
and
the
semisweetness
is
a
welcomed
one
of
course
i
know
the
alcohol
is
in
there
somewhere
and
im
sure
id
be
down
for
the
count
after
my
second
or
third
bottle
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
this
beer
for
as
long
as
you
can
i
like
this
stuff
it
just
doesnt
look
too
appealing
d
perfect
as
a
wee
heavy
scotch
ale
the
maple
syrup
is
present
enough
to
add
some
depth
and
light
sweetness
but
in
the
background
so
as
not
to
overwhelm
the
classic
scotch
malt
notes
full
bodied
nice
sipping
warming
alcohol
presence
perfect
for
a
cool
evening
two
notes
surprised
they
are
using
twist
off
caps
just
an
observation
secondly
i
really
like
the
label
art
work
d
a
very
good
and
very
unique
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
abv
was
very
well
hidden
velvety
mouthfeel
ample
caramel
candy
sweetness
with
a
fruity
finish
presumably
from
the
maple
ive
read
on
previous
reviews
that
this
was
a
hot
mess
but
by
the
time
this
bottle
got
to
me
all
the
alcohol
had
faded
out
good
im
pretty
sure
this
is
a
2009
bottle
though
it
could
be
a
2008
i
really
dont
recall
but
it
has
been
in
my
cellar
for
over
a
year
got
it
in
a
trade
from
someone
thanks
whoever
you
are
a
little
too
boozy
but
overall
quite
nice
scotch
ale
brewed
with
maple
syrup
sounds
like
the
kind
of
thing
for
a
rainy
day
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
little
head
smells
very
nice
and
quite
complex
pleasant
notes
of
banana
raisin
bread
nuts
and
maple
syrup
breakfast
anyone
the
taste
is
sharper
and
a
bit
woodier
than
the
aroma
with
clear
oak
notes
and
some
more
firmness
otherwise
similar
notes
as
in
the
nose
a
bit
lean
in
the
mouth
but
better
than
it
being
overly
sweet
nice
picked
up
by
my
wife
on
a
whim
the
other
day
at
argonaut
liqours
we
shared
the
bottle
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
very
boozy
on
the
nose
with
brown
sugar
apple
cider
and
caramel
on
the
palatethis
one
is
kinda
thin
and
full
of
alcoholic
heat
a
little
maple
a
little
scotch
and
a
lot
of
heat
while
it
lacks
some
of
the
roasted
malt
toffee
and
smokiness
notes
you
can
get
with
other
scotch
ales
the
addition
of
maple
syrup
adds
a
unique
touch
to
the
style
its
a
smooth
beer
but
the
drinkability
is
not
high
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
that
pairs
well
with
dark
chocolate
dark
sweet
and
tasty
this
is
a
really
rich
ale
which
celebrates
the
creativity
and
skill
of
quebec
brewing
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
mediumbodied
coats
the
mouth
moderately
well
which
creates
a
nice
lingering
sweetness
its
drinkability
is
decent
not
a
quick
drink
more
of
a
moderate
sipper
very
good
for
a
night
cap
reminiscent
of
a
nice
liquor
an
interesting
and
flavorful
brew
to
say
the
least
drinkability
is
only
slightly
impaired
by
the
weighty
abv
given
the
right
situation
i
definitely
could
have
knocked
down
another
one
not
bad
for
my
first
wee
heavy
will
have
to
try
others
of
the
same
style
to
compare
d
the
alcohol
isnt
particularly
hidden
in
that
it
is
quite
warming
though
the
flavour
is
quite
masked
i
dont
know
if
i
make
a
point
of
seeking
it
out
actively
but
its
an
interesting
experience
nonetheless
d
this
beer
just
isnt
very
cohesive
its
not
something
id
want
to
drink
much
of
there
are
too
many
other
beers
in
this
segment
that
i
would
choose
before
this
one
pours
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
vanishes
leaving
no
lace
cloudy
brownamber
color
with
some
yeast
left
in
bottle
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
malty
maple
nose
flavor
is
roasty
malt
with
maple
hints
of
the
higher
abv
and
is
warming
nice
variation
of
a
scotch
ale
5
29
for
a
11
5oz
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
i
dig
the
addition
of
maple
to
it
however
i
think
ive
sampled
this
too
young
i
have
a
feeling
that
itll
round
out
more
in
time
and
smooth
out
the
rougher
edges
in
the
process
a
very
good
beer
i
plan
on
getting
a
couple
more
bottles
maybe
drink
one
in
the
late
fall
and
maybe
let
the
other
age
a
year
or
so
i
really
would
have
rated
it
higher
but
not
that
fitting
to
the
style
pours
an
orangishbrown
colour
with
a
thin
strip
of
white
head
that
doesnt
go
away
lots
of
maple
in
the
smell
with
some
nuttiness
i
think
flavour
is
great
with
maple
though
im
partial
to
maple
caramel
and
dried
fruits
very
smooth
beer
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
d
the
flavours
work
well
but
there
is
a
definite
bite
no
hiding
of
the
9
1
here
dont
think
id
want
to
attempt
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
still
a
very
interesting
brew
from
dieu
du
ciel
who
have
a
habit
of
coming
up
with
interesting
and
wellmade
beers
not
my
favourite
of
theirs
but
im
glad
i
got
to
sample
it
d
with
the
booze
the
heavy
feel
and
all
the
sugar
it
somewhat
loses
here
but
its
well
balanced
and
still
go
down
quite
easily
the
beer
has
a
darkened
reddish
brown
body
and
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
lots
of
caramelized
malt
maple
syrup
and
a
fair
bit
of
booze
it
even
smells
sweet
the
malt
smells
worty
perhaps
a
bit
underattenuated
at
least
for
my
taste
the
beer
has
a
sweet
taste
very
sweet
its
like
a
slightly
fermented
maple
syrup
mixed
with
some
malt
actually
i
almost
really
like
it
but
the
booziness
hurts
things
significantly
the
maple
syrup
is
interesting
but
its
just
out
of
control
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
cloying
im
having
trouble
getting
through
the
11
5
oz
bottle
i
could
see
this
beer
aging
well
but
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
fresh
all
in
all
this
brew
definitely
surprised
me
its
better
than
i
expected
very
sweet
boozy
and
malty
my
type
of
brew
id
say
if
you
like
a
good
malty
big
beer
once
in
a
while
then
give
this
one
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
the
hops
then
avoid
this
one
worth
hunting
down
d
ehhh
more
then
one
is
more
then
enough
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
something
with
such
a
high
abv
could
easily
toss
back
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
the
flavours
are
intense
but
still
very
refreshing
highly
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
something
bold
and
sweet
d
the
abv
rears
its
head
and
its
a
sipper
but
it
goes
down
deceptively
easily
id
recommend
trying
it
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
was
careful
in
pouring
this
one
as
the
label

indeed
i
like
scotch

and
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
appearance

became
increasingly
clear

all
i
can
taste
is
the
fig

has
a
warmth
to
it
that
i
do
appreciate
quite
smooth
has
astringent
elements
to
it
overall
appearance
and
taste
do
put
me
off
not
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
however
i
think
it
is
more
a
case
of
me
not
appreciating
the
beer
style
than
the
actual
beer
brewer
appears
interesting
and
i
would
try
other
products
overall
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
most
pleasant
surprises
ive
had
in
a
while
definitely
recommended
4

is
from
heaven
malty
and
fruity
flavors
are
strong
malt
sweetness
with
some
slight
wine
notes
incredibly
smooth
and
way
too
drinkable
this
one
could
get
me
in
trouble
it
is
sweet
with
a
flavor
that
is
a
mix
of
molasses
and
raisins
and
figs
o
very
tasty
beer
lots
of
sweet
malty
flavors
make
this
a
rich
and
pleasant
drinker
this
one
absolutely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
for
me
almost
missed
it
at
the
store
just
happened
to
notice
a
couple
4
packs
collecting

on
a
bottom

skull
splitter
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
smooth
head
the
lacing
is
quite
appealing
with
tiny
distinct
bubbles
and
falls
away
quickly
the
nose
is
unmistakably
dark
sugared
fruits
plum
and
fig
and
perhaps
the
best
part
if
this
beer
although
the
taste
is
delectable
smooth
sweet
malts
and
a
warm
boozy
finish
it
begs
to
be
drank
and
i
concede
i
find
this
beer
quite
enjoyable
cold
my
first
wee
heavy
and
im
officially
in
love
happy
valentines
day
overall
very
enjoyable
drinks
like
a
session
ale
the
flavor
had
complexity
but
overall
it
didnt
have
that
mouthwatering

very
good

overall
impeccable
really
all
of
the
qualities
work
very
well
together
especially
the
wellstructured
and
judicious
flavors
and
the
carefully
attenuated
carbonation
and
carbonic

the
flavor
and

are
consistently
complex
and
expressive
without
being
overwhelming
ill
give

overall
this
will
split
your
skull
with
a
nordic
buzz
that
is

overall
this
is
an
excellent

i
love

the

tastes
of

o
a
glorious

and
one
i
return
to
frequently
for
a
devout

this
beer
is
a
dance
of
triumph
along

not
for

this

yeasty

slight

a

slight

this
beer
is
quite
mellow
and
delicious
overall
despite
the
fact
that
its
probably
past
its
prime
the
seller
shall
remain
anonymous
except
to
me
of
course
despite
the
rather
horrid
appearance
this
is
probably
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
tried
so
far
maybe
the
extra
aging
helped
it
awesome

by
the

with
a
cool
if
historically
inaccurate
norse
chieftainking
on
the
label
drink
it
when
you
find
it
o
a
really
very
good
beer
with
some
great
flavors
i
find
myself
thinking
that
it
could
be
better
however
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
rich
malty
and
complex
with
darker
fruit
notes
and
hints
of
peat
slick
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
and
a
creamy
lingering
head
dangerously
drinkable
and
insanely
well
done
im
on
vacation
so
this
is
a
halfassed
review
cheers
had
this
while
eating
muscles
in
garlic
sauce
first
mouthful
gives
the
impression
of
cough
mixture
but
this
soon
dissipates
to
a
smooth
drink
pours
lovely
from
the
bottle
with
a
nice
colour
to
it
enjoyed
the
experience
but
dont
think
ill
be
adding
it
to
my
regular
list
i
first
had
this
in
a
restaurant
in
kirkwall
before
i
knew
what
a
wee
heavy
was
then
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
it
now
however
i
find
it
to
be
a
delightful
drink
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
this
meets
the
criteria
for
a
scotch
ale
very
well

a

offering
to

this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
of
you
ever
have
the
chance
it
is
a
must
have
o
this
is
a
decent
scotch
ale
i
would
drink
it
again
the
flavors
come
together
well
and
the
abv
is
hidden
well
just
tried
this
beer
last
night
at
really
cool
bar
that
had
a
twin
peeks
look
velvet
wallpaper
red
curtains
animal
heads
on
the
wall
and
very
dark
with
a
name
like
skull
splitter
i
just
had
to
try
it
amazing
taste
and
almost
instant
buzz
so
good
i
ordered
3
more
if
you
like
dark
beer
but
dont
like
how
it
sets
heavy
in
the
gut
this
beer
will
impress
you
because
it
has
the
rich
dark
flavor
but
without
the
bloat
i
am
giving
this
beer
a
perfect
5
because
so
far
it
is
the
best
dark
beer
i
have
ever
had
certainly
the
name
and
history
sell
this
beer
but
it
stands
on
its
own
as
a
colorful
and
interesting
character
has
a
very
good
taste
you
can
taste
the
molasses
and
dried
fruits
in
it
with
a
smooth
aftertaste
of
spices
it
smells
rich
in
figs
and
spices
but
blends
together
nicely
with
the
hops
and
maltiness
looks
dark
brown
clean
and
has
a
nice
head
to
it
overall
nothing
is
overdone
or
outshines
the
other
a
staple
to
what
the
wee
heavy
style
is
this
ones
a
keeper
and
one
ill
recommend
to
people
interested
in
the
style
o
easier
to
drink
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
this
style
because
of
the
lighter
mouthfeel
and
not
so
cloying
sweetness
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
really
enjoy
with
exceptionally
well
hidden
alcohol
o
the
benchmark
of
the
style
and
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
a
few
of
these
and
one
would
likely
understand
where
this
beer
gets
its
name
highly
recommend
j
serving
type
bottle
skull
splitter
poured
a
clear
dark
redhued
copper
colour
with
distinct
ruby
highlights
and
some
orange
around
the
edges
when
backlit
pouring
produced
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
faded
to
an
even
thinner
ring
of
foam
around
the
glass
leaving
almost
no
spotting
or
lacing
behind
it
its
aroma
was
primarily
of
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
with
the
taste
dominated
by
sweet
malts
dark
cherries
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
gives
off
some
slight
heat
in
the
taste
but
not
enough
to
overpower
the
other
flavours
skull
splitter
had
a
moderate
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
countered
the
initial
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
dark
cherries
well
i
would
describe
the
beer
as
surprisingly
light
bodied
given
its
alcohol
content
with
a
distinctly
low
level
of
carbonation
overall
skull
splitter
is
flavourful
quite
well
balanced
and
well
suited
to
consumption
on
a
10c
night
at
3
30
per
330
ml
bottle
skull
splitter
is
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
not
outrageously
so
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
this
was
worthy
of
this
spectacular
spring
day
enjoyed
canal
side
and
followed
by
a
long
walk
in
the
crisp
air
while
the
sun
warmed
our
faces
o
a
few
flaws
slightly
too
sweet
and
boozy
but
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
o
a
favorite
of
mine
always
enjoy
this
beer
if
you
see
this
on
tap
get
it
it
really
shines
and
has
a
barrel
aged
flavor
to
it
as
well
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
especially
with
the
rave
reviews
o
can
easily
imgine
myself
sitting
in
a
scottish
pub
along
the
north
coast
and
sipping
this
with
a
meat
pie
while
the
sun
refuses
to
set
at
10
p
m
not
so
skull
splitting
so
far
but
17
ounces
at
8
5
abv
will
kick
in
soon
enough
im
sure
in
the
meantime
im
soberly
enjoying
this
sweet
treat
it
would
surely
be
one
of
my
favorite
regulars
if
it
was
not
6
a
bottle
overall
i
can
see
how
this
could
be
enjoyable
to
some
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
especially
compared
to
the
many
good
scotch
ales
out
there
just
above
average
worth
a
try
if
you
understand
that
it
has
a
lot
of
candy
notes
to
it
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
more
traditional
scotch
ale
i
would
pass
i
could
drink
this
all
day
sitting
and
enjoying
a
scottish
style
view
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
the
high
alcohol
content
should
be
noted
dont
plan
on
drinking
more
than
one
o
this
is
not
a
fast
drinking
beer
and
definitely
not
one
you
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
session
it
is
warming
good
for
a
cold
winter
night
i
rated
it
on
the
basis
of
the
characteristics
but
this
is
probably
never
going
to
be
a
favorite
overall
a
disappointment
looking
forward
to
when
my
own
scotch
ale
matures
up
in
about
25
weeks
hopefully
that
will
scratch
my
scotch
ale
itch
o
havent
had
many
commercial
examples
of
scotch
ale
maybe
4
but
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
visit
this
in
the
american
landscape
of
hoppy
beers
all
over
you
could
sit
and
sip
this
beer
all
day
smooth
engaging
with
a
fullish
mouthfeel
that
finishes
dry
and
with
a
lingering
malty
sweetness

very
pleasant
and
goes
down

lots
of
great
flavors
coming
through
perfect
carbonation
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
quite
surprised
on
this
one
overall
i
would
drink
this
one
over
and
over
again
very
tasty
and
first
time
i
had
this
type
i
like
this
for
my
first
foray
into
a
scotch
ale
wee
heavies
i
found
it
to
be
flavorful
and
boozy
but
the
head
doesnt
last
as
long
as
id
have
liked
and
its
by
no
means
creamy
as
some
reviewers
stated
but
perhaps
its
because
its
from
a
bottle
a
nice
coldweather
sipping
ale
would
be
wonderful
with
a
bowl
of
chili
and
cornbread
or
a
sunday
roast
beef
dinner
i
could
see
this
at
table
replacing
a
bottle
of
merlot
as
it
has
a
depth
and
character
that
would
carry
quite
well
with
a
hearty
and
seasoned
meal
by
itself
its
also
fine
but
i
think
itd
be
better
with
food
the
label
graphics
and
where
its
brewed
drew
me
to
try
it
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
as
i
enjoy
a
rich
lowhops
flavorful
ale
let
me
paint
you
a
picture
silence
all
around
you
you
sit
down
after
a
long
day
of
work
you
pop
one
of
these
open
and
before
you
finish
that
first
swallow
all
you
hear
in
your
head
are
the
opening
chords
to
led
zeppelins
rock
n
roll
and
i
am
pretty
sure
thats
what
the
viking
on
the
bottle
intended
its
not
too
dark
its
not
too
bitter
and
yet
it
doesnt
totally
abandon
those
characteristics
either
its
a
solid
choice
for
any
beer
drinking
purpose
whether
that
be
food
accompaniment
thirst
social
outing
or
relaxation
skull
splitter
is
a
take
you
away
from
every
day
monotony
kind
of
beer
this
beer
lets
you
know
its
quitting
time
so
if
you
have
one
on
your
lunch
breakummmyou
should
probably
take
a
half
day
and
not
go
back
to
work
imagine
the
vikings
celebrating
after
a
conquest
with
this
beer
you
have
your
own
celebrations
to
commemorate
and
this
will
pair
nicely
with
them
a
decent
tasting
wee
heavy
yet
comes
across
rather
weak
overall
sure
theres
the
malts
flavors
and
a
fair
enough
presence
of
alcohol
warmth
yet
the
beer
seems
rather
watered
down
and
lacking
in
character
and
depth
for
a
scotch
ale
certainly
not
bad
overall
but
i
cant
imagine
why
a
beer
with
such
a
great
name
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
its
bold
brutish
name
a
great
tasting
easy
drinking
wee
heavy
ive
got
to
get
this
beer
more
often
a
perfect
scotch
ale
that
doesnt
exaggerate
with
the
malts
and
instead
really
focuses
on
the
balance
between
alcohol
and
rich
fruitiness
really
great
i
really
looked
forward
to
trying
skull
splitter
as
i
really
enjoy
scotch
ales
it
had
a
wonderful
appearance
in
my
crystal
beer
mug
with
a
beautiful
tan
head
over
a
beautiful
brownish
nutty
appearance
it
tasted
very
good
with
fruity
undertones
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
bitter
for
my
tastes
as
something
seemed
missing
it
was
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
though
doing
a
full
review
of
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
a
regular
in
my
rotation
excellent
looking
beer
that
smells
great
i
tend
to
like
a
murkier
beer
but
still
tasty
looking
wonderful
taste
one
of
the
best
scottish
ales
out
there
wonderful
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
content
this
is
a
must
try
on
the
whole
skull
splitter
is
a
chimaera
a
complex
and
fascinating
brew
that
makes
me
reconsider
what
i
thought
i
knew
about
scotch
ales
its
sweet
fruity
warm
light
and
spicy
to
varying
degrees
at
varying
moments
but
always
engaging
in
spite
of
its
initially
confounding
originality
renewed
acquaintance
reveals
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
adventure
for
your
taste
buds
that
ceases
much
sooner
than
one
might
expect
for
a
beer
of
its
gravity
overall
yes
i
think
i
will
be
picking
this
up
quite
regularly
for
now
on
when
i
want
to
go
with
something
that
i
know
is
going
to
be
really
good
yet
unique
and
as
a
bonus
reasonably
priced
for
a
4
pack
this
beer
smells
a
lot
like
wine
it
gives
off
a
strong
fruity
aroma
the
taste
reminds
me
of
apples
or
grapes
its
a
little
boozy
the
alcohol
taste
could
be
covered
up
a
little
better
the
aftertaste
is
ok
it
finishes
a
lot
like
wine
with
a
light
bubbly
burn
on
the
tongue
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
im
going
to
buy
it
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
loved
having
with
my
dinner
on
a
chilly
fall
evening
would
definitely
have
again
would
suggest
for
anyone
who
likes
dark
complex
flavorful
beers
overall
this
beer
is
one
to
sip
on
around
a
fire
with
your
sweetie
i
feel
it
is
warming
and
toasted
which
bring
on
memories
of
mild
fall
days
raking
leaves
the
caramel
and
toffee
notes
actually
stuck
around
on
the
pallet
for
a
really
smooth
after
taste
which
i
much
appreciated
the
beer
itself
was
much
lighter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
food
match
roasted
chicken
with
a
side
of
roasted
vegetables
or
roasted
turkey
this
is
a
beer
that
suits
a
festive
occasion
overall
definitely
worth
the
while
but
surely
only
one
every
now
and
then
or
a
4pack
at
most
at
the
price
of
au140
per
case
of
24
x
330ml
a
great
scottish
ale
led
by
some
flavoursome
malt
and
toffee
instead
of
being
overly
hopped
works
well
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
seem
to
enjoy
more
with
each
sip
o
a
flavorful
robust
scotch
ale
thats
not
too
sweet
and
has
a
rad
name
yeehaw
much
better
than
the
one
i
had
a
decade
ago
still
a
sipper
but
it
comes
in
a
small
european
bottle
so
it
wont
do
too
much
damage
tastes
nothing
like
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
presents
more
like
a
belgian
and
thats
a
good
thing
will
pass
it
by
next
time
despite
the
intrigue
of
the
orkney
isles
and
the
cute
term
wee
heavy
id
compare
this
to
a
belgian
tripel
to
the
point
this
is
the
only
skull
splitter
i
have
had
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
overall
good
beer
but
not
the
best
scotch
ale
you
will
have
could
definitely
use
a
lot
of
tweaking
i
love
scotch
ales
to
death
but
this
one
itself
being
from
scotland
could
take
some
pointers
off
its
american
counterpart
salud
a
big
malty
beer
with
lots
of
caramel
and
sweetness
very
different
from
the
other
scotch
ales
ive
hada
bit
more
in
your
faces
and
why
not
considering
the
name
but
still
while
others
are
a
bit
more
subtle
this
provides
a
bold
taste
keeps
you
enticed
and
wanting
more
very
tasty
and
glad
i
tried
this
found
this
overly
sweet
with
tons
of
caramel
brown
sugar
dextrose
but
still
some
nice
hop
character
coming
through
it
holds
the
alcohol
strength
really
well
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
tasty
and
full
bodied
though
i
have
a
bottle
so
will
have
to
do
a
reappraisal
soon
on
the
second
time
i
still
find
the
caramel
and
slight
boozey
sweetness
to
be
a
bit
overbearing
it
does
have
a
lot
of
complexity
and
is
a
very
good
beer
but
im
left
wanting
more
bitterness
and
crispness
on
the
end
feel
in
many
ways
the
quintessential
scotch
ale
although
not
my
favorite
one
out
there
it
pours
a
syrupy
dark
bock
color
dense
with
a
small
off
white
head
showing
very
little
carbonation
the
nose
is
peaty
but
not
smoky
like
some
tend
to
be
its
alcohol
is
obvious
and
its
sweet
grain
is
saturated
with
a
toasted
aroma
and
a
very
earthy
vibe
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
like
birch
syrup
or
something
lighter
and
a
little
less
sweet
than
maple
the
texture
is
like
that
too
earthy
right
from
the
soil
sort
of
autumn
compost
heaviness
really
challenges
me
in
warmer
weather
but
i
am
imagining
a
cold
snowy
night
in
front
of
a
fire
a
much
more
enjoyable
setting
for
this
brew
i
love
the
grain
features
complex
and
rich
the
feels
is
odd
but
i
like
it
its
thick
almost
sticky
in
my
mouth
lacking
carbonation
american
scotch
ales
have
bastardized
this
intentional
weight
with
high
carbonation
gimmicks
and
lighter
grain
bills
but
this
feels
more
authentic
although
very
heavy
and
hard
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
it
improves
as
it
warms
and
just
takes
me
to
the
dead
of
winter
its
a
nice
beer
but
not
the
first
scotch
ale
i
would
reach
for
even
though
its
authenticity
is
appreciated
o
a
nice
and
complex
wee
heavy
the
high
abv
adds
to
the
complexity
great
full
bodied
scotch
ale
travels
well
from
scotland
because
of
the
high
alcohol
deep
rich
color
with
some
red
hues
malty
sweet
and
strong
very
satisfying
pairs
well
with
a
good
steak
no
hop
aroma
or
flavor
but
there
really
shouldnt
be
ny
in
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
smokey
scotch
ale
well
then
this
isnt
it
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
overall
theres
a
reason
i
hold
skull
splitter
above
the
many
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
and
thats
because
im
biased
but
why
you
scream
and
point
accusingly
because
its
simply
everything
youd
want
in
a
beer
of
its
kind
strong
caramelised
taste
decent
strength
consistent
body
plus
more
open
a
bottle
take
a
sip
and
split
your
skull
split
it
beyond
the
point
of
repair
you
wont
regret
it
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
highly
recommended
overall
great
for
the
style
certainly
worth
getting
again
o
the
initial
notes
and
flavors
of
this
one
are
good
the
only
thing
that
didnt
sit
well
was
the
aftertaste
it
left
kind
of
a
bitter
alcohol
woody
taste
that
just
didnt
work
the
rest
of
it
was
delicious
pours
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
a
small
but
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
shrinks
quickly
and
leaves
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
faint
but
sweet
and
fruity
with
floral
hops
first
sip
is
surprisingly
hoppy
right
from
the
start
with
an
even
more
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
distinct
sour
note
much
like
the
sour
of
some
belgian
dubbels
purposely
cupping
the
glass
in
my
hands
to
warm
it
some
the
malt
flavors
are
coming
through
raisins
and
tart
cherry
flavors
with
a
hint
of
molasses
still
a
longlasting
bitter
aftertaste
and
the
sour
note
is
still
present
but
less
pronounced
definitely
getting
better
as
it
warms
up
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
like
but
not
bad
a
bit
dry
not
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
but
a
good
scotch
ale
ive
had
before
and
will
buy
again
second
review
interesting
a
couple
months
later
i
am
getting
mainly
an
overwhelming
whiskey
flavor
still
good
but
not
a
4
25
for
taste
overall
overall
i
would
have
to
agree
with
many
reviews
in
saying
that
this
is
world
class
im
no
expert
but
i
would
think
this
almost
a
5
out
of
5
the
only
issue
that
i
have
with
it
is
that
the
alcohol
is
pretty
noticeable
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
it
is
not
detracting
from
the
beer
at
all
as
the
dark
fruits
are
carried
along
with
it
like
a
chocolate
cordial
doesnt
push
the
envelope
of
flavor
but
what
it
does
it
does
it
well
wasnt
not
expecting
it
but
tends
to
finish
with
a
subtle
cherry
flourish
could
be
a
nice
one
to
bring
to
a
group
without
shocking
the
nonbeer
enthusiasts
a
worthy
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
prost
lampertland
deep
ruby
red
colour
ring
of
white
head
no
real
lace
to
speak
of
really
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
fruity
with
lots
of
cherry
notes
and
even
a
bit
of
strawberryberry
as
well
caramel
a
little
alcohol
smells
a
bit
like
a
barley
wine
meets
strong
ale
taste
is
sweet
and
quite
fruity
apple
cherry
and
berries
malty
with
some
caramel
flavours
some
darker
fruits
mid
palate
sweet
in
the
finish
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
fruity
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
chewy
and
mediumfull
body
felt
at
times
the
carbonation
here
was
a
touch
high
a
solid
beer
quite
flavourful
though
not
all
that
complex
drinkable
but
probably
something
im
not
going
to
seek
out
again
glad
to
have
had
it
once
though
its
a
good
dark
brown
amber
with
a
etched
surface
and
some
loose
rim
foam
smells
like
butter
apple
skin
a
little
bit
of
malt
some
skunk
this
died
off
as
the
beer
warmed
really
sad
nose
flavor
is
malt
rye
tomato
sweet
hawaiian
bread
rolls
some
astringency
and
on
the
breath
after
the
swallow
booze
and
butter
medium
bodied
and
tight
moderate
alcohol
profoundly
unimpressed
with
this
brew
this
is
what
i
remember
skull
splitter
tasting
like
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
because
this
is
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
all
night
long
they
also
dont
make
bombers
of
this
but
if
they
did
it
would
be
a
bomber
that
you
could
spend
an
entire
night
with
the
bottle
says
500
years
in
the
making
job
well
done
orkeny
overall
this
is
very
nice
beer
and
the
8
5
abv
perfectly
meshes
with
the
fruits
and
sugars
to
create
a
sweet
alcoholic
goodness
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
very
sweet
but
theres
just
enough
of
grains
and
hops
in
here
to
keep
it
from
becoming
cloying
a
very
nice
bottle
of
beer
overall
okay
but
not
great
a
bit
disapointed
based
on
the
high
average
score
as
joel
knows
im
not
typically
much
of
a
scotch
ale
fan
he
sent
this
one
because
its
one
of
his
favorites
in
the
genre
and
im
glad
he
did
thanks
man
good
night
out
caramel
blah
blah
blah
o
no
complaints
a
good
time
a
great
bottle
fantastic
name
what
more
could
you
want
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
consists
of
deep
caramelized
malt
with
lightly
sweet
undertones
and
light
toffee
notes
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
caramelized
malt
notes
with
some
toffee
notes
and
a
dry
aftertaste
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
brewed
and
quite
enjoyable
though
overall
dryer
then
i
had
expected
deep
copper
small
and
shortlived
beige
head
decent
lace
sharp
boozy
aroma
with
light
raisin
and
toffee
notes
tastes
mildly
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
raisin
and
dried
cherry
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
boozy
and
i
find
that
unpleasant
without
some
strong
flavours
to
balance
things
out
lightbodied
with
low
carbonation
it
feels
thin
and
i
think
it
contributes
to
the
alcohol
coming
across
harshly
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
it
pours
a
clear
crimson
with
a
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
and
the
lacing
is
very
nice
aromas
of
malt
and
grape
along
with
alcohol
are
all
present
the
taste
is
very
much
like
red
wine
it
gives
some
good
malt
flavor
up
front
after
that
its
fruity
and
acidic
but
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
throughout
it
leaves
a
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
the
carbonation
is
low
i
really
cant
get
past
the
acidity
in
this
one
not
my
style
of
beer
at
all
o
crazy
brew
a
lot
going
on
maybe
too
complex
and
trying
too
hard
bottom
line
never
had
it
buy
it
its
worth
the
jingle
overall
in
the
end
smooth
spiced
toffee
and
rich
dark
fruit
with
a
mild
sense
of
heat
prevails
almost
like
spiced
rum
making
for
a
great
winter
beer
that
isnt
heavy
love
the
interplay
and
transition
of
flavours
from
first
sip
to
last
dont
give
up
on
it
burgundy
with
a
tan
head
film
of
retention
with
light
lace
nose
has
grapes
caramel
candy
and
a
very
nice
beautiful
malt
character
all
around
taste
has
some
complex
malt
notes
sweeter
caramels
and
toasty
grains
moderate
bitterness
alcohol
is
prevalent
and
almost
takes
away
from
this
a
bit
lower
carbonation
this
one
warms
the
bones
did
not
enjoy
another
reviewer
put
it
well
wears
its
abv
on
its
sleeve
probably
would
have
split
my
skull
but
i
didnt
finish
it
thin
mouthfeel
bitterness
unbalanced
by
body
not
nearly
as
rich
or
warm
as
i
was
expecting
from
a
strong
beer
have
never
had
a
scotch
ale
before
so
maybe
i
just
dont
care
for
the
style
final
thoughts
i
guess
with
a
name
like
skull
splitter
i
should
have
expected
a
beer
that
drinks
like
an
axe
to
the
head
i
guess
this
beer
is
for
more
adventurous
tastes
as
unlike
belgians
who
tend
to
hide
their
high
alcohol
content
this
beer
seems
to
want
to
be
blatantly
upfront
about
it
overall
pretty
good
o
overall
this
was
an
odd
scotch
ale
more
of
a
belgian
strong
than
a
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
regardless
id
have
another
it
smells
better
than
almost
any
other
beer
i
have
ever
tried
for
starters
for
a
beer
that
is
8
5
it
goes
down
very
well
and
although
its
not
a
beer
you
could
drink
more
than
two
of
i
can
see
myself
picking
this
up
every
now
and
again
when
i
can
a
masterly
demonstration
of
scottish
brewing
smooth
with
a
fullbodied
character
that
warms
you
right
through
plenty
of
sweet
fruit
in
the
aroma
and
flavour
along
with
a
hefty
slug
of
booze
the
only
minor
letdowns
are
the
absence
of
live
yeast
and
a
slightly
subpar
body
i
think
bottle
conditioning
would
allow
for
an
interesting
flavour
evolution
nonetheless
this
is
a
topnotch
wee
heavy
that
is
well
worth
sampling
grab
one
and
stash
it
away
for
a
rainy
day
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
brown
tints
slightly
hazy
about
a
onefinger
eggshell
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
on
a
smattering
of
lacing
very
earthy
and
malt
forward
aroma
the
malt
presents
both
a
sweet
caramel
and
breadlike
characteristic
only
the
slightest
note
of
hops
the
flavor
is
very
rich
and
malty
as
expected
the
dense
malt
flavors
are
accompanied
by
an
almost
sour
taste
that
is
close
to
orange
peel
but
comes
through
only
in
small
doses
a
minor
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
thickness
and
does
present
a
bit
of
alcohol
but
not
to
the
boozy
level
a
solid
wee
heavy
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
pour
this
sucker
in
your
favorite
mug
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
just
dont
take
the
weekly
4
pack
i
have
reserved
at
my
local
wine
store
overall
a
great
brew
big
strong
and
malty
with
balance
ive
wanted
to
try
this
for
quite
some
time
and
wasnt
disappointed
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
highly
recommended
it
is
certainly
recommended
that
a
person
like
wee
heavies
before
delving
into
it
a
very
tasty
beverage
overall
im
used
to
the
us
style
so
for
me
this
misses
the
mark
on
the
scotch
ale
style
as
the
smoke
and
carmel
sweetness
is
missing

great
offering
for
this
style
o
a
really
nice
brew
o
pretty
good
but
it
doesnt
really
feel
like
a
different
category
of
beer
than
belgian
strong
ales
or
even
many
tripels
o
really
really
great
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
alcohol
too
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
incredibly
balanced
unlike
any
scotch
ale
that
ive
had
before
skull
splitter
is
indeed
a
beer
that
gives
one
much
to
fry
their
brain
over
it
has
a
potent
profuse
flavour
profile
that
is
a
respectable
mix
of
abstraction
and
concreteness
definite
maltiness
and
suggestive
fruitiness
its
reputation
as
one
of
the
uks
heaviest
hitters
has
been
rightfully
earned
o
malt
forward
clean
creamy
and
smoothe
sweet
nutty
fruity
and
toasty
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
solid
example
of
it
if
your
a
fan
of
hopps
and
ipas
look
elsewhere
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
beer
for
years
simply
because
of
the
name
of
the
beer
it
sounds
like
a
cannibal
corpse
song
as
it
turns
out
skull
splitter
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
this
may
be
my
benchmark
for
future
beers
of
this
style
its
tasty
and
somehow
drinks
like
a
lighter
beer
o
interesting
this
one
is
certainly
easy
to
quaff
and
i
can
easily
see
myself
having
a
few
in
a
sitting
but
the
abv
sure
would
sneak
up
on
me
worth
a
try
better
as
it
warms
up
final

an
a
orkneys
skull
splitter
is
a
fine
scotch
ale
that
is
perfectly
suited
to
sipping
on
a
cold
canadian
winters
night
i
honestly
wasnt
expecting
much
when
i
picked
this
one
up
but
it
has
probably
been
over
a
year
since
my
last
wee
heavy
and
this
one
absolutely
hit
the
spot
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
at
its
lcbo
price
point
at
least
its
a
virtual
steal
especially
given
the
difficulty
of
finding
quality
scotch
ales
in
most
of
the
province
great
value
and
well
worth
a
tipple
this
winter
im
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
wee
heavies
but
this
one
i
enjoyed
not
oversweet
easy
to
drink
true
to
its
style
and
at
the
same
time
with
personality
i
would
describe
it
in
plain
way
as
a
liquid
panettone
with
liquor
overall
maybe
not
as
sweet
as
others
of
this
style
but
still
really
good
clear
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
light
quickdissipating
offwhite
head
smells
like
rich
cherry
some
toffee
and
red
berries
raspberry
tastes
strong
dark
red
cherry
malt
sweetness
hoppy
spiciness
and
a
light
bitter
finish
very
thick
and
chewy
with
a
medium
to
low
carbonation
its
got
a
little
dr
pepper
vibe
going
on
with
the
cherry
and
overall
its
nice
albeit
slightly
sweet
sipping
beer
o
something
must
have
gone
wrong
with
this
bottle
because
it
was
absolutely
nothing
like
what
id
expect
from
a
wee
heavy
underwhelming
across
the
board
overall
i
find
this
wee
heavy
enjoyable
and
better
than
plenty
that
i
have
tried
it
is
worth
the
purchase
and
got
better
with
each
sip
o
above
average
but
not
exceptional
at
all
it
just
seemed
some
pieces
didnt
quite
fit
together
as
they
should
have
better
brews
can
be
had
for
less
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
translucent
amber
with
a
thick
eggshell

appears
to
be

transluscent
amber
with
a
thick
eggshell
colored

the
head
recedes
slowly
and
there
appears
to
be
moderate
carbonation
in
the
beer
the
taste
has
that
roasted
malt
and
toffee
flavor
that
i
detected
in
the
nose
its
pretty
bready
with
some
of
those
dark
fruit
flavors
those
grassy
hops
come
through
and
i
get
that
nice
back
end
hop
bitterness
that
really
helps
to
balance
this
beer
i
get
some
of
the
alcohol
as
well
the
body
is
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
coats
the
mouth
well
and
there
are
warming
qualities
from
the
8
5
abv
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
have
as
the
weather
turns
cool
this
bad
boy
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
could
have
easily
had
three
of
these
without
realizing
that
i
was
face
down
on
the
floor
perfect
compliment
to
an
irish
meal
overall
good
standby
scotch
ale
its
a
solid
standardbearer
for
the
style
this
was
one
of
those
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
still
good
to
this
day
pours
deep
amber

a
great
creamy
beige

great

great
o
awesome
scottish
wee
heavy
enjoyed
every
sip
of
this
amazing
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
fairly
rich
overall
a
worthy
exemplar
of
the
genre
overall
i
can
drink
this
beer
but
i
will
be
passing
on
it
in
the
future
o
this
is
one
hell
of
a
hearty
beer
highly
complex
and
challenging
on
the
palate
it
gets
a
little
rough
and
jarring
at
times
but
in
a
good
way
the
8
5
abv
is
felt
it
drinks
rather
like
a
whiskey
a
great
beer
for
the
dead
of
winter
overall
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
and
the
depth
of
flavor
there
is
a
really
great
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
with
alcohol
fairly
well
hidden
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
again
wow
this
beer
is
a
spectacular
example
of
this
style
its
really
malty
and
complex
and
engages
the
drinker
by
constantly
presenting
you
with
new
flavors
this
beer
presses
lots
of
buttons
on
my
palate
ill
definitely
be
drinking
it
again
a
well
made
beer
but
not
the
best
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
i
have
had
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
dark
brown
body
with
blood
red
highlights
when
viewed
closely
wonderful
looking
head
of
white
foam
sits
on
top
plenty
of
carbonation
smell
has
aromas
of
cherry
and
dark
rum
the
flavor
was
delicious
plenty
of
notes
of
fresh
plums
and
fig
with
a
gentle
sweetness
coming
from
the
malt
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
for
a
scotch
ale
never
would
have
guessed
the
abv
at
8
5
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
in
order
to
cellar
for
a
while
longer
o
this
hits
all
the
aspects
of
the
style
loads
of
flavor
and
easy
drinking
with
a
dangerous
level
of
abv
highly
recommended
and
stoked
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it

there
is
an
alcohol
kick
and
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp

this
is
a
good

cordial
its
a
fairly
sweet
beer
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
with
the
alcohol
and
light
bitterness
keeping
it
in
check
overall
lots
of
scotch
flavours
going
on
with
this
beer
its
a
tad
on
the
boozy
side
but
still
quite
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
it
was
still
worth
a
shot
3
a
single
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
its
also
from
my
home
country
which
is
a
bonus
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
over
powering
and
the
fruitiness
is
excellent
this
is
classified
as
a
scotch
ale
bu
i
wouldnt
read
too
much
into
that
o
a
very
big
beer
that
drinks
like
a
mild
ale
all
very
rich
full
flavours
make
this
a
real
treat
looking
forward
to
my
next
venture
into
this
brewers
repertoire
overall
a
new
and
instant
favorite
you
must
try
overall

excellent
brew
but
not
perfect
i
am
a
fan
of
the
scottish
ales
and
skullsplitter
is
the
apex
of
the
style
it
takes
the
style
as
far
as
it
can
possibly
go
earl
hauskaluif
would
be
proud
yet
another
welcome
addition
to
our
shelves
here
in
alberta
i
want
to
age
a
bottle
but
its
already
smooth
and
has
no
booze
detected
not
sure
if
time
would
improve
it
for
less
the
5
ill
find
out
anyways
overall
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
this
is
my
first
scotch
ale
and
so
far
so
good
i
think
the
100
rating
by
the
bros
may
be
a
little
steep
but
i
really
think
its
a
great
beer
from
orkney
brewery
a
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
certainly
not
my
favorite
scotch
ale
maybe
i
just
got
an
off
bottle
or
something
drinkability
quite
good
really
as
it
sits
the
bitterness
comes
out
a
bit
more
been
a
very
long
time
since
i
had
one
of
these
it
hasnt
been
available
locally
since
i
started
actually
reviewing
beer
so
i
cant
really
reference
if
or
how
it
may
have
changed
over
a
decade
still
rather
enjoyable
especially
for
this
style
that
can
easily
become
cloying
great
malt
character
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
somewhat
reigned
in
glad
to
see
it
available
locally
again
its
a
classic
overall
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
it
borrows
mild
characteristics
from
that
of
trappist
rochefort
yet
still
remains
less
heavy
certainly
less
bready
and
a
little
more
scotch
flavored
very
well
balanced
with
lots
of
interesting
dark
fruits
to
enjoy
this
straddles
the
line
between
belgian
strong
ale
and
scotch
ale
while
still
representing
elements
of
a
barley
wine
i
would
not
classify
this
as
a
scotch
ale
as
it
has
been
above
i
feel
like
thats
a
tad
bit
inaccurate
but
thats
just
me
enjoy
overall
i
thought
that
was
an
ok
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
pretty
average
example
of
a
wee
heavy
it
had
a
great
look
and
aroma
but
the
taste
seemed
lackluster
it
was
like
a
very
watered
down
version
of
aroma
and
that
really
held
this
beer
back
this
beer
isnt
that
drinkable
with
some
warming
alcohol
and
a
high
amount
of
sweetness
one
bottle
is
just
a
little
more
then
i
would
want
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
great
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
a
let
down
and
compared
to
the
aroma
it
seemed
watered
down
and
rough
around
the
edges
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
they
are
plenty
wee
heavys
that
i
like
more
and
are
much
cheaper
if
you
are
really
into
the
style
it
might
be
worth
a
try
but
other
then
that
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
this
was
my
first
time
trying
a
beer
from
orkney
and
i
have
to
say
i
wasnt
that
impressed
with
and
i
wish
the
taste
lived
up
to
the
aroma
so
it
didnt
make
for
the
best
first
impression
i
would
still
try
more
of
their
beers
but
im
not
too
eager
better
luck
next
time
guys
o
easy
drinker
that
leaves
one
satisfied
and
smiling
o
a
striking
scotch
ale
not
to
be
missed
by
fans
of
this
style
high
abv
evident
in
feel
aroma
and
taste
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
ideal
but
this
is
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
in
which
the
higher
alcohol
effects
are
an
integral
part
of
the
experience
flavor
dynamics
changed
with
some
additional
warming
becoming
tamer
and
more
refined
o
very
well
put
together
boozy
but
delicious
malts
sugars
spices
and
fruits
are
nicely
balanced
together
as
well
as
against
the
hops
which
clearly
exist
to
create
a
clean
finish
but
are
not
in
the
nose
a
great
alternative
to
a
shot
of
single
malt
at
the
end
of
the
day
more
of
a
sipping
beer
although
two
or
three
across
a
relaxing
evening
wouldnt
be
out
of
the
question
definitely
worth
having
a
fourpak
in
the
fridge
for
appreciative
guests
a
sophisticated
amped
version
of
the
style
this
is
by
far
my
most
favorite
of
strong
scotch
ales
it
has
a
creamy
maltiness
that
is
very
appealing
a
slight
peat
flavor
comes
through
and
the
alcohol
content
of
8
5
abv
complements
the
malt
sweetness
nicely
i
had
this
at
the
hair
of
the
dog
pub
in
chattanooga
tn
and
really
wish
i
could
get
this
in
oklahoma
poured
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
teacolored
with
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
that
dissipated
into
a
medium
thick
cap
and
heavy
lacing
the
nose
is
heavy
with
malts
and
molasses
on
the
bready
side
tastewise
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
dried
figs
mouthfeel
is
more
than
mediumbodied
with
an
oily
texture
even
though
i
prefer
ales
a
scotch
ale
is
not
one
of
my
top
choices
this
however
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
that
genre
other
info
i
picked
up
a
second
bottle
of
this
about
a
month
after
i
first
tried
it
and
it
was
nowhere
near
as
good
the
sweetness
wasnt
there
the
bitterness
was
harsh
and
the
aroma
was
almost
nonexistant
i
assume
this
must
have
been
treated
very
roughly
when
being
shipped
as
it
was
nothing
like
the
first
overall
this
is
my
fourth
time
having
this
beer
great
for
the
style
covers
the
abv
well
notes
this
is
dam
tasty
and
mighty
hefty
with
a
great
malt
backbone
cheers
o
very
good
scotch
ales
arent
really
my
thing
but
i
can
really
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
best
overall
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
i
have
tried
o
above
average
scotch
ale
gonna
try
cellaring
a
couple
and
see
what
happens
review
from
notes
enjoyed
many
times
over
the
years
making
it
official
here
along
with
youngs
old
nick
one
of
the
very
1st
scotch
ales
i
ever
tried
that
made
me
seek
out
this
wonderfully
warming
style
poured
into
duvel
tulip
a
rich
dark
amber
with
a
half
an
inch
of
dense
head
that
has
great
retention
smells
of
yeast
malt
and
dark
fruits
like
plum
raisin
and
fig
mouthfeel
is
good
and
spicy
on
the
front
end
retaining
its
wonderful
maltiness
that
almost
has
a
peat
like
quality
that
mixes
with
the
sweetness
of
the
aforementioned
fruits
a
bit
of
yeast
and
good
carbonation
finishes
spicy
and
velvety
on
the
palate
with
the
8
5
abv
being
evident
to
be
sure
making
it
a
wonderful
winter
warmer
ive
always
wondered
about
the
listed
abv
of
8
5
as
it
seems
higher
and
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
skullsplitter
poured
from
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
into
a
tulip
a
moderately
aggressive
pour
yields
a
nice
dense
one
inch
ivory
head
that
follows
the
beer
down
the
glass
the
beer
is
dark
amber
with
lots
of
small
bubbles
the
aroma
is
butterscotch
and
toffee
lots
of
that
in
the
flavor
and
some
fruitiness
with
a
surprising
dryness
at
the
finish
a
hint
of
smoke
some
diacetyl
the
carbonation
is
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
sweetness
somewhat
coating
medium
bodied
this
is
an
excellent
wee
heavy
very
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
thickness
and
does
present
a
bit
of
alcohol
but
not
to
the
boozy
level
a
solid
wee
heavy
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
the
last
wee
heavy
i
had
was
founders
dirty
bastard
and
i
recall
it
having
a
stronger
more
aggressive
flavor
skullsplitter
is
more
balanced
its
got
a
lot
of
the
same
parts
but
doesnt
come
off
as
bold
if
you
want
to
have
a
few
at
a
time
i
figure
thats
good
since
i
remember
thinking
i
probably
would
not
have
wanted
more
than
one
dirty
bastard
at
a
sitting
unless
it
was
going
to
be
with
a
good
hearty
meal
i
liked
skullsplitter
a
lot
and
would
definitely
look
to
have
it
again
oabsolutely
fantastic
scotch
ale
great
balance
and
lots
of
dark
fruit
complexity
that
meshes
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
by
far
overall
not
to
familiar
with
scotch
ales
or
wee
heavys
but
this
is
a
good
start
into
the
style
nice
and
tastey
and
boozy
too
my
cup
of
tea
in
short
a
malty
caramelly
and
fruity
brew
lacking
smoke
earth
or
peat
character
one
might
expect
from
a
scotch
ale
330
ml
best
before
end
july
2011
into
tulip
overall
ive
got
a
feeling
that
this
is
one
that
will
benefit
from
a
year
in
the
cellar
smooth
out
the
alcohol
and
the
hops
some
and
it
would
be
very
nice
with
them
still
raw
though
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me

o
who
would
have
thought
that
a
beer
named
skullsplitter
featuring
a
burly
viking
on
its
front
would
seemingly
be
so
appealing
to
the
wine
drinking
read
female
demographic
this
kind
of
beer
isnt
normally
up
my
alley
but
i
would
pick
this
up
again
rjt
d
very
unique
scottish
cant
remember
ever
having
one
that
is
this
woody
has
a
smoke
element
but
is
not
dominant
on
either
aspect
my
first
brew
from
orkney
excited
to
try
more
poured
dark
with
a
nice
deep
blood
red
hue
to
it
and
a
thick
offwhite
head
nicely
settled
over
time
smells
of
dark
fruits
malty
a
bit
of
hops
and
alcohol
taste
malty
dark
molasses
fruits
spices
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
sweet
rich
full
body
w
good
carbonation
warming
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
loved
the
color
on
it
aroma
and
taste
were
great
especially
for
being
8
5
definitely
a
beer
i
will
be
picking
up
again
not
a
bad
beer
extremely
drinkable
but
theres
also
not
a
lot
there
was
definitely
expecting
more
hot
and
a
bit
harsh
id
have
expected
dark
fruit
over
red
not
the
style
definer
id
heard
it
was
o
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
over
the
top
with
the
name
but
this
is
well
balanced
abd
very
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
ut
not
what
iam
looking
for
in
this
style
of
beer
overly
fruity
in
my
opinion
i
could
use
more
smoke
in
this
beer
the
aroma
is
sublime
the
appearance
is
less
so
a
bit
cloudy
but
pretty
colored
this
is
easily
my
all
time
favorite
scotch
ale
and
it
might
even
prompt
me
to
give
others
a
try
hoping
to
find
more
great
ones
like
this
poured
a
2
light
beige
head
body
is
brown
in
masstone
but
held
up
to
the
light
its
a
deep
beautiful
auburn
amber
it
smells
like
a
complex
array
of
malts
maybe
a
little
dried
fruit
taste
repeats
the
malt
smells
and
also
has
a
sweet
and
salty
emphasis
to
them
body
is
medium
rich
this
is
kind
of
like
a
concentrated
version
of
the
scoth
ale
style
and
ill
add
the
price
among
imports
wasnt
too
bad
at
all
and
though
i
feared
the
skullsplitter
name
was
merely
marketing
it
actually
turned
out
to
be
deserving
of
it
both
historically
and
due
to
the
higher
alcohol
level
o
yuck
i
think
i
may
have
my
second
drainpour
ever
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
of
the
best
wee
heavies
out
there
othis
is
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
real
complex
flavor
but
highly
drinkable
cant
really
taste
the
8
5
abv
unreal
stuff
well
worth
it
enjoy
o
this
beer
is
magnificent
it
is
the
best
of
its
style
and
perhaps
one
of
the
best
beers
available
my
only
gripe
is
that
4
11
2
ounce
bottles
are
12
but
its
worth
it
and
then
some
o
this
is
certainly
one
of
those
brews
that
really
needs
to
come
up
to
room
temp
to
really
appriciate
alot
of
different
things
going
on
in
there
nice
alcohol
kick
sweet
candy
and
dried
fruits
this
beer
is
very
palatable
and
quite
enjoyable
a
definite
recommendation
notes
good
stuff
a
heavy
beer
suitable
for
hand
to
hand
combat
or
getting
warm
on
a
chilly
evening
a
great
beer
d
vinous
and
sweet
very
solid
i
enjoyed
it
best
beverage
coming
out
of
scotland
that
isnt
scotch
smooth
on
tongue
with
a
drying
finish
a
really
quite
nice
wee
heavy
that
was
a
rather
nice
surprise
mouthfeel
has
rich
and
creamy
full
bodied
feel
overall
skull
splitter
is
quite
an
enjoyable
scotch
ale
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
some
tend
to
be
but
still
a
full
bodied
malty
brew
for
a
nice
cool
evening
o
wow
for
3bottle
this
is
a
steal
ive
found
a
new
goto
wee
heavy
its
crisp
and
it
can
handle
earthy
and
sweet
heavy
pizzas
like
a
charm
take
full
advantage
of
this
beer
it
will
turn
a
soso
earthy
dinner
into
a
damn
good
meal
the
color
is
dark
ruby
and
murky
with
suspended
particles
the
head
is
tan
with
little
retention
and
no
lace
the
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
with
caramel
or
molasses
character
tastes
initially
sweet
but
the
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
raisins
taste
could
be
noted
and
there
is
an
obvious
malt
character
alcohol
taste
is
very
obvious
little
hops
bitterness
is
present
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
tingly
carbonation
overall
good
and
pleasant
o
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
it
is
complex
and
tasty
pretty
hard
to
say
anything
bad
about
this
offering
lest
odins
dogs
of
war
be
set
free
still
the
standard
enjoyable
big
malt
component
isnt
done
any
favours
by
the
kind
of
offputting
hop
character
booze
i
can
deal
with
this
less
so
o
a
sweet
malty
brew
with
a
good
measure
of
provocative
complexity
a
touch
thin
in
the
body
for
my
liking
however
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
crystal
clear
with
about
a
quarter
inch
of
cream
colored
head
smells
sweet
with
light
fruit
scent
like
cantaloupes
and
figs
a
bit
of
funk
this
one
might
a
bit
past
its
prime
flat
flavor
on
the
front
end
the
middle
has
a
strong
fruity
flavor
with
a
light
sweetness
the
sweetness
then
turns
into
a
back
end
which
is
a
bit
bitter
the
bitterness
then
magnifies
and
really
shines
at
the
far
end
and
lingers
in
the
mouth
for
a
few
seconds
the
mouthfeel
is
great
the
body
is
dense
and
smooth
but
not
too
thick
there
is
little
or
no
sting
on
the
tongue
from
the
alcohol
or
the
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
beer
very
enjoyable
but
im
not
very
impressed
a
very
good
beer
for
its
style
but
not
amazing

simply
amazing
old
ale
probably
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
a
very
rich
and
delicious
malt
and
hop
mix
rich
and
sweet
with
the
absence
of
the
sharp
hoppy
bouquet
that
tends
to
reside
in

beers
mouth

is
thick

yeah
my
review
was
harsh
but
so
was
this
beer
this
is
a
thick
rich
malty
gem
that
i
hope
i
will
be
able
to
try
again
some
day
doing
a
sidebyside
with
13
and
14
bottles
as
air
just
have
one
12
left
that
ill
save
for
a
longer
vertical
in
the
future
no
distinguishable
difference
on
the
pour
on
the
nose
the
13
has
a
slightly
stronger
bourbon
scent
that
carries
through
to
the
taste
as
well
with
the
13
also
having
a
just
a
touch
more
caramel
sweetness
this
makes
me
assume
they
keep
their
bourbon
barrels
on
a
3year
rotation
like
they
do
with
kbs
overall
theres
not
much
difference
at
all
between
the
batches
now
5
months
and
17
months
old
will
be
curious
to
see
how
much
difference
is
present
with
a
bigger
lineup
in
a
couple
years
o
very
drinkable
very
smooth
tasty
its
a
2013
and
the
bourbon
and
alcohol
leave
a
slight
burn
on
the
palate
but
overall
very
good
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
as
the
scotch
ale
characteristics
are
absent
it
is
rare
that
i
find
a
beer
that
just
makes
me
want
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
backwoods
bastard
is
just
that
it
is
a
very
complex
brew
similar
to
a
good
scotch
ale
but
with
a
lot
of
subtle
complexities
obviously
that
comes
from
the
aging
process
in
bourbon
casks
the
taste
is
dark
fruit
peat
chocolate
and
bourbon
it
has
a
little
more
hops
on
the
finish
than
i
generally
like
but
this
is
a
world
class
brew
watch
out
however
if
you
do
engage
and
have
more
than
a
couple
at
a
sitting
because
it
is
a
10
2
brew
and
they
do
sneak
up
on
you
cheers
this
beer
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
the
oakbourbonvanilla
flavor
is
the
best
i
have
had
among
beers
with
a
flavor
similar
to
this
dragons
milk
and
pilgrims
dole
come
to
mind
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
might
have
improved
this
beer
but
no
major
complaints
definitely
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
glad
i
was
able
to
snag
the
last
4pack
of
this
at
a
local
liquor
store
a
little
bit
rye
whiskey
a
little
bit
porter
smooth
and
flat
and
more
like
settling
in
with
a
glass
of
whiskey
flavorwise
there
very
close
to
weyerbacher
insanity
a
bit
smoother
with
not
as
much
bourbon
for
my
taste
i
prefer
insanity
over
bb
great
ale
and
i
will
buy
it
when
ever
i
can
find
it
o
really
enjoyable
very
tasty
and
very
smooth
for
the
abv
too
bad
that
i
could
only
get
2
bottles
hopefully
i
can
load
up
next
time
like
butterscotch
let
her
sit
for
a
bit
after
taking
out
the
fridge
glad
i
loaded
up
on
this
stuff
this
year
looking
forward
to
see
what
age
has
to
offer
cheers
a
little
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
i
sip
this
one
on
special
occasions
especially
when
celebrating
success
at
work
and
wins
by
my
favorite
teams
i
go
to
great
lengths
to
purchase
as
much
as
i
can

very
reasonable
price
another
master
crafted
brews
from
the
founders
team
overall
really
a
wonderful
beer
especially
during
these
winter
months
the
sweet
malts
compliment
the
bournon
barrel
quailities
very
well
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
i
imagine
the
perfect
bba
scotch
ale
to
be
but
its
damn
close
the
warmer
it
got
the

it
is
a
captivating
thrilling
experience
and
keeps
the
alcohol
so
well
in

with
the
bourbon

it
is
unbelievable
pleasant
and
easy

cuz
theres

had
in
this
founders
offering
has
opened
my
eyes
to
what
can
be
done
with
a
bourbon
barrel
aside
from
the
usual
stout
suspects
delicious
be
warned
there
is
a
lot
of
bourbon
in
this
beer
its
sweet
and
malty
but
bourbon
is
the
dominate
flavor
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
not
masked
at
all
imagine
drinking
a
viscous
carbonated
bourbon
with
14
the
alcohol
content
thats
backwoods
sorry
but
im
not
a
fan
i
like
bba
stouts
and
even
barely
or
wheat
wines
this
is
not
for
me
another
great
beer
from
founders
i
think
this
may
be
my
favorite
beer
now
dark
brown
in
color
but
somewhat
clear
sweet
nutty
aroma
with
bourbon
the
tast
is
carmel
and
bourbon
with
a
lite
sweet
taste
no
bitterness
this
is
one
of
the
quintessential
beers
i
could
drink
this
everyday
had
this
from
several
different
years
and
has
always
been
good
definitely
better
at
room
temperature
and
be
aware
you
can
taste
that
10
2
looks
of
deep
walnut
carries
a
nutty
toffee
vanilla
and
an
amazing
bourbon
barrel
scent
dark
sweet
and
vinous
fruit
tastes
like
figs
and
dates
quite
distinctly
spicy
and
roasted
malt
clean
scotch
cask
flavor
with
rough
barrel
of
bourbon
big
bodied
beer
very
exceptional
the
mixed
drink
of
beers
okay
head
nothing
special
there
rich
brown
color
smells
sweet
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
as
well
smells
of
whiskybourbon
tastes
sweet
but
harsh
you
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
its
not
masked
much
at
all
a
great
beer
for
a
whisky
drinker
not
so
much
for
me
loved
this
beer
very
smooth
and
a
wee
bit
heavy
but
i
loved
it
wee
heavy
more
like
quite
heavy
but
this
was
worth
savoring
and
the
warming
effect
of
the
alcohol
complemented
everything
else
nicely
founders
brews
some
amazing
beers
and
this
one
was
no
exception
to
it
i
need
to
get
a
fourpack
for
this
house
and
age
a
few
as
so
many
here
have
done
shame
that
this
was
a
fall
release
as
id
love
this
for
all
of
the
cooler
months
of
the
year
yes
its
that
good
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
and
well
rounded
brew
that
has
taken
all
the
good
things
out
of
the
barrel
aging
and
left
nothing
behind
drinking
this
with
just
under
six
months
of
age
on
it
i
would
love
some
more
to
be
able
to
age
and
have
the
barrel
flavors
develop
further
great
stuff
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
pours
like
motor
oil
the
head
is
maybe
18th
of
an
inch
high
bronze
color
the
smell
is
a
good
balance
between
bourbon
oak
vanilla
nuts
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
fantastically
layered
starts
with
a
captivating
bourbon
dominance
transitions
into
layers
of
dark
fruit
and
oak
and
finishes
with
a
very
long
vanilla
note
the
feel
is
creamy
and
complex
laid
a
few
down
in
the
cellar
tons
of
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
prob
the
best
scotch
ale
out
there
imo
love
it
would
drink
it
year
round
had
on
tap
good
beer
very
dark
and
almost
black
and
smells
oaky
and
scotchy
also
tastes
very
oaky
from
the
barrel
aging
and
slightly
overpowers
the
peated
scotchy
malts
bourbon
tastes
are
incredibly
apparent
as
well
and
this
is
a
very
boozy
tasting
beer
the
scotch
ale
style
has
some
malty
sweetness
to
balance
this
out
but
this
beer
could
use
some
aging
to
open
up
more
flavors
and
depth
definitely
a
recommended
beer
though
drink
fresh
have
recently
had
a
12
13
and
a
14
this
bourbon
bomb
needs
no
mellowing
best
founders
brew
i
have
had
this
doesnt
taste
like
beer
but
i
like
it
ooooh
yes
thats
the
stuff
was
really
excited
to
get
to
try
this
one
but
was
immediately
surprised
by
the
hefty
booze
notes
both
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
the
purported
smoky
notes
which
id
hoped
would
balance
out
the
booze
and
attendant
sweetness
struggled
to
come
through
theres
certainly
some
dark
fruit
and
toffeelike
sweetness
throughout
but
theyre
not
particularly
inviting
accords
in
lieu
of
the
dominating
bourbon
yet
another
beer
i
just
dont
get
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
bourbon
flavor
mixed
perfectly
with
the
chocolate
and
malt
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
unique
ale
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
before
the
scent
hints
at
massive
bourbon
flavor
but
the
taste
is
surprisingly
mild
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
flavors
are
primarily
toffee
caramel
creme
brulee
bourbon
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
very
refreshing
and
doesnt
have
the
bite
associated
with
most
bourbon
aged
beers
really
like
the
ale
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
this
is
one
of
the
better
founders
beer
i
have
had
o
such
a
perfect
balance
of
complex
malts
and
bourbon
barrel
character
it
almost
seems
to
evolve
as
you
drink
it
and
the
unexpected
chocolate
flavor
was
a
nice
surprise
worth
seeking
out
for
a
craft
beer
very
good
surprisingly
pleasant
aroma
of
bourbon
toffee
caramel
and
wood
the
smell
matches
the
taste
its
the
aroma
that
really
makes
this
wee
heavy
stand
out
the
most
to
me
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
outstanding
beer
awesome
flavors
wrapped
up
in
an
equally
awesome
mouthfeel
be
careful
though
as
with
its
awesome
flavors
and
amazing
masked
alcohol
you
might
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
which
could
know
you
on
your
ass
real
quick
ok
im
not
a
big
fan
of
bourbon
as
a
beer
flavor
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
didnt
expect
the
strong
bourbon
presence
it
was
evident
from
the
time
i
popped
the
top
until
the
time
the
final
remnants
finished
rolling
off
my
tongue
to
me
this
was
too
overbearing
it
was
as
though
founders
took
some
ale
and
mixed
it
5050
with
beam
beautiful
deep
red
color
and
felt
great
on
the
tongue
just
couldnt
get
over
thinking
that
i
was
drinking
a
cocktail
i
love
this
beer
i
just
wish
they
would
come
out
with
this
beer
more
then
a
month
the
bourbon
taste
at
the
end
of
a
sip
taste
amazingdef
a
great
beer
to
buy
others
in
the
class
barrel
aged
wulver
fantastic
but
needs
a
lot
more
time
to
settle
and
ride
the
lion
i
have
mixed
feelings
on
this
are
both
greatgood
beers
if
you
like
the
style
alesmith
wee
with
a
year
on
it
is
a
delight
overall
just
from
the
nose
i
could
tell
this
would
be
great
and
it
was
rich
toffee
flavors
and
a
mellow
bourbon
influence
makes
this
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
sipper
that
sips
very
easily
and
isnt
cloying
in
the
least
bit
given
the
price
and
quality
of
this
beer
this
will
be
a
seasonal
must
have
o
with
this
style
its
easy
to
be
boring
or
do
too
much
innovation
this
one
nails
it
malt
at
the
forefront
sweet
overall
but
not
too
much
with
whiskey
spice
and
a
bit
of
an
ethanol
reminder
to
really
elevate
it
above
the
rest
this
is
an
absolutely
outstanding
beer
its
powerful
but
not
too
overwhelming
and
i
love
the
way
it
smells
right
after
you
open
the
bottle
drank
all
mine
up
so
i
will
have
to
wait
until
next
year
for
more
overall
the
power
in
this
is
in
the
initial
aroma
not
as
much
bourbon
as
you
would
expect
in
the
taste
which
i
dont
mind
very
drinkable
scotch
ale
gave
it
a
couple
shots
spread
out
over
time
and
i
just
cant
get
into
it
wayy
too
much
booze
on
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
once
you
get
past
the
booze
there
are
some
nice
notes
hidden
underneath
but
they
are
completely
overwhelmed
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
jack
and
coke
taste
is
overwhelming
booze
then
a
decent
bourboney
finish
will
try
to
keep
a
couple
in
the
cellar
and
see
how
it
mellows
with
age
o
this
ended
up
being
a
mild
whale
for
me
and
im
not
disappointed
its
special
and
robust
and
worth
the
hunt
i
look
forward
to
seeing
it
next
year
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
place
where
i
picked
it
up
had
a
limited
release
so
i
was
expecting
a
lot
from
this
one
i
am
not
sure
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
make
sure
i
get
a
bottle
the
next
time
it
is
release
but
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
best
of
its
category
in
my
opinion
nice
aroma
nice
start
then
there
is
just
thin
alcohol
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
perfect
so
delicious
the
color
is
almost
black
but
with
some
burgundy
shades
the
foam
is
one
finger
high
the
aroma
is
strong
with
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
taste
is
sharp
and
sweet
lots
of
vanilla
and
butterscotch
the
finish
is
a
bit
smoky
which
i
personally
like
it
also
cuts
of
the
alcohol
well
a
very
complex
and
strong
ale
what
i
especially
like
about
this
beer
is
that
you
can
really
feel
that
it
has
been
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
both
in
taste
and
in
the
aroma
i
like
this
brew
but
i
feel
the
bourbon
is
too
dominant
and
doesnt
allow
the
beer
to
shine
the
color
is
a
deep
redcaramel
tone
with
a
thinmedium
creamy
head
oaky
and
caramel
english
toffee
notes
dominate
the
nose
the
base
beer
dirty
bastard
is
a
classic
founders
offering
but
this
barrel
aged
version
ramps
up
the
flavor
profile
to
11
there
are
blended
tones
of
vanilla
cherrydried
fruit
and
rich
caramel
all
adding
up
to
a
complex
deep
woody
ale
a
phenomenal
beer
that
shows
incredible
restraint
on
the
booziness
this
strikes
me
as
one
to
enjoy
fresh
such
complexity
that
demands
your
attention
at
each
sip
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
balanced
body
that
has
the
perfect
full
feel
without
being
sticky
or
too
thick
great
color
and
i
could
smell
the
bourbon
not
much
foam
and
a
little
bit
of
bubble
after
its
poured
really
enjoyed
this
beer
found
2
4
packs
in
nebraska
in
late
december
of
all
places
im
assuming
this
beer
is
even
better
closer
to
the
source
what
can
i
say
one
of
the
best
winter
beers
money
can
buy
this
beer
looked
and
smelled
great
but
was
way
too
boozy
ruined
the
beer
outstanding
beer
after
the
first
sip
i
though
i
was
imagining
things
you
know
a
beer
is
good
when
the
last
sip
is
as
good
as
the
first
first
one
was
good
next
night
better
3rd
one
out
fuckin
standing
took
a
couple
to
really
appreciate
whats
going
on
one
per
session
for
me
will
be
grabbing
this
whenever
it
is
seen
glad
i
couldnt
get
a
single
wouldnt
have
given
it
a
second
thought
beer
was
not
very
good
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
it
doesnt
have
an
insanely
huge
barrel
character
but
it
definitely
adds
to
the
beer
perfectly
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
founders
tastes
like
liquid
caramel
i
love
it
its
basically
a
badass
version
of
their
dirty
bastard
which
is
great
bourbon
is
definitely
the
front
runner
on
the
nose
and
taste
but
absolutely
no
bad
tastes
smooth
my
bros
smooth
not
bad
but
the
high
alcohol
content
is
overcompensated
for
by
too
much
sweetness
resulting
in
a
syrupy
beer
that
leaves
some
hoppiness
or
other
flavor
to
be
desired
if
you
love
whiskey
and
you
love
ales
youll
love
this
beer
strong
and
tasty
alcohol
really
jumps
out
at
you
founders
delivers
again
i
was
blown
away
by
this
beer
the
bourbon
flavor
is
perfectly
balanced
in
this
beautifully
complex
beer
i
want
more
o
love
it
really
really
delicious
sipper
suppose
theres
some
minor
improvements
to
be
had
but
fricking
delicious
a
celebration
of
big
beer
the
color
is
a
very
dark
red
burgundy
shade
with
a
small
tannish
head
not
much
lacing
the
beer
seems
cloudy
with
floating
sediments
the
odor
is
bourbon
dark
berry
cherry
woods
sweet
very
rich
fig
dried
fruits
dates
the
taste
is
dried
fruits
dates
malt
sweet
berry
dry
but
not
very
bitter
a
aftertaste
aged
a
few
months
before
trying
bottle
presence
is
strong
can
definately
smell
the
alcohol
and
berry
woody
notes
at
the
spout
of
the
bottle
initially
poured
about
2
ounces
in
a
snifter
the
color
is
rich
and
with
full
body
upon
initial
swirl
again
the
booze
eminates
strong
but
there
is
a
very
rich
oak
smell
the
head
is
full
but
quickly
dissipates
as
expected
with
the
high
alcohol
content
the
thickness
of
the
beer
is
impressive
and
hold
well
to
the
glass
the
temperature
at
taste
is
about
45
degrees
fahrenheit
and
this
is
where
i
feel
the
beer
is
at
its
best
has
a
great
mouth
feel
and
the
aging
of
the
beer
really
shows
through
the
taste
is
super
crisp
and
bites
like
a
good
whiskey
over
the
course
of
an
hour
the
drink
warms
but
holds
up
well
overall
it
makes
for
an
overall
enjoyable
experience
there
is
a
little
room
for
improvement
as
the
color
muddied
a
bit
as
it
warms
but
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
founders
rarely
disappoints
me
and
this
one
holds
up
strong
this
has
always
been
a
go
to
winter
beer
for
me
this
year
it
has
a
very
creamy
mouth
feel
coats
the
mouth
a
lot
though
tastes
good
but
has
a
little
bit
of
a
banana
taste
to
it
otherwise
its
still
a
favorite
cold
weather
beer
typing
characters
so
that
i
can
rate
as
before
without
having
to
write
a
paragraph
phenomenal
beer
everything
you
want
in
a
ba
beer
the
best
hands
down
scotch
ale
you
will
ever
have
looks
great
in
the
glass
smells
like
almost
pure
bourbon
taste
has
that
similar
twang
that
all
befell
kbs
as
well
where
the
bourbon
seems
to
be
somehow
applied
on
top
of
the
beer
instead
of
a
part
of
it
reaching
an
almost
buttery
flavor
that
almost
puts
you
off
but
not
quite
really
enjoy
this
brew
alcohol
binding
pretty
well
taste
the
bourbon
in
the
after
taste
cant
beat
2
in
1
beer
and
bourbon
good
seasonal
beer
much
more
going
for
it
than
billed
reddish
brown
hue
with
vanilla
and
bourbon
in
the
aroma
tastes
of
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
with
a
touch
of
heat
on
the
finish
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
any
aging
but
this
one
works
well
nicely
done
founders
this
is
an
excellent
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
the
oakvanillabourbon
is
somewhat
downplayed
compared
to
others
that
ive
tried
which
often
come
across
as
cloyingly
sweet
this
been
lets
the
underlying
beer
come
through
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
for
this
week
as
an
initial
foray
in
to
the
beer
review
community
what
better
brewery
to
start
with
than
founders
and
what
better
selection
than
2014
backwoods
bastard
admittedly
i
am
a
little
partial
due
to
the
fact
that
i
grew
up
in
metro
detroit
and
was
spoiled
with
the
likes
of
world
class
breweries
such
as
founders
and
bells
now
that
i
am
living
in
south
carolina
i
can
appreciate
their
genius
even
more
well
its
monday
night
what
better
way
to
usher
in
tedious
tuesday
morning
meetings
than
a
midnight
wee
heavy
that
clocks
in
at
10
2
i
have
tried
many
other
scotch
ales
orkney
old
chub
innis
gunn
mcewans
and
more
but
this
one
raises
the
bar
for
me
dirty
bastard
was
always
a
favorite
but
the
barrel
aging
of
this
masterpiece
sets
it
apart
the
bourbon
notes
perfectly
marry
with
the
sweet
caramel
malts
creating
a
warm
and
especially
inviting
beer
this
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
though
i
would
call
it
dangerously
drinkable
for
those
that
can
enjoy
the
aroma
warmth
of
bourbon
and
appreciate
the
syrupy
splendor
of
sweet
scotch
ale
give
it
to
your
friend
that
drinks
blue
moon
and
watch
them
recoil
in
horror
share
with
an
afficianado
of
spirits
and
you
might
find
a
convert
best
enjoyed
in
the
company
of
a
true
beer
advocate
this
is
simply
too
good
to
trifle
with
those
that
cannot
appreciate
its
perfection
lots
of
vanilla
too
sweet
for
me
but
will
be
great
for
fans
of
bourbon
aged
beers
overall
my
favorite
founders
brew
second
to
kbs
2013
vintage
really
nice
barrel
influence
on
this
to
have
such
a
presence
after
more
than
a
years
aging
nice
cherryplum
flavors
and
hints
of
vanilla
from
the
oak
taste
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
rootbeer
windsor
there
is
a
light
fizz
that
dances
on
your
tongue
coffee
syrup
aftertaste
overall
wulver
is
better
i
would
take
either
but
prefer
wulver
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
with
an
amazing
aroma
of
caramel
and
big
bourbon
flavors
that
are
a
major
part
of
everything
there
is
definitely
some
oak
on
the
finish
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
and
is
the
perfect
touch
this
is
a
great
beer
but
personally
i
would
like
it
more
if
the
bourbon
was
slightly
less
pronounced
nonetheless
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
now
i
am
regretting
only
buying
a
single
12oz
o
this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
exactly
worthy
of
all
the
hype
thirsty
dogs
wulver
on
the
other
hand
good
flavor
but
sticks
on
pallet
o
regardless
of
style
this
is
simply
one
extraordinary
bba
beer
the
base
beer
dirty
bastard
is
excellent
in
its
own
right
but
after
time
in
a
bourbon
barrel
transforms
it
into
a
sublime
libation
founders
continues
to
release
very
solid
barrelaged
beers
with
backwoods
bastard
being
one
that
is
often
overlooked
5
0
o
outstanding
job
by
founders
im
a
sucker
for
kbs
and
stouts
but
this
is
a
homerun
for
a
scotch
ale
and
is
just
a
step
behind
kbs
in
my
opinion
i
know
quite
a
few
people
who
enjoy
this
offering
better
actually
its
smooth
bourbon
bliss
in
my
book
overall
boozy
bourbon
barrel
beer
and
pretty
good

a

on
how
to
make
a
bourbonbomb
of
a
beer
heavenly
aromas
combine
with
impressive
flavors
with
seamless
bourbon
barrel
presence
world
class
overall
great
beer
and
the
first
of
the
bourbon
barrel
beers
ive
tasted
definitely
a
fan
and
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
the
look
is
much
the
same
as
the
standard
dirty
bastard
the
aroma
is
mostly
bourbon
with
some
sweetness
uh
oh
the
first
taste
is
a
major
surprise
having
expected
lots
of
harsh
bourbon
actually
while
the
bourbon
is
present
the
most
amplified
characteristic
is
vanilla
which
sets
in
hard
at
mid
palate
other
flavors
are
something
of
a
syrupy
caramel
and
of
course
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
feel
is
wonderful
silky
smooth
my
only
regret
was
that
i
didnt
drink
it
faster
not
sure
what
happened
but
after
about
3040
minutes
the
beer
became
sticky
and
cloying
my
ratings
reflect
the
first
half
of
the
beer
still
i
like
to
sip
the
heavy
stuff
not
sure
id
go
back
for
this
one
well
thought
out
results
are
a
harmony
of
nose
flavor
and
mouthfeel
o
very
good
bourbon
barrel
aged
wee
heavy
is
a
killer
idea
medium
brownish
red
pour
looks
like
dirty
bastard
the
smell
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
you
have
to
get
down
in
there
to
smell
it
bourbon
comes
through
though
once
you
get
past
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
yummy
smells
in
there
it
tastes
like
bourbon
all
the
great
flavors
without
the
alcohol
burn
it
isnt
overpowering
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
to
try
and
figure
it
out
great
balance
great
beer
in
the
end
this
functions
well
as
a
flavorful
postsupper
nite
cap
in
the
late
year
season
more
world
class
from
founders
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
founders
this
one
means
business
its
very
strong
but
if
you
sip
it
its
a
great
nightcap
o
very
well
done
by
founders
not
too
boozy
and
not
too
heavy
nice
mouthfeel
and
just
enough
heat
to
let
you
know
its
oak
aged
the
light
carbonation
is
a
nice
touch
also
everyone
should
try
it
at
least
once
o
i
am
impressed
founders
really
produced
a
solid
brew
here
that
definitely
raised
my
opinion
of
scotch
ales
this
is
some
good
stuff
here
definitely
one
you
should
try
if
you
get
the
chance
scored
a
couple
of
4
packs
of
these
one
of
the
better
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
out
there
real
good
bourbon
up
front
with
a
smooth
finish
a
gift
from
a
friend
pours
a
deep
reddish
mahogany
the
nose
is
sweet
and
boozy
lots
of
bourbon
flavor
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
very
little
vanilla
shines
through
mostly
oak
and
dark
sticky
fruits
the
feel
is
thin
with
a
nice
alcohol
burn
on
the
tongue
this
one
is
a
perfect
sipper
enjoyed
next
to
the
dim
light
of
the
christmas
tree
o
an
excellent
brew
and
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
scotch
ales
i
wish
i
picked
up
more
than
a
single
because
id
love
to
see
how
this
beer
ages
my
neighbor
was
kind
enough
to
share
not
one
but
two
bottles
of
this
woodsy
aged
oak
goodness
if
i
can
locate
it
within
a
reasonable
distance
i
would
for
sure
snag
a
sixer
sweet
a
bit
syrupy
slight
barley
wine
taste
gives
way
to
slight
peated
whisky
flavors
slow
sipper
dude
at
my
store
had
a
4
pack
left
and
sold
me
one
i
should
have
bought
all
four
oops
buy
it
if
you
can
find
it
finally
found
a
4
pack
and
everything
i
heard
about
this
beer
is
true
very
tasty
dessert
like
taste
founders
again
brings
their
a
game
this
beer
is
one
of
my
top
10
of
all
time
and
im
glad
it
is
so
easily
attainable
when
it
is
released
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
not
much
of
a
head
and
it
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
the
smell
leaves
you
with
the
impression
that
this
will
be
a
sweet
beer
similar
to
a
southern
tier
brew
the
taste
strikes
me
as
being
an
almost
perfect
balance
of
malts
and
bourbon
the
aftertaste
is
probably
the
best
of
any
beer
i
have
ever
tried
it
leaves
you
with
a
sticky
sweetness
and
a
slight
hint
of
oak
the
complexity
is
just
amazing
and
if
you
sip
the
beer
as
you
should
by
the
end
of
your
glass
the
temperature
may
be
10
degrees
higher
which
accentuates
even
more
flavors
you
may
not
have
been
conscious
of
before
the
more
you
drink
this
mysterious
concoction
the
more
you
appreciate
such
a
well
crafted
beer
founders
knocked
this
one
outta
the
park
just
a
fantastic
well
crafted
beer
for
those
who
appreciate
a
beer
a
bit
out
of
the
norm
o
this
beer
is
amazing
strong
like
whiskey
but
smooth
one
of
my
favorite
beers
super
delicious
and
satisfying
o
this
is
a
sipping
beer
perfectly
built
for
reading
fireside
on
a
cold
snowy
autumn
afternoon
add
someone
you
love
to
share
the
calm
and
you
just
might
glimpse
the
meaning
of
life
well
lived
this
may
well
be
the
best
beer
i
have
had
this
year
so
far
pours
a
deep
and
clear
brown
the
thin
tan
head
melts
away
quickly
the
aroma
smells
like
youre
sitting
in
the
barrel
bourbon
sweetness
dominating
the
taste
certainly
brings
the
barrel
with
nice
notes
of
vanilla
oak
and
a
hint
of
the
bourbon
itself
the
body
has
a
nice
thickness
and
silky
feeling

wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
exceeded
expectations
in
smell
and
taste
not
usually
a
scotch
ale
guy
but
when
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
this
was
great
beer
highly
recommend
trying
but
starting
to
get
hard
to
find
only
available
in
november
for
retailers
no
beer
is
perfect
and
it
is
totally
by
preference
and
i
will
go
out
and
say
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
so
far
if
you
love
bourbon
this
beer
is
great
some
say
this
is
a
sipper
and
i
agree
to
enjoy
it
best
aroma
look
labeling
very
very
pleased
approach
with
caution
and
enthusiasm
cheers
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
pours
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
deep
ruby
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nice
oak
and
bourbon
nose
flavor
is
similar
with
bourbon
and
oak
some
malty
sweetness
the
high
abv
is
hidden
3
50
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
berts
better
beers
hooksett
nh
glass
stout
glass
very
strong
burbon
hit
when
first
sampled
it
has
grown
on
me
with
continuous
tasting
an
excellent
scotch
ale
what
distinguishes
this
from
other
scotch
ales
is
its
pronounced
yet
warming
bourbon
booziness
o
such
an
amazing
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
people
are
saying
the
2014
batch
is
hot
or
not
as
good
bullshit
its
just
as
good
go
out
and
pick
up
a
couple
4packs
and
cellar
some
this
beer
was
a
hot
mess
the
bourbon
was
hot
the
scotch
aspect
was
hot
it
tastes
like
super
sugary
caramel
covered
in
bourbon
i
wouldnt
have
finished
it
if
i
hadnt
paid
for
it
founders
disappoints
again
this
is
bold
alcoholic
scottish
ale
if
you
dig
bourbons
you
will
find
your
life
meaningless
before
tasting
this
beer
but
similarly
you
need
to
like
this
yankee
liquor
to
embrace
this
beer
awesome
as
it
warms
up
becoming
a
great
sipper
i
love
this
beer
i
had
some
of
the
2013
batch
for
the
first
time
a
month
ago
and
when
it
came
out
i
bought
16
bottles
of
the
2014
batch
and
have
had
it
on
tap
whenever
i
see
it
fantastic
beer
pours
dark
maroon
with
a
slight
dirty
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
aroma
showcases
that
bourbon
barrel
wonderfully
with
some
soft
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
and
it
pairs
well
with
the
beer
which
offers
raisin
fig
cherry
and
caramel
flavor
is
downgrade
decent
but
not
excellent
bourbon
stand
on
top
of
a
thick
malt
foundation
that
does
not
come
close
to
offering
anything
close
to
the
depth
i
got
from
the
aroma
dark
fruits
and
caramels
are
there
but
they
dont
really
jump
out
at
me
what
i
get
in
that
first
wave
of
flavor
is
all
that
there
is
nothing
really
builds
or
evolves
nothing
new
really
comes
at
me
mid
sip
or
in
the
finish
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
are
there
mid
to
end
stream
but
minimal
a
fuller
mouthfeel
no
activity
overall
this
one
underwhelmed
me
in
all
honesty
in
part
because
my
expectations
were
sky
high
a
decent
beer
nothing
outstanding
and
definitely
not
worth
the
18
i
spent
on
it
basically
someone
made
scotch
but
instead
of
distilling
it
bottled
and
called
it
ale
nice
kick
great
for
the
first
few
seconds
that
it
hits
your
mouth
then
the
alcohol
kicks
you
in
face
with
a
pair
of
steal
toed
boots
2014
bottle
tastes
boozier
than
the
10
on
the
label
would
lead
you
to
believe
very
heavy
barrel
flavor
on
the
beer
too
tickling
of
the
tongue
more
carbonation
than
expected
yet
smooth
none
the
less
overall
an
intense
complex
ale
that
shows
great
depth
of
malt
character
with
a
surprising
complexity
of
alcohol
notes
oak
character
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
not
overpowering
of
the
wonderful
underlying
beer
just
enough
hop
presence
to
make
this
behemoth
of
a
beer
more
drinkable
i
have
a
feeling
this
might
have
been
a
bit
harsh
young
but
is
good
now
and
probably
would
have
been
better
in
another
year
definitely
one
that
holds
up
to
age
overall
was
told
to
get
this
pricy
but
very
good
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
but
at
10
2
would
not
have
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
a
nice
younger
brother
to
the
kbs
which
is
obviously
better
but
hard
to
get
would
def
get
another
four
pack
cheers
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
beer
2014
and
i
love
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
one
is
way
too
much
bourbon
its
pretty
much
like
bourbon
that
was
aged
in
a
beer
barrel
no
head
low
carb
served
in
my
oskar
blues
rocks
glass
which
looks
like
a
glass
youd
drink
whiskey
from
very
fitting
founders
calm
down
the
bourbon
it
takes
away
from
the
beer
thank
you
sir
ill
have
another
this
was
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
never
found
it
to
be
overwhelming
or
out
of
balance
in
any
facet
maybe
not
for
everyone
but
definitely
for
me
hank
was
right
a
country
boy
can
survive
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
beer
and
im
hugely
impressed
split
at
cellar
temperature
with
the
lady
after
splitting
a
dirty
bastard
i
will
admit
that
the
neither
of
us
are
bourbon
ba
fans
but
this
has
changed
things
the
flavors
are
so
well
integrated
and
blend
way
too
well
this
is
entirely
unsafe
its
unfair
for
it
to
be
so
delicious
coming
from
someone
who
does
not
enjoy
bourbon
in
the
least
im
incredibly
happy
that
i
got
a
few
of
these
cant
wait
to
try
it
with
several
monthsa
year
on
it
if
i
can
hold
off
of
course
highly
highly
recommended
dark
brown
with
mahogany
hues
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
and
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
really
inviting
aroma
on
this
one
oak
bourbon
vanilla
malted
milk
caramel
cocoa
and
some
alcohol
heat
fill
the
nose
aroma
made
me
think
of
bourbon
balls
with
that
same
dessert
like
sweetness
to
it
dark
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
coffee
malted
milk
bourbon
soaked
dark
fruits
and
oak
flavors
in
abundance
make
this
a
complex
sipper
of
a
beer
smooth
creamy
feel
with
a
medium
body
and
semi
dry
finish
great
texture
and
feel
lends
to
sipping
slowly
could
it
be
less
boozy
sure
could
it
have
less
barrel
presence
perhaps
bottom
line
who
cares
this
beer
is
big
bold
and
unapologetic
and
i
dig
it
a
lot
of
nice
bourbon
flavor
without
the
kind
of
burn
i
would
expect
out
of
a
10
brew
a
little
vanilla
on
the
back
end
and
even
some
creaminess
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
before
and
you
can
find
it
in
your
area
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
it
a
go
o
this
brew
from
founders
is
another
outstanding
beer
like
most
of
their
others
im
happy
to
have
landed
a
few
bottles
of
this
i
can
only
image
this
brew
will
improve
with
a
little
age
on
it
but
it
is
also
an
exceptional
drinking
beer
within
a
couple
of
months
off
the
bottling
line
this
is
the
best
founders
ive
had
so
far
highly
recommend
o
3
25
this
is
very
alcohol
forward
in
my
opinion
the
booze
and
bourbon
mute
a
lot
of
other
flavors
i
let
it
warm
before
drinking
perhaps
a
colder
beer
would
have
suppressed
the
alcohol
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
but
i
think
it
is
just
not
my
thing
creamy
silky
smooth
vanilla
caramel
butterscotch
its
like
a
fine
bourbon
in
a
beer
i
just
love
this
beer
if
you
have
not
tried
this
do
scotch
ales
arent
my
fancy
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
character
so
i
cant
degrade
it
o
i
am
a
fan
of
bourbon
and
a
fan
of
the
dirty
bastard
as
such
this
makes
for
quite
a
beer
for
me
this
2014
bottle
is
the
first
time
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
since
a
founders
tap
takeover
at
fries
cafe
around
2011
or
so
and
that
may
well
be
too
long
a
span
to
go
without
this
in
my
life
overall
founders
has
knocked
one
out
of
the
park
again
i
bought
a
few
of
these
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
some
of
them
age
let
it
warm
up
maltiness
balances
out
with
the
bourbon
closer
to
cellar
temperatures
awesome
overall
another
great
brew
from
founders
the
brew
melds
big
bourbon
a
solid
wee
heavy
and
a
dominate
oak
very
well
to
make
a
great
drinking
barrel
aged
beer
the
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
i
think
alesmiths
barrel
aged
wee
heavy
is
still
the
best
beer
in
this
style
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
when
i
see
it
again
too
much
bourbon
flavor
not
enough
smoothness
in
my
opinion
for
a
scotch
ale
which
lowered
its
rating
this
beer
is
kicking
my
ass
a
bourbon
punch
to
the
face
but
then
it
goes
down
smooth
a
heavy
looking
beer
that
pours
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
trail
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
wood
and
alcohol
but
also
some
vanilla
on
the
end
the
taste
was
amazing
with
hints
of
big
flavors
such
as
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
up
front
and
then
the
sweet
malt
masking
a
slight
burn
on
the
end
very
well
done
and
very
tasty
also
really
liked
the
weight
of
the
beer
overall
if
you
do
not
like
bourbon
you
are
not
going
to
enjoy
this
beer
it
really
isnt
balanced
really
well
it
does
improve
quite
a
bit
as
it
warms
it
is
really
hot
initially
though
like
curmudgeon
is
fresh
my
score
is
probably
a
little
favorable
because
i
love
bourbon
and
think
this
is
an
excellent
beer
but
if
you
want
a
better
balanced
barrel
aged
scotch
alewee
heavy
try
wulver
overall
this
is
a
good
barrel
aged
beer
pours
a
thin
white
head
and
dark
garnet
color
when
held
to
light
bourbon
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
velvety
mouth
feel
hints
of
toffee
and
milk
chocolate
come
through
with
the
oak
and
has
a
pronounced
bourbon
finish
if
you
like
bourbon
this
is
an
excellent
beer
need
to
find
more
overall
i
still
find
myself
getting
acclimated
to
the
scotch
ale
styles
since
they
are
so
unlike
what
i
have
conventionally
accepted
as
beer
i
have
been
a
long
time
fan
of
good
scotch
later
in
life
as
i
have
acquired
a
greater
knowledge
of
craft
beer
and
extreme
beer
styles
i
have
gained
a
greater
appreciation
for
non
traditional
brews
as
im
nearing
the
end
of
this
drink
i
can
tell
that
the
potency
of
this
brew
is
almost
comparable
to
the
feeling
you
get
from
drinking
scotch
however
the
malty
sweetness
in
the
aroma
and
the
licorice
feel
a
taste
i
have
never
enjoyed
is
slightly
disconcerting
as
i
said
i
love
me
some
good
scotch
but
more
for
the
bitter
and
spicy
elements
it
brings
this
scotch
ale
does
not
provide
that
for
me
however
i
will
acknowledge
that
as
someone
who
is
still
learning
about
the
diverse
and
dynamic
nature
of
beer
this
one
could
become
an
acquired
taste
in
the
future
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
those
of
you
who
shy
away
from
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
should
try
this
one
yes
it
is
there
and
you
can
taste
it
but
it
does
not
dominate
another
great
beer
from
founders
very
good
great
big
full
bodied
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
huge
bourbon
and
vanilla
notes
very
well
balanced
warms
nicely
and
has
just
great
flavor
smooth
all
the
way
through
although
at
10
2
some
booze
shines
through
and
leaves
a
burn
overall
a
great
ba
brew
that
i
will
always
seek
out
overall
bourbon
barrel
compliments
the
base
beer
beautifully
enhances
and
almost
plays
with
the
flavors
in
a
wonderful
way
notes
of
bourbon
are
mild
to
subtle
but
you
also
get
a
lot
of
oaky
characteristics
malt
aromas
and
flavors
are
delictably
sweet
and
satisfying
rich
and
full
of
flavors
great
to
sip
and
savor
i
loved
the
2013
backwoods
bastard
the
2014
has
even
surpassed
last
years
brew
in
quality
rich
and
decadent
with
pronounced
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
balanced
out
with
light
oak
from
the
bourbon
barrels
so
smooth
incredible
mouthfeel
a
bit
boozy
but
i
fully
expect
that
to
balance
out
with
a
bit
of
bottle
aging
as
good
as
scotch
ale
gets
simply
amazing
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
one
is
awesome
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
yet
im
still
trying
to
comprehend
all
of
the
wonderful
flavors
present
in
the
taste
the
balance
and
the
craft
of
this
brew
are
beyond
superb
perhaps
a
top
5
beer
of
all
time
despite
the
warnings
to
only
drink
this
at
room
temp
i
found
it
to
be
delightful
cold
as
well
the
carbonation
hits
the
tongue
and
immediately
fades
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
then
theres
the
bourbon
the
delicious
perfectly
accented
bourbon
its
how
bourbon
and
beer
were
supposed
to
taste
together
perfection
o
this
is
an
outstanding
style
and
something
that
can
be
saved
for
when
you
feel
you
deserve
a
treat
cant
wait
to
sit
on
a
few
six
packs
for
a
few
years
o
awesome
beer
i
cant
wait
to
drink
one
of
these
is
6
months
too
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
so
soughtafter
the
vanilla
toffee
caramel
and
oak
just
blend
so
perfectly
with
the
bourbon
to
create
such
an
excellent
beer
i
could
deal
with
a
little
less
bourbon
in
the
taste
i
now
understand
why
people
cellar
this
stuff
but
that
is
really
its
only
flaw
now
excuse
me
why
i
go
pick
up
more
o
worth
my
wait
and
interest
should
probably
get
more
before
its
gone
4150
bourbon
notes
right
off
the
pour
a
sweet
caramelchocolate
taste
thats
not
too
strong
and
very
pleasant
really
smooth
an
easy
drinker
and
one
that
packs
in
the
alcohol
without
harshness
great
relaxation
beer
o
just
awesome
everything
about
this
is
what
i
remember
from
prior
years
kudos
to
founders
for
upping
production
apparently
without
quality
slipping
hands
down
one
of
my
top
5
beers
ever
very
disappointed
with
this
one
should
have
been
labeled
bourbon
bastard
because
that
is
what
dominated
this
beer
the
smell
reminds
you
of
bourbon
and
the
taste
profile
is
that
of
a
watery
bourbon
o
a
potent
brew
shouldve
been
called
backwoods
moonshine
soso
looks
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
an
impressive
blend
of
bourbon
wood
caramel
malt
and
fruitiness
seriously
boozy
enjoyable
but
a
tad
harsh
on
the
palate
nice
body
could
be
livelier
a
good
beer
but
i
reckon
the
malt
is
overshadowed
and
the
bourbon
character
could
be
dialled
back
a
bit
for
balance
a
good
demonstration
of
why
stouts
endure
bourbonbarrel
aging
better
nonetheless
a
worthy
beer
that
deserves
to
be
sampled
as
smooth
and
drinkable
a
bourbon
barrel
ive
ever
had
perfect
for
the
onebeer
sipping
night
o
this
is
a
top
notch
ba
wee
heavy
its
very
soft
carbonation
and
smooth
vanilla
taste
this
is
a
home
run
you
want
to
keep
drinking
this
one
after
another
amazing
scotch
ale
tried
in
akron
oh
great
bourbon
flavor
but
doesnt
overpower
this
is
an
extremely
rare
and
hard
to
come
by
beer
do
what
you
can
to
get
hold
of
it
and
then
be
amazed
a
fine
almost
liquer
like
flavor
founders
bourbon
barrel
beers
are
a
high
art
form
it
would
be
between
this
and
old
curmudgeons
better
half
for
honors
of
the
brewerys
best
product
on
tap
at
the
kbs
release
had
this
at
the
same
time
as
a
kbs
but
still
enjoyed
it
very
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
oak
good
whiskey
touch
definitely
a
beer
i
would
try
again
dark
brown
sweet
smelling
with
almost
no
foam
the
taste
is
a
revelation
and
surprising
amazing
beer
had
waited
a
long
time
to
try
and
was
worth
the
wait
alcohol
hidden
and
bourbon
character
in
the
back
overall
quite
the
total
package
a
quality
truetostyle
wee
heavy
with
the
lovely
addition
of
the
barrel
aging
pick
this
one
up
in
the
coming
months
overall
this
is
fantastic
i
love
what
a
few
years
have
done
to
this
one
bourbon
has
died
down
considerably
from
when
it
is
fresh
which
has
balanced
it
much
more
and
made
it
a
bit
more
drinkable
fantastic
mouth
feel
medium
body
with
a
smooth
finish
definitely
not
as
heavy
as
other
beers
in
this
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
feel
like
the
hype
kind
of
ruined
the
experience
for
me
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
standout
in
its
style
but
it
is
a
bit
more
unique
than
others
because
of
the
emphasis
of
the
vanilla
taste
overall
a
great
beer
compared
to
kbs
i
would
give
4
of
this
to
1
kbs
however
i
feel
this
is
a
more
complex
beer
i
am
unsure
as
to
how
this
directly
compares
with
fresh
vs
aged
even
though
ive
had
both
yet
still
great
t
tons
of
rich
maltiness
right
off
the
bat
with
a
lot
of
caramel
oak
molasses
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
finish
brings
some
heavy
oak
and
some
light
cinnamon
and
charred
wood
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
gives
the
sweeter
caramel
flavors
a
bit
of
a
buttery
feel
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
way
up
there
on
my
list
of
scotch
ales
o
real
decent
scotch
ale
not
the
best
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
but
it
is
defiantly
one
that
i
will
pick
up
year
after
year
age
this
beer
trust
me
so
good
bringing
this
rating
down
slightly
from
4
75
it
remains
an
outstanding
beer
however
the
2013
production
was
a
bit
smoother
2014
is
definitely
boozier
i
actually
preferred
the
halfbaked
version
lil
saplin
that
was
out
in
september
pours
out
a
burnt
caramel
with
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
for
a
head
barrel
is
overwhelming
in
the
nose
oak
vanilla
char
flavor
is
a
good
marriage
of
the
base
beer
and
the
barrel
aging
the
bourbon
notes
tone
down
the
overbearing
esters
of
dirty
bastard
toasty
caramel
malts
work
very
well
with
the
oaky
vanilla
tones
finishes
sweet
aftertaste
has
a
lingering
dried
fruit
bourbon
thing
going
on
mouthfeel
is
chewy
thick
and
smooth
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
but
this
is
a
solid
example
of
when
it
goes
right
i
dont
even
care
much
for
the
base
beer
so
im
surprised
at
how
the
barrel
improved
the
original
product
whereas
normally
i
see
it
as
detracting
from
the
base
product
o
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
it
has
some
age
on
it
so
the
flavors
blend
very
well
together
and
it
isnt
the
least
bit
harsh
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
final
word
highly
recommended
everything
about
this
beer
is
complex
and
engaging
while
being
simultaneously
approachable
and
easy
to
drink
there
are
many
flavors
and
aromas
to
enjoy
so
practically
any
beer
drinker
will
find
something
to
their
liking
other
beers
contain
these
same
flavors
but
this
beer
presents
them
fully
completely
and
in
such
good
balance
that
it
is
worth
seeking
out
above
other
barrel
aged
beers
o
an
excellent
example
of
using
barrel
aging
to
develop
complexity
and
create
an
ale
that
stands
up
well
as
an
aperitif
the
fruits
leather
vanilla
wood
and
dankness
all
suggest
to
me
a
mix
of
old
world
pleasures
overall
hmm
not
crazy
about
this
beer
i
just
dont
think
a
wee
heavy
has
enough
strong
flavor
and
complexity
to
withstand
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
process
at
least
for
me
too
much
prominent
bourbon
influence
for
me
to
truly
enjoy
o
an
outstanding
brew
this
brew
manages
to
master
the
fine
line
between
one
dimensional
overload
and
balance
in
an
array
of
flavours
superb
the
beer
has
this
beautiful
play
of
sweetness
dark
fruit
and
then
the
woody
bitterness
and
barrel
character
on
the
end
full
bodied
and
creamy
o
one
of
my
favourite
beers
it
is
amazing
overall
an
amazing
solid
beer
from
founders
what
isnt
get
it
drink
it
and
enjoy
overall
an
incredible
beer
overall
great
a
nicely
balanced
aged
scottish
ale
many
complex
flavors
and
aromas
well
balanced
and
great
a
room

very
nice

good
amount
of
sediment
in
the

appearance
is
dark
reddish
brown
cold
outta
the
fridge
nose
is
sweet
bourbony
with
some
pungent
notes
sweetness
is
muted
mainly
noticeable
up

on

get
some
puckering
bitterness
toward
the

booze
is
noticeable
with
a
lingering
sweetness
in
the

half
an
hour
later
and
25
degrees
warmer
its
like
a
different
beer
the
sweetness
dominates
with
bitterness
still
there
but
taking
a
back
seat
i
know
that
most
beers
change
character
as
they
warm
but
this
one
takes
it
to
an
extreme
barely
enjoyable
cold
it
becomes
a
real
treat
as
it
approaches
room
temp
o
pretty
good
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
so
my
review
is
a
bit
skewed
its
very
good
for
an
aged
brown
but
my
lower
mark
is
due
to
my
preference
the
reason
i
dont
love
it
is
that
the
base
flavor
isnt
really
noteworthy
pretty
good
but
not
great

the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
with
light
hints
of
scarlett
and
a
subtle
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
caramel
vanilla
sweetness
wrapped
in
a
bourbon
blanket
i
wanted
to
dip
my
entire
face
in
my
glass
but
i
resisted
the
temptation
the
bourbon
was
upfront
but
not
overly
dominant
just
the
right
touch
it
lended
a
smoky
vanilla
tone
to
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
of
the
beer
that
just
glided
along
my
palate
the
backwood
bastard
had
enough
heft
in
the
body
and
light
carbonation
to
hold
up
to
the
heavy
flavors
in
this
enticing
elixir
this
was
a
truly
phenomenal
bourbon
barrel
aged
brew
and
a
real
treat
from
founders
o
right
up
there
with
kbs
the
barrelaging
process
brings
a
new
layer
of
depth
founders
heavy
scottish
ale
which
can
be
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
i
find
that
at
first
this
beer
can
have
quite
bite
from
the
alcohol
but
after
6
months
to
a
year
in
the
cellar
it
mellows
out
to
be
just
about
perfect
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
my
first
time
having
this
from
founders
and
its
well
worth
it
the
oak
and
only
slightly
bitter
make
it
a
win
for
me
it
has
a
10
2
abv
so
sip
it
slow
but
this
one
has
a
way
of
creeping
up
on
ya
good
job
founders
o
not
much
of
a
wee
heavy
fan
and
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
but
after
having
it
on
tap
and
again
in
the
bottle
its
really
grown
on
me
smell
is
fantastic
and
taste
and
mouthfeel
work
together
for
a
great
drinking
experience
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
higher
deep
muddy
brown
true
to
form
headless
bourbon
and
oak
in
spades
on
the
nose
vanilla
notes
breaking
through
the
bourbon
vanilla
dominates
the
front
of
the
tongue
warming
feel
on
the
mid
and
nice
slap
of
the
bourbon
on
the
back
end
smooth
mouthfeel
with
long
lingering
presence
of
the
barrel
this
is
excellent
even
better
as
it
is
a
rare
treat
for
me
probably
not
an
everyday
drinker
if
i
had
the
choice
but
excellent
for
a
special
occasion
finish
carbonation
sticks
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
while
the
oil
coats
my
tongue
and
lips
the
oil
leaves
some
alcohol
and
sweet
so
i
would
definitely
grab
this
again
given
the
chance
o
cant
say
anything
asides
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
pretty
great
built
beer
by
an
even
better
brewery
would
enjoy
to
see
more
experiments
with
this
base
for
a
beer
truly
wonderful
beer
bourbon
and
caramel
dominates
the
nose
and
taste
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
light
carbonation
rich
buttery
mouthfeel
so
smooth
and
delicious
but
this
beer
is
all
about
the
taste
perfect
blend
of
scotch
ale
and
bourbon
flavors
one
of
my
very
favorite
beers
absolutely
delicious
had
it
for
lunch
and
loved
the
smooth
drinking
caramel
taste
and
smell
im
not
the
most
well
rounded
beer
drinker
but
i
will
certainly
be
having
this
one
again
with
a
thick
juicy
burger
complements
a
savory
meal
perfectly
with
its
semiheavy
sweet
and
very
drinkable
qualities
brilliant
work
founders
warming
sipping
beer
almost
like
a
scotch
very
smooth
with
low
carbonation
overall
outstanding
beer
that
youll
be
sad
when
its
gone
founders
did
it
again
overall
this
was
exceeded
my
expectations
so
complex
and
tasty
i
didnt
want
to
stop
drinking
it
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
overall
while
scotch
ales
are
not
my
favourite
style
this
is
easily
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
to
date
glad
i
picked
up
4
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
more
eventually
overall
this
was
fun
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
dark
ruby
color
thin
white
head
around
the
rim
strong
aroma
of
vanilla
caramel
and
bourbon
predominate
intense
favors
which
all
work
together
into
a
very
complex
taste
that
follows
the
nose
quite
a
bit
of
heat
fom
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
my
favorite
parts
of
this
beer
very
creamy
rich
and
buttery
overall
a
fantastic
sipper
rich
in
complex
flavors
as
a
lover
of
great
single
malt
whisky
and
a
good
bourbon
i
naturally
fall
as
a
rock
for
this
its
heaven
on
earth
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
to
one
finger
of
creamy
khaki
head
that
falls
quickly
to
a
thin
collar
and
leaves
minimal
lace
the
nose
is
dominated
by
the
barrel
lots
of
vanilla
oak
bourbon
and
alcohol
but
there
is
still
a
big
malt
character
with
big
ripe
fruit
prunes
raisins
the
taste
is
very
similar
and
starts
off
dominated
by
the
grain
bill
highlighting
swet
rich
malt
and
lots
of
luscious
dried
fruit
figs
prunes
and
raisins
the
barrel
warms
the
palate
and
delivers
lots
of
warm
bourbon
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
oak
as
well
as
brown
sugar
and
molasses
the
body
is
full
creamy
and
rich
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
pull
it
all
together
that
is
a
really
great
beer
big
thick
sweet
molasses
syrupy
little
bit
of
hops
could
use
some
sitting
thick
and
warming
overall
doesnt
remind
me
too
much
of
the
dirty
bastard
in
my
opinion
much
better
balanced
just
another
example
of
founders
ability
to
make
big
smooth
beers
postscript
if
you
can
please
pair
this
with
some
samoa
cookies
youll
thank
me
afterwards
overall
despite
being
an
older
bottle
this
is
still
drinking
very
nicely
the
barrel
shines
with
excellent
notes
of
bourbon
and
toasted
oak
the
base
beer
itself
is
starting
to
taste
like
an
aged
american
barleywine
highly
recommend
fresh
or
with
some
time
on
it
o
a
very
good
version
of
a
scotch
ale
highly
recommended
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
complex
a
nice
treat
on
this
snowy
day
ogreat
tasting
beer
all
time
favorite
good
balance
of
style
with
the
barrel
aging
not
much
alcohol
burn
given
the
abv
great
sipper
on
a
cold
day
overall
another
great
example
of
the
quality
brewers
setting
up
shop
in
my
homestate
founders
is
world
class
and
although
i
wouldnt
call
this
beer
world
class
its
an
example
of
the
innovation
and
quality
theyre
known
for
honestly
if
they
toned
down
the
bourbon
just
every
so
slightly
id
be
singing
its
praises
even
more
than
i
already
am
overall
it
would
appear
that
ive
given
this
beer
a
perfect
score
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
reviews
but
this
is
one
of
only
two
so
far
that
has
gotten
such
a
rating
from
me
i
dunno
for
me
most
beers
fall
behind
in
either
mouth
feel
or
appearance
but
this
one
is
quite
simply
perfect
all
around
i
cut
myself
off
once
id
purchased
16
bottles
i
have
3
left
and
i
feel
like
i
made
a
grave
mistake
buying
as
few
as
i
did
this
beer
is
an
utter
masterpiece
as
the
beer
warms
there
are
additional
notes
of
spice
that
were
likely
imparted
from
the
barrel
giving
the
beer
additional
depth
and
complexity
im
very
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
unique
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
barrel
aging
this
is
one
seeking
but
dont
expect
any
sort
of
wee
heavy
o
i
love
backwoods
bastard
and
its
one
of
my
highlights
beer
wise
every
late
fall
its
a
simply
stunning
bourbon
barrel
giant
and
a
true
as
good
as
it
gets
type
creation
the
definition
of
perfection
with
a
nice
big
wee
heavy
and
bourbon
barrel
brilliance
a
winter
warmer
for
those
cold
cold
days
overall
a
very
good
bb
aged
scotch
ale
but
ive
had
better
st
arnold
bishopss
barrel
5
trumps
this
one
big
time
o
it
is
a
very
warming
beer
and
certainly
a
great
sipper
much
like
scotch
is
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
well
crafted
beer
do
not
let
the
styles
name
deter
you
from
drinking
this
beer
even
if
you
dont
like
scotch
you
will
certainly
enjoy
this
beer
overall
an
amazing
brew
so
many
interesting
characteristics
in
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
happy
to
have
been
able
to
grab
a
growler
fill
of
this
o
unrealistically
amazing
founders
has
produced
a
world
class
ba
scotch
ale
thank
you
founders
for
this
creation
and
much
love
for
distributing
to
wi
too
bad
i
can
not
enjoy
one
of
these
daily
happy
holidays
ba
o
backwoods
bastard
may
have
a
rough
grizzly
exterior
but
its
a
gooey
softontheinside
sipping
dessert
beer
thats
seeping
with
malty
sweetness
reminiscent
of
milano
cookies
and
homemade
bourbon
balls
its
moderate
barrelaging
makes
it
great
fresh
but
also
allows
it
to
age
gracefully
for
a
beer
that
develops
for
years
to
come
othis
beer
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
across
the
board
big
but
not
overpowering
its
complex
without
being
overdone
sticks
to
the
guns
of
a
good
classic
scotch
aleweeheavy
but
brining
a
good
modern
twist
with
the
oak
barrel
aging
lets
see
this
bad
boy
aged
in
an
islay
scotch
barrel
with
a
heaping
dose
of
smoke
and
salt
water
sounds
like
heaven
on
earth
to
me
o
very
good
scotch
ale
great
tasting
and
smooth
founders
does
it
again
o
love
the
smell
of
this
and
wish
i
liked
it
more
than
i
did
but
im
not
a
regular
drinker
of
heavy
liquor
this
is
a
very
high
quality
beer
and
even
though
im
not
a
bourbonguy
its
obvious
that
this
is
done
well
more
personal
taste
than
anything
overall
very
nice
wish
they
didnt
run
out
here
but
happy
i
got
to
review
it
o
one
of
the
best
there
is
as
always
backwoods
delivers
i
like
it
with
about
a
year
to
a
year
and
a
half
on
it
but
still
amazing
fresh
i
will
always
seek
this
beer
out
and
grab
a
case
or
two
its
that
good
o
its
obvious
why
people
look
forward
to
this
release
every
year
i
should
have
bought
more
maybe
theres
still
some
laying
around
would
love
to
start
a
vertical
of
this
beer
tasty
wellbalanced
offering
from
founders
was
just
gonna
go
to
bed
but
after
walking
the
dogs
off
the
lead
only
for
the
bitch
to
go
walkabout
on
me
an
hour
later
after
i
return
with
the
bitch
in
tow
and
after
thinking
the
worst
only
to
return
achieved
instead
of
finishing
with
a
cool
drink
im
drinking
a
beer
for
the
moment
name
appropriate
and
after
visiting
the
backwoods
to
find
that
bitch
man
its
appropriate
and
pours
a
dirty
dark
ass
brown
hue
with
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
and
a
rim
of
lacing
along
with
sporadic
clingersthe
smell
is
strong
bourbon
along
with
feint
oak
and
an
undercoat
of
sticky
toffeethe
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
above
moderation
and
could
use
a
little
work
but
the
tastes
are
a
happy
medium
oaked
bourbon
and
sticky
chewy
caramel
and
finished
with
a
dried
fruit
booziness
but
no
boozy
heat
which
is
good
and
im
always
surprised
at
the
abv
when
drinking
this
and
looking
at
it
as
its
hidden
so
well
and
overall
the
hype
is
right
on
the
money
for
once
this
is
definately
something
i
could
get
used
to
being
on
our
shores
shelves
as
an
option
as
its
tasty
and
nicely
priced
overall
one
of
my
favorites
from
these
guys
i
might
say
i
enjoy
it
more
than
kbs
i
get
more
bourbon
out
of
it
and
it
ages
better
imo
the
bourbon
stays
intact
the
body
is
modfull
to
full
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
but
great
complexity
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
should
be
shared
overall
a
very
tasty
offering
from
founders
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
from
them
grab
some
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
a
little
too
thin
and
bourbon
forward
but
still
decent
might
rather
just
have
a
classic
dirty
bastard
the
barrel
doesnt
seem
to
do
much
for
this
one
unlike
kbs
which
i
think
is
excellent
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
somewhat
foamy
12
and
smooth
12
mouthfeel
thats
a
bit
light
and
even
slightly
watery
for
the
style
ethanol
easily
felt
in
the
nostrils
as
heat
and
as
burning
on
the
throat
and
tongue
closes
dryly
with
heavy
stickiness
clinging
to
the
lips
and
palate
o
this
beer
is
better
than
my
rating
its
appearance
holds
back
the
number
here
but
thats
a
mere
technicality
as
bbas
go
this
ones
done
right
o
this
was
a
good
beer
especially
for
a
bba
wee
heavy
that
you
can
pick
up
off
the
shelf
that
said
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
best
beers
in
that
category
od
this
is
a
pretty
cool
scotch
ale
the
barrel
aging
definitely
shows
but
doesnt
overpower
the
base
which
is
quite
pleasant
a
good
sipper
o
i
was
impressed
you
cant
go
wrong
with
founders
overall
this
is
yet
another
home
run
from
founders
i
love
how
they
have
stellar
beers
all
over
their
lineupsome
in
the
yearround
some
in
the
seasonal
some
in
the
specialty
or
limited
releasesi
could
name
several
that
i
just
love
and
this
one
is
no
different
a
really
tasty
take
on
a
style
that
doesnt
seem
terribly
widespread
amongst
american
brewers
absolute
homerun
of
a
beer
o
as
a
said
i
loved
it
i
want
more
and
i
want
it
at
my
disposal
at
all
hours
sadly
i
heard
that
its
a
seasonal
beer
and
that
breaks
my
heart
i
guess
ill
just
have
to
stock
up
ive
rarely
had
a
beer
that
i
loved
more
than
this
i
love
fullflavored
ales
and
ive
recently
become
a
huge
fan
of
oak
whiskey
barrel
aging
add
that
to
wee
heavy
being
my
favorite
variety
of
beer
and
this
is
second
only
to
one
other
beer
ive
tried
st
arnolds
bishops
barrel
5
from
houston
and
then
not
by
much
dark
color
beautiful
full
aromas
of
cocoa
taste
and
finish
were
delightful
the
bourbon
gives
it
an
oaky
caramellike
taste
to
compliment
the
cocoa
and
adds
just
a
slight
burn
that
feels
great
going
down
i
cant
give
this
beer
enough
stars
unfortunately
like
the
st
arnolds
its
a
limited
release
so
i
dont
get
to
enjoy
it
over
and
over
i
would
love
for
a
brewer
to
make
a
beer
like
this
yearround
o
well
after
after
a
long
search
and
pursuit
i
finally
have
this
beer
in
my
cellar
i
think
the
chase
was
worth
it
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
either
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
in
this
case
it
is
hit
it
is
well
done
and
the
bourbon
really
makes
this
beer
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
well
deserved
reputation
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
highly
recommended
sweet
rich
and
deep
dark
in
color
backwoods
bastard
almost
makes
raul
blush
almost
overall
outstanding
sneaky
and
drinkable
despite
high
abv
very
very
drinkable
o
several
cuts
above
the
dirty
bastard
and
easily
one
of
the
top
5
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
probably
the
best
bourbonbarrel
aged
beer
that
ive
tried
and
much
better
than
its
base
beer
4
5
d
this
is
delicious
and
alarmingly
drinkable
with
the
oak
bourbon
barrel
qualities
well
balanced
and
very
complimentary
to
the
other
flavours
in
this
will
certainly
be
picking
up
more
of
this
this
is
a
well
crafted
barrelaged
beer
that
does
not
end
up
tasting
harsh
or
cidery
the
craftsmanship
in
the
creation
of
this
offering
is
evident
o
nice
beer
well
balanced
in
flavour
and
booze
the
bourbon
is
a
tad
strong
but
this
is
a
hard
thing
to
control
and
does
bring
an
otherwise
nice
characteristic
to
balance
the
toffee
sweetness
not
extremely
classic
as
with
any
aging
but
is
certainly
up
there
for
this
style
the
beer
really
comes
alive
with
a
bit
of
time
in
the
glass
breathing
and
warming
up
which
seems
to
smooth
over
the
booze
a
bit
wont
be
minding
that
i
picked
up
a
4
of
this
one
this
winter
o
admittedly
im
not
a
big
fan
of
scotch
but
i
can
appreciate
it
to
a
certain
degree
in
beer
unfortunately
its
way
too
overpowering
in
this
brew
i
prefer
my
beers
to
have
their
own
flavours
and
not
simply
be
barrel
leaches
ill
give
this
another
go
in
a
few
months
probably
but
will
probably
try
to
trade
the
other
two
away
wow
im
really
having
a
hard
time
describing
everything
going
on
in
this
beer
other
than
awesome
i
absolutely
did
not
expect
this
beer
to
live
up
to
the
hype
i
was
absolutely
wrong
o
4
75
this
is
a
great
beer
its
definitely
unique
id
love
to
put
it
next
to
the
other
wee
heavys
because
i
think
it
would
stand
out
glad
i
could
score
this
guy
at
tw
in
wpb
florida
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
not
much
retention
but
a
good
lace
aroma
is
of
carmel
malts
brown
sugar
whiskey
and
dark
fruits
body
is
thick
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
whiskey
up
front
with
dark
fruits
and
malts
through
out
nice
rich
finish
excellent
brew
that
warms
you
up
quick
overall
pretty
good
but
not
entirely
my
kind
of
beer
so
im
glad
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
i
expected
some
booziness
but
there
was
none
even
with
aging
in
bourbon
barrels
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
overall
really
quite
good
i
am
not
much
of
a
scotch
ale
fan
and
there
are
some
elements
of
this
beer
that
i
dont
love
but
as
a
whole
package
it
is
really
good
well
done
this
is
a
really
exceptional
beer
front
of
the
mouth
you
get
vanilla
and
coconut
with
a
little
bit
of
rye
very
soft
mouthfeel
incredible
aftertaste
a
tad
bit
of
bitterafter
taste
50
ibus
but
really
a
lot
going
on
for
this
one
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
anyone
who
doesnt
like
this
type
has
no
place
in
drinking
craft
beers
no
lie
i
grew
a
full
beard
instantly
while
drinking
this
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
slight
purple
or
dark
brown
depending
on
how
the
light
hits
it
an
off
white
creamy
head
thats
about
half
a
finger
that
dies
dow
quickly
slight
to
almost
no
carbonation
and
the
smell
is
of
caramel
oak
toasted
almonds
vanilla
and
warm
breadwhere
are
those
50
ibus
taste
is
caramel
and
oak
up
front
followed
light
berries
and
a
vanilla
sugar
finish
and
finally
that
delayed
hop
coating
the
mouthful
is
huge
slightly
lighter
than
a
stout
on
par
with
a
barley
wine
the
alcohol
to
me
is
very
minimal
in
this
one
especially
for
the
10
abv
the
only
time
present
to
me
was
in
delayed
drinks
when
i
could
feel
my
tongue
soaking
it
in
well
balanced
great
example
of
the
style
overall
fairly
complex
delicious
rich
malty
sweet
with
flavors
mixing
well
update

had
another
and
was
struck
by
how
much
this
tastes
like
a
heavierbodied
innis
gunn
scottish
porter
which
i
just
had
a
few
nights
ago
and
which
is
also
aged
in
liquor
barrels
i
must
admit
much
as
i
love
ig
i
liked
this
better
because
of
the
more
substantial
body
and
slightly
better
maltwhiskey
flavor
balance
i
like
a
hefty
mouthfeel
and
backwoods
bastard
is
hard
to
beat
of
course
it
also
tops
the
abv
of
innis
gunn
by
about
3
a
very
good
and
very
indulgent
beer
i
definitely
think
its
worth
the
cost
per
four
pack
however
i
dont
think
its
worth
aging
because
the
bourbon
notes
tend
to
get
lost
over
time
had
this
one
stashed
in
the
fridge
from
last
year
i
poured
it
and
it
has
a
black
color
body
with
just
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
very
strong
bourbon
the
taste
has
a
strong
bourbon
presence
with
a
nice
maltyness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
the
bourbon
lingers
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
damm
good
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
some
to
age
was
very
disappointed
with
this
after
looking
at
the
reviews
i
hope
it
was
a
bad
bottle
and
the
other
three
are
better
the
watered
down
whiskey
and
coke
flavor
is
lingering
founders
has
given
me
another
reason
to
consider
them
one
of
the
best
breweries
out
there
decided
to
get
grab
a
4
pack
of
this
the
temperatures
have
dipped
down
into
the
teens
here
in
chicago
so
i
thought
it
would
work
well
for
the
season
i
typically
dont
go
for
this
style
but
i
was
intrigued
after
having
a
nice
bourbon
aged
ale
last
weekend
during
the
holiday
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
quality
of
balance
in
the
beer
and
the
lovely
hidden
alcohol
it
definitely
blooms
while
it
warms
and
everything
about
the
beer
becomes
a
bit
more
pronounced
the
smell
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
specifically
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
molasses
raisin
vanilla
and
finally
a
kick
of
the
bourbon
on
the
tail
end
that
is
not
overly
aggressive
like
some
of
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
ales
out
there
im
gonna
hang
on
to
two
of
these
and
see
how
they
age
thats
if
i
can
hold
off
from
drinking
them
o
very
impressed
with
this
brew
the
barrel
aging
does
wonders
for
the
beer
as
i
dont
really
care
for
dirty
bastard
but
this
is
great
cant
wait
to
see
how
my
other
three
bottles
change
over
the
course
of
the
next
year
if
i
had
a
complaint
about
this
beer
it
would
be
that
it
should
be
slightly
more
carbonated
let
the
aroma
fill
the
room
pours
an
almost
opaque
black
with
a
thin
chocolate
head
a
steady
ring
of
lace
lines
the
outside
of
the
glass
and
leaves
its
sticky
presence
with
each
sip
strong
bourbon
vanilla
oak
and
slight
hints
of
chocolate
highlight
the
aromas
the
taste
is
right
in
line
with
the
smell
my
palate
is
met
with
a
mild
upfront
bourbon
flavor
then
catches
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
middle
that
finishes
with
a
nice
boozy
burn
light
carbonation
with
a
warm
mouthful
from
the
bourbon
makes
this
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
a
great
complex
barrelaged
offering
from
founders
the
accessibility
cost
and
overall
complexity
make
this
one
of
my
favorites
from
founders
this
ranks
up
there
with
kbs
minus
all
of
the
hype
o
an
awesome
beer
this
is
such
a
well
balanced
beer
with
the
flavors
blending
seemlessly
i
will
have
to
save
a
few
of
these
for
the
colder
months
o
this
is
my
absolute
favorite
vintage
of
this
beer
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
once
again
will
be
tough
to
save
a
few
bottles
for
the
holidays
overall
this
is
a
complex
and
well
crafted
beer
i
absolutely
love
everything
about
this
one
and
will
revisit
an
aged
bottle
this
time
next
year
o
this
beer
was
solid
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
as
it
seemed
a
better
syrup
then
scotch
ale
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
will
likely
by
yearly
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
very
dark
brown
color
small
head
with
moderate
lacing
the
smell
is
pure
bourbon
im
getting
a
lot
of
oak
and
vanilla
i
can
also
detect
some
of
the
booziness
in
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
the
bourbon
notes
shining
through
at
the
beginning
but
the
scotch
ale
comes
through
after
the
bourbon
fades
i
think
the
two
sets
of
flavors
are
really
wellbalanced
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
for
the
abv
this
is
pretty
drinkable
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
great
barrelaged
offering
from
founders
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
tints
that
has
a
very
nice
head
and
lingering
lacing
nose
is
of
bourbon
against
a
molasses
dark
malt
and
chocolate
background
carbonation
is
average
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
i
was
expecting
a
full
medium
body
but
the
lightness
helps
bring
the
bourbon
flavor
forward
the
10
2
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
very
well
balanced
beer
bourbon
against
the
molasses
and
dark
malt
backbone
is
the
taste
profile
finishes
with
bourbon
and
malt
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
oak
and
a
nice
alcohol
burn
that
lingers
along
with
the
oak
another
outstanding
founders
offering
that
takes
old
ale
brewing
to
a
new
level
o
overshadowed
by
other
barrel
aged
beers
from
founders
i
find
bwb
easily
available
and
this
year
incredibly
inexpensive
at
12
a
four
pack
malt
heads
dream
bourbon
is
spot
on
and
drinkable
now
no
need
to
tame
this
one
down
very
difficult
to
get
around
here
but
yet
thru
tenuous
searching
was
able
to
score
a
few
4
pks
definitely
worth
the
hunt
down
and
reminds
me
every
year
that
thanksgiving
is
around
the
corner
very
similar
to
my
liking
of
central
waters
barrel
aging
fantastic
ba
scotch
ale
notes
founders
what
a
brewery
overall
way
better
than
i
remember
love
this
beer
the
thing
i
love
about
this
beer
is
that
the
bourbon
is
blended
well
and
isnt
boozy
or
overpowering
the
other
flavors
they
just
mix
together
perfectly
amazing
beer
and
my
favorite
scotch
ale
now
had
to
go
back
and
get
a
4
pack
o
an
absolute
surprise
possibly
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
a
bit
rough
at
times
but
i
can
see
this
beer
approaching
perfection
with
some
age
o
fantastic
flavor
still
quite
boozy
but
much
better
balanced
from
fresh
2012
bwb
the
sweetness
is
absolutely
fantastic
and
holds
up
to
the
booze
reasonably
well
just
too
much
bourbon
for
me
i
prefer
a
lighter
bourbon
touch
to
my
beer
as
the
prolonged
aging
in
the
barrel
adds
to
the
vanilla
sweetness
so
prevalent
in
oak
plus
dirty
bastard
is
already
malty
and
sticky
sweet
the
feel
is
so
mellow
smooth
and
it
has
a
silky
thickness
it
holds
almost
no
carbonation
and
the
high
abv
is
lost
but
a
slight
spike
at
the
rear
of
the
throat
overall
a
heavy
hitter
on
the
abv
that
surprisingly
mellows
as
it
warms
with
nice
bourbon
and
oak
notes
that
are
agressive
but
not
too
much
and
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
without
a
thick
stickiness
would
think
about
one
year
in
the
basement
would
smooth
it
out
a
bit
really
good
bourbon
barrel
style
old
ale
that
i
will
buy
more
of
in
the
future
thanks
founders
fantastic
example
of
the
style
i
really
enjoy
the
dirty
bastard
so
this
is
jut
that
one
step
better
after
being
in
the
barrels
everything
about
it
just
sits
right
with
me
from
the
color
to
the
finish
if
you
are
a
fan
of
wee
heavys
this
is
a
must
o
other
than
mouthfeel
a
solid
beer
this
beer
is
simply
amazing
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
hues
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
very
nice
38
inch
head
which
brought
out
the
smell
the
smell
is
of
sweet
bourbon
with
an
oakey
hint
tastes
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
bark
roasted
bourbon
flavor
the
mothfeel
was
very
smooth
even
with
the
higher
abv
overall
this
beer
is
great
o
i
would
love
to
compare
this
to
a
nonbarred
aged
version
but
as
it
is
its
quite
pleasant
deep
chestnut
brown
color
you
can
see
some
sediment
floating
within
the
body
of
the
beer
the
head
is
minimal
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
bourbon
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
fig
and
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
thicksticky
and
with
a
lingering
warmth
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
all
malt
but
that
malt
is
buried
within
the
bourbon
much
more
depth
emerges
in
the
flavor
as
it
warms
a
wonderful
barrel
aged
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
point
greatest
thing
ever
one
of
them
pours
a
lovely
translucent
coppery
color
with
a
thin
eggshell
head
very
bourbon
forward
smell
hits
you
hard
as
one
that
generally
doesnt
like
bourbon
it
was
a
bit
offputting
but
not
enough
to
want
to
put
it
down
the
taste
amazing
bourbon
is
definitely
there
but
not
even
half
as
strong
as
it
is
in
the
nose
bit
of
a
twang
but
in
a
good
way
hints
of
a
bitter
vanillaburnt
caramel
silky
mouthfeel
warms
nicely
as
it
fills
and
goes
down
overall
a
great
balance
and
really
quite
lovely
and
this
is
coming
from
one
that
thought
they
didnt
even
like
scotch
ales
very
nice
overall
i
have
had
this
one
in
the
past
and
not
only
did
this
beer
get
me
into
barrel
aged
beers
but
it
also
got
me
into
bourbon
the
barrel
aging
makes
a
huge
impression
on
this
one
and
its
not
for
those
that
steer
clear
of
that
type
of
thing
for
those
that
like
that
though
this
is
one
of
the
best
ba
beers
out
there
o
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
most
cost
effective
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
ive
encountered
scotch
ales
are
my
favorite
style
and
dirty
bastard
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
this
just
amplifies
all
that
beers
greatness
by
adding
the
oak
and
vanilla
from
the
barrel
o
i
love
scotch
ales
a
lot
as
has
already
been
said
the
style
really
does
lend
itself
to
this
type
of
aging
strong
but
not
an
alltimer
by
any
means
cheers
update
drank
a
bottle
bottled
on
92311
so
more
than
2yrs
old
bit
more
watery
still
create
flavors
but
the
mouthfeel
is
falling
off
pretty
good
over
all
wish
i
had
more
pours
a
hazy
ruby
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
lacing
big
bourbon
notes
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
bourbon
hits
the
palate
right
up
front
with
a
nice
sweet
oaky
finish
light
bodied
with
faint
carbonation
overall
a
bourbon
lovers
delight
well
balanced
and
well
crafted
o
excellent
beer
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
as
previously
stated
its
perfect
for
the
cold
weather
reminds
me
a
bit
of
bois
with
much
higher
drinkability
and
without
the
crazy
alcohol
presence
this
has
nice
big
flavors
but
tastes
very
controlled
and
balanced
like
most
founders
offerings
i
could
drink
this
everyday
overall
unique
this
blows
away
any
wee
heavy
that
i
ve
had
serving
type
bottle
o
probably
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
warms
you
up
but
the
alcohol
isnt
very
obvious
highly
recommended
founders
backwoods
bastard
45
if
you
can
find
this
beer
buy
it
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
i
have
tasted
my
wife
says
it
reminds
her
strikingly
of
tyranena
dirty
old
man
which
was
a
barrelaged
imperial
porter
i
agree
o
very
enjoyable
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
cold
winter
night
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
thin
light
brown
colored
head
spotty
lace
down
the
glass
smell
caramelized
sugar
mildly
earthy
leafy
and
boozy
bourbon
yes
not
a
lot
from
the
oak
taste
caramelized
pear
dates
earthy
with
notes
of
bourbon
vanilla
and
baking
spices
sugary
candied
fruit
finish
we
werent
going
to
buy
this
after
trying
a
2012
at
a
local
pub
which
left
a
tinny
ok
taste
but
who
knows
how
it
spent
its
last
year
ie
storage
temperature
etc
im
glad
we
gave
2013
a
try
because
its
really
a
treat
in
a
glass
curmudgeon
meets
dirty
bastard
plus
steroids
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
it
has
a
really
really
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
froth
line
around
the
top
the
smell
is
boozy
but
delicious
its
a
beautiful
blend
of
malty
vanilla
with
a
soft
bourbon
base
i
dont
make
a
lot
of
room
on
my
top
shelf
which
is
crowded
with
stouts
but
this
one
is
near
anderson
valleys
bourbon
aged
stout
parabola
and
kbs
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
impressive
alcohol
forward
and
in
your
face
delicious
a
truly
exceptional
scotch
alewee
heavy
founder
brought
the
big
guns
here
o
db
was
one
of
my
favorites
to
this
point
and
bb
has
solidified
itself
as
my
favorite
brew
to
this
point
in
time
would
seek
this
out
year
after
year
thanks
founders
definitely
one
of
the
top
three
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
i
am
not
a
liquor
drinker
however
i
can
most
certainly
taste
and
feel
the
bourbon
from
the
pour
to
my
belly
amazing
balance
of
hops
malts
and
other
flavors
of
which
i
am
unfortunately
not
qualified
to
differentiate
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
am
very
excited
about
this
beer
and
wishing
that
i
have
purchased
more
than
three
four
packs
founders
just
rolled
into
florida
last
month
and
ive
been
blown
away
by
one
beer
after
another
from
them
breakfast
stout
reds
rye
and
their
porter
have
all
been
great
but
this
is
my
favorite
founders
brew
out
of
the
ones
that
ive
tried
and
its
not
close
its
just
a
phenomenal
massive
beer
with
a
ridiculous
flavor
profile
and
great
balance
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
o
truly
one
of
my
favorites
perfectly
balanced
perfectly
boozy
in
my
opinion
one
of
founders
best
right
here
whats
not
to
love
about
this
beer
i
can
babysip
this
beer
for
over
an
hour
and
every
sip
is
better
than
the
last
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
i
want
to
reward
myself
and
quietly
revel
in
my
own
success
it
simply
tastes
like
victory
another
job
well
done
by
founders
overall
great
beer
this
is
the
third
year
in
a
row
i
have
made
a
special
trip
to
buy
it
i
loved
the
2011
batch
2012
was
good
i
am
loving
the
2013
batch
overall
top
tier
ba
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
and
this
delivered
compared
to
ba
barleywines
or
stouts
this
seems
a
lot
more
balanced
fresh
from
the
bottling
date
honestly
im
not
sure
if
aging
this
would
help
much
but
since
i
got
a
4
pack
its
worth
saving
1
for
6
months
and
1
for
a
year
im
thinking
o
not
having
been
able
to
get
my
hands
on
kbs
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
founders
beer
granted
i
lucked
out
in
that
i
only
had
to
pay
12
for
a
4pack
but
hey
id
pay
15
or
whatever
it
should
be
selling
for
its
not
something
i
could
or
would
want
to
drink
every
night
but
it
hit
the
spot
on
a
chilly
vermont
november
evening
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
defiantly
going
to
put
some
of
these
away
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
one
i
look
forward
to
every
year
wonderful
drinks
big
with
an
intense
malt
character
that
is
deep
and
full
o
the
best
bb
wee
heavy
imho
i
have
had
both
wulver
and
cw
bbsa
and
they
come
up
short
to
this
heavy
weight
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
overall
a
little
disappointed
with
the
mouthfeel
but
the
scent
is
fantastic
for
such
a
full
bodied
beer
its
a
shame
that
it
comes
across
as
a
little
watery
the
taste
is
solid
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
good
stuff
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
2013
bottles
if
you
can
get
past
the
overwhelming
booziness
of
this
beer
you
will
likely
be
blown
away
by
the
amazingly
rich
robust
and
complex
flavor
profile
i
cellared
my
bottle
for
a
year
and
thought
that
it
was
far
smoother
than
how
i
remembered
the
glass
that
i
had
ontap
all
in
all
backwoods
bastard
is
a
fantastic
example
of
what
barrel
aging
can
do
to
a
fairly
ordinary
base
beer
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
tiny
head
and
a
little
lacing
smell
is
bourbon
carmel
molasses
butterscotch
and
vanilla
taste
is
bourbon
up
front
with
the
flavors
of
the
nose
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
great
scotch
ale
definitely
worth
seeking
out
total
4550
pours
rubymahogany
with
a
beige
head
aromas
of
light
smoke
vanilla
oak
caramel
and
bourbon
oak
bourbon
vanilla
caramel
light
smoke
and
some
dark
fruits
tastes
of
nutty
caramel
inputs
of
dark
fruits
and
oak
some
chocolate
with
a
finish
of
bourbon
i
would
call
this
a
barley
wine
overall
a
sweet
boozy
heavy
beast
of
a
beer
but
not
quite
a
barleywine
very
tasty
notes
this
is
aged
about
9
months
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
like
coca
cola
with
a
small
head
that
goes
away
very
fast
theres
a
wonderful
bourbon
aroma
emanating
from
the
glass
along
with
molasses
it
kind
of
smells
like
shoofly
pie
theres
some
maltiness
to
back
it
up
but
mostly
bourbon
its
quite
sweet
on
the
toungue
with
more
delicious
bourbon
and
also
a
dryer
oakyness
that
comes
along
afterward
nice
creamy
texture
and
just
a
slight
bitterness
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
founders
and
it
seems
to
mellow
out
slightly
while
holding
up
very
well
after
almost
a
year
in
the
cellar
overall
quite
a
tasty
ba
beer
for
sure
wish
they
made
it
in
bomber
form
to
share
overall
excellent
loved
it
o
awesome
this
is
a
great
beer
fresh
but
man
this
is
drinking
even
better
right
now
overall
another
great
job
by
founders
they
continue
to
amaze
me
beer
after
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
sharp
carbonation
up
front
that
recedes
quickly
very
warming
even
while
still
refrigerator
cold
not
particularly
smooth
sadly
and
slightly
thinner
than
i
might
expect
but
an
extremely
good
beer
glad
i
have
3
left
loved
this
beer
fresh
but
now
that
it
is
pushing
a
year
old
i
think
i
like
it
more
the
bourbon
barrel
is
there
but
its
a
more
blended
and
subdued
flavor
the
heat
is
completely
gone
and
notes
of
vanilla
and
caramel
are
brought
to
the
forefront
o
i
would
have
liked
to
have
to
have
a
bit
more
out
of
the
taste
as
the
nose
was
superb
ba
scotch
ales
are
hard
to
do
and
founders
definitely
pulled
it
off
with
this
one
probably
one
of
my
favorite
founders
brews
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
i
dont
like
big
beers
but
for
those
who
do
this
one
is
excellent
overall
founders
has
been
making
great
beer
for
over
20
years
backwards
bastard
is
an
amazingly
subtle
yet
complex
beer
you
will
find
the
flavor
change
with
each
sip
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
taste
lingers
you
can
drink
this
with
almost
any
rich
food
and
meal
course
from
roasted
garlic
portobello
mushrooms
to
a
mediumrare
rib
eye
or
a
flourless
chocolate
raspberry
cake
but
why
wait
for
the
food
as
my
favorite
late
night
talk
show
host
would
exclaim
this
is
a
beverage
overall
i
cannot
judge
this
on
the
current
or
year
of
backwoods
bastard
because
i
had
one
that
was
2
old
i
would
say
the
one
i
had
was
absolutely
phenomenal
and
if
your
into
scotch
aleswee
heavys
than
definitely
seek
out
an
aged
one
specifically
founders
and
you
will
love
it
as
well
i
am
gonna
buy
a
4
pack
and
age
them
as
well
see
how
they
turn
out
in
a
few
years
o
great
brew
and
really
enjoyable
in
moderation
quite
good
and
i
think
its
awesome
that
founders
chose
to
put
some
truly
great
stuff
ontap
at
the
world
expo
of
beer
overall
excellent
this
beer
has
taken
the
last
6
months
well
smooth
sweet
and
brings
bourbon
heat
still
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
be
picking
up
a
lot
of
the
2013
vintage
and
aging
some
more
of
it
its
almost
up
there
with
cigar
citys
ba
big
sound
its
not
as
complex
but
its
certainly
mellow
despite
packing
a
good
bourbon
bite
4
deep
ruby
red
wityh
a
bit
of
brown
ring
of
eggshell
head
with
little
lace
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
bourbon
oak
and
caramel
vanilla
with
over
ripe
fruit
and
toffee
really
well
intergrated
nose
taste
is
malty
with
lots
of
oak
and
vanilla
flavours
bourbon
caramel
and
toffee
mildly
sweet
oaky
finish
bourbon
and
fruit
aftertaste
lightly
carbonated
medium
full
body
great
stuff
here
really
drinkable
despie
high
abv
something
i
will
be
searching
out
again
o
ive
found
that
while
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
scotch
ales
i
really
like
barrelaged
versions
mainly
because
the
dry
oakiness
of
the
barrel
cuts
the
malt
sweetness
for
the
huge
abv
this
is
a
great
bourbon
barrel
scotch
ale
the
bourbon
aroma
and
flavor
is
there
but
not
so
huge
as
to
completely
take
over
its
a
great
sipper
and
the
nuances
of
the
barrel
along
with
the
base
beer
make
it
enjoyable
especially
as
you
give
it
time
to
warm
another
winner
from
founders
and
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
bad
beer
from
them
yet
or
even
an
average
beer
for
that
matter
overall
not
the
best
beer
i
know
some
people
love
this
but
i
just
couldnt
get
into
it
o
a
good
beer
certainly
complemented
by
the
barrelaging
and
very
drinkable
not
sure
its
worth
the
trouble
to
get
but
enjoyed
good
maybe
excellent
but
not
world
class
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
one
again
verdict
a
massive
improvement
over
dirty
bastard
and
one
of
the
better
bourbon
treated
scottish
ales
on
the
market
nice
complexity
good
balance
and
great
barrel
character
while
remaining
very
quaffable
an
excellent
beer
o
a
great
example
of
this
style
and
one
of
the
sweeter
scotch
ales
out
there
worth
trying
like
many
of
the
founders
offerings
o
very
nice
brew
im
going
to
have
to
savor
the
four
pack
i
managed
to
pick
up
and
go
in
search
of
more
mind
blowing
one
of
two
beers
next
to
breakfast
stout
that
made
me
say
to
myself
holy
shit
55
o
what
a
fantastic
brew
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
ba
scotch
ale
before
but
i
shall
be
seeking
out
others
a
fantastic
beer
maybe
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
had
so
far
this
is
number
97100
of
my
quest
to
complete
the
ba
hall
of
fame
three
more
to
go
this
beer
was
first
tried
by
a
friend
and
i
on
a
chilly
sunday
afternoon
inbetween
two
music
event
that
we
were
attending
it
was
an
excellent
choice
all
around
it
has
and
great
color
and
smell
and
was
served
in
a
sniffer
glass
it
is
a
sipping
beer
that
will
warm
you
right
up
if
you
think
of
a
scotch
ale
aged
in
a
bourbon
barrel
you
will
have
an
idea
about
what
this
beer
tastes
like
if
you
enjoy
their
dirty
bastard
and
you
are
a
fan
of
whiskey
this
is
a
great
beer
oi
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
it
might
be
because
i
dislike
liquor
and
it
strongly
resembled
a
scotch
whisky
i
guess
this
kind
of
beer
is
not
my
style
and
now
i
definitely
know
so
o
i
love
this
beer
i
only
wish
i
could
have
found
more
of
it
founders
did
a
wonderful
job
great
scotch
ale
perhaps
one
of
the
best
nice
blend
of
flavor
without
the
overwhelming
alcohol
flavor
overall
best
scotch
alewee
heavy
ive
had
to
date
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
or
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
its
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
overall
a
good
beer
with
an
excellent
flavor
a
great
beer
barrels
take
the
already
world
class
scotch
ale
to
the
next
level
if
i
lined
this
up
against
most
beers
it
would
win
most
head
to
head
competitions
when
i
compare
it
to
the
cream
of
the
crop
beers
i
have
had
though
it
didnt
quite
rise
to
the
occasion
bourbon
bombshell
the
wee
heavy
malt
style
is
really
what
is
needed
here
to
provide
balance
and
earthy
complexity
to
the
oak
and
bourbon
a
delight
to
try
o
really
nice
beer
big
complex
flavors
lots
of
bourbon
barrel
influence
would
definite
get
more
if
had
the
opportunity
serving
type
bottle
big
thanks
to
hopshopenstein
for
sending
this
my
way
dark
dark
red
color
with
a
minimal
head
the
aroma
on
this
was
just
great
vanilla
bourbon
sugar
wood
great
the
flavor
was
not
nearly
as
good
sort
of
muddled
it
had
hints
of
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
but
i
really
couldnt
get
a
feel
for
the
base
beer
beneath
if
the
flavor
matched
the
aroma
this
would
be
top
notch
one
cannot
simply
enjoy
this
beer
unless
hes
reached
manhood
this
is
indeed
a
mans
beer
o
good
beer
but
not
great
definitely
worth
trying
though
overall
founders
always
does
it
right
no
expections
here
i
cannot
wait
to
periodically
pop
the
other
three
of
these
over
the
next
year
i
think
the
aging
really
matured
this
beer
and
settled
in
many
of
the
flavors
cheers
i
say
if
you
ever
see
this
buy
it
o
this
is
a
delicious
beer
it
has
all
the
key
elements
of
a
good
scotch
ale
with
the
added
bonus
of
bourbon
barrels
furthermore
it
is
extremely
drinkable
especially
for
the
10
2
abv
the
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
is
strong
but
really
quite
pleasant
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
founders
and
may
certainly
be
my
favorite
scotch
ale
i
might
also
add
that
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
this
is
a
pretty
perfect
sipper
if
you
dont
like
a
boozier
beer
then
you
can
avoid
this
one
but
this
is
a
very
balanced
delicious
beer
overall
first
off
im
not
a
big
fan
of
dirty
bastard
but
this
bourbon
aged
version
is
everything
i
want
in
a
sipping
beer
the
flavor
just
keeps
evolving
as
you
drink
it
give
this
beer
to
a
whiskey
drinker
and
watch
their
eyes
open
up
and
explode
strong
bourbon
profile
get
a
pack
if
you
can
get
two
if
you
have
the
money

this
is
the
best
bourbon
aged
i
have
ever
had
it
was
aged
about
18
months
to
perfection
im
in
texas
and
understand
the
founders
has
been
picked
up
here
by
a
distributor
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
amazing
beer
if
anyone
can
recommend
anything
like
this
or
better
i
want
it
bottom
line
if
i
see
it
i
buy
it
o
a
scotch
ale
big
tasty
beer
the
barrel
flavor
is
a
simple
though
imho
it
smells
great
big
vanilla
oak
brown
sugar
molasses
and
a
lot
of
caramel
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
taste
is
similar
but
the
barrel
flavor
gets
a
tad
harsh
and
isnt
quite
as
enjoyable
theres
just
an
almost
astringent
harshness
to
the
beer
still
lots
of
vanilla
dark
sugars
and
oak
perhaps
a
different
batch
or
temperature
would
soften
my
opinion
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
while
its
fairly
thick
it
could
be
even
thicker
deep
amber
brown
in
color
with
a
sudsy
beige
head
interesting
beer
i
just
wish
that
the
barrel
was
a
bit
gentler
on
the
palate
o
this
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
just
bourbon
drenched
toffee
perfection
absolutely
world
class
stuff
overall
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
but
it
feels
just
short
of
something
really
brilliant

an

every

everyone

drank
during

overall
4
0
it
has
some
flaws
in
my
mind
but
nothing
crucialim
just
not
the
biggest
fan
of
most
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
and
while
this
beer
does
very
well
with
the
barrels
i
just
dont
necessarily
like
what
bourbon
barrels
bring
to
a
lot
of
the
beers
aged
in
them
this
however
does
a
good
job
also
its
much
much
better
overall
after
it
warms
up
more
than
a
bit
and
it
becomes
a
very
pleasant
sipper
o
a
really
good
beer
but
whats
new
whenh
it
comes
to
founders
i
think
they
might
have
something
there
pours
deep
amber
brown
with
small
orange
brown
head
smells
of
straight
whiskey
vanilla
smoke
brown
sugar
candy
sweet
malt
butterscotch
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
very
sweet
but
with
some
bite
and
smokiness
to
balance
it
out
alcohol
warmth
and
bourbon
for
sure
with
a
huge
burst
of
vanilla
slick
and
heavy
on
the
palate
very
nice
overall
but
doesnt
live
up
to
other
ba
scotch
ales
i
have
had
o
huge
bourbon
flavor
but
doesnt
mask
the
other
flavors
from
the
base
an
exceptional
beer
that
is
brilliantly
balanced
sweet
caramel
shortbread
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
are
balanced
by
booze
bourbon
and
wood
i
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
creamier
but
i
could
not
ask
for
anything
more
a
beer
that
is
so
much
fun
to
drink
especially
at
10
2
abv
wish
i
had
more
overall
the
first
time
i
had
this
one
i
really
thought
it
was
great
but
every
time
i
have
it
it
loses
a
bit
every
time
i
have
it
it
really
is
an
improvement
on
dirty
bastard
but
it
is
still
not
great
in
my
opinion
picked
this
up
in
a
great
trade
with
evan
beautiful
mahogany
pour
with
a
hint
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
one
and
a
half
finger
head
with
decent
retention
and
great
lacing
big
buttery
woody
nose
with
hints
of
butterscotch
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
the
taste
is
extremely
unique
and
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
had
tons
of
oak
butterscotch
and
creamy
caramel
along
with
hints
of
bourbon
toffee
tobacco
and
just
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
perfect
5
ive
ever
given
its
totally
incredible
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
touch
of
oil
and
a
spicy
warming
finish
this
was
an
extra
in
my
trade
so
i
have
to
thank
evan
as
i
may
have
never
tried
it
if
it
wasnt
for
him
another
mindblowing
beer
from
my
favorite
brewery
o
a
very
special
treat
an
obvious
upgrade
to
an
already
awesome
beer
founders
is
known
to
be
talented
with
barrels
at
their
disposal
and
this
only
enhances
that
reputation
extremely
wellcrafted
with
the
bourbon
character
incorporatedinfused
perfectly
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
unbelievable
damn
very
nice
beer
from
founders
the
craftsmanship
is
impressive
well
done
o
absolutely
worth
the
price
tag
hard
to
track
down
but
definitely
worth
the
hunt
probably
my
favorite
founders
brew
to
date
wee
heavy
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
the
style
for
me
its
amazing
how
the
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
balance
the
bourbon
and
oak
very
good
backwoods
bastard
is
like
founders
dirty
bastards
big
brother
that
has
spent
time
soaking
in
bourbon
barrels
cheers
to
soaking
in
bourbon
barrels
well
done
founders
a
malt
lovers
dream
founders
has
perfected
bourbon
barrel
aging
and
with
this
beer
they
proved
it
once
again
now
what
is
different
here
is
that
its
truly
unique
to
have
a
non
stoutdark
beer
pull
off
such
a
smooth
tasty
flavor
with
such
a
high
abv
once
you
crack
the
bottle
the
smell
of
malt
and
bourbon
overwhelm
and
you
know
youre
in
for
a
very
different
experience
the
taste
of
the
base
dirty
bastard
is
present
and
it
meshes
extremely
well
with
the
sweet
malt
and
bourbon
to
create
a
top
notch
smooth
scotch
ale
overall
its
a
must
have
and
one
of
the
best
beers
founders
has
created
o
a
fabulous
sipper
one
to
celebrate
with
slow
down
and
taste
the
burn
overall
another
excellent
brew
from
founders
very
enjoyable
especially
for
colder
weather
overall
this
is
what
i
would
call
a
bourbon
lovers
beer
its
excellent
another
fine
example
of
founders
skill
with
barrels
o
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
ahold
of
some
of
these
and
i
wasnt
dissapointed
the
caramel
notes
in
this
were
amazing
i
cant
wait
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
for
a
few
years
and
see
how
they
age
o
this
is
really
smooth
for
the
abv
its
quite
sweet
and
i
get
the
bourbon
mostly
in
the
finish
im
not
a
huge
scotch
ale
fan
but
i
love
bourbon
and
this
did
not
disappoint
i
pulled
it
out
of
the
fridge
but
as
it
warmed
it
got
even
better
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
even
though
many
stores
limit
it
to
buying
one
oz
bottle
near
me
poured
into
large
tulip
small
non
lasting
head
that
ended
as
a
ring
around
the
surface
the
color
is
beautiful
very
deep
red
bright
and
clear
aroma
is
of
oak
tones
earthiness
and
wonderful
bourbon
the
flavor
is
amazing
no
bitterness
a
little
underlying
sweetness
great
woody
flavors
strong
bourbon
but
not
overpowering
maybe
a
hint
of
good
scotch
too
clean
on
the
palate
with
a
lingering
bit
of
alcohol
and
bourbon
sweetness
great
stuff
this
here
is
sippin
beer
really
enjoyable
and
even
better
as
it
warmed
unfortunately
only
found
one
lonely
bottle
bummer
overall
great
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
very
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
enjoyable
young
but
im
going
to
age
a
few
bottles
as
well
to
see
how
it
is
in
a
year
or
more
copper
mahogany
colored
with
a
wispy
beige
head
that
barely
rises
up
and
runs
away
quickly
aroma
of
smoke
and
bourbon
some
vanilla
and
caramel
rich
flavors
of
bourbon
and
smoke
toffee
and
caramel
alcohol
warmth
and
sweetness
vanilla
and
woody

decent
beer
overall
very
rich
highly
recommended
cheers
o
i
like
some
scotch
ales
but
usually
dont
seek
them
out
this
is
a
standout
the
aging
in
the
bourbon
barrels
makes
this
beer
sing
perfection
no
fake
bourbon
flavor
here
like
a
ton
of
bourbon
ales
out
there
an
a
in
my
opinion
seek
it
out
sit
back
and
enjoy
having
had
two
bottles
over
a
couple
weeks
im
comfortable
in
my
review
solid
but
definitely
barrel
driven
o
i
gotta
say
i
was
not
expecting
what
i
received
in
taste
based
on
what
i
noted
on
the
nose
how
does
a
sweet
sugary
odor
have
so
much
alcohol
punch
this
is
a
rare
beer
that
drinks
hotter
than
it
lists
as
an
abv
kind
of
a
perfect
sipping
beer
for
a
day
where
i
had
no
heat
with
temps
in
the
teens
and
4
inches
of
snow
backwoods
as
f
overall
if
you
like
bourbon
you
will
absolutely
love
this
beer
the
flavors
mesh
perfectly
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
full
but
not
too
sweet
a
really
amazing
beer
overall
i
liked
the
first
23
a
lot
by
the
last
third
it
was
getting
a
little
old
for
me
kind
of
a
one
trick
pony
in
my
book
but
a
helluva
trick
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
at
once
but
would
like
to
have
it
around
to
have
one
once
a
week
or
so
overall
this
is
a
great
barrel
aged
brew
from
founders
and
i
know
why
this
is
highly
sought
after
im
glad
my
local
store
still
has
cases
upon
cases
of
this
because
that
means
that
theyre
basically
aging
it
for
me
the
boozy
taste
has
mellowed
out
over
the
last
few
months
and
i
cannot
imagine
aging
this
more
than
a
few
months
regardless
of
what
it
says
either
way
this
is
delicious
and
i
will
definitely
keep
buying
when
i
run
out
of
what
i
have
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
definitely
an
offbeat
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
everyday
but
its
fun
and
different
overall
very
good
beer
but
see
my
taste
comment
needs
to
keep
the
basics
of
a
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
still
the
oak
makes
it
so
smooth
it
is
insanly
drinkable
o
this
is
one
big
sipper
that
demands
your
attention
and
is
not
for
the
faint
of
hearted
it
definitely
comes
with
extreme
flavor
and
a
hell
of
a
kick
simply
amazing
i
tried
one
when
it
was
fresh
and
this
slightly
aged
one
has
more
pronounced
bourbon
notes
a
must
try
for
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
lover
cheers
a
true
sipper
and
a
nice
selection
on
a
chilly
december
evening
like
tonight
im
glad
the
weekend
is
here
o
overall
a
wonderful
take
on
an
already
great
scotch
ale
the
bourbon
tones
take
over
and
deliver
wave
after
wave
of
enjoyable
flavors
this
is
a
real
winner
the
taste
has
some
punch
with
sweet
maltiness
and
vanilla
which
quickly
evolves
into
a
biting
long
lingering
bitterness
that
coats
my
throat
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
the
wee
heavy
style
overall
fantastic
stuff
really
mellow
probably
at
least
pratially
from
the
age
on
it
overall
i
know
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
strong
beer
but
its
strength
is
a
little
bit
raw
as
i
said
id
prefer
it
a
bit
smoother
still
quite
a
good
beer
o
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
that
i
have
come
across
though
i
might
be
a
little
biased
as
i
really
like
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
definitely
one
i
will
be
getting
again
and
this
is
not
even
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
again
this
was
never
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
you
have
to
respect
how
drinkable
and
smooth
it
is
even
if
youre
not
in
love
with
the
tastelike
me
id
say
this
is
an
excellent
candidate
for
aging
and
can
turn
into
a
classic
after
some
my
guess
is
the
astringent
factors
of
this
beer
will
surely
fade
after
a
year
and
improve
it
significantly
giving
it
a
more
malty
balanced
taste
just
might
have
to
buy
a
few
extra
there
are
so
many
beers
of
this
ilk
that
are
practically
undrinkable
compared
to
thisespecially
young
which
is
why
founders
is
who
they
are
and
does
what
they
duz
o
love
it
not
much
more
to
say
drinks
extremely
well
at
a
great
price
point
i
will
gladly
grab
this
anytime
it
is
available

with
some
very
visible
alcohol
legs
bourbon
right
off
the
bat
big
vanilla
buttery
malts
follow
up
big
brown
sugar
and
caramel
on
the
finish
buttery
malts
fill
the
tongue
then
caramel
and
raisins
follow
sharp
carbonation
hits
around
mid
sip
and
opens
up
the
taste
buds
to
a
vanilla
bourbon
blast
that
resinates
to
a
cheerywood
and
alcohol
finish
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
strong
boozey
and
very
sweet
overall
just
an
all
around
great
beer
intense
complexity
creative
flavors
malty
sugary
desert
like
sweetness
it
is
crazy
how
good
this
beer
is
backwoods
bastard
pours
a
hazy
brownish
reddish
color
similar
to
that
of
dieherra
with
no
head
strong
oak
aroma
with
hints
of
bourbon
spicy
malty
aroma
there
is
a
strong
whiskey
like
flavor
on
a
mellow
smokey
malty
backbone
with
a
sharpness
on
the
palette
good
full
flavor
well
balanced
and
complex
overall
a
fantastic
scotch
ale
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
from
an
awesome
brewery
and
made
even
better
by
its
reasonable
price
im
aging
a
bottle
in
my
cellar
and
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
poured
into
a
lost
abbey
tulip
bottled
101212
poured
slowly
down
the
center
and
got
a
beautiful
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
thick
ring
of
lace
the
beer
itself
is
a
bright
ruby
the
smell
on
this
starts
with
strong
vanilla
bourbon
peat
dark
fruit
and
some
biscuit
taste
is
similar
to
smell
not
as
much
vanilla
as
the
nose
would
have
you
expect
but
really
complex
pick
up
different
flavors
each
sip
and
really
makes
you
crave
the
next
one
maybe
a
little
smoke
but
very
subtle
and
blends
well
with
all
the
other
flavors
from
the
nose
body
is
medium
large
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
not
really
dry
almost
surprising
and
very
drinkable
for
a
big
brew
founders
and
firestone
are
so
good
at
brewing
barrel
aged
beers
it
is
scary
love
this
and
had
a
dirty
bastard
before
to
see
what
a
difference
the
barrels
made
and
it
turned
a
very
good
beer
into
an
amazing
beer
o
an
interesting
welldone
beer
o
im
stunned
i
knew
this
beer
was
going
to
be
good
but
i
honestly
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
good
i
gave
it
pretty
high
marks
because
im
really
not
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
usually
but
for
me
this
is
so
perfect
backwoods
bastard
is
now
absolutely
my
favorite
founders
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
kbs
and
breakfast
stout
are
up
there
as
well
but
i
think
this
takes
it
to
another
level
well
done
founders
and
thank
you
nick
for
sending
this
my
way
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
happens
to
my
other
bottle
with
some
age
on
it
final
thoughts
completely
worth
the
money
and
unique
im
starting
to
like
barrel
aged
beers
more
and
more
because
of
tasting
something
like
backwoods
bastard
which
is
brewed
and
aged
to
near
perfection
would
i
drink
it
again
this
year
if
i
can
find
itwould
love
to
cellar
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
otherwise
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
next
years
release
super
different
for
a
beer
in
this
genre
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
amber
color
with
a
dense
nearly
pure
white
head
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
as
it
sips
down
the
nose
is
a
little
fruity
a
lot
boozy
and
entirely
different
again
from
most
scotch
ales
its
too
light
the
taste
is
awesome
like
a
tasty
hybrid
of
licorice
and
fresca
soda
thats
what
i
taste
more
fruit
than
ever
for
a
scotch
and
the
same
effervescent
carbonation
as
that
artificial
grapefruit
flavored
soda
pop
its
really
good
but
i
am
missing
that
smoke
and
hefty
malt
base
ive
grown
used
to
in
these
beers
anyone
else
get
that
bright
bubbling
medium
body
again
too
light
for
the
style
but
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
living
up
to
its
name
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
this
is
something
unique
and
to
be
cherished
i
never
in
a
million
years
would
have
put
uts
abv
over
10
on
a
blind
tasting
its
far
too
delicate
to
be
that
potent
but
it
all
seems
to
work
out
just
right
on
tap
at
j
ryans
in
syracuse
a
place
you
must
visit
as
a
beer
enthusiast
what
a
treat
from
founders
pours
a
cloudy
dark
rubyamber
with
a
quickly
attenuating
scorched
carmaelcolored
head
lovely
vanilla
on
the
nose
accompanied
by
tempered
bourbon
moutfheel
is
a
little
thin
but
smooth
as
silk
a
bit
of
a
burn
on
the
finish
from
a
combination
of
carbonation
hop
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
amazing
it
would
be
perfect
but
theres
just
some
alcohol
bitterness
that
detracts
from
the
heavenliness
toffee
vanilla
bread
and
bourbon
all
in
spades
its
reminiscent
of
my
favorite
beer
on
planet
earthdouble
dba
from
fw
but
a
scaled
down
version
this
beer
transcends
style
bullshit
and
proves
light
barrel
notes
rule
at
least
when
done
by
founders
highest
recommendation
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
considering
the
sweetness
it
was
well
balanced
and
very
delicious
glad
i
got
to
try
it
finally
o
great
beer
bought
a
second
bottle
to
cellar
o
a
truly
fantastic
example
of
what
barrel
aging
can
do
to
a
beer
othis
is
way
too
hot
and
needs
to
be
laid
down
for
at
least
4
months
its
a
mess
to
tell
you
the
truth
this
may
be
very
nice
when
the
bourbon
cools
off
a
bit
and
i
truly
hope
i
was
not
tasting
sucralose
o
im
really
glad
i
cracked
this
tonight
looking
for
a
beer
to
slowly
sip
and
enjoy
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
one
warms
up
also
happy
i
have
three
more
bottles
to
sit
on
ill
likely
drink
two
soon
since
im
liking
where
it
is
right
now
but
will
be
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
oan
excellent
beer
one
that
i
will
get
on
an
annual
basis
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
scotch
ales
but
the
bourbonoak
in
this
one
balances
out
the
sweetness
perfectly
do
drinkability
not
that
high
since
it
is
such
a
big
beer
and
overall
this
is
a
really
great
version
of
the
style
there
are
many
in
this
style
that
are
big
huge
beers
the
bourbon
here
helps
to
make
it
more
accessible
and
easier
drinking
in
short
it
really
helps
the
style
for
me
4
0
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
not
many
others
mimic
the
craftsmanship
is
noted
and
i
look
forward
to
grabbing
a
4pack
each
year
wow
incredibly
smooth
like
sucking
down
a
rum
raisin
butterscotch
sunday
with
toffee
bits
creamy
rich
vanilla
oakiness
throughout
caramel
toffee
and
smoke
faint
dark
fruit
so
smooth
and
so
big
on
flavor
but
it
seems
so
subtle
at
the
same
time
alcohol
heat
is
barely
there
simply
put
this
is
an
amazing
brew
with
incredible
smoothness
and
a
faint
lingering
sweetness
balance
is
almost
impeccable
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
a
bit
simple
but
its
good
the
bourbon
is
a
bit
heavy
and
the
underlying
scotch
ale
at
times
seems
to
struggle
with
it
on
the
whole
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
worth
trying
overall
just
amazing
ba
scotch
ale
leaves
me
pretty
warm
in
the
throat
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
brew
the
complexity
is
stunning
the
flavor
is
amazing
and
the
balance
is
like
no
other
its
definitely
a
sipper
than
demands
sip
after
sip
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
one
do
it
overall
i
do
not
think
the
brewers
at
founders
or
anyone
else
could
do
a
better
job
of
making
a
true
scotch
ale
with
as
much
complexity
and
character
as
this
it
is
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
the
only
things
i
will
say
against
it
are
1
it
only
comes
out
1xyear
and
in
limited
distribultion
and
with
the
high
alcohol
content
if
you
drink
more
than
one
you
really
feel
it
however
i
will
gladly
put
up
with
the
buzz
and
slowly
sip
it
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
pretty
damn
good
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
mellows
out
o
a
sipper
total
nightcap
beer
tastes
and
feels
like
bourbon
damn
worth
the
hype
but
i
really
wish
this
was
easier
to
get
in
bottles
medium
full
body
with
mild
carbonation
more
than
i
thought
a
high
abv
beer
would
have
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
experience
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
a
bit
of
warmth
after
swallowing
o
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
brew
i
have
had
and
i
have
not
had
many
that
i
have
enjoyed
this
one
is
actually
smooth
and
balanced
good
stuff
overall
really
good
i
have
three
more
bottles
left
in
the
four
back
and
thinking
about
letting
one
or
two
of
them
sit
around
for
a
while
o
wow
will
be
buying
more
of
this
if
i
get
a
chance
a
nice
brown
pour
with
a
small
head
minimal
lacing
on
my
class
aroma
of
bourbon
shines
through
making
me
a
bit
nervous
actually
add
a
little
vanilla
to
the
smell
and
now
im
ready
to
drink
it
not
as
much
whiskey
in
the
flavor
still
very
present
but
not
overpowering
lots
of
flavors
in
this
the
more
i
let
it
sit
it
started
tasting
like
almond
joy
candy
bars
really
nice
brew
overall
pretty
solid
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
anything
barrel
aged
especially
bourbon
this
beer
rocks
o
an
amusing
novelty
o
founders
doesnt
disappoint
when
it
comes
to
barrel
aged
beers
this
is
delicious
and
very
complex
seems
to
get
more
complex
the
warmer
it
gets
overall
i
was
excited
to
finally
see
this
beer
in
my
area
and
to
try
it
the
bourbon
is
sort
of
overpowering
feels
like
i
am
having
whiskey
not
beer
maybe
some
age
or
warming
would
help
improve
things
o
im
not
sure
what
to
do
with
this
brew
quite
honestly
i
love
my
beers
aggressive
but
this
one
just
didnt
cut
it
for
me
there
just
wasnt
much
beyond
the
bourbon
bite
not
much
flavor
overall
just
hints
of
various
other
flavors
perhaps
some
aging
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
but
im
not
so
sure
im
willing
to
give
it
another
shot
quite
yet
above
average
brew
but
nothing
more
personally
3
75
mainly
due
to
alcohol
and
easy
drinkability
onthe
lower
side
due
to
taste
that
puts
me
off
i
wont
buy
it
next
time
o
im
a
sucker
for
beers
that
get
more
flavor
out
of
the
barrels
they
use
than
the
bourbon
the
barrels
held
this
is
an
excellent
example
and
an
interesting
experiment
with
a
scotch
ale
grateful
to
now
be
able
to
get
it
in
my
market
overall
as
someone
who
isnt
even
a
huge
fan
of
barrel
aged
beers
i
found
this
one
to
be
superb
great
complexity
smooth
whiskey
taste
that
isnt
overpowering
very
very
good
a
warming
smooth
sipper
o
this
is
a
damn
delicious
wonderful
beer
its
very
rich
and
the
flavors
are
interesting
enough
to
sip
at
all
evening
along
with
the
breakfast
stouts
this
is
easily
one
of
founders
best
beers
m
thick
body
booze
more
prominent
with
warming
but
not
overwhelming
finish
is
sweet
and
a
bit
sticky
but
for
a
true
desert
of
a
beer
thats
no
problem
o
i
liked
it
didnt
love
it
would
definitely
drink
as
much
as
i
can
get
though
low
b
o
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
this
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
although
the
alcohol
does
sneak
up
on
you
i
think
the
aroma
on
this
one
is
top
notch
not
sure
the
rest
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
did
enjoy
it
but
not
sure
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
again
to
track
it
down
o
a
very
good
take
on
a
style
i
dont
drink
very
often
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
aroma
with
fruits
vanilla
and
the
forward
bourbon
contributions
the
flavor
is
good
but
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
in
my
opinion
it
improves
considerably
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
as
it
warms
i
am
happy
to
have
gotten
a
four
pack
so
i
can
put
a
few
down
and
try
them
with
some
age
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
wish
came
to
my
area
cant
say
it
would
always
be
on
the
top
of
my
list
but
it
is
very
good
d
pretty
enjoyable
brew
really
nice
to
see
a
big
bourbon
barrel
aged
brew
this
easy
to
drink
after
only
being
in
the
bottle
for
about
6
weeks
my
only
complaint
is
regarding
the
carb
which
i
think
detracts
from
the
body
a
bit
something
that
i
think
if
it
were
backed
off
a
bit
would
make
this
even
more
of
a
savory
treat
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
i
have
tasted
i
will
definitely
keep
an
eye
out
for
these
every
year
from
now
on
excellent
seasonal
brew
enjoy
it
as
it
ages
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
pop
from
the
bourbon
right
off
the
bat
with
the
first
sip
throughout
the
sip
the
flavoring
stays
very
smooth
and
relatively
uniform
this
is
both
good
and
bad
on
the
one
hand
you
get
this
great
rich
buttery
sweet
bourbon
flavoring
for
the
entire
sip
on
the
other
hand
however
there
are
really
no
surprises
youre
waiting
for
something
insane
to
kick
in
but
they
kind
of
pull
all
their
stops
at
the
instant
the
beer
touches
your
mouth
really
this
isnt
a
complaint
as
we
found
this
beer
to
be
delicious
and
another
homerun
for
founders
the
insane
bourbon
nose
and
flavoring
makes
this
guy
a
contender
amongst
barreled
beers
despite
the
style
o
a
very
delicious
beer
one
that
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
not
to
be
taken
lightly
this
even
at
its
high
price
will
be
a
repeat
purchase
j
o
overall
a
really
good
scotch
ale
with
the
bourbon
twist
out
does
dirty
bastard
with
the
barrel
aging
and
honestly
one
of
the
first
bourbon
barrel
beers
ive
liked
dont
care
for
bourbon
but
this
isnt
overpowering
all
in
all
i
wish
my
bottle
shop
would
have
more
than
a
one
bottle
limit
guess
im
gonna
have
to
road
trip
it
for
some
more
o
overall
this
is
excellent
i
had
heard
good
things
and
this
did
not
disappoint
it
seems
like
everytime
founders
puts
a
beer
in
a
bourbon
barrel
they
hit
a
home
run
i
highly
recommend
and
will
certainly
drink
this
one
again
o
well
this
totally
sucked
maybe
its
not
my
style
but
just
tasted
like
liquor
not
beer
maybe
it
needs
time
to
mellow
out
or
the
style
isnt
for
me
but
i
hated
it
i
finally
get
a
chance
to
taste
this
delicious
beer
again
the
appearance
is
slightly
dark
brown
i
bought
a
case
of
this
because
i
absolutely
love
the
vanilla
caramel
oak
bourbon
taste
it
emits
you
definitely
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
and
it
is
worthy
of
praise
founders
does
an
amazing
job
brewing
this
the
mouth
feel
is
warm
sweet
and
pleasant
i
love
drinking
this
ale
when
the
days
get
dark
and
cold
quicker
it
is
limited
depending
on
where
you
live
if
you
find
it
please
try
this
youll
enjoy
it
o
well
the
fact
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
have
never
bothered
to
review
it
is
a
testament
to
its
quality
it
is
a
very
good
beer
a
big
beer
but
one
that
is
not
at
all
overdone
well
balanced
with
the
brewer
showing
some
restraint
on
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
o
this
is
fantastic
wee
heavy
in
bourbon
barrels
why
is
this
not
more
common
this
is
well
made
and
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
happens
to
this
beer
with
a
little
time
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
could
just
sit
an
enjoy
the
aroma
alone
but
drinking
it
is
so
much
fun
ogreat
complex
flavor
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
well
put
together
o
this
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
though
from
prior
experience
id
say
it
is
definitely
better
after
a
few
months
when
the
bourbon
subsides
a
bit
and
the
subtle
smokiness
of
the
base
beer
comes
through
the
flavor
takes
on
more
of
a
scotch
note
than
a
bourbon
note
and
this
becomes
a
truly
sublime
beer
experience
even
fresh
though
this
is
an
absolute
treat
worth
seeking
out
and
drinking
as
much
as
possible
o
overall
i
love
this
brew
im
immediately
going
to
the
store
to
buy
more
such
a
robust
taste
and
smell
i
wish
this
beer
were
available
year
round
o
this
is
very
good
but
honestly
i
found
myself
just
slightly
disappointed
this
is
likely
because
my
expectations
were
sky
high
based
upon
anything
barrel
aged
ive
had
by
founders
which
have
been
amazing
having
said
all
of
that
i
will
gladly
revisit
this
offering
overall
i
absolutely
adore
barrel
aged
beers
and
i
buy
a
six
pack
of
every
pack
i
can
find
i
also
do
a
lot
of
home
brewing
and
throw
oak
into
nearly
every
batch
however
this
surpassed
anything
i
have
purchased
or
made
it
is
worthy
of
the
founders
label
and
i
cannot
recommend
this
highly
enough
to
any
big
beer
lovers
really
a
great
beer
wish
it
was
a
year
round
it
could
have
been
a
bit
cheaper
but
thats
typical
of
my
area
if
its
priced
correctly
it
sells
out
way
too
fast
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
silky
o
not
mindblowing
but
pretty
tasty
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
date
of
101212
stamped
on
the
neck
pours
a
dark
brownish
black
with
almost
no
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
a
big
whiff
of
oaky
booze
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
oaky
booze
the
toffee
and
caramel
malt
flavors
come
out
in
the
middle
more
bourbon
and
oak
at
the
finish
not
overly
sweet
warming
alcohol
presence
this
is
a
slow
drinker
with
lots
of
oak
and
bourbon
overall
outstanding
scotch
ale
that
is
easily
one
of
the
best
around
o
a
potent
earth
sweet
beer
that
stop
short
of
being
cloying
but
it
definitely
weighs
in
as
a
desert
beer
but
thats
the
style
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beers
stay
away
the
wee
heavy
has
the
richness
and
boldness
to
let
the
oak
and
whiskey
really
infuse
this
beer
with
a
lot
of
there
character
and
the
balance
between
the
base
beer
and
the
oak
is
spot
on
pretty
low
drinkability
at
this
point
i
anticipate
some
rounded
edges
after
a
year
or
so
careful
the
high
alcohol
content
can
sneak
up
on
you
tons
of
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
from
the
barrel
sweet
and
smooth
one
of
the
few
10
beers
i
can
knock
back
a
few
of
i
can
get
enough
of
this
stuff
go
find
some
if
you
can
o
this
is
my
motherfucking
shit
o
my
first
experience
with
this
brew
very
happy
i
have
the
pleasure
sipping
this
right
now
very
well
done
huge
flavors
with
huge
balance
now
i
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
def
putting
my
other
2
way
for
a
couple
of
years
o
very
impressed
by
this
beer
it
has
redefined
the
style
for
me
a
great
sipper
that
competes
with
some
of
founders
others
barrel
aged
behemoths
after
buying
two
4pks
im
ready
to
commit
to
stocking
up
on
this
to
get
me
through
til
next
years
release
ogreat
marriage
of
scotch
ale
and
bourbon
barrel
a
delicious
sipper
with
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
bourbon
flavor
oeasily
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
founders
offering
and
hands
down
my
favorite
weeheavy
im
glad
i
got
a
few
4
packs
of
this
to
sip
on
for
the
next
few
weeks
its
incredibly
balanced
and
no
one
flavor
is
really
overpowering
im
amazed
at
how
balanced
and
drinkable
this
beer
is
well
done
founders
well
done
othis
is
my
first
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
so
not
sure
what
to
compare
it
to
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
much
thinner
than
i
expected
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
i
enjoy
this
i
will
age
and
see
what
happens
after
a
few
months
very
good
beer
overall
a
real
good
barrel
aged
brew
mostly
find
stouts
that
are
bourbon
aged
was
a
good
chance
of
pace
to
try
a
scotch
ale
cant
wait
another
year
to
see
how
this
ages
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
hunt
some
down
ill
be
putting
two
bottles
away
to
see
how
the
bourbon
notes
do
with
some
age
this
is
drinking
rather
hot
when
fresh
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
for
me
but
thats
not
for
everyone
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
syrupy
caramel
with
terrific
ruby
tints
a
slight
ring
of
creamy
head
is
present
and
leaves
behind
a
light
ring
around
the
glass
but
the
body
of
the
beer
is
dark
red
bordering
on
black
and
completely
opaque
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
big
with
malty
bourbon
caramel
and
sweet
alcohol
slight
bread
in
the
malt
adds
further
complexity
peat
malt
is
also
slightly
and
gives
the
beer
an
eversoslight
roasty
tinge
on
the
taste
the
beer
is
very
complex
in
flavor
beginning
sweet
and
almost
cloying
with
spicy
alcohol
and
too
sweet
malts
and
big
bourbon
flavoring
but
then
transitions
into
very
slight
middle
caramel
before
the
finish
pulls
big
barrel
notes
onto
the
tongue
which
lingers
with
the
cloying
bourbon
mouthfeel
is
big
and
marmaladelike
on
the
tongue
with
sharp
effervescence
and
a
prickly
feeling
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
sticky
but
dry
with
very
little
saliva
to
speak
of
overall
i
think
im
going
to
cellar
the
rest
of
this
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
much
in
the
flavor
right
now
for
my
personal
taste
there
are
some
big
bourbon
notes
which
very
intriguing
in
a
sipping
beer
but
id
like
to
get
a
little
more
malt
flavor
in
this
and
less
alcohol
the
complexity
of
both
the
taste
and
the
smell
are
superb
and
show
to
founders
superb
skill
in
brewing
extreme
beers
it
just
is
not
really
the
flavor
im
looking
for
this
definitely
a
must
try
for
bourbon
fans
and
barrel
aged
beers
fans
alike
and
a
superb
beer
but
i
plan
to
cellar
this
to
bring
some
new
complexity
to
it
expect
a
redux
review
in
a
couple
months
this
beer
is
a
sipper
meant
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
in
the
evenings
in
front
of
a
roaring
fire
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
decent
beer
im
excited
to
age
my
remaining
bottles
and
do
a
vert
in
the
future
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
burbon
barrel
aged
brews
the
burbon
character
from
the
barrels
and
the
scotch
character
from
the
malts
make
a
delicious
brew
where
you
can
really
taste
all
the
complex
components
going
into
it
deffinatly
give
this
a
go
if
you
have
the
opportunity
particuarly
of
you
like
barrel
aged
beers
o
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
i
know
i
gave
it
a
5
but
this
is
a
rare
example
of
a
truly
great
beer
overall
this
one
had
a
shit
ton
of
hype
behind
it
and
with
this
my
first
try
of
it
id
say
it
has
held
its
own
im
a
sucker
for
big
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
and
founders
does
seem
to
know
what
they
are
doing
in
this
category
o
an
incredible
ba
scotch
ale
nice
and
complex
which
makes
this
is
a
definite
sipper
definitely
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
o
this
was
fantastic
with
two
years
on
it
would
be
interested
in
trying
one
fresh
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
just
outstanding
i
love
this
beer
my
new
favorite
founders
beer
tho
i
am
going
to
crack
cbs
next
week
overall
for
being
such
a
heavy
powerful
beer
the
balance
is
great
i
had
another
wee
heavy
ale
during
a
tasting
the
other
day
and
i
couldnt
handle
it
with
the
alcohol
being
too
powerful
this
founders
brew
was
expertly
balanced
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
a
must
try
o
absolutely
a
masterpiece
in
terms
of
a
bourbon
aged
scotch
ale
backwoods
has
drinkability
that
wants
to
shatter
the
sipping
component
that
you
need
follow
so
delicious
fresh
i
can
only
imagine
how
it
tastes
after
a
little
time
down
edit
had
a
bottle
from
2010
bourbon
notes
are
more
mellow
much
heavier
on
the
vanilla
and
oak
accents
much
to
my
surprise
this
one
had
more
carbonation
once
again
awesome
brew
o
a
beautiful
strong
scotch
ale
warm
and
comforting
sweet
but
nowhere
near
clawing
very
balanced
and
a
perfect
introduction
to
the
style
packed
full
of
flavour
but
not
extreme
that
seems
to
be
founders
in
a
nutshell
great
stuff
overall
this
maybe
one
of
the
easier
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
to
drink
the
flavors
stand
right
out
in
front
i
would
love
this
on
tap
or
to
try
a
very
34
year
old
bottle
i
would
trade
for
this
again
a
serious
sipper
even
with
age
smooth
big
and
boozy
drink
it
fresh
and
youll
feel
like
you
just
took
a
dozen
shots
of
iffy
whiskey
drink
it
aged
poured
from
the
bottle
this
beer
has
a
dense
dark
and
cloudy
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
crimsontinged
halo
around
the
edges
the
aroma
is
intensely
woody
giving
an
impression
of
being
in
a
pine
forest
at
dusk
after
a
storm
there
is
also
a
mild
fruity
cherrylike
sweetness
that
wafts
out
from
under
the
wood
the
flavor
is
similarly
rustic
with
notes
of
charred
wood
and
dark
caramel
but
any
nuance
to
the
flavor
profile
is
difficult
to
appreciate
under
a
substantial
alcohol
heat
overall
though
despite
some
identifiable
faults
the
total
experience
with
this
beer
is
still
satisfying
o
was
so
delighted
i
was
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
the
bourbon
was
there
but
did
not
overpower
this
beer
i
recommend
this
beer
overall
another
world
class
beer
from
founders
the
things
they
do
with
a
bourbon
barrel
astound
me
big
thanks
for
yaknowbrady
for
sending
me
this
and
some
others
out
of
the
kindness
of
his
heart
overall
awesome
founders
big
beers
are
simply
works
of
art
a
creative
great
brewery
on
top
of
their
game
overall
pretty
darn
good
but
i
liked
the
fresh
ive
had
on
tap
better
o
another
solid
brew
from
founders
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
two
finger
beige
head
good
retention
and
noticeable
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
a
lot
of
bourbon
on
the
nose
with
oak
and
toffee
opens
with
a
shot
of
bourbon
toffee
vanilla
and
rich
caramel
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
creamy
perfect
carbonation
and
frankly
feels
like
velvet
a
truly
amazing
brew
that
sets
the
standard
for
barrelaged
scotch
ales
taste
is
very
soft
and
creamy
this
is
a
hell
of
beer
which
makes
you
very
happy
while
drinking
it
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
has
less
peat
and
smoke
than
other
scotch
ales
but
being
mistaken
for
a
very
good
old
ale
is
not
a
bad
thing
i
distinctly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
like
to
have
it
again
o
nice
beer
but
not
that
nice
would
have
again
as
the
barrel
enhances
the
beer
but
does
leave
some
fairly
large
gaps
here
and
there
overall
this
is
excellent
very
appreciative
that
i
got
to
try
an
aged
version
this
beer
does
get
better
in
my
opinion
fresh
its
a
bit
hot
and
harsh
carbonationwise
with
this
time
on
it
its
totally
mellowed
out
even
with
a
year
on
it
we
get
similar
results
i
have
several
bottles
from
2012
vintage
with
1
year
on
them
and
i
plan
to
let
them
stick
around
for
some
sidebysides
down
the
road
o
this
was
a
great
scotch
ale
another
great
offering
from
founders
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
curmudgeon
with
the
molasses
taste
definitely
probably
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
i
loved
the
balance
between
all
the
tastes
including
the
scotch
sweetness
molasses
etc
nothing
was
overpowering
or
too
subtle
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beer
and
i
would
love
to
pick
more
up
in
the
future
originally
reviewed
09182011
overall
it
is
an
amazing
bourbon
beer
rich
and
luxurious
i
like
my
bourbon
beers
heavy
on
the
bourbon
flavor
and
this
delivers
in
spades
its
great
with
bbq
as
an
after
dinner
drink
or
really
anytime
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
big
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
smoothness
that
is
surprising
notes
of
bourbon
caramel
are
balanced
by
an
herbal
bitterness
an
oak
dryness
the
vanilla
comes
across
as
sweet
bitter
at
times
it
reminds
one
of
creme
brulee
or
bananas
foster
this
is
one
big
bad
easy
sipping
smooth
as
hell
beer
that
is
full
of
flavor
awesome
beer
focused
largely
on
the
barrel
id
buy
as
much
of
this
as
is
available
overall
really
like
this
there
is
a
great
amount
of
scotch
and
the
sweetness
is
up
a
bit
from
the
non
ba
version
really
enjoyed
getting
a
chance
to
try
this
o
a
really
nice
bear
i
had
it
on
tap
once
at
the
ginger
man
in
nyc
and
i
rememberd
it
to
have
a
little
less
bourbon
could
be
mistaken
or
maybe
its
the
aging
that
has
changed
it
but
i
would
think
it
would
be
the
opposite
either
way
pretty
nice
beer
could
do
with
a
little
less
bourbon
but
would
definitely
have
it
again
wow
the
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
despite
the
flavors
being
built
on
bourbon
this
was
still
pretty
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
maybe
not
quite
on
the
level
of
kbs
but
oh
so
much
more
obtainable
pick
yourself
up
a
couple
of
packs
and
enjoy
following
them
through
the
aging
process
o
top
notch
barrel
aged
beer
here
not
sure
i
can
discern
that
this
is
a
scotch
ale
from
any
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
strong
ale
offering
but
its
very
good
bourbon
lovers
rejoice
o
love
every
second
of
this
i
stumbled
upon
a
case
late
last
year
and
have
5
bottles
left
will
enjoy
every
last
one
of
them
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
and
appreciate
more
my
chance
to
plan
for
having
one
at
the
end
of
a
night
when
deemed
appropriate
drinking
a
2014
bottle
im
still
not
impressed
scores
unchanged
o
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
next
time
its
released
this
is
a
bit
of
a
strange
experience
having
my
first
one
after
its
been
aged
for
a
couple
years
postbarrelaging
the
hops
have
remained
as
spice
and
light
bitterness
the
malts
are
all
there
and
the
bourbon
is
just
wacky
this
is
a
fine
beer
a
contemplative
beast
oscotch
ales
are
a
style
that
i
think
should
be
made
more
throw
it
in
a
bourbon
barrel
and
it
becomes
even
better
verdict
drink
this
one
around
four
to
eight
months
after
release
for
maximum
enjoyment
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
definitely
the
sweetest
while
not
a
great
textbook
example
of
a
scotch
ale
per
se
its
still
a
very
good
beer
an
excellent
beer
but
definitely
a
dessert
sipper
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
a
punch
in
the
mouth
but
it
was
fully
lacking
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
that
being
said
it
was
still
a
tasty
beer
taste
is
exquisitely
heavy
and
malty
all
of
the
aforementioned
aromas
make
a
showing
on
the
palate
but
with
an
added
vanillabourbon
booziness
at
the
finish
this
is
a
toptier
scotch
ale
with
a
unique
twist
and
an
experience
in
itself
a
marvelous
beer
but
definitely
a
sipper
this
is
one
of
the
best
barrelaged
beers
ive
ever
had
such
great
integration
between
the
beer
and
the
bourbon
the
light
smoke
the
hefty
malt
bill
and
the
dark
fruits
all
work
really
well
with
the
mellow
bourbon
character
simply
delicious
and
the
alcohol
is
starting
to
talk
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
one
of
my
favorite
wee
heavys
o
this
is
my
second
review
of
backwoods
bastard
i
dont
like
reviewing
a
beer
more
than
once
but
my
palate
was
pretty
inexperienced
the
first
time
i
didnt
enjoy
my
serving
and
so
my
rating
was
pretty
low
i
owed
bb
another
shot
while
i
can
admit
that
my
first
review
is
essentially
invalid
i
still
feel
like
the
overall
ratings
are
substantially
inflated
and
so
it
is
then
i
guess
that
i
remain
in
the
minority
on
this
one
this
is
a
massively
rich
complex
scotch
ale
with
lots
of
oak
and
bourbony
sweetness
the
spirit
is
well
integrated
very
nice
overall
a
fabulous
beer
huge
flavors
that
you
are
prepared
for
by
the
aroma
wafting
out
of
the
glass
then
it
lives
up
to
the
anticipation
with
expertly
executed
tastes
and
mouthfeel
o
just
outstanding
i
dont
dabble
into
this
style
often
but
this
beer
is
one
ill
always
drink
when
i
see
it
founders
doesnt
mess
around
with
their
barrels
o
this
is
a
bourbon
lovers
beer
if
i
drink
hard
liquor
its
only
good
bourbon
or
scotch
and
this
would
be
a
great
substitute
barely
any
burn
from
the
alcohol
a
great
sweet
malt
backbone
to
complement
the
bourbon
flavors
and
the
hit
of
pure
bourbon
flavor
make
this
an
amazing
beer
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
especially
someone
who
enjoys
bourbonwhiskeyscotch
pours
a
slightly
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
tiny
off
white
head
that
never
really
musters
but
never
fully
dissipates
either
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
oak
and
bourbon
the
smell
is
heavenly
really
taste
is
as
sweet
as
advertised
but
have
enough
bourbon
warmth
to
keep
is
slightly
balanced
lots
of
dark
sugars
and
dark
fruits
round
out
the
flavor
nicely
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
sugary
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
the
heck
out
of
this
beer
i
only
wish
it
were
a
little
easier
to
obtain
but
this
is
all
about
the
bourbon
it
burns
pleasantly
on
the
way
down
and
leaves
you
feeling
warm
o
along
with
beer
im
a
huge
bourbon
lover
this
is
like
the
best
of
both
words
some
might
find
it
too
boozy
but
its
just
right
for
me
o
a
nice
ba
wee
heavy
but
could
use
a
bit
more
body
and
needs
some
time
to
smooth
out
at
this
point
pretty
boozy
and
not
really
something
i
can
drink
much
of
decent
m
fairly
similar
to
the
11
with
slightly
lighter
carbonation
o
very
good
beer
would
love
to
have
again
overall
i
liked
it
but
id
like
to
see
how
this
one
ages
would
the
bourbon
smooth
out
a
bit
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
at
times
i
really
enjoy
the
huge
bourbon
presence
at
times
i
think
its
too
overshadowing
i
have
plenty
in
the
cellar
im
hoping
that
with
more
time
some
of
the
more
predominant
flavors
mellow
out
allowing
the
base
beer
to
come
through
more
clearly
i
buy
a
lot
of
this
when
it
comes
out
and
drink
it
often
for
a
few
weeks
it
is
my
regular
grab
beer
i
dont
horde
it
and
it
doesnt
last
long
in
my
hands
i
dig
it
i
had
this
beer
a
few
times
at
blue
dogg
in
warminster
p
a
everytime
i
see
it
on
a
list
i
will
get
it
because
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
founders
makes
it
has
an
incredible
balance
of
hops
and
barley
the
smokey
hint
tops
it
off
at
the
aftertaste
the
head
is
always
full
and
rich
with
overwhelming
aromas
that
make
you
want
more
great
beer
o
a
nice
scotch
ale
not
enough
barrel
for
my
taste
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
totally
piqued
my
interest
in
exploring
this
style
and
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
a
bit
more
ive
been
on
a
pretty
long
hops
kick
and
this
beer
may
have
just
changed
that
i
wish
i
had
more
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
if
youre
into
sweeter
big
beers
i
see
this
on
a
continuum
with
sweet
barleywines
and
especially
old
ales
but
thats
fine
by
me
o
different
than
the
last
batch
i
had
from
2011
cant
wait
to
try
again
this
is
good
stuff
4
5
overall
carbonation
was
there
just
right
a
very
complex
and
great
brew
i
really
enjoy
how
the
bourbon
aging
pairs
with
the
carmel
sweet
malts
a
great
product
from
barrel
aging
one
of
the
best
ive
had
to
date
ill
have
another
o
the
alcohol
presence
is
not
distracting
i
think
the
heat
and
the
bourbon
flavors
mix
well
with
the
hefty
caramel
malt
bill
and
all
the
bready
characteristics
for
a
beer
this
old
it
still
retains
a
lot
of
bourbon
notes
must
be
a
hot
one
fresh
i
really
liked
this
one
overall
i
love
these
beers
it
was
great
to
have
both
at
once
the
base
beer
is
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
the
barrel
aged
big
brother
is
sweet
smokey
greatness
that
any
fan
of
big
beers
scotch
bourbon
life
itself
will
love
seek
these
out
enjoy
them
o
i
had
pretty
high
expectations
for
the
beer
sadly
it
didnt
quite
live
up
it
was
solid
but
didnt
wow
me
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
in
some
ways
unbalanced
for
its
style
in
my
mind
i
e
thin
body
and
lack
of
great
bourbon
flavor
vs
its
high
abv
and
alcohol
flavor
good
but
not
great
its
a
cold
rainy
night
in
southwest
ohio
and
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
that
would
be
better
in
this
moment
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
next
year
m
mediumheavy
body
rich
but
not
heavy
carbonation
is
low
alcohol
is
apparent
but
drinkability
is
still
quite
high
this
is
a
well
done
strong
scotch
ale
aging
in
bourbon
barrels
just
makes
it
more
impressive
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
the
style
or
bourbon
barrel
aging
and
everyone
else
o
wow
perfection
in
a
bottle
kbs
may
get
the
glory
but
this
beer
is
the
self
assured
older
brother
o
i
havent
been
big
on
scotch
ales
in
the
past
i
really
like
this
one
though
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
is
almost
completely
black
with
some
deep
bloodruby
highlights
around
the
edges
thin
sparse
frothy
beige
head
that
settles
slowly
into
an
uneven
covering
aromas
are
darkly
sweet
and
earthy
with
a
heavy
dose
of
caramel
molasses
and
cherries
blended
with
a
good
booze
character
and
some
woody
smells
flavors
are
bold
and
rich
all
over
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
a
decent
alcohol
warmth
that
hits
the
throat
immediately
taste
profiles
include
a
strong
bourbon
backbone
with
rich
caramel
and
molasses
sweetness
rolling
off
good
balance
of
sweet
characteristics
with
a
roasty
feel
and
a
kick
of
light
cherry
sweetness
at
the
end
super
rich
and
smooth
with
a
good
full
body
to
carry
both
the
flavor
and
the
abv
aftertaste
is
slightly
sharp
thanks
to
the
abv
with
oaky
and
earthy
flavors
the
finish
is
slightly
cloying
with
a
slightly
astringent
feel
from
the
booze
this
is
a
good
brew
that
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
despite
the
increased
alcohol
presence
this
is
an
ass
kicker
it
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
no
head
there
is
some
mild
lacing
around
the
edge
i
really
smell
the
effects
of
the
barrel
almost
a
sweet
rum
mouthfeel
is
viscous
but
not
overly
so
the
taste
is
what
brings
me
back
every
time
there
is
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
heat
mostly
on
the
finish
the
main
flavor
for
me
is
caramel
i
do
get
a
little
oak
and
ting
of
syrupy
sweet
but
that
dissipates
quickly
i
am
sure
i
have
not
said
anything
that
hasnt
already
been
said
about
this
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorite
nonstout
beers
from
founders
having
spent
my
summers
in
scotland
back
in
the
80s
as
a
we
lad
i
have
had
a
few
scotch
ales
in
my
youth
and
have
to
say
that
this
one
stands
alone
and
above
most
probably
because
i
am
a
huge
bourbon
fan
as
well
but
all
aside
another
great
product
from
founders
who
have
set
the
bar
in
many
catagories
o
it
seems
a
little
hot
even
with
a
year
on
it
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
tend
to
dominate
the
senses
i
do
like
the
warming
sensation
that
comes
over
me
pours
a
nice
bright
mahogany
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
the
smell
is
strongly
bourbon
with
some
slight
maltcaramel
in
the
background
taste
was
way
too
heavy
with
bourbon
for
me
it
just
tasted
like
any
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
had
except
with
a
shot
of
bourbon
added
it
was
still
good
just
a
bit
one
note
for
my
taste
and
nothing
that
made
me
able
to
distinguish
it
from
anything
else
the
mouthfeel
was
good
no
burn
from
the
alcohol
but
nothing
particularly
special
either
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
it
was
still
a
good
beer
i
just
feel
like
a
lot
of
people
really
like
this
beer
and
it
seemed
pretty
one
note
to
me
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
one
again
with
some
age
to
perhaps
let
the
bourbon
settle
into
a
more
balanced
brew
o
very
tasty
and
pretty
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
oak
bomb
the
barrel
treatment
dominates
here
but
its
well
executed
so
its
hard
to
complain
as
always
it
would
be
nice
if
the
base
beer
showed
through
more
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
a
little
light
in
the
body
for
the
style
but
still
very
enjoyable
i
enjoy
a
little
bit
of
smoked
aspect
in
this
type
of
offering
and
i
didnt
really
pick
up
on
any
of
that
instead
i
was
left
with
an
enjoyable
barrel
aged
beer
that
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
barleywinestrong
ale
overall
a
pretty
solid
offering
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
one
of
these
fresh
to
see
if
there
is
any
big
difference
moreys
bottom
line
i
had
this
beer
several
years
back
and
it
was
too
much
for
me
now
i
absolutely
love
it
its
meant
for
sipping
and
the
flavors
come
out
more
as
this
one
warms
up
cost
6
50
for
a
10
oz
pint
pour
or
15
99
for
a
four
pack
yet
again
founders
delivers
a
true
masterpiece
in
brewing
just
a
phenomenal
beer
so
tasty
and
balanced
lovely
bourbon
character
m
carbonation
is
active
but
dim
for
a
barrel
aged
old
ale
this
is
fine
imo
i
feel
its
a
little
thin
i
wish
it
where
a
little
more
chewy
but
still
a
decent
mouthfeel
i
have
looked
forward
to
this
one
for
a
while
poured
into
a
sniffer
the
beer
was
a
dark
color
with
hints
of
brown
the
aroma
which
was
quite
potent
was
vanilla
and
alcohol
being
a
scotch
ale
in
its
initial
state
one
expects
a
certain
level
of
sweetness
i
detected
tastes
of
prune
and
vanilla
mixed
in
with
the
scotch
flavors
the
alcohol
from
being
aged
was
very
detectable
in
the
taste
it
had
a
negative
impact
on
the
overall
scope
of
flavors
the
alcohol
stays
on
the
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
making
the
aftertaste
disappointing
since
the
more
desireable
flavors
disappeared
for
all
the
hype
that
went
with
this
beer
this
is
slightly
disappointing
the
barrel
aged
flavors
did
not
blend
well
with
the
beer
making
the
alcohol
flavor
too
prominent
overall
though
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
drink
o
this
is
a
darn
good
boozy
bourboncentric
beer
o
really
great
combination
here
of
scotch
ale
and
bourbon
i
loved
this
and
would
like
to
try
other
bourbon

i
really

batch
of
backwoods
i
have
had
it
on
tap
and
out
of
the
bottle
and
both
are
excellent
i
believe
the
draft
version
is
even
smoother
than
the
bottled
version
but
this
is
still
great
i
loved
last
years
batch
with
a
year
of
age
to
it
i
am
looking
forward
to
this
batch
with
a
year
on
it
even
more
another
good
bal
from
founders
although
not
great
overall
its
a
bit
too
sweet
at
times
and
the
bourbon
got
a
bit
too
hot
this
review
is
of
an
11
vintage
i
much
prefer
about
912
months
on
these
to
mellow
out
some
of
the
flavors
its
sublime
then
o
wow
where
has
this
beer
been
all
my
life
i
absolutely
recommend
this
especially
if
you
enjoy
all
the
bourbon
and
oak
notes
in
your
beer
as
well
as
your
whiskey
o
an
awesome
beer
near
perfect
for
the
style
just
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
heat
very
glad
i
have
one
aging
cant
wait
to
see
the
results
thanks
for
the
awsome
brew
gentlemen
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
great
complex
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
i
will
say
outright
i
am
not
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
as
a
style
to
include
founders
dirty
bastard
but
this
beer
is
strong
enough
to
make
me
look
past
that
for
the
price
point
it
wont
be
something
im
going
to
be
seeking
out
a
lot
in
the
future
as
id
rather
spend
that
kind
of
money
on
a
great
imp
stout
but
if
you
even
remotely
are
fan
of
scotch
ales
andor
very
bourbonforward
beers
stock
up
on
this
one
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
but
there
are
others
i
would
drink
first
including
founders
dirty
bastard
all
around
founders
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
brew
i
enjoyed
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
and
its
pretty
well
balanced
all
around
i
wouldnt
say
its
full
bodied
but
lies
somewhere
in
between
middle
and
full
another
big
thanks
to
2bdchicago
for
the
chance
to
try
this
12oz
bottle
served
at
51
degrees
in
a
tulip
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brownishmaroon
hue
with
a
creamy
quarter
inch
tancolored
head
that
quickly
disperses
towards
the
shoulders
forming
a
frothy
band
around
the
edges
great
nose
on
this
beer
bourbon
notes
brown
sugar
raisins
and
prunes
along
a
robust
malty
backbone
aromas
are
very
much
reminiscent
of
an
old
ale
taste
follows
nose
however
the
bold
aromas
are
somewhat
hollowed
out
in
the
flavor
profile
nothing
really
pops
that
said
i
also
get
some
buttery
notes
as
well
as
a
slight
earthy
hops
presence
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
as
well
as
a
trace
of
acidity
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
residual
alcohol
heat
that
lingers
at
the
back
of
the
throat
between
quaffs
overall
a
very
good
beer
im
not
really
getting
the
wee
heavy
on
this
so
i
am
rating
more
to
preference
than
style
another
great
beer
from
founders
however
not
a
beer
that
i
would
cellar
for
an
extended
period
of
time
as
i
feel
like
this
brew
could
develop
some
oxidized
flavors
this
was
the
leadup
beer
to
me
1st
shot
at
the
mounties
best
so
i
feels
like
i
beer
threadin
my
gullet
with
some
soft
comfy
furniture
before
put
down
some
plastic
this
stuff
sweats
sweet
maple
and
burrrbon
i
am
liking
each
sip
whilst
weighing
me
hopes
and
dreams
on
sipping
some
equal
to
the
sweat
off
zeus
ballsc
this
grog
is
floatin
around
in
a
chimay
glass
just

am
livin
in
heaven
while
still
havin
a
ticker
that

yea
ya

good
stuff
bettern
duff
overall
one
of
the
most
drinkable
ones
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
sure
wish
we
got
this
stuff
locally
i
was
lucky
to
get
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
cheers
pours
out
a
rich
brown
body
with
copper
highlights
all
thru
it
not
much
carbonation
to
speak
of
just
a
thin
tan
ring
that
eventually
disappears
there
are
notes
of
vanilla
and
oak
that
blend
wonderfully
to
make
a
nice
bourbon
aroma
taste
is
like
drinking
bourbon
without
the
burn
once
again
the
vanilla
shines
thru
with
a
dry
oak
feel
to
it
and
a
nice
caramel
malt
balance
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
almost
oily
it
goes
down
so
smooth
with
just
a
touch
of
warming
in
the
belly
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
everyone
should
try
black
pour
with
a
short
lived
white
head
nothing
amazing
the
smell
however
is
quite
amazing
huge
hits
of
vanilla
coconut
and
bourbon
really
awesome
taste
has
less
of
the
bourbon
but
all
of
the
coconut
and
malt
very
german
chocolate
cake
like
smooth
as
silk
body
and
while
the
bourbon
is
prominant
it
is
not
overpowering
very
good
stuff
i
will
be
picking
up
much
more
of
this
on
the
next
release
acquired
in
a
trade
and
thank
you
chris
pours
a
deep
earthy
brown
very
murky
with
some
deep
red
edges
1
finger
of
a
lightly
browned
head
quickly
fell
to
a
thin
layer
while
showing
good
retention
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
sweet
candied
sugar
caramel
fudge
but
not
much
of
a
barrel
presence
the
taste
is
among
the
sweetest
that
has
ever
graced
my
palate
follows
the
nose
with
a
strong
torched
caramelized
vanilla
bean
awesomeness
roasted
pralines
and
subtle
woody
dryness
then
the
bourbon
shines
through
with
some
very
warming
heat
considering
the
barrel
aging
there
is
not
much
of
a
charred
character
but
bourbon
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
a
touch
of
oak
very
smooth
on
the
palate
and
quite
the
sipper
the
carbonation
is
just
enough
and
done
right
overall
what
a
great
brew
for
the
season
i
do
wish
there
was
more
of
an
oak
or
charred
characteristic
to
help
balance
some
of
the
sweetness
but
i
cant
complain
dirty
bastard
stands
its
ground
well
and
could
take
the
cake
in
comparison
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
very
happy
that
i
got
it
and
have
one
left
once
again
well
done
founders
dont
see
this
one
improving
with
age
pours
a
deep
amber

smells
in
the
taste
bourbon
oaky
and
sweet
notes
of
vanilla
a
smooth
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
vanilla
and
bourbon
like
aftertaste
like
drinking
bourbon
but
less
abrasive
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
really
like
the
mix
of
the
sweet
caramelized
base
beer
with
the
heavy
handed
character
of
the
bourbon
barrel
overall
the
bourbon
is
overpowering
i
suspect
that
if
you
have
bottles
and
age
it
for
a
year
or
two
itll
taste
great
but
it
is
not
good
fresh
i
love
founders
beers
and
was
excited
to
finally
get
to
try
something
other
than
the
breakfast
stout
i
am
however
very
much
disappointed
beer
should
taste
like
beer
if
i
wanted
a
glass
of
bourbon
i
would
have
purchased
a
glass
of
bourbon
o
overall
a
treat
of
a
beer
a
slow
sipping
tasty
beer
that
will
reward
anyone
who
is
fond
of
scotchbourbon
murky
rusty
brown
tiny
wisp

is

bourbon
lovers
wet
dream
light
carbonation
great
sipping
beer
for
cold
winter
nights
poured
into
a
tall
glass
at
room
temperature
this
wee
heavy
shows
a
deep
mahogany
with
rosyroot
beer
colored
edges
it
produces
a
solid
light
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
nice
blanket
and
leaves
a
respectable
web
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
deep
vanilla
scotch
and
woodsy
malt
subtle
dark
fruits
and
heavy
grains
completely
enticing
the
first
taste
brings
intense
scotch
malt
with
super
sweet
pine
and
deep
figprune
vanilla
certainly
comes
back
as
well
with
a
sure
alcohol
presence
but
one
that
does
not
block
the
urge
to
go
back
to
the
well
to
keep
the
flavor
coming
bourbon
and
oak
can
definitely
be
identified
as
advertized
its
just
such
a
classic
medley
of
all
things
a
scotch
ale
should
be
and
then
some
its
a
pretty
hefty
brew
with
fairly
full
body
nearly
cloying
except
that
the
flavor
works
right
through
it
to
make
it
drinkable
enough
for
the
style
its
finely
but
thoroughly
carbonated
and
makes
for
a
smooth
somewhat
silky
feel
that
works
well
despite
the
seriousness
of
this
brew
id
say
the
10
abvplus
is
evident
but
very
well
managed
here
its
just
a
great
serious
scotch
ale
a
wee
heavy
yes
exquisitely
so
this
pours
a
rich
caramel
color
it
has
a
slight
aroma
to
it
light
notes
of
caramel
and
toasted
coconut
both
of
which
become
more
apparent
and
pronounced
as
it
warms
tastes
great
with
the
coconut
sweetness
and
a
warming
alcohol
working
in
tandem
it
reminded
me
of
an
aged
barleywine
once
the
hops
mellowed
outin
terms
of
the
sweetness
and
finishand
id
certainly
drink
it
again
a
real
treat
smells
of
vanilla
bourbon
licorice
alcohol
had
this
fresh
and
now
a
few
months
past
the
vanilla
has
definitely
faded
leaving
more
of
a
bourbon
alcohol
heat
and
oak
presence
to
this
beer
still
good
just
one
i
wont
be
aging
the
scotch
ale
is
in
there
somewhere
providing
a
great
base
for
this
beer
to
stand
on
o
a
solid
all
around
beer
its
impressive
how
smooth
it
is
for
10
i
could
use
just
a
little
more
in
your
face
flavor
out
of
it
though
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
is
like
a
luxury
model
of
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
bbcs
bourbon
barrel
big
brown
i
do
love
barrelaged
stouts
but
i
wish
more
brewers
would
make
barrelaged
versions
of
easydrinking
sweet
malty
beers
like
brown
ales
and
scottishscotch
ales
the
oaky
tones
of
the
bourbon
just
go
perfectly
with
these
beers
o
a
great
barrel
aged
offering
from
founders
very
bourboncentric
though
which
to
some
may
be
offputting
that
being
said
i
think
the
base
beer
melded
great
with
the
aging
and
preserved
its
integrity
while
taking
on
an
even
more
complex
flavor
profile
overall
unique
beer
i
can
compare
it
some
but
i
will
let
you
be
the
judge
if
you
like
rum
meets
malts
with
slight
hints
of
vanilla
you
will
love
this
beer
its
definitely
not
for
most
but
definitely
for
all
real
beer
drinkers
alike
cheers
to
all
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
of
bal
beers
tend
to
be
rather
unbalanced
either
its
all
barrel
or
its
invisible
this
hit
the
perfect
harmony
of
a
great
base
beer
made
better
with
barrel
character
id
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
bal
beers
founders
clearly
knows
what
they
are
doing
with
barrels
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
founders
once
again
stands
up
to
its
name
be
sure
to
sip
this
bad
boy
b
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
stupendous
and
thats
not
a
word
i
often
use
to
describe
a
beer
last
time
i
had
this
i
believe
it
was
pretty
old
while
still
good
i
dont
quite
remember
the
same
wow
factor
that
i
get
with
this
relatively
fresh
one
extremely
well
done
barrel
aged
beer
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
a
couple
four
packs
of
this
i
know
what
id
be
drinking
almost
every
night
very
well
done
o
could
use
more
smoke
darkness
carbonation
and
body
but
worth
buying
store
level
goes
well
with
the
winter
season
o
this
is
a
great
ale
i
will
definitely
get
more
of
these
overall
impression
while
i
enjoyed
this
one
ontap
the
founders
beer
dinner
in
the
beginning
of
this
year
i
feel
i
was
able
to
grasp
more
the
second
time
around
and
enjoyed
it
more
still
has
such
a
huge
jim
beam
clone
like
aroma
and
taste
i
dont
know
if
i
could
ever
drink
more
than
16oz
of
this
in
one
night
tough
drinkability
but
a
very
great
brew
have
3
more
left
who
shall
i
share
them
with
overall
nice
body
chewy
oaky
caramel
and
light
bourbons
round
this
brew
out
has
the
aesthetic
of
an
old
ale
brewed
by
a
crazy
warlock
in
a
musty
stone
cellar
deep
below
the
earth
great
balance
i
dig
it
probably
be
great
with
some
chili
overall
a
great
wee
heavy
delicious
bourbon
notes
overall
another
pretty
delicious
beer
from
founders
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
i
could
have
in
one
sitting
largely
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
not
to
mention
the
high
abv
but
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
drinkability
a
definite
slow
sipper
amazingly
good
but
one
is
enough
becomes
much
more
dangerous
as
it
warms
up
as
the
alcohol
gets
hidden
thankfully
the
bourbon
flavor
and
smell
is
there
to
remind
you
of
the
higher
abv
and
to
slow
down
i
think
this
is
a
wee
heavy
that
would
indeed
put
a
fierce
scotsman
in
his
place
mellowing
him
out
with
one
and
prompting
him
to
fight
after
two
as
i
said
about
the
aroma
its
like
a
whiskey
toffee
fudge
candy
in
liquid
beer
form
and
that
makes
this
a
very
good
beer
overall
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
but
if
you
prefer
the
taste
of
bourbon
drink
this
fresh
as
the
barrel
disappeared
quickly
even
with
a
few
months
on
this
the
flavors
still
balance
nicely
overall
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
and
age
i
find
that
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
formidable
for
sure
it
is
a
sipper
but
every
sip
is
delicious
and
well
worth
it
overall
i
love
this
beer
very
rich
and
complex
and
not
nearly
as
hot
as
id
anticipated
gonna
hold
onto
some
of
these
in
my
cellar
and
highly
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
as
well
it
seems
aroma
wise
to
have
lost
a
little
something
or
maybe
this
is
its
style
i
do
not
know
as
this
is
the
first
bottle
i
have
ever
tasted
almost
feels
like
the
high
test
cabs
coming
out
of
napa
valley
these
days
big
mouthfeel
dark
sweet
candy
alcohol
upfront
round
and
biting
very
worthy
to
seek
out
and
hang
on
to
this
is
a
special
brew
and
one
that
can
convert
the
uninitiated
a
great
beer
overall
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
a
bit
different
and
boozy
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
is
solid
another
winner
from
founders
this
was
medium
to
heavy
in
body
carbonation
seemed
a
little
light
and
the
beer
seemed
rather
boozy
at
the
end
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
just
about
perfect
do
this
barrelaged
wee
heavy
has
the
makings
of
a
favorite
sipper
with
alcohol
distributed
evenly
and
prominently
throughout
it
is
the
bold
but
respectful
handling
of
alcohol
that
makes
this
beer
special
allowing
the
booze
to
define
the
experience
without
becoming
unruly
of
excessive
overall
drinkability
is
5
0
and
beyond
i
could
down
this
like
water
but
it
should
be
bigger
like
old
stock
or
something
similar
the
mouthfeel
brings
it
down
however
if
it
were
2
a
bottle
instead
of
4
i
would
drink
this
all
day
long
o
overall
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
a
rarity
as
i
always
enjoy
founders
beers
i
dont
get
the
melding
of
flavors
they
dont
seem
to
work
in
my
opinion
i
love
dirty
bastard
but
do
not
dig
this
o
overall
this
is
quite
good
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
i
found
it
o
like
a
dirty
bastard
with
bourbon
lots
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
verystrongbourbontasting
beers
ive
had
perhaps
its
the
fact
this
is
a
wee
heavy
but
i
prefer
their
kentucky
bourbon
stout
a
little
more
nevertheless
this
is
one
fine
beer
it
ages
really
well
do
not
let
this
fairly
limited
seasonal
beer
slip
through
your
fingers
another
year
o
i
would
avoid
it
but
a
lot
of
people
like
this
beer
i
would
just
recommend
getting
bourbon
since
the
bourbon
in
this
beer
is
so
overpowering
that
it
hinders
much
of
the
aletaste
found
in
dirty
bastard
notes
perfect
mouthfeel
good
barrel
aging
hot
but
not
overly
so
maintains
a
great
balance
of
beer
and
barrel
cheers
and
happy
thanksgiving
o
very
solid
drink
im
curious
how
the
flavours
will
develop
with
some
age
on
it
definitely
a
solid
performer
as
per
founders
usual
i
was
expecting
that
it
would
be
perhaps
a
bit
richer
but
i
found
it
was
about
the
same
as
db
surprisingly
it
seems
much
smoother
though
and
thats
a
real
accomplishment
when
you
add
bourbon
i
was
expecting
a
lot
of
boldness
from
this
and
while
it
didnt
deliver
as
much
boldness
as
i
expected
it
seemed
to
be
very
balanced
and
tastefully
done
overall
the
age
has
done
this
one
very
well
extremely
smooth
and
complex
ill
definitely
have
this
one
again
o
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
strong
bourbon
flavor
without
the
heat
will
definitely
seek
out
more
of
these
overall
i
really
liked
another
founders
brew
it
seems
like
founders
really
has
their
shit
together
this
brew
is
right
in
line
with
their
ability
to
nail
any
style
but
i
love
the
bourbon
barell
aged
ones
most
i
think
they
do
those
best
overall
quite
a
huge
and
complex
brew
the
flavors
complement
each
other
very
well
it
will
be
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
ages
overall
this
is
truly
like
sipping
a
glass
of
bourbon
im
nearly
tempted
to
throw
some
ice
in
a
rocks
glass
and
pour
a
few
fingers
to
sip
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
really
the
flavors
are
actually
very
well
balanced
but
the
bourbon
and
alcohol
are
the
main
acts
here
o
this
is
the
2nd
time
ive
had
this
beer
both
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
1st
time
i
thought
this
beer
was
gods
gift
to
earth
this
time
it
was
just
really
good
interested
to
see
what
the
3rd
bottle
brings
overall
good
beer
i
havent
had
this
fresh
but
would
assume
that
it
is
a
little
brighter
than
this
maybe
the
hops
are
a
little
more
apparent
some
bigger
alcohol
flavors
might
be
there
as
well
45
i
really
like
this
beer
but
it
could
definitely
be
thicker
more
viscous
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
it
goes
down
relatively
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
with
low
carbonation
levels
definitely
something
you
have
to
sip
the
booze
holds
you
back
a
little
but
the
wonderful
flavors
constantly
draw
you
back
in
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
for
someone
that
doesnt
like
bourbon
this
would
be
something
to
avoid
however
this
is
absolutely
wonderful
to
me
had
this
ontap
at
sapsuckers
hop
grubs
in
huntington
ny
the
deep
reddish
color
and
nice
tannish
head
are
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
on
the
nose
the
distinctive
aroma
of
bourbon
and
strong
alcohol
lets
you
know
that
this
beer
has
been
caskaged
the
first
sip
confirms
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
the
syrrupy
quality
of
the
beer
allows
it
to
linger
after
first
sip
and
leaves
a
lasting
bourbon
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
on
the
tongue
a
fantastic
beer
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
i
had
an
early
2010
vintage
and
picked
up
more
vanilla
and
molasses
on
the
palate
with
less
bourbon
burn
the
mouth
feel
was
also
better
being
more
creamy
and
less
dry
not
as
much
heat
o
very
good
founders
seasonal
easily
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
o
a
little
more
carbonation
and
no
sediment
would
have
gotten
a
higher
score
a
treat
none
the
less
another
great
seasonal
from
founders
been
awhile
since
ive
had
this
one
but
just
as
good
as
i
remember
worth
hunting
down
a
bottle
or
two
a
year
thanks
kawilliams81
overall
a
wonderful
beer
as
long
as
you
let
it
warm
up
so
that
you
can
appreciate
all
of
the
subtle
flavors
overall
a
very
good
beer
will
be
looking
for
more
of
this
o
this
is
really
nice
burnt
sugar
and
wood
vanilla
dried
fruit
and
cocoa
it
has
a
nice
funky
yeastiness
on
the
nose
and
the
back
of
the
tongue
has
some
candycorn
and
caramel
popcorn
notes
im
really
glad
i
have
a
second
bottle
to
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
overall
i
really
liked
this
brew
im
far
from
familiar
with
scotch
ales
but
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
to
my
ignorant
pallet
this
seems
like
a
double
scotch
ale
so
maybe
not
the
best
choice
to
someone
new
to
the
style
love
the
prominent
but
clean
bourbon
taste

but
theyre
not
my
favorite
i
can
tell
which
ones
are
quality
and
this
is
one
will
be
anxious
to
see
how
this
beer
drinks
with
some
age
on
it
overall
no
doubt
about
it
this
beer
is
excellent
the
bourbon
barrel
treatment
works
wonders
for
the
backwoods
bastard
my
favorite
scotch
ale
to
date
o
overall
this
beer
was
delicious
sad
i
only
have
two
bottles
of
this
wish
i
had
more
overall
this
a
fine
beer
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
and
the
fact
that
its
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
a
real
nice
beer
that
i
will
revisit
for
sure
o
what
a
difference
barrel
aging
can
make
this
is
a
much
more
enjoyable
bastardinabottle
this
beer
has
a
hell
of
a
kick
but
enough
mellow
flavors
to
counteract
it
with
incredible
smoothness
id
really
love
to
have
this
ontap
that
version
of
dirty
bastard
was
even
better
than
its
bottled
counterpart
backwoods
bastard
pours
mahogany
to
a
deep
red
with
about
a
finger
of
beige
foam
it
displays
good
retention
and
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
clinging
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
fantastically
sweetmalty
vanilla
ad
caramelize
sugar
immediately
jump
out
at
my
nose
eventually
making
room
for
subtle
bourbon
and
oak
scents
to
show
themselves
and
add
a
layer
of
complexity
the
flavor
takes
that
great
balance
though
and
turns
it
on
its
ear
as
bourbon
and
wood
trample
all
over
the
malty
flavors
present
in
the
beer
those
spirit
and
oak
notes
work
much
better
in
a
supporting
role
and
arent
great
acting
as
the
focal
point
of
the
beer
the
beers
carbonation
is
alright
tending
towards
the
less
intense
side
of
things
the
body
though
is
inexcusably
light
not
nearly
as
full
and
rich
as
such
a
big
beer
brewed
in
a
malt
forward
style
requires
backwoods
bastard
is
an
alright
beer
and
it
has
some
potential
but
as
is
i
think
this
is
one
case
where
i
prefer
the
base
beer
to
the
barrel
aged
version
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
bottle
o
this
is
a
world
class
wee
heavy
the
bourbon
notes
are
just
outstanding
one
of
the
seasonal
i
look
forward
to
every
year
o
a
very
good
beer
that
will
sort
of
remind
you
of
cbs
or
kbs
without
the
coffee
and
deep
complex
flavors
its
basically
3
flavors
of
bourbonwhisky
caramel
malt
and
spice
note
finish
very
strong
and
will
knock
you
out
a
very
good
beer
o
an
intense
and
overwhelming
beer
fresh
and
a
tasty
caramel
bomb
after
a
year
of
aging
ive
got
2
more
bottles
aging
and
im
curious
how
itll
be
after
sitting
for
another
year
or
two
with
the
first
sniff
theres
no
mistaking
that
this
is
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
nice
dark
copper
hue
good
head
dirty
bastard
is
probably
my
least
favorite
founders
beer
but
im
a
huge
founders
fan
the
barrel
aging
really
works
with
it
though
the
bourbon
almost
overtakes
the
beer
here
but
since
i
like
bourbon
so
much
this
isnt
a
problem
draft
to
snifter
looks
good
brown
with
a
little
head
laced
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
smells
good
too
malt
and
bourbon
are
noticeable
tastes
great
its
this
beers
best
attribute
the
bourbon
barreling
mellows
out
the
scotch
flavoring
nicely
mouthfeel
is
good
it
would
get
better
with
age
but
for
a
draft
i
cant
complain
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
the
few
that
the
taste
is
the
best
feature
of
overall
damn
good
and
i
know
it
will
be
better
in
a
year
medium
mouthfeel
and
just
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
overall
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
fine
fine
creationthe
bourbon
barrel
treatment
makes
the
flavors
of
the
scottish
ale
truly
shine
scott
is
the
absolute
man
for
cracking
some
of
these
for
us
during
this
bliss
tasting
seriously
it
pours
a
clear
dark
russetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
lighttan
foam
the
nose
comprises
bourbon
oak
light
vanilla
caramel
toffee
light
peat
moss
raisin
dates
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
the
only
thing
holding
this
smell
back
is
the
strength
of
the
bourbon
which
comes
close
to
singeing
my
nosehairs
with
every
sniff
but
this
aint
enough
to
deter
me
from
going
further
mind
you
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
decidedly
stronger
and
boozier
bourbon
component
which
threatens
to
overtake
everything
else
in
a
blaze
of
usurpatory
glory
its
still
pretty
tasty
but
much
more
onedimensional
than
it
could
have
been
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
yeah
its
heavy
on
the
bourbon
but
its
still
a
damn
fine
tasty
brew
its
not
amazing
but
its
more
than
an
experience
years
later
tried
again
fresh
in
14
and
the
fruity
notes
are
excellent
in
aroma
flavor
still
boozy
and
vanilla
dominant
upped
my
rating
a
bit
overall
a
rich
smooth
wee
heavy
that
has
a
nice
hoppy
balance
o
the
backwoods
bastard
is
a
unique
bourbon
barrel
offering
that
combines
the
taste
and
boozyness
of
bourbon
with
sweet
butterscotchesque
flavors
its
not
an
everyday
type
of
beer
but
it
is
a
tasty
treat
i
know
a
lot
of
people
who
really
look
forward
to
this
one
and
hype
it
up
a
good
bit
for
me
i
cant
say
im
in
that
group
i
love
bourbon
but
frankly
i
was
bored
to
death
by
dirty
bastard
this
beer
is
rather
tasty
and
i
am
putting
a
few
bottles
aside
to
see
if
age
helps
but
frankly
this
one
finds
itself
in
that
special
place
where
it
isnt
a
great
late
night
sipper
or
a
nice
pairing
for
a
meal
o
solid
work
from
the
boys
at
founders
keep
em
coming
oh
a
note
though
id
actually
suggest
letting
this
guy
get
up
to
around
50
degrees
because
i
feel
the
chill
actually
suppresses
some
of
the
flavours
still
trying
to
decide
how
i
feel
about
the
buttery
flavor
o
excellent
bourbon
barrel
aged
old
ale
or
wee
heavy
depending
on
how
you
classify
it
highly
recommended
this
will
vary
year
to
year
and
is
great
to
have
in
the
cellar
o
one
of
the
top
tier
beers
founders
makes
phenominal
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
that
is
comes
out
only
once
a
year
why
would
anyone
drink
a
bud
after
having
this
type
of
beverage
ill
never
know
pour
is
the
same
but
the
smell
has
lost
some
dark
fruits
and
gained
a
barleywine
smell
carbonation
leaves
what
looks
like
a
film
at
the
top
it
has
actually
gained
more
vanilla
and
beautiful
oak
barrel
notes
i
actually
like
it
more
now
than
before
o
this
stuffs
great
im
not
a
gigantic
malt
bomb
guy
but
the
bourbon
works
perfectly
with
everything
to
make
a
really
tasty
and
dangerously
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
this
fine
beverage
from
a
modern
day
tulip
glass
at
cellar
temp
when
held
up
to
the
sun
it
shows
a
deep
red
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
this
beer
smells
like
a
loaf
of
bread
with
vanilla
oak
and
a
hint
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
unrivaled
amongst
its
peers
extremely
wellbalanced
the
flavors
of
the
barrel
only
compliment
this
beer
no
single
flavor
is
overwhelming
not
boozy
considering
its
abv
mouthfeel
is
thin
yet
creamy
this
bastard
is
drinking
really
well
right
now
and
will
only
improve
with
age
backwoods
bastard
was
a
very
early
beer
i
had
when
i
first
started
drinking
craft
beer
and
while
i
do
remember
enjoying
it
i
dont
think
i
appreciated
it
as
i
do
now
its
so
complex
flavorful
and
smooth
unlike
many
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
one
of
my
fall
favorites
that
i
cannot
get
enough
of
overall
good
brew
enjoyable
perhaps
not
as
great
as
some
see
it
for
me
as
barrel
ageing
defiantly
upfront
as
you
have
to
search
for
anything
else
othis
is
one
of
my
favorite
releases
from
founders
it
took
some
time
for
me
to
get
into
when
i
first
tried
it
a
couple
years
ago
i
thought
the
bourbon
was
overpowering
now
i
think
it
is
perfect
this
is
really
a
fantastic
example
of
what
barrel
aging
does
to
a
beer
i
know
it
is
not
comparable
to
kbs
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
much
more
and
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
a
really
good
beer
especially
for
the
cold
winter
nights
o
the
barrel
is
well
integrated
yet
again
in
a
founders
beer
this
is
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
great
beer
o
overall
very
nice
my
only
gripe
about
this
beer
is
the
amount
of
dark
fruits
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
i
was
hoping
from
the
nose
that
it
would
be
more
vanilla
and
caramel
with
the
fruit
and
toffee
as
more
of
a
backdrop
i
will
also
say
that
i
thought
this
was
much
more
impressive
the
first
time
i
had
it
on
tap
at
founders
o
another
excellent
beer
from
founders
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
had
a
barrel
aged
beer
with
this
strong
of
a
bourbon
flavor
and
aroma
but
it
works
well
with
this
beer
o
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
to
age
for
612
months
right
now
for
me
its
just
out
of
balance
id
prefer
more
vanillaoakmalt
on
the
palate
instead
of
the
fresh
bourbonbooze
which
dominates
i
can
see
this
beer
aging
wonderfully
though
seriously
the
founders
brewmasters
are
rock
stars
this
beer
pours
with
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
fine
finger
of
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
and
some
bourbon
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
there
is
a
mild
frutiness
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
the
taste
is
amazing
malty
caramel
with
lots
of
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
booziness
which
accompanies
a
very
nice
bourbon
note
a
bit
sweet
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
where
it
should
be
not
much
carbonation
and
a
pretty
full
mouthfeel
very
well
made
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
makes
a
good
nightcap
this
is
the
first
barrelaged
bourbon
beer
ive
had
that
was
not
a
stout
and
i
was
pleased
with
the
result
o
really
interesting
style
with
the
scotchbourbon
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
tread
lightly
though
because
you
will
be
feeling
it
before
you
finish
just
one
o
while
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
beers
aged
in
bourbon
i
had
to
pick
this
up
considering
founders
makes
it
that
said
i
prefer
this
beer
to
any
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
over
angels
share
and
bourbon
santas
but
that
could
be
inferred
by
my
previous
reviews
nothing
in
this
beer
is
overpowering
to
the
point
that
the
other
flavors
are
hid
and
the
balance
of
the
beer
is
really
the
most
impressive
aspect
is
4
too
much
for
a
bottle
of
this
absolutely
not
but
i
probably
wont
be
stocking
up
on
it
when
founders
still
makes
stouts
o
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
it
is
such
a
great
step
in
learning
more
and
more
about
beer
this
beer
is
pretty
legit
great
beer

suffice

beer
as

wee

o
very
impressed
which
really
isnt

for

really

going

vanilla
perfect
beer
to
warm
up
with
on
a
cold
day
like
most
founders
beers
the
only
thing
that
could
improve
this
beer
would
be
to
make
it
available
year
round
cheers
o
i
thought
it
would
be
a
bit
better
but
i
still
really
enjoy
it
i
couldnt
have
more
then
one
pours
a
brilliant
reddishbrown
thin
white
head
fades
rapidly
aroma
is
dominated
by
bourbon
not
so
much
oak
more
bourbon
and
malt
in
the
taste
warm
alcohol
no
hop
presence
very
low
carbonation
mimicking
a
liquor
would
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
a
really
nice
complex
beer
cant
wait
till
founders
expansions
when
they
can
put
out
of
more
of
this
each
year
this
thing
immediately
smells
of
bourbon
i
will
say
that
i
was
turned
off
a
bit
in
the
fact
that
the
previous
night
i
had
had
a
little
too
much
to
drink
and
this
brought
back
some
of
the
spins
for
me
now
getting
on
to
it
this
is
an
amazing
brew
the
bourbon
is
nice
and
mellow
once
it
warms
and
this
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
nice
10
er
a
nice
dark
red
to
brown
hue
no
head
at
all
it
was
really
fresh
so
a
little
carbonation
was
noticeable
i
will
say
that
the
feeling
is
a
little
think
for
my
taste
overall
but
this
is
worlds
above
some
of
the
other
wee
heavies
ive
had
tastes
really
really
good
and
potent
overall
founders
nails
it
everytime
and
this
is
no
exception
great
bourbon
aged
brew
that
holds
great
characteristics
the
barrel
really
work
some
magic
in
this
beer
the
nose
is
really
heavy
on
the
booze
and
suggests
that
this
brew
should
be
cellared
for
a
little
while
a
nice
fireside
sipper
it
could
work
with
a
bourbonspiked
bread
pudding
o
wasnt
as
good
as
i
had
expected
but
a
quality
libation
for
sure
i
thought
the
nose
was
amazing
with
the
body
and
taste
lacking
abit
all
in
all
worth
trying
once
for
sure
overall
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
when
it
had
a
year
on
it
and
i
was
absolutely
blown
away
i
think
i
prefer
this
beer
with
more
age
on
it
when
i
found
out
my
local
shop
had
it
i
went
and
bought
three
4
packs
because
thats
how
much
i
loved
it
when
i
first
had
it
however
the
newer
bottle
tastes
a
lot
different
than
an
aged
one
i
really
wanted
to
review
this
one
higher
i
should
have
taken
notes
on
the
first
one
but
honestly
this
is
a
spectacular
brew
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
bold
and
complex
with
plenty
of
flavor
to
dwell
over
bitterness
it
countered
by
some
sweet
malt
and
things
seem
to
battle
back
and
forth
but
always
seems
to
even
things
out
toward
the
end
barrelaging
usually
makes
big
beers
better
and
backwoods
bastard
is
a
fine
example
of
this
the
base
beer
was
already
a
good
brew
and
the
addition
of
bourbon
barrels
has
only
made
it
better
founders
really
does
know
how
to
keep
pushing
the
envelope
and
come
out
winners
a
vast
majority
of
the
time
prost
2012
update
the
2012
batch
has
a
really
nice
barrel
character
to
it
lots
of
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
unfortunately
it
kinda
ends
up
being
bourbon
barrel
aged
generic
malty
beer
as
the
base
beer
doesnt
offer
much
other
than
support
for
the
barrel
flavor
it
reminds
me
of
a
lesser
firestone
walker
double
double
barrel
ale
id
probably
give
it
a
similar
score
but
for
different
reasons
o
phenominal
this
is
my
favorite
founders
beer
i
love
the
complexity
that
the
barrelaging
brings
to
it
i
am
disappointed
that
it
will
not
be
as
abundant
this
year
as
it
was
last
woody
malty
aroma
has
a
strong
overtone
of
bourbon
no
surprise
there
and
a
hint
of
molasses
it
pours
a
luscious
clear
dark
caramel
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
rich
malty
flavor
has
notes
of
molasses
and
horehound
with
a
strong
but
not
fierce
bite
from
the
bourbon
and
a
woody
slightly
fruity
undertone
smooth
fizzy
texture
has
average
body
overall
delicious
and
recommended
this
is
rich
and
big
it
holds
the
alcohol
very
well
and
is
certainly
not
a
gulping
beer
the
feel
is
really
good
and
deep
mouthfeel
was
smooth
mediumbodied
beer
that
went
down
smoothly
aside
from
the
bourbon
struggle
overall
i
liked
this
brew
well
enough
but
the
bourbon
was
just
too
overwhelming
the
balance
of
flavor
was
not
good
enough
for
my
taste
still
i
would
be
willing
to
try
it
again
maybe
next
time
on
tap
definitely
the
least
good
of
any
founders
brews
ive
had
poured
a
reddishmahogany
color
muddy
with
a
spotty
white
head
that
receded
to
a
layer
of
patchy
bubbles
boozeheavy
aroma
almost
straight
bourbon
big
and
woody
theres
a
bb
joke
in
there
somewhere
lets
be
honest
this
tasted
like
a
cheap
boilermaker
big
on
the
booze
eliminating
almost
all
complexity
that
might
exist
tones
of
oakaged
vanilla
come
through
but
the
bourbon
just
kills
the
palate
almost
completely
tasted
way
higher
in
alcohol
content
than
it
actually
was
thinner
than
most
scottish
ales
ive
had
but
certainly
not
as
good
as
some
the
texture
is
more
what
id
like
to
have
in
that
it
wasnt
too
syrupy
and
certainly
not
as
peaty
but
it
just
didnt
work
with
the
intensity
of
the
booze
flavor
not
very
good
not
very
drinkable
and
ill
be
happy
never
having
it
again
sorry
founders
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
the
flavors
all
complimented
each
other
well
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
flavor
is
where
this
beer
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
the
mix
of
malt
and
caramel
with
smoky
bourbon
and
a
light
alcohol
burn
this
is
what
i
want
from
a
beer
toffee
and
butterscotch
are
there
as
well
body
is
medium
with
very
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
o
good
sipping
beer
on
a
cold
night
lots
of
strong
flavors
and
abv
in
this
one
try
to
enjoy
it
warm
its
way
better
not
really
my
style
of
beer
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
nonetheless
overall
the
base
beer
like
dirty
bastard
just
isnt
that
interesting
the
bourbon
aging
makes
it
quite
nice
though
o
i
love
this
beer
im
a
sucker
for
oaked
beers
that
have
a
tail
end
of
vanilla
backwoods
is
underrated
kbscbs
ect
get
all
the
attention
this
batch
of
backwoods
hit
my
store
same
day
as
cbs
made
its
rounds
while
people
pillaged
the
toowns
for
cbs
backwoods
sat
on
the
shelf
waiting
for
me
id
say
even
if
you
dont
like
scotch
ales
this
being
barrelled
makes
it
easy
for
anyone
with
one
tastebud
in
thier
lousy
mouths
keep
buying
and
racing
around
states
looking
for
kbscbs
and
leave
this
for
me
founders
youre
my
fave
unfortunately
ive
had
different
experiences
with
founders
i
want
to
really
like
their
beers
but
i
find
them
sometimes
falling
a
bit
short
o
very
good
beer
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
scotch
ales
and
something
i
go
for
when
accessible
whenever
im
in
the
mood
for
bourbony
flavors
but
without
the
bite
o
a
scotch
ale
that
actually
tastes
like
scotch
thats
bloody
brilliant
great
job
of
pushing
the
envelope
while
staying
faithful
to
a
much
underrated
style
yet
another
example
of
why
founders
is
one
of
americas
top
notch
breweries
quite
simply
my
new
personal
favorite
founders
has
reached
legendary
status
with
this
one
in
my
book
mm
o
great
beer
love
the
strong
bourbon
taste
it
will
be
hard
for
me
to
age
any
of
these
since
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
are
so
delicious
pretty
drinkable
for
10
and
i
must
be
a
lightweight
since
this
started
to
numb
my
tongue
age
this
boozy
doggy
a
interesting
merge
between
beer
marshmallow
maltiness
and
bourbon
hints
some
walnut
and
zucchini
bread
hints
pour
is
sticky
and
nice
head
of
mahogany
with
an
off
white
head
nose
of
bourbon
and
caramel
palate
is
hard
on
the
tough
like
bourbon
and
then
cuts
clean
this
is
not
syrupy
at
all
its
a
bit
hot
its
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
that
ends
sooner
than
the
expected
barrel
ages
stout
dry
mineral
tongue
dessert
that
doesnt
let
itself
linger
overall
great
beer
i
think
i
liked
it
more
than
fresh
after
everything
melded
together
have
4
2010s
left
so
ill
see
how
they
are
doing
soon
thanks
overall
with
every
sip
you
taste
the
bourbon
i
am
a
big
fan
of
old
stock
cellar
reserve
and
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
other
in
many
ways
it
is
balanced
with
an
excellent
taste
that
is
as
smooth
as
25
year
old
bourbon
considering
the
difference
in
price
and
overall
availability
i
would
visit
this
beer
again
maybe
not
a
staple
but
certainly
a
regularly
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
scotch
ale
and
much
better
on
tap
than
in
bottles
bourbon
is
there
mixxing
with
sweet
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
and
it
isnt
nearly
as
alcoholdominated
as
i
remember
it
would
love
to
have
it
again
on
tap
at
churchkey
in
dc
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
bright
red
tint
and
a
thick
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
down
into
a
thin
layer
of
even
lace
leaving
thick
residue
along
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
strong
with
vanilla
cinnamon
and
oaky
bourbon
along
with
a
light
cherry
undertone
with
a
ton
of
caramel
maltiness
as
well
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
sweeter
malt
up
front
moving
to
the
very
oaky
vanilla
and
cinnamon
bourbon
a
hint
of
cherry
and
a
bit
of
burnt
caramel
bitterness
the
body
is
full
with
light
carbonation
and
a
long
vanilla
bourbon
caramel
malt
and
lightly
burnt
bitter
finish
not
a
huge
fan
of
scotch
alewee
heavy
styles
but
glad
to
have
tried
this
out
truly
amazing
beer
hints
of
bourbon
tons
of
vanilla
toasty
oak
buttery
toffe
and
caramel
slight
scottish
roast
medium
carbonation
almost
syruplike
mouthfeel
tons
of
flavor
founders
hit
a
big
fucking
homerun
with
this
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
odthis
far
exceeded
my
expectations
i
usually
dont
love
scotch
ales
but
this
one
is
delicious
looks
like
i
need
to
buy
a
four
pack
instead
of
just
a
single
4
15
for
a
bottle
is
pricey
but
its
worth
it
this
is
a
gem
founders
is
among
the
best
o
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
awesome
i
would
like
to
see
some
more
bourbon
bite
on
this
one
but
its
still
damn
good
another
superior
offering
from
founders
4
5
o
a
delicious
malty
bastard
expertly
aged
in
oak
bourbon
barrels
comes
off
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
10
2
although
theres
a
slight
hint
of
booze
it
seems
rather
pleasant
this
is
the
best
wee
heavy
around
hands
down
jh
update
pouring
a
2011
and
a
2012
next
to
each
other
and
seeing
the
differences
looking
at
appearance
my
11
is
slightly
lighter
then
the
12
which
is
much
darker
this
year
the
smell
on
the
11
has
definitely
mellowed
out
over
the
year
and
the
12
has
the
same
wonderful
smell
that
i
imagine
lets
taste
wow
the
11
has
really
mellowed
out
and
became
extremely
smooth
you
can
taste
the
difference
in
the
two
from
the
get
go
the
year
of
age
really
benefits
this
beer
though
the
12
is
still
the
amazing
beer
that
i
remember
it
shows
the
alcohol
much
more
and
has
slightly
more
of
the
bourbon
burn
the
11
is
now
super
smooth
and
easy
going
alcohol
presence
has
lessened
but
im
sure
that
the
overall
abv
has
hopefully
increase
with
age
mouthfeel
on
the
11
is
amazingly
creamy
while
12
has
the
nice
bourbon
feel
and
fresh
beer
carbonation
cant
wait
to
put
the
11
next
to
the
12
and
13
next
year
lol
overall
i
like
my
wee
heavyscotch
ales
but
this
is
comparable
to
a
ola
dubh
30
year
reserve
by
harviestoun
which
i
enjoyed
very
much
i
have
to
say
i
like
this
brew
a
little
better
i
wish
it
was
not
a
year
round
release
but
i
will
hunt
for
when
it
is
in
season
i
suggest
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
scotch
ales
this
one
is
superb
this
is
the
first
offering
ive
tried
from
founders
and
im
an
instant
fan
anyone
that
can
make
a
beer
like
this
knows
what
theyre
doing
plain
simple
with
all
thats
great
about
this
beer
there
are
two
things
about
it
that
make
me
sad
1
its
only
released
once
a
year
and
2
i
dont
have
a
fireplace
to
sit
in
front
of
in
a
rocking
chair
of
course
while
sipping
this
wonderful
drink
and
at
10
2
sipping
may
be
the
way
to
enjoy
it
o
this
beer
is
absolutely
blowing
my
mind
now
its
very
complex
with
a
fruity
vanilla
bourbon
character
as
a
bourbon
drinker
this
is
very
familiar
to
me
and
this
is
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
making
me
warm
and
tingly
with
each
sip
overall
wow
as
a
bourbon
and
scotch
enthusiast
this
was
right
up
my
alley
a
sipper
for
sure
but
dangerously
sippable
at
that
another
great
brew
from
founders
one
of
the
greatest
breweries
in
the
country
this
is
a
heavy
bodied
beer
but
its
easy
drinking
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
its
dangerously
drinkable
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
great
beer
glad
i
have
a
few
more
to
see
how
they
age
overall
i
enjoyed
it
just
as
ive
enjoyed
everything
from
founders
really
a
wonderful
brewery
but
i
dont
need
to
tell
you
that
pick
some
up
and
try
it
it
should
be
noted
that
the
price
18
for
a
fourpack
was
the
going
rate
for
this
brew
in
most
places
locally
i
had
designs
on
buying
a
case
if
i
could
find
one
but
at
that
price
its
a
tough
sell
i
adore
this
beer
but
in
the
end
its
just
beer
insanely
drinkable
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
as
mentioned
is
a
little
thin
but
the
taste
here
will
keep
you
distracted
from
that
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
bourbon
barrel
comes
through
a
lot
but
it
is
not
too
overpowering
so
you
can
still
taste
the
complexities
of
the
grain
bill
o
much
better
than
last
year
but
i
may
have
had
a
bad
batch
on
par
with
2009
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
another
solid
addition
to
founders
bourbon
line
damn
those
guys
know
how
to
work
with
barrels
this
is
a
worthy
altering
of
the
already
solid
dirty
bastard
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
whenever
possible
really
solid
brew
and
its
nice
to
see
something
other
than
a
stout
and
barleywine
as
the
vehicle
of
bourbon
in
beer
o
you
know
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
this
beer
and
its
prevalent
its
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
as
it
plays
really
well
with
the
whole
bourbon
characteristic
the
flavors
are
nice
soft
oak
syrup
and
earth
they
come
together
to
make
a
really
really
nice
flavor
as
a
whole
but
i
cant
bring
myself
to
give
this
beer
a
straight
aa
just
based
on
the
alcohol
content
and
the
hype
around
it
its
a
great
sipping
beer
for
a
cool
fall
night
and
those
who
like
bourbon
andor
scotch
ales
will
find
nirvana
in
this
beer
but
for
me
its
just
very
good
pours
a
dark
brown
color
w
a
one
finger
cocoa
head
that
quickly
disappears
good
carbonation
and
somewhat
weak
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
oak
vanilla
malt
alcohol
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
me
and
warming
doesnt
help
much
not
as
complex
as
i
would
think
for
a
beer
w
this
pedigree
taste
is
the
same
good
but
not
great
somethings
missing
here
it
just
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
or
complexity
that
i
would
expect
from
a
founders
brew
still
its
good
mouthfeel
is
a
disappointment
very
thin
and
carbonated
feel
too
thin
to
be
honest
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
fell
short
of
what
i
had
hoped
for
this
is
a
beer
that
packs
a
hefty
bourbon
punch
but
also
blends
almost
seamlessly
with
the
wee
heavy
base
this
is
a
brew
that
would
probably
benefit
from
a
few
years
of
aging
o
a
real
winner
definitely
need
to
find
as
many
as
i
can
to
hoard
another
awesome
brew
from
founders
o
fantastic
beer
im
going
to
go
purchase
some
more
cant
believe
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
tried
it
definitely
tasty
right
now
but
im
very
interested
in
what
a
little
aging
will
do
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
fullish
and
somewhat
creamysyrupy
yet
not
cloying
in
flavor
the
sweet
upfront
taste
followed
by
a
dry
finish
turns
me
off
slightly
the
carbonation
is
very
fine
and
lightens
the
body
a
bit
i
like
this
beer
but
one
at
a
time
is
enough
to
satisfy
i
would
love
to
age
a
bottle
for
3
years
and
revisit
if
not
ill
pass
on
it
fresh
overall
impression
lighter
weight
cousin
to
kbs
excellent
beer
im
gonna
stop
reviewing
and
enjoy
the
rest
of
it
o
strong
and
boozy
but
enjoyable
knockout
completely
nails
it
very
enoyable
beer
o
quality
stuff
very
balanced
some
heavy
oak
aged
beers
are
way
too
sweet
this
beer
is
just
about
spot
on
overall
a
very
good
beer
its
nice
to
find
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
that
isnt
all
bourbon
this
beer
balances
a
very
good
base
beer
with
the
addition
of
the
barrel
aging
the
scotch
ale
flavor
is
complex
and
the
boubon
barrel
aging
only
adds
to
that
complexity
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
highly
recommended
o
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
dirty
bastard
witness
the
power
of
bourbon
barrelageing
overall
great
beer
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
and
would
love
to
have
a
couple
to
keep
around
for
a
while
i
will
look
fo
it
in
the
bottle
this
year
overy
very
good
beer
o
such
a
great
style
so
old
and
perfect
for
a
chilly
night
pours
a
dark
brown
oaken
color
that
is
very
nearly
opaque
a
small
thin
layer
of
tan
head
develops
bud
dissipates
quickly
small
patches
of
wet
lacing
are
left
as
the
beer
diminishes
smells
of
bourbon
caramel
some
toffee
a
touch
of
vanilla
oak
and
some
dark
sugary
fruit
cherries
date
tastes
of
caramel
toffee
vanilla
oak
bourbon
and
the
same
dark
fruits
very
well
balanced
and
palatable
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
hidden
only
noticeably
by
a
warming
exhale
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
and
it
finishes
a
touch
dry
overall
a
spectacular
brew
that
i
could
easily
sip
on
all
evening
it
pains
me
that
i
dont
have
regular
access
to
this
edit
upping
my
score
on
taste
after
sampling
the
current
2011
batch
the
bourbon
seems
more
well
blended
for
a
smoother
and
tastier
overall
flavor
fantastic
beer
o
excellent
offering
from
founders
and
a
great
take
on
an
already
awesome
beer
dirty
bastard
another
excellent
bourbon
beer
from
founders
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
no
doubt
with
almost
a
year
on
it
its
a
pleasantly
for
the
most
part
boozy
coldweatherappropriate
sipper
thats
stays
relatively
close
to
the
british
style
of
wee
heavy
yet
for
about
12
a
4pk
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
depth
or
complexity
id
need
for
it
to
become
a
regular
seasonal
purchase
smells
like
smoke
tea
a
little
caramel
light
oak
and
savory
spice
taste
is
the
same
with
some
earthy
hops
added
not
very
boozy
and
i
can
still
taste
base
beer
the
2010
vintage
i
aged
for
a
year
was
boozier
than
this
fresh
one
would
probably
give
this
a
bb
medium
to
full
bodied
firm
and
a
bit
drying
founders
take
on
the
wee
heavy
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
maintains
the
scottish
character
but
the
added
complexity
of
the
oak
bourbon
barrel
aging
really
sets
this
beer
apart
overall
another
solid
offering
from
founders
in
the
future
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
a
750ml
bottle
o
this
is
a
big
beer
really
enjoyed
the
big
bourbon
flavors
not
over
powering
but
really
balanced
really
impressed
this
bottle
poured
out
as
a
light
muddy
brown
color
with
a
soft
creamy
looking
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
thin
but
sticks
nicely
the
smell
of
booze
maple
some
fennel
malts
and
wood
all
flood
out
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
light
vanilla
flavors
sweet
malts
a
light
amount
of
bourbon
and
some
earth
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
has
some
soft
bubbles
and
a
smooth
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
overall
i
am
very
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
i
had
wanted
to
give
it
a
shot
for
a
while
and
i
did
my
best
to
enjoy
each
sip
of
this
this
beer
is
great
but
isnt
my
favorite
from
founders
my
very
last
2010
poured
into
my
oversized
snifter
pours
a
translucent
mohagony
body
with
almost
no
headminimal
lacing
denotes
the
booze
presence
and
wow
are
you
greated
in
the
nose
with
bourbon
but
it
is
every
pleasent
aroma
that
bourbon
has
to
offermixed
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
honestly
a
truely
exceptional
nose
the
taste
is
great
just
what
you
would
expect
out
of
a
good
wee
heavy
but
with
a
nice
bourbon
presence
a
bit
boozy
on
the
back
end
though
and
the
aint
so
bad
a
nice
mouthfeel
to
a
wonderful
beer
overall
this
is
another
badass
beer
from
founderseasily
my
favorite
brewery
i
definately
recommend
this
beera
must
try
o
great
beer
from
founders
again
you
get
the
initial
flavors
of
dirty
bastard
and
then
the
perfect
blend
of
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
finish
off
the
beer
perfectly
a
must
try
drink
as
its
a
10
2
abv
its
a
sipper
but
it
surprised
me
with
how
easily
drinking
it
was
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
colder
winter
months
given
that
warming
alcohol
taste
o
more
and
more
this
is
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
really
like
how
the
barrel
integrates
into
the
base
beer
and
comes
out
a
winner
thanks
mike
not
to
bad
considering
this
is
not
really
a
style
that
ive
ever
much
enjoyed
overall
a
really
nice
bourbon
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
the
booze
is
a
bit
heavy
in
the
nose
but
it
blends
well
in
the
taste
a
nice
complex
and
warming
sipper
definitely
recommended
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
bottle
from
a
friend
this
beer
is
absolutely
incredible
very
smooth
taste
definitely
can
tell
it
was
aged
in
oak
barrels
if
you
arent
a
fan
of
the
oak
aged
beers
then
this
one
might
not
be
for
you
but
this
beer
is
no
joke
some
bite
of
whiskey
on
the
front
end
but
smooths
right
out
i
think
one
is
enough
for
drinking
one
of
these
i
wish
i
had
several
more
o
this
is
a
nice
brew
not
as
stunning
as
i
remembered
it
but
nevertheless
its
a
beer
to
take
your
time
with
and
appreciate
illegitimate
or
not
backwoods
bastard
is
a
glorious
wee
heavy
showcasing
a
smooth
and
surprisingly
drinkable
blend
of
beer
and
barrel
its
great
now
but
the
flavors
may
yet
be
able
to
develop
more
good
thing
i
have
a
bottle
from
2009
nestled
away
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
i
feel
it
could
be
a
little
more
carbonated
but
the
mouthfeel
compliments
the
flavor
profile
pretty
well
ratio
is
in
favor
of
the
malts
but
a
good
ratiobalance
slight
tingle
on
the
tongue
from
the
alcohol
pretty
darn
drinkable
perfect
after
dinner
drink
or
nightcap
not
typical
to
the
style
but
i
love
what
founders
is
doing
here
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
this
beer
is
expensive
but
well
worth
it
it
has
an
excellent
brown
body
with
amber
tone
there
is
average
head
but
the
lace
has
a
lot
of
staying
power
it
has
strong
aroma
of
bourbon
roasted
malt
it
is
very
rich
it
has
candy
and
bourbon
flavor
with
wood
caramel
and
some
vanilla
esters
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
some
burn
a
very
good
desert
or
night
cap
beer
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
was
too
much
on
a
hot
day
in
texas
so
im
sure
id
give
it
higher
had
it
been
winter
overall
i
remember
having
this
fresh
and
almost
gagging
but
after
about
8
months
possibly
at
the
most
a
year
if
you
want
to
age
it
its
about
as
good
as
it
will
get
very
tasty
bourbon
beer
thats
worth
the
4
50
price
tag
especially
considering
some
cant
even
find
this
right
now
at
the
most
one
a
sitting
since
the
bourbon
goes
right
to
your
head
o
great
brew
by
founders
i
am
going
to
keep
this
on
my
radar
so
that
i
can
buy
some
and
throw
them
in
the
cellar
next
time
has
tastes
of
yeast
oak
fudged
corn
corn
booze
malt
tang
nesquik
and
vinegar
had
this
several
times
now
and
liked
each
time
a
little
bettera
little
more
than
when
i
had
previously
good
stuff
i
want
some
more
alas
i
cant
get
founders
here
o
a
solid
barrel
aged
beer
i
actually
liked
both
versions
equally
i
liked
the
strong
bourbon
flavour
in
the
fresh
one
only
cuz
i
love
bourbon
but
it
was
very
alcoholhot
and
i
like
the
2009
because
it
had
mellowed
out
and
allowed
the
oakiness
and
vanilla
to
shine
through
but
less
bourbon
flavour
great
beer
loved
it
i
am
thinking
i
need
more
of
this
to
share
with
my
buddy
who
frequents
his
bourbon
bottle
as
a
nightcap
overall
this
was
an
excellent
bonus
thanks
to
prototypic
for
this
gem
i
loved
every
sip
of
this
beer
this
beer
had
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
some
serious
boozy
notes
bottom
line
if
you
cant
take
the
heat
get
out
of
the
kitchen
son
this
beer
will
eat
your
lunch
i
have
long
been
critical
of
overbarreled
beers
and
i
imagine
in
previous
years
or
exceptionally
fresh
that
this
beer
could
suffer
from
the
traits
it
plays
with
here
but
pulls
off
ive
had
several
over
the
last
few
months
and
its
a
beer
that
id
always
be
glad
to
dust
off
from
the
cellar
and
pour
into
a
snifter
or
tulip
and
nurse
as
the
evenings
cool
settles
in
overall
smooth
and
delicious
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
rather
thick
mouthfeel
it
is
easily
drinkable
despite
its
slight
stickiness
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
light
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
rings
upon
rings
upon
rings
of
lace
on
the
drink
down
very
nice
looking
lacing
with
this
beer
smells
of
toasted
coconut
some
wood
alcohol
and
malt
taste
has
the
toasted
coconut
slight
wood
flavors
some
vanilla
and
malts
i
am
not
really
getting
any
stand
out
bourbon
alcohol
smells
or
tastes
from
this
beer
low
carbonation
with
a
thick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
pretty
taste
beer
with
some
nice
toasted
coconut
qualities
i
love
coconut
i
could
probably
only
handle
one
of
these
at
a
time
though
doverall
it
was
not
the
wee
heavy
scotch
ale
i
was
hoping
for
def
a
good
brew
but
just
alittle
too
dry
and
boozy
for
me
i
wanted
a
tab
bit
more
sweet
and
refreshing
but
still
a
good
beer
would
drink
again
but
i
think
their
are
better
wee
heavys
overall
another
great
offering
from
founders
i
am
going
to
let
a
few
bottle
sit
for
a
while
and
this
beer
should
be
perfect
still
a
bit
hot
but
delicious
reminds
me
of
tyranena
bgw
shaggin
in
the
woods
but
heavier
o
very
enjoyable
look
forward
to
getting
my
hands
on
more
of
this
one
easy
to
drink
especially
for
a
scotch
ale
which
i
usually
find
very
hot
overall
great
beer
i
like
this
one
alot
warm
complex
a
sipper
better
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
cheers
glad
i
chose
a
snifter
this
one
warms
up
nicely
to
bring
out
the
notes
from
the
nose
and
its
definitely
a
oneanddone
big
o
another
fantastic
barrelaged
brew
from
founders
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
o
great
for
a
strong
ale
the
only
negative
for
me
is
just
little
to
strong
on
the
bourbon
enjoy
the
subtle
oak
notes
though
o
i
like
this
a
lot
this
would
be
a
perfect
cold
weather
sipper
a
very
high
quality
complex
brew
once
again
from
founders
o
alcohol
incredibly
wellhidden
not
at
all
the
tast
profile
i
anticipated
but
certainly
enjoyable
for
the
price
at
least
in
my
area
this
will
not
be
a
yearly
musthave
but
i
will
no
doubt
enjoy
this
beer
another
time
or
two
d
this
is
not
a
beer
for
the
average
beer
drinker
this
is
a
gnarly
beer
very
strong
bourbon
presence
and
the
10
2
does
not
go
unnoticed
definitely
a
sipper
however
if
you
like
bourbon
and
aggressive
beers
then
give
this
one
a
try
dtoo
much
bourbon
flavor
to
make
this
one
more
than
a
sipper
for
me
bourbon
whiskey
lovers
will
like
this
one
beer
is
too
overloaded
to
be
enjoyed
as
more
then
a
novelty
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
thick
and
the
finish
is
full
this
beer
is
almost
too
much
there
is
no
balance
in
the
beer
it
has
too
much
booze
in
the
beer
the
beer
needs
to
age
for
a
couple
of
years
to
mellow
it
out
the
beer
is
just
too
strong
to
drink
it
is
a
sipper
di
enjoy
this
beer
each
time
i
have
it
this
years
vintage
is
no
exception
i
can
put
down
mulitples
on
this
loved
this
beer
will
definitely
look
to
buy
again
is
very
much
a
sipper
and
i
look
forward
to
finishing
this
glass
rarely
am
i
given
the
chance
to
rate
a
beer
so
highly
this
is
so
far
beyond
any
other
american
scotch
ale
it
is
the
standard
for
american
beers
in
this
style
bourbon
to
the
fore
add
to
that
the
gentle
aroma
of
citrus
with
a
heavy
malty
tang
a
dense
taste
of
orange
peels
lemons
rope
cocoa
butter
oak
new
leather
shoes
is
there
anything
not
to
envy
in
this
beer
this
can
go
head
to
head
with
any
uk
scotch
ale
best
enjoyed
in
a
snifter
or
a
thistle
while
playing
the
piano
or
on
ones
front
porch
on
an
almostspring
new
england
afternoon
an
incredible
beer
by
any
standard
im
surly
bumbed
this
is
gone
rudy
reddish
brown
and
opaque
in
the
glass
light
tanish
head
which
leaves
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
slightly
one
dimisional
and
whiskey
based
not
much
wood
or
oak
just
high
spirit
aroma
vanilla
caramel
and
brown
sugar
my
taste
buds
tingle
with
tasty
brown
sugar
sweet
vanilla
creme
brulee
cheap
whiskey
and
faint
oak
notes
this
beer
reminds
me
of
liquid
bread
pudding
somehow
it
isnt
cloying
but
there
is
a
lingering
flavor
silky
id
say
damn
wish
i
had
more
of
this
founders
truly
knows
what
they
are
doing
with
bal
aged
beers
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
someday
o
definitely
a
sipper
but
this
is
one
that
just
comes
together
right
it
would
be
better
with
less
booziness
on
the
initial
hit
but
that
seemed
to
go
away
as
it
warmed
and
i
got
further
into
the
glass
so
the
verdict
is
that
this
isnt
a
favorite
beer
from
founders
for
me
not
a
big
deal
they
make
plenty
other
good
ones
creamy
and
full
nice
and
smooth
with
soft
carbonation
a
great
beer
here
founders
really
hit
the
mark
on
this
one
really
one
of
the
finer
examples
of
this
style
d
seems
to
be
o
now
the
bourbon
booziness
and
sweetness
is
detracting
from
the
drinkability
for
me
scotch
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
to
start
with
and
i
love
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
so
i
might
just
be
having
a
hard
time
not
separating
these
tastes
this
is
an
absolute
sipper
that
i
really
needed
to
take
my
time
with
this
beer
pours
a
dark
caramel
to
light
brown
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
the
smell
is
bourbon
up
front
with
toffee
and
vanilla
notes
swirling
around
in
there
too
the
flavor
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
bourbon
being
apparent
immediately
and
then
the
sweet
caramelized
malts
followed
by
some
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sweet
and
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
this
is
a
definate
sipper
and
not
a
liter
mug
guzzler
its
smell
is
quite
nice
with
some
vanilla
bourbon
and
dark
roasted
malts
taking
a
sip
of
bb
i
get
some
oak
scotch
a
little
chocolate
mf
is
mediumheavy
a
bit
rich
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
i
continue
to
be
happy
from
my
founders
purchases
when
i
am
traveling
tothrough
nearby
states
live
in
ct
od
good
flavor
and
is
overall
not
your
typical
scottish
ale
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
o
glad
i
got
this
one
this
was
appropriate
as
a
long
slow
sipper
the
hoppiness
surprised
me
but
this
was
a
well
made
beer
the
cpj
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
very
nice
lots
of
kick
and
a
wonderful
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
most
definitely
a
beer
for
sipping
the
alcohol
is
prevelant
but
it
is
surprisingly
not
distracting
its
noticeable
in
the
mouthfeel
but
its
not
unbearable
after
one
of
these
i
would
more
than
likely
be
done
not
from
lack
of
enjoyment
but
lack
of
alcohol
tolerance
very
dark
amber
color
with
white
head
smell
is
off
sweet
cherries
and
strong
bourbon
taste
is
similar
although
bourbon
is
more
forward
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
more
nondescript
than
the
specific
cherry
flavor
in
the
smell
also
strong
malt
flavor
medium
bodied
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
its
brother
beer
dirty
bastard
the
bourbon
adds
a
nice
complexity
i
enjoy
far
more
than
the
straight
malt
in
dirty
bastard
d
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
meant
to
be
slowly
appreciated
great
brew
overall
d
mmmm
strong
but
i
want
another
and
would
buy
a
22
oz
or
a
6pack
maybe
if
it
came
as
such
a
4pack
if
in
that
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
although
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
md
if
given
the
chance
to
get
this
on
tap
i
would
jump
at
the
chance
i
really
love
this
beer
and
have
enjoyed
many
a
bottle
but
the
freshness
from
the
growlertap
pour
does
wonders
for
this
beer
founders
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
but
this
is
one
of
the
highlights
of
their
catalog
overall
although
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
a
wee
heavy
with
this
level
of
abv
the
nicely
balanced
flavor
profile
makes
up
for
it
founders
does
not
make
a
bad
beer
the
do
just
about
everything
right
in
any
style
they
try
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
like
i
got
a
single
from
duffextracold
and
im
now
going
out
buy
a
case
favorite
beer
whereas
i
could
see
where
this
beer
could
be
much
better
id
love
to
see
some
of
the
scotch
ale
actually
poke
through
i
love
the
extreme
bourbon
im
a
huge
bourbon
fan
but
can
stomach
too
much
alcohol
i
think
i
just
found
the
solution
overall
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
hand
all
the
time
just
a
great
beer
to
smell
sip
and
enjoy
after
having
this
both
fresh
and
with
age
i
actually
prefer
it
fresh
though
but
it
was
still
good
with
age
but
the
toffee
notes
which
i
love
faded
a
bit
kudos
to
founders
well
crafted
overall
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
even
if
its
not
pretty
definitely
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
to
date
the
oak
and
bourbon
flavors
are
definitely
present
and
unmistakable
but
very
well
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
a
very
nicely
done
beer
by
founders
the
bourbon
barrel
certainly
takes
center
stage
on
this
one
so
if
you
dont
like
bourbon
this
may
not
be
a
good
one
for
you
i
thought
it
went
down
very
easy
and
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
d
this
is
a
delight
to
drink
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
is
impressive
i
bought
2
bottle
to
have
one
now
and
save
the
other
for
later
the
other
bottle
didnt
last
a
month
well
done
d
surprisingly
well
balanced
the
caramel
sweetness
of
the
scotch
ale
blends
well
with
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
notes
overall
solid
beer
2013
edit
after
trying
this
beer
several
more
times
both
aged
and
not
aged
i
have
changed
my
score
accordingly
i
remain
endlessly
curious
as
to
what
age
will
do
to
my
other
bottles
good
stuff
this
years
backwoods
and
breakfast
stout
releases
confirm
for
me
that
founders
is
consistent
d
definately
a
sipper
this
is
a
cool
weather
brew
that
takes
a
while
to
consume
sip
by
sip
you
wont
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
unless
youre
a
huge
bourbon
fan
it
is
delicious
though
and
my
only
complaint
is
a
slightly
dry
phenolic
finish
im
not
grabbing
this
when
i
want
a
scotch
ale
but
its
a
wonderful
sipper
when
you
want
that
bourbon
feel
but
dont
want
the
heaviness
of
a
stout
a
sipper
but
every
enjoyable
try
d
really
hides
the
alcohol
at
first
but
after
it
sits
in
the
gut
for
a
bit
you
get
the
warmth
overall
not
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
ever
had
but
still
a
decent
beer
id
drink
it
again
great
for
cold
weather
probably
only
one
in
a
sitting
poured
from
the
bottle
a
dark
amber
copper
with
a
soft
tannish
head
that
disapated
quickly
the
nose
was
dominated
by
oak
and
burbon
lots
of
it
but
under
it
you
could
smell
smoke
bready
malt
and
light
wisp
of
alcohol
taste
is
big
and
bold
burbon
vanilla
oak
and
bready
malt
hit
you
big
upfront
big
on
the
burbon
the
taste
finishes
dry
and
warm
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
quick
very
light
on
the
carbonatio
as
would
be
expected
from
an
aged
beer
drinkability
is
marked
as
be
careful
good
brew
but
strong
and
dangerous
very
nice
beer
backwoods
smells
of
bourbon
toasted
vanilla
sweet
toffee
and
roasted
dark
malts
tastes
of
caramely
malts
balanced
by
bitter
smoke
and
all
pulled
together
by
bourbon
deliciousness
long
smoky
finish
similar
to
burned
marshmallows
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
warm
from
the
10
2
abv
definitely
a
slow
sipper
on
to
the
wants
you
will
go
this
is
a
wonderful
barrel
aged
beer
highly
addicting
flavor
but
the
booziness
assures
you
cannot
manage
more
than
a
sip
at
a
time
d
very
drinkable
due
to
the
high
abv
this
is
one
that
i
can
say
i
would
highly
recommend
and
will
be
getting
for
myself
again
loved
it
bourbon
amount
is
perfect
in
this
beer
sweet
but
well
attenuated
with
enough
bitterness
and
alcohol
to
counter
the
sweetness
d
fairly
drinkable
knocking
in
at
a
relatively
high
10
20
abv
this
is
a
fairly
heavy
beer
and
is
best
sipped
that
being
said
the
booze
flavors
stay
in
check
for
high
level
and
the
flavor
is
just
amazingly
well
balanced
and
complex
excellent
beer
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
plummaroon
color
with
little
to
no
white
head
doing
anything
but
lacing
on
the
surface
the
aroma
is
a
lot
of
malts
hanging
out
together
and
having
a
party
in
this
glass
there
is
an
overwhelmingly
sweet
aroma
coming
off
of
the
nose
of
this
beer
this
beer
truly
is
a
bastard
because
i
really
cant
figure
out
all
of
the
flavors
its
really
trying
to
go
for
the
short
answer
is
that
i
like
it
but
i
dont
know
why
i
believe
that
there
is
a
definite
whiskey
kick
to
this
beer
that
is
more
prevalent
in
the
back
of
the
palate
there
might
even
be
a
touch
of
smoked
malts
used
its
a
true
malt
bomb
in
every
sense
of
the
word
its
got
a
really
decent
mouthfeel
but
is
almost
too
sweet
and
strong
to
easily
take
down
without
a
lot
of
time
on
your
hands
drinkability
i
have
been
spacing
my
beers
out
tonight
so
i
wouldnt
be
too
tipsy
to
review
them
and
i
can
honestly
say
for
the
abv
i
have
no
taste
of
alcohol
nor
warming
this
is
a
very
rich
beer
though
one
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
as
has
been
shown
sensory
feelings
i
e
taste
or
smell
are
very
strong
and
this
beer
for
some
reason
brings
me
back
to
happy
childhood
memories
which
makes
it
all
the
better
a
very
solid
brew
im
not
a
bourbon
person
so
this
was
a
miss
for
me
but
its
a
nice
foray
into
maltforward
and
bal
side
of
experimental
brews
as
opposed
to
massive
ipas
or
sours
pours
a
ruddy
amber
with
iridescent
orange
hues
no
real
head
to
speak
of
some
descent
but
oily
looking
lacing
i
can
smell
the
bourbon
bomb
from
an
arms
length
so
this
should
be
interesting
upon
closer
inspection
with
my
nose
i
detect
vanilla
and
cola
slight
oak
and
thats
about
it
taste
is
upfront
bourbon
wow
ok
this
is
too
much
for
me
but
ill
try
to
judge
it
fairly
based
on
merit
vanilla
cola
bourbon
some
slight
char
somewhere
in
there
but
damn
this
is
like
a
bourbon
cut
with
a
lager
there
aint
much
else
than
that
i
know
others
love
that
sort
of
thing
but
there
is
no
balance
there
for
me
carbonation
is
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
body
is
dry
like
a
bourbon
heavy
mixer
with
coke
im
giving
this
an
average
score
as
nothing
really
stands
out
in
this
for
me
aside
from
the
bourbon
overall
i
like
the
effort
founders
masters
put
towards
this
one
not
exactly
my
cup
of
teabourbon
but
enjoyed
for
the
time
drinkability
this
is
my
first
founders
brewing
co
beer
and
i
feel
like
i
started
on
top
with
this
particular
one
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
and
anytime
just
sad
that
this
was
my
only
one
if
your
ever
in
eyesight
of
backwoods

had
this
at
the

tasting
at

hunt
in
dc
in
november
2010
it
was
poured
into
a
small
glass
and
never
really
had
much
head
but
quite
enjoyable
on
a
cold
night
i
like
this
just
a
touch
more
than
the
nonbarreled
offering
as
usual

i
wasnt

aware
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
scotch
ale
when
i
bought
it
its
not
really
like
any
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
scotch
strong
w
bourbon
but
it
was
overall
excellent
and
one
of
founders
better
efforts

although
a
bit
of
bourbon
flavor
there
is
no
booziness
or
alcohol
burn
great
to
sip
very
tasty
drinkability
okay
so
i
know
for
the
regular
beer
drinker
this
may
be
way
too
strong
but
as
far
as
barrelaged
goes
i
find
this
one
to
be
highly
drinkable
it
really
doesnt
give
off
a
heavy
booziness
unlike
some
other
offerings
which
is
nice
if
i
could
only
drink
one
barrelaged
beer
this
might
very
well
be
it
great
job
this
is
a
very
nice
enjoyable
beer
to
be
enjoyed
at
a
slow
pace
the
sweetness
dies
down
as
the
beer
reaches
room
temperature
making
it
a
little
more
enjoyable
to
me
great
job
founders
dhigh
abv
i
think
not
the
taste
is
amazing
and
it
stays
so
well
there
is
no
alcohol
note
whatsoever
i
loved
this
beer
and
i
hope
to
have
a
lot
more
of
it
d
this
beast
qualifies
as
a
nice
a
slow
sipper
high
abv
and
bourbon
foward
make
this
one
to
seek
out
for
those
who
love
balaged
beers
very
good
and
well
crafted
makes
this
one
worth
revisiting
again
d
i
think
i
just
dont
much
care
for
bourbonbarrel
aged
beers
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
interesting
things
going
on
but
its
just
not
for
me
a
little
boozier
than
id
like
but
its
really
that
overwhelming
bourbonsweetness
that
turns
me
off
here
and
at
10
2
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
pound
several
of
these
in
a
given
night
even
if
you
liked
it
good
the
impression
of
scotch
whisky
is
very
well
done
for
a
beer
with
an
abv
over
10
the
alcohol
is
caped
very
well
the
complexity
of
the
characters
in
this
beer
make
it
one
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
to
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
you
should
certainly
get
your
hand
on
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
feel
that
it
will
be
better
with
a
little
age
the
alcohol
will
have
a
chance
to
balance
out
the
finish
could
be
a
little
longer
for
a
sipper
i
wish
this
beer
displayed
a
little
more
complexity
as
it
warms
backwoods
bastard
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
simultaneously
gives
a
tutorial
as
to
why
people
age
beer
in
bourbon
barrels
and
a
benchmark
against
which
one
can
measure
the
success
of
other
barrel
aged
beers
worth
the
large
pricetag
around
15
per
4pack
if
im
not
mistaken
the
flavor
of
the
scotch
ale
is
strong
and
rich
with
a
toffee
quality
w
pine
from
the
hops
and
lots
of
vanilla
from
the
barrel
the
taste
is
nutty
with
earthy
flavor
and
mild
woody
taste
like
a
vanilla
toffee
spice
with
a
moderately
strong
bourbon
flavor
there
is
a
bitter
presence
that
dominates
w
a
caramel
candy
and
bitter
presence
w
more
sweetness
evident
in
the
taste
as
it
warms
i
was
overjoyed
when
mike
offered
this
growler
to
me
a
wonderful
oak
and
bourbon
element
presents
itself
so
well
w
lots
of
roasted
and
candylike
notes
yet
strength
is
high
in
the
flavor
and
feel
it
fits
the
style
well
and
has
exceptional
drinkability
in
my
opinion
i
was
truly
grateful
for
the
gift
i
almost
drank
a
whole
growler
save
for
2
pints
conclusion
one
of
my
favorite
beers
smooth
and
thick
this
is
pleasant
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
clearly
there
but
not
overwhelming
an
excellent
winter
warmer
that
is
good
from
start
to
finish
maybe
im
a
lightweight
low
abv
smooth
drinking
bastards
not
from
the
backwoods
still
well
made
though
can
never
deny
founders
that
cheers
this
is
an
alltime
favorite
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
a
onceayear
release
tastemouthfeeldrinkability
really
enjoyed
it
the
flavors
tracked
the
initial
nose
not
the
later
more
alcoholic
aromatic
shift
got
hints
of
coconut
as
well
as
toffee
oak
and
scotch
bourbon
element
was
nicely
balanced
not
overpowering
as
in
some
ales
though
i
really
like
good
bourbon
nice
mediumheavy
volume
extremely
drinkable
though
you
would
not
want
several
in
a
row
nice
for
sipping
this
is
still
a
must
try
come
on
now
its
founders
an
interesting
stab
at
an
oakaged
scotch
ale
it
seems
though
that
the
bourbon
character
overwhelms
the
other
flavors
and
aromas
at
times
its
still
very
good
id
just
like
a
little
more
scotch
ale
flavor
to
come
through
recommended
but
steer
clear
if
you
dont
like
bourbon
i
bought
one
4er
and
then
immediately
bought
3
more
with
the
intent
of
aging
some
so
i
guess
you
can
imagine
how
i
feel
about
it
after
having
dirty
bastard
i
didnt
think
this
one
would
be
this
good
but
this
is
exquisite
d
off
the
charts
probably
the
smoothest
wee
heavy
ive
had
the
barrel
aging
in
this
beauty
was
masterfully
crafted
i
highly
recommend
getting
your
hands
on
some
of
this
goodness
backwoods
bastard
is
some
damn
yummy
stuff
founders
astounds
with
this
one
if
there
is
a
bastard
who
lives
in
the
backwoods
somewhere
in
michigan
probably
the
u
p
this
would
be
whats
for
breakfast
drink
i
have
one
i
want
more
drinkability
i
could
probably
drink
two
of
these
in
a
row
before
i
felt
compelled
to
call
it
a
night
this
is
a
big
beer
and
it
drinks
like
a
dessert
the
boozy
fumes
are
powerful
but
not
overwhelming
definitely
one
to
sip
and
enjoy
the
nuances
and
subtleties
this
beer
is
not
for
your
everyday
beer
drinker
this
beer
pours
like
the
red
seas
and
the
aroma
of
this
beer
opens
up
the
bourbon
barrel
the
first
sip
is
a
full
mouth
of
delight
but
the
way
it
makes
you
feel
is
the
best
it
is
to
bad
thiss
beer
is
very
limited
thankyou
founder
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
and
smooth
drinking
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
nice
despite
the
nice
flavors
and
feel
of
this
beer
i
find
it
very
hard
to
put
more
than
one
down
at
a
time
the
scotch
flavor
and
maltiness
is
great
for
one
beer
but
overstays
its
welcome
after
that
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
pinkys
worth
of
light
tan
head
smells
smokey
malty
and
boozy
a
lot
of
smokiness
tastes
pretty
much
exactly
like
it
smells
boozy
oaky
and
smoky
damn
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
low
carbonation
but
thick
enough
and
drinkability
is
high
at
least
for
me
it
is
an
outstanding
beer
but
if
smoke
flavor
isnt
your
thing
avoid
this
brew
pours
a
very
dark
carmel
color
can
still
see
through
the
glass
very
little
head
but
a
bit
more
carbonation
that
expected
the
smell
is
bourbon
and
alcohol
some
sweetness
to
the
nose
the
flavor
has
maple
syrup
and
vanilla
notes
with
a
good
dose
afftertaste
bitterness
mouthefeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
me
im
not
sure
i
could
get
through
another
one
of
these
at
10
but
its
a
great
12oz
after
dinner
beer
d
this
beer
is
quite
hard
to
get
through
as
a
bottle
its
tasty
but
gets
a
little
old
as
you
go
through
it
this
is
a
12oz
to
share
for
sure
d
for
the
10
abv
this
one
goes
down
suprisingly
easy
while
it
is
definitely
an
excellent
beer
im
not
sure
if
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
the
molasses
gets
a
little
tiring
d
after
dinner
drink
or
one
or
two
with
a
book
when
its
cold
outside
d
very
drinkable
despite
the
abv
a
great
brew
to
sit
back
and
finish
off
the
weekend
with
i
only
tried
14
from
the
pack
as
i
am
interested
to
see
how
it
cellars
d
if
you
like
bourbon
barrel
brews
youll
fall
in
love
with
this
as
soon
as
you
pry
the
cap
off
the
bottle
you
do
have
to
appreciate
bourbon
to
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
though
all
in
all
founders
did
not
let
me
down
here
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
and
well
worth
the
try
d
oh
yeah
o
good
example
of
the
style
d
could
drink
something
that
tastes
like
this
all
day
but
the
syrup
is
and
alcohol
are
a
little
overpowering
need
to
switch
to
something
else
after
this
pours
a
hohum
murky
brown
color
with
a
rather
small
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
brown
sugar
vanilla
some
sour
oak
and
some
sweet
bourbon
pretty
much
all
bourbon
barrel
in
the
nose
but
it
does
smell
quite
nice
very
much
like
the
aroma
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
bourbon
barrel
i
like
to
see
a
sturdy
malt
and
some
smoke
or
wood
flavors
in
a
scotch
ale
but
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
it
it
does
have
a
very
tasty
bourbon
flavor
with
good
vanilla
and
sour
oak
flavors
to
go
along
with
the
bourbon
flavor
the
malt
bring
some
brown
sugar
flavor
and
perhaps
the
lightest
touch
of
peat
the
feel
is
light
with
tingly
carbonation
finishes
quite
sweet
and
a
bit
sticky
not
cloying
for
a
12oz
bottle
there
is
some
boozy
vapors
going
on
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
due
to
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
and
i
scored
it
as
such
however
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
the
malt
pop
through
especially
for
a
10
5abv
brew
if
you
are
going
to
make
it
that
boozy
beef
up
the
malt
if
you
like
the
taste
of
bourbon
is
a
light
body
this
is
for
you
i
like
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
just
needs
to
be
a
tad
thicker
drinkability
is
stratospheric
d
this
has
a
delicious
bourbon
taste
but
it
would
be
better
if
it
incorporated
more
of
the
scotch
flavors
of
dirty
bastard
d
a
lot
of
people
like
this
beer
but
i
just
dont
like
it
at
all
hard
to
get
through
imo
i
have
a
few
bottles
left
ill
gift
them
and
probably
wont
try
this
one
again
d
at
10
2
the
drinkability
is
astounding
with
the
smell
i
assumed
the
beers
scotch
taste
would
be
overpowering
but
it
is
actually
more
subtle
than
i
thought
making
the
beer
much
more
enjoyable
i
could
absolutely
have
a
lot
of
these
in
one
sitting
which
is
dangerous
at
10
2
i
recommend
this
beer
to
any
fans
of
the
style
or
to
anyone
who
simply
enjoys
good
beer
md
medium
to
full
bodied
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
while
very
easy
to
drink
considering
its
abv
i
prefer
to
sip
and
savor
it
very
complex
with
a
lot
of
flavor
p
s
cant
stop
drinking
this
a
true
treat
enjoy
d
this
is
a
heavy
one
but
the
initial
flavor
is
just
so
good
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
night
very
tasty
d
the
high
abv
of
this
bastard
is
the
only
thing
stopping
me
from
drinking
the
whole
four
pack
at
once
its
incredibly
tasty
and
is
everything
i
expect
from
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
ale
i
hope
you
hate
this
beer
so
there
is
more
of
this
limited
release
for
me
ive
heard
it
gets
much
better
with
age
so
the
rest
of
the
four
pack
is
going
into
the
beer
fridge
but
i
am
sorely
disappointed
as
i
tried
hard
to
find
this
fourpack
ddrinkable
but
you
must
like
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
i
tried
to
drink
this
slow
but
i
found
it
to
have
a
somewhat
addictive
quality
d
ive
got
to
say
i
love
bourbon
but
this
is
like
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
for
the
person
who
doesnt
love
a
heavy
dose
of
bourbon
the
bourbon
sweetness
is
highlighted
while
keeping
the
alcohol
heat
at
bay
though
there
is
a
bourbon
aftertaste
because
of
this
this
was
a
beer
i
began
sipping
but
couldnt
stay
away
for
long
i
had
no
problem
polishing
off
a
bottle
at
this
abv
its
probably
best
to
leave
it
at
one
though
d
the
alcohol
doesnt
burn
but
it
just
tastes
awful
truly
truly
gross
fora
finish
if
i
could
capture
the
first
moments
and
let
them
last
id
find
this
to
be
a
good
beer
unfortunately
that
is
not
the
fact
this
10
tastes
more
like
a
20
or
worse
im
forced
to
drink
it
further
as
i
hit
the
middle
of
the
bottle
i
love
this
beer
the
bourbon
vanilla
flavors
are
awsome
so
far
ive
been
nothing
but
impressed
with
what
founders
has
to
offer
i
will
buy
whatever
these
guys
have
to
offer
a
bit
boozy
but
this
is
what
i
love
from
barrel
aged
beers
cant
wait
until
next
years
version
of
this
ill
age
at
least
one
until
then
maybe
more
im
splitting
this
bottle
with
my
brother
and
weve
each
nursed
a
half
for
nearly
an
hour
i
think
this
is
almost
a
liquor
substitute
that
isnt
very
complex
this
young
but
still
solid
and
great
sipping
for
bourbon
or
brandy
fans
i
want
to
like
this
more
than
i
do
its
good
its
a
fine
bourbon
barrel
beer
but
its
not
that
exciting
and
when
im
done
i
rarely
crave
another
one
d
bit
of
a
sipper
but
good
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
deserves
to
be
sipped
while
the
glass
warms
i
think
the
oak
flavor
dominates
a
bit
too
much
id
bet
with
some
age
the
alcohol
notes
would
fade
and
make
this
a
better
balanced
brew
ill
have
to
throw
a
bottle
into
the
cellar
before
they
are
all
gone
has
a
very
nice
driniability
but
at
10
it
only
takes
a
couple
to
feel
nice
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
if
it
wasnt
for
the
abv
phenomenal
beer
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
2
and
nice
for
a
minnesota
winter
daynight
i
could
drink
about
2
before
i
had
enough
its
a
bit
boozy
but
im
ok
with
that
im
not
much
for
scotch
ales
but
i
do
enjoy
is
one
especially
barrel
aged
drinkabilty
well
its
over
10
so
you
cant
drink
it
as
you
like
i
split
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
friend
and
was
happy
so
1
bottle
is
enough
i
can
say
this
should
be
a
top
100
beer
on
here
its
fantastic
and
i
hope
more
people
get
to
drink
it
drinks
pretty
well
for
a
beer
as
strong
and
bourbonheavy
one
in
a
night
is
plenty
to
warm
me
up
though
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
cheers
dthis
is
a
superb
beer
like
so
many
full
flavored
brews
this
should
be
savored
for
its
complexity
and
its
power
i
may
have
just
found
my
new
favorite
wee
heavy
i
may
also
have
just
killed
my
palate
for
the
evening
after
this
anything
you
drink
will
taste
like
water
over
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
i
could
see
why
a
little
time
on
the
shelf
could
settle
this
one
down
a
bit
i
do
think
the
bourbon
flavor
is
complex
and
not
without
its
charm
but
a
little
time
to
melt
into
the
rest
of
the
flavors
could
help
the
overall
balance
t
perfect
balance
of
bourbon
some
of
these
taste
too
strong
of
bourbon
which
i
hate
this
one
tastes
so
sweet
you
forget
about
the
10
abv
i
cant
account
for
the
goodbutnotgreat
reviews
for
this
beer
theres
a
big
disparity
between
the
tapped
and
bottled
version
maybe
i
dunno
what
i
do
know
is
that
this
tasted
like
a
world
class
brew
and
id
love
a
chance
to
try
it
again
what
kind
of
barrels
are
these
in
remind
me
never
to
buy
that
bourbon
d
can
i
have
another
please
now
yeah
its
that
easy
to
drink
small
sips
only
please
savor
every
morsel
as
my
momma
used
to
say
d
pretty
good
maybe
one
bottle
is
good
d
a
little
boozy
and
i
think
ill
try
to
age
my
remaining
bottle
and
see
how
it
mellows
fuller
body
some
dry
and
stickiness
in
the
feel
definitely
a
super
slow
sipper
but
delicious
if
youre
into
bourbon
and
whiskey
flavors
you
can
feel
this
beer
going
all
the
way
down
and
despite
its
super
bold
flavors
i
found
it
very
tasty
i
love
this
beer
yet
another
winner
for
founders
dm
the
aging
really
has
given
this
the
characteristic
of
a
scotchy
smoothness
it
goes
down
really
easily
which
is
scary
because
you
dont
overly
sense
the
10
alcohol
that
goes
into
this
bad
boy
very
nice
to
sit
and
enjoy
but
hard
to
switch
to
other
beers
that
do
not
pair
the
weight
let
me
preface
this
with
saying
that
i
love
scotch
ales
i
love
old
chubb
and
i
typically
love
beers
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
black
ops
comes
to
mind
that
being
said
i
had
a
really
hard
time
finishing
one
bottle
of
this
4
pack
it
was
like
drinking
bourbon
almost
no
beer
taste
to
be
found
if
you
love
bourbon
you
will
love
this
beer
but
be
warned
that
it
is
extremely
overpowering
i
typically
love
founders
beers
had
the
breakfast
stout
and
nemesis
on
tap
last
night
but
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
one
again
d
overall
they
are
advertising
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
they
get
that
for
sure
however
i
would
like
to
get
something
else
besides
bourbon
and
sugar
i
think
it
is
a
good
beer
and
interesting
however
i
wouldnt
purchase
again
i
paid
14
for
a
4
pack
poured
into
a
snifter
at
the
mohawk
house
in
sparta
nj
deep
opaque
reddishmahogany
with
one
finger
of
beige
head
that
retained
and
laced
excellently
very
little
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
revealed
a
huge
cherryvanillawhiskeyoak
essence
with
some
caramel
apple
and
smoke
as
well
the
taste
wow
sweet
malty
caramelapple
cherryvanilla
then
followed
by
more
sweet
fruitiness
before
finishing
on
an
ever
so
subtle
bitter
peel
finish
that
hid
the
alcohol
content
ridiculously
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
it
wasnt
for
the
whiskey
in
the
nose
i
wouldnt
get
much
hint
of
alcohol
at
all
the
feel
was
a
silky
smooth
medium
thickness
with
no
carbonation
the
crazy
thing
is
that
the
alcohol
presence
is
such
a
nonfactor
that
you
can
find
yourself
having
downed
three
snifters
of
this
stuff
and
still
be
yearning
to
session
more
i
know
i
was
anyway
i
sampled
this
at
my
virgin
trip
to
the
fine
establishment
known
as
the
mohawk
house
see
review
but
even
if
i
didnt
like
the
place
i
wouldve
come
back
just
for
this
beer
i
cant
remember
when
i
have
given
a
beer
review
5s
across
the
board
if
ever
this
beer
is
excellently
done
on
all
fronts
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
some
red
hues
i
it
creamy
off
white
head
with
alcohol
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
pure
malty
bourbon
with
a
nice
sweet
caramelized
bourbon
aroma
the
flavor
starts
out
intense
but
falls
off
completely
really
lands
flat
and
boozy
on
the
backend
initial
sweetness
and
starts
out
very
nice
but
dry
and
austere
on
the
finish
nothing
going
on
but
booze
after
the
first
second
as
for
drinkability
this
is
ok
not
something
i
want
more
than
one
of
but
for
what
it
is
i
think
its
a
definately
sipper
and
a
sharing
bottle
worth
a
shot
but
not
on
par
with
their
other
bourbon
a
barrel
beers
d
the
high
abv
and
sweetness
might
get
to
be
a
bit
much
but
with
some
age
and
temperature
warmth
this
baby
is
a
winner
deep
brown
pour
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
into
a
faint
ring
sticks
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
of
bourbon
cherry
and
vanilla
it
almost
feels
as
though
the
bourbon
aroma
is
burning
my
nose
hairs
big
caramel
burnt
sugar
roasted
malt
and
bourbon
flavor
big
chewy
body
and
very
boozy
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
this
is
a
big
beer
founders
makes
great
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
exactly
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
bourbon
aged
scotch
ale
and
this
is
near
the
top
of
the
list
when
it
comes
to
bourbon
aged
beers
the
best
bourbon
aged
beer
that
ive
ever
had
was
brewed
by
jeremy
for
the
ba
party
at
hopcat
a
bourbon
aged
porter
on
nitro
that
tasted
like
chocolate
milk
great
beer
try
it
d
the
nice
bourbon
flavors
are
accompanied
by
quite
a
punch
of
alcohol
i
know
this
beer
is
10
but
wow
this
could
definitely
benefit
from
some
aging
which
would
probably
take
away
the
alcohol
flavor
in
favor
of
the
vanilla
bourbon
and
smoke
notes
enjoy
this
if
you
can
find
it
ps
this
beer
has
one
of
the
coolest
labels
ive
ever
seen
overall
it
is
well
done
at
first
the
alcohol
teetered
very
close
to
overpowering
the
taste
but
as
i
worked
my
way
down
the
glass
it
became
more
mellow
as
i
conclude
drinking
it
it
gives
me
a
nicepleasant
relaxed
feeling
served
from
tap
into
a
goblet
at
the
founders
event
at
duckworths
poured
reddishbrown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
bourbon
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
syrup
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
light
to
mild
carbonation
overall
this
one
was
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
nice
flavor
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
quite
nice
as
well
probably
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
to
date
it
is
also
crazy
drinkable
to
weigh
in
at
10
2
im
very
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
if
this
was
readily
available
to
me
i
might
get
some
to
age
but
i
prolly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
this
im
not
sure
of
the
price
but
its
worth
a
try
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
with
exceptional
caramel
notes
and
a
surprisingly
subdued
alcohol
profile
considering
the
10
2
abv
drinkability
isnt
exactly
the
name
of
this
beers
game
its
evident
from
the
first
whiff
that
this
is
a
sipper
and
its
an
excellent
one
at
that
though
it
would
definitely
be
nice
if
a
bit
more
of
the
base
beers
character
would
show
through
after
the
barrel
aging
process
for
fans
of
bourbon
and
beers
aged
on
bourbon
wood
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
and
it
makes
a
heck
of
a
nightcap
sadly
because
the
base
is
so
masked
by
the
aging
it
becomes
a
good
deal
less
interesting
than
it
could
potentially
be
id
like
to
see
how
this
cellars
though
as
it
certainly
has
cellaring
potential
and
could
mellow
and
become
more
intriguing
with
a
bit
of
age
on
the
bottle

i
love
this
beer
now
its
one
of
my
favorites
ill
try
to
get
it
every
year
d
i
love
this
beer
and
would
pick
up
some
more
if
they
were
on
the
shelves
out
here
overall
pretty
rich
and
tasty
but
the
flavors
are
too
dominated
by
the
bourbon
notes
and
it
has
a
bit
too
much
heat
great
well
balanced
scotch
ale
definitely
going
to
buy
me
some
bottles
later
this
week
d
this
is
one
of
those
dangerous
beers
big
abv
that
is
hidden
well
and
all
around
great
flavors
if
you
like
big
bourbon
notes
this
one
is
for
you
d
drinkability
for
me
is
fairly
low
it
may
be
just
me
getting
acclimated
to
both
of
the
styles
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
real
sipper
and
it
wasnt
easy
to
get
down
for
me
the
sweet
malts
were
just
too
much
for
this
beer
d
a
nice
beer
not
too
overpowering
with
the
bourbon
character
at
the
same
time
it
seems
a
little
one
dimensional
i
just
read
my
review
of
dirty
bastard
and
it
seems
like
some
of
that
goodness
is
missing
i
like
this
beer
but
dont
love
it
may
have
to
revisit
in
the
future
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
bourbon
fan
or
really
like
barrel
aged
beers
high
abv
is
the
only
detractor
otherwise
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
worth
seeking
out
overall
i
find
this
one
to
be
excellent
the
bourbon
notes
are
very
present
but
not
over
the
top
the
abvs
are
hidden
very
well
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
fresh
and
ageing
a
few
bottles
to
see
what
happens
ive
loved
this
beer
in
the
past
though
cant
remember
if
its
always
this
hot
upon
release
right
now
the
bourbon
completely
dominates
the
other
flavors
i
seem
to
remember
it
being
a
bit
more
balanced
even
fresh
id
like
to
give
this
6
months
and
see
if
the
flavors
seem
to
come
together
a
bit
making
this
a
little
easier
to
drink
the
potential
for
greatness
is
there
just
needs
a
little
time
i
think
thick
rich
and
chewy
very
satisfying
this
is
a
great
wintertime
beer
and
ill
be
putting
up
a
few
bottles
for
those
january
snow
days
with
an
extra
log
on
the
ire
and
time
to
kill
drinkability
takes
a
shot
because
ive
had
one
and
im
done
for
the
night
pick
up
a
four
pack
of
these
before
they
disappear
dobviously
this
beer
is
not
for
people
who
dont
appreciate
a
good
bourbon
but
for
those
that
due
it
is
a
smooth
and
drinkable
must
try
bought
this
beer
in
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
it
into
a
glass
there
was
no
head
the
appearance
was
a
nice
caramel
color
with
ruby
tints
visible
in
the
light
the
smell
was
wonderful
definite
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
in
the
initial
smell
of
the
ale
the
taste
was
the
same
way
obviously
a
oak
bourbon
barrel
aged
ale
where
i
found
this
beer
somewhat
lacking
was
in
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
syrupy
for
my
taste
but
this
might
be
what
you
would
expect
from
a
barrel
aged
ale
the
single
bottle
serving
was
the
perfect
amount
between
the
intense
flavor
mouthfeel
and
high
alcohol
content
one
of
these
is
all
you
need
taste
and
mouth
feel
were
the
two
carrying
factors
for
this
beer
i
enjoyed
the
sweetness
and
malt
up
front
as
the
beer
goes
down
the
throat
it
has
a
rather
bitter
finish
also
noticed
some
caramel
and
very
little
spice
overall
this
was
quite
nice
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
i
have
had
this
one
was
way
heavy
not
wee
heavy
due
to
alcohol
i
dont

are

usually
do

for
scotch

as
they
tend
to
be
overly
sweet

cloying

this
brew
does
not
go
overboard
on
the
sweetness
and
i

the

did
wonders

the

would
have

more
now
oh
well
nicely
done
thanks
to
tburkhart
for
this
one
d
a
very
good
sipper
and
quite
tasty
worth
picking
up
the
beer
pours
a
cool
ruby
almost
purple
color
with
a
limited
tanish
white
head
initial
aroma
is
mostly
alcoholwhiskey
with
a
bit
of
an
earthy
undertone
the
taste
is
very
caramel
sweet
with
a
nice
bite
of
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
great
smooth
mouthfeel
esp
for
10
abv
definitely
something
i
would
drink
again
well
this
is
a
special
beer
which
retains
much
of
the
whisky
flavor
very
different
and
creamy
d
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
way
too
drinkable
for
its
abv
very
enjoyable
especially
on
a
rainy
night
getting
ready
for
the
holidays
if
i
werent
told
that
this
is
so
alcoholic
i
may
have
been
in
trouble
a
god
pick
this
beer
is
an
excellent
one
for
a
cold
night
by
the
fire
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
warming
to
garner
a
high
drinkability
score
but
certainly
worth
a
try
and
a
great
sipper
to
share
with
friends
i
thought
the
beer
was
spot
on
for
its
style
in
terms
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
some
scotch
ales
come
out
of
the
bottle
a
little
thin
but
i
though
this
one
nailed
it
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
perfect
for
a
cold
night
a
great
beer
all
around
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
delicious
smooth
and
creamy
flavors
mashed
with
alcohol
age
on
this
would
be
delicious
even
though
bourbon
overtakes
everything
mmmm
drinkability
is
low
this
one
is
almost
up
there
with
triple
bock
though
this
at
least
tastes
like
something
someone
not
me
would
want
to
drink
one
of
the
few
beers
i
actually
poured
out
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
one
but
i
probably
shouldnt
have
been
so
surprised
if
you
like
bourbon
you
will
probably
like
this
but
i
still
think
the
dirty
bastard
is
a
far
superior
brew
at
least
i
got
a
cool
bottle
out
of
it
the
newer
style
label
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
2008
vintage
with
the
new
artwork
and
served
in
a
snifter
this
beer
poured
a
dark
murky
mahogany
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
lingered
for
a
bit
leaving
behind
some
decent
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
slightly
vinous
boozy
dark
fruits
burnt
caramel
brown
sugar
and
maybe
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
the
flavor
was
like
a
piece
of
hard
caramel
candy
soaked
in
bourbon
the
flavors
work
really
well
together
rich
malty
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
mellow
boozy
bourbon
note
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
fullbodied
and
had
very
mild
carbonation
just
a
bit
sticky
a
really
tasty
sipper
d
this
is
damn
enjoyable
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
yet
another
awesome
beer
from
founders
why
wont
they
distribute
to
texas
nice
deep
mahogany
color
with
sparkling
red
tinges
thin
creamy
off
white
head
that
trails
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
drank
this
fairly
warm
and
the
smells
were
very
bold
lots
of
bourbon
with
some
floral
hop
notes
very
faintly
in
the
background
also
some
sweet
maple
syrup
notes
bourbon
again
comes
to
front
of
the
taste
it
somehow
manages
to
dominate
but
not
give
any
burn
on
the
way
down
thick
mouth
this
one
is
a
good
one
to
sip
on
a
cold
winter
night
by
the
fire
with
a
book
across
the
board
good
beer
but
i
just
couldnt
bump
it
to
the
exceptional
level
pours
a
semi
cloudy
copper
with
a
very
small
beige
head
aroma
is
medium
sweet
with
grapefruit
bourbon
smoky
and
caramelization
flavor
is
grapefruit
orange
caramel
and
smoky
with
some
alcohol
detected
medium
to
full
body
sticky
texture
finishes
somewhat
hot
low
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
not
something
id
necessarily
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
or
frequently
but
great
balance
of
big
flavors
makes
this
a
great
offering
dangerously
drinkable
it
is
so
smooth
i
wanted
another
two
bottles
of
this
to
sip
on
all
night
great
beer
for
a
cold
evening
best
aromatics
of
any
bourbon
barrel
aged
ale
that
ive
tried
that
hasnt
been
a
stout
yeah
i
know
thats
kind
of
weird
bourbon
vanilla
caramel
and
toffee
are
all
present
in
the
aroma
of
this
beer
along
with
a
bit
of
oak
and
maybe
even
leather
the
combination
of
these
scents
is
what
really
makes
these
introducing
the
word
im
searching
for
is
probably
nuance
its
a
nuanced
character
what
you
smell
is
also
what
you
get
in
tasting
this
beer
along
with
an
extraordinarily
smooth
mouthfeel
i
like
the
way
all
the
aforementioned
flavors
and
some
others
mix
in
this
beer
the
flavors
show
themselves
then
hide
then
come
back
in
the
finish
simple
caramel
maltiness
starts
things
out
then
a
theres
a
big
smack
of
toffee
make
that
a
huge
smack
of
toffee
followed
by
a
grainy
bourbon
flavor
and
then
a
portlike
tawny
character
making
for
a
rich
warming
finish
as
the
beer
warmed
up
i
noticed
a
sort
of
coffee
with
cream
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
a
complex
and
very
well
made
ale
its
smooth
alright
i
dont
really
know
what
else
to
say
here
i
like
it
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
is
this
really
a
scotch
ale
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
your
a
whiskey
drinker
you
will
love
this
beer
i
sure
did
d
not
my
style
but
could
drink
one
or
two
on
a
cold
winter
night
poured
a
slightly
hazy
brownish
amber
with
a
medium
creamy
light
tan
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
dark
maltsvanillaoak
dark
maltscaramel
and
bourbon
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
vanilla
caramel
malt
and
oak
with
the
bourbon
enhancng
the
flavor
but
not
overpowering
it
very
nice
finish
that
is
slightly
bitter
and
warming
a
perfect
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
michigan
evening
bwb
pours
slightly
turbid
showcasing
a
rich
brown
color
a
firm
pour
produced
a
12
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
to
a
nice
foam
skin
small
patches
of
lacing
are
present
when
cold
the
aroma
is
that
of
mainly
caramel
but
as
it
warms
a
whole
range
of
scents
poke
through
vanilla
bourbon
figs
a
damp
earthiness
or
mustiness
and
butterscotch
wow
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
either
many
of
the
same
smells
follow
through
to
the
palate
this
is
a
full
flavor
beer
with
caramel
malts
bourbon
and
figs
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
not
too
heavy
or
light
though
it
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
for
more
punch
if
it
werent
for
the
high
abv
i
could
easily
have
2
or
3
of
these
beers
in
a
night
a
lot
of
bourbonbased
beers
become
ponderous
to
me
after
a
few
sips
not
this
beer
good
stuff
from
founders
this
beer
is
hits
every
end
of
the
spectrum
for
me
the
appearance
was
nice
a
deep
cloudy
brown
with
a
few
bubbles
and
no
head
aroma
was
absolutely
perfect
strong
vanilla
dominates
with
oak
and
bourbon
intertwined
taste
was
a
little
thin
the
taste
reminds
me
of
the
days
when
i
first
started
drinking
in
bars
it
tastes
exactly
like
a
jack
and
coke
that
has
been
sitting
too
long
with
ice
in
it
and
got
watered
down
this
is
because
the
beer
lacks
any
hint
of
carbonation
with
some
carbonation
this
beer
could
be
an
a
i
dont
remember
07s
being
this
flat
maybe
its
just
the
bottle
i
had
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
sharp
bourbon
bite
of
oak
and
booze
that
quickly
gives
way
to
creamy
vanilla
and
scotch
malts
candyapple
molasses
and
brown
sugars
slide
through
for
a
deliciously
sweet
finish
aftertaste
is
more
vanilla
and
a
boozy
warmth
that
continues
all
the
way
to
the
stomach
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
perfectly
carbonated
and
slightly
viscousbut
not
so
thick
that
its
tough
to
drink
all
in
all
an
impressive
scotch
ale
from
the
bastards
at
founders
me
likey
a
flavorful
experience
but
it
is
a
bit
too
intensely
alcoholy
and
sweet
for
me
at
14
or
so
for
four
this
isnt
something
im
going
to
be
drinking
all
the
time
but
its
a
great
alternative
to
a
winter
warmer
which
tend
to
be
too
rich
for
my
taste
if
your
sick
of
stouts
this
could
be
your
new
favorite
seasonal
the
mouthfeel
decent
a
little
watery
but
very
in
tune
with
the
style
i
dont
know
how
drinkable
this
one
is
with
over
9
abv
and
16
a
four
pack
but
i
cannot
slam
them
for
either
considering
the
awesome
flavor
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
im
just
not
acclimated
to
whiskey
as
a
bourbon
fan
this
is
a
winner
i
have
to
be
honest
i
bought
a
4
pack
and
now
i
am
considering
running
out
to
get
another
d
extremely
drinkable
as
most
have
said
here
for
a
10
percenter
drinkability
oh
its
quite
good
potent
sure
but
good
if
ever
anyone
has
some
extra
bottles
of
backwoods
bastard
theyre
looking
to
get
rid
of
count
me
in
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
the
relatively
strong
bourbon
barrel
quality
i
think
that
malty
scottish
ales
work
pretty
well
in
bourbon
barrels
and
this
is
no
exception
backwoods
bastard
is
on
the
fullbodied
side
with
milky
feel
and
mild
carbonation
alarmingly
drinkable
for
a

around
here
more
tasty

quality
and
interesting

from
founders
whiskey
lovers
will
enjoy
this
beer
because
that
is
what
dominates
both
aroma
and
flavor
there
are
other
aspects
that
make
it
interesting
and
it
is
definitely
flavorful

still
you
can
smell
the

you
cant

this

i
wonder
what
the

this
malty

also
sports
a
seriously
buff

that
heats
and
hazes
still
it
drinks
happily
if
malt
be
your
thing
so
im
not
sure
if
i
mentioned
malt
but
it
is
malty
and
damned
proud
of
it

many
thanks
to
afterexile
for
this
stellar
brew
and
i
was
very
impressed
by
it
founders
has
continually
managed
to
blow
me
away
and
this
beers
no
exception
drinkability
suffers
slightly
from
the
heat
and
the
nearlydouble
digit
abv
but
thats
alright
its
still
an
expertly
constructed
beer
flavorful
wonderfully
aromatic
wellintegrated
with
all
the
bourbon
notes
and
whatnot
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
high
alcohol
definitely
recommended
glad
i
tried
this
but
1
would
have
done
just
fine
drinability
this
beer
is
really
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
does
a
great
job
of
covering
the
alcohol
its
not
big
and
brash
like
i
was
expecting
but
in
the
end
i
think
that
turned
out
to
be
a
good
thing
the
barrel
aging
may
have
added
a
bit
of
one
dimensionality
but
its
still

you
are

as
wonderful
as
this

is
this
is
a
beer
you
sit
and
sip
quietly
to
appreciate
i
would
suggest
limiting
it
to
one
of
these

of

highly
recommend

i
thought
the
beer
was
okay
a
little
thin

quaffable
but
in
this
conception
the
bourbonbarreling
made
the
beer
richly
textured
yet
not
stick
to
the
roof
of
your

i
am
about
to
put
my
feet
up
and
enjoy
the
rest
of
this

as
the

and

i
recommend
each
of
you
do
the

i
didnt

what
i
did
note
was
the

and
the

aftertaste
is
usually
a
bad
word

with
this
beer
it

beer
this
is
a
delightfully
pleasant
and
refreshing
brew
that
far
surpasses
all
expectations
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
full
body
it
is
lightly
carbonated
the
beer
even
pulls
off
a
bit
of
creamyness
this
beer
is
a
sipper
by
many
peoples
standards
i
had
to
restrain
myself
from
guzzling
this
malt
bomb
another
great
brew
from
founders
a
fantastic
brew
from
a
fantastic
brewery
sweetness
comes
back
with
time
and
brings
some
booze
with
it
too
its
enjoyable
as
hell
but
has
some
heft
in
there
definitely
a
sipper
as
soon
as
i
heard
that
this
beer
had
come
in
locally
i
raced
over
to
an
establishment
that
had
it
in
stock
interesting
label
with
a
guy
with
a
big
beard
that
looks
a
lot
like
this
crazy
guy
i
used
to
talk
to
on
the
bus
when
i
was
back
at
umass
we
called
him
gandalf
anyway
pours
a
very
murky
dark
raspberry
brown
color
a
bit
more
heading
would
raise
the
score
of
appearance
a
bit
as
there
is
little
if
any
great
smells
of
candied
apple
custard
bourbon
and
other
sweet
fruit
come
through
taste
is
of
more
apple
some
cinnamon
chocolate
sharp
acidic
twang
and
some
molasses
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
aspect
to
the
beer
as
well
perhaps
a
result
of
barrel
aging
body
is
large
and
malty
with
little
hop
presence
this
would
make
for
beer
to
pair
with
dessert
or
on
its
own
with
a
pipe
or
cigar
this
beer
conjures
up
thoughts
of
changing
leaves
from
fall
which
is
a
great
thing
i
might
consider
putting
this
in
the
lineup
for
thanksgiving
beers
this
year
great
beer
founders
is
amongst
my
favorites
right
now
happy
trails
full
bodied
and
perfect
carbonation
i
really
dig
this
beer
i
cant
picture
another
example
of
a
bourbon
aged
scotch
ale
that
would
stand
up
to
this
simply
delicious
drinkability
not
something
i
would
want
more
than
a
bottle
of
in
one
sitting
definitely
a
sipping
beer
this
is
a
decent
scotch
ale
and
one
that
bourbon
lovers
will
especially
enjoy
its
definitely
a
sipper
and
makes
a
great
nightcap
ive
had
a
few
other
barrel
aged
either
plain
oak
barrel
or
a
barrel
previously
used
with
some
other
spirit
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
this
beer
can
definatley
benefit
from
cellaring
although
good
now
i
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
beer
after
a
couple
of
months

the
beer
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
very
small
tan
head
that
went
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
either
aroma
is
mostly
bourbon
but
theres
also
vanilla
oak
peat
and
smoke
noticable
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
the
alcohol
heat
is
a
little
harsh
at
first
it
does
mellow
a
bit
when
it
warms
up
but
you
can
still
tell
theres
some
alcohol
there
when
drinking
it
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
carbonation
is
low
and
its
creamy
drinkability
is
decent
enough
and
it
is
smooth
but
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
well
at
all
so
that
hurts
it
some
i
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
more
than
12
of
these
at
a
time
overall
i
think
it
is
a
decent
enough
beer
i
think
aging
it
some
would
help

color
from

i
do
not
really
like
this
beer
but
that
is
sort
of
a
compliment
it
is
very
true
to
stile
becouse
i
do
not
enjoy
scotish

as
in
most
scotish
ale
the
big
alcohol
precese
is
not
balanced
with
any
backbone
no
real
malts
or
hops
however
it
was
a
great
suprise
to
find
a
michigan
beer
on
tap
that
i
have
not
tried
hard
to
really
go
wrong
with
any
founders
i
like
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
one
was
still
quite
hot
for
my
liking
i
have
had
the
regular
dirty
bastard
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
but
i
had
no
idea
it
could
be
improved
this
much
this
stuff
is
great
im
gonna
have
to
get
another
four
pack
bottle
on
122708
pours
a
cloudy

with
a
frothy
inch
caramel
colored
head
a
light
aroma
of
bourbon
and
malt
complete
the
nose
first
sip
is
much
more
bourbon
than
the
nose
indicated
it
is
all
bourbon
and
then
some
malts
appear
in
a
supportive
role
as
it
warms
it
is
still
all
bourbon
but
now
some
hops
are
present
adding
to
the
overall
complexity
i
am
guessing
this
was
aged
in
some
very
fresh
barrels
still
loaded
with
residual
bourbon
wetness
as
the
beer
picked
up
a
ton
of
flavor
slightly
murky
red
decent
amount
of
foam
clear
and
strong
bourbon
aroma
alcohol
has
mellowed
oxidation
is
creeping
in
but
doesnt
interfere

are

the
smell
is
straight
up
bourbon
but
it
doesnt
have
the
burn
youd
expect
it
pours
black
as
hell
and
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
stumbled
several
times
while
drinkin
this
and
lookin
at
some
fine
ladies
i
havent
thrown
up
yet
founders
is
delicious
but
i
think
this
beer
might
be
a
little
much
for
me
wooo
d
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
one
it
was
sort
of
rough
in
the
mouth
and
the
flavor
profile
wasnt
anything
too
special
i
really
didnt
care
for
how
the
peat
bitterness
and
oaky
spicness
came
together
they
just
didnt
seem
to
blend
right
as
one
area
was
always
a
bit
out
of
whack
well
see
what
time
does
for
it
but
i
wasnt
too
impressed
overall
somewhat
disappointed
in
this
one
founders
does
so
many
beers
well
perhaps
im
unfairly
holding
it
up
to
their
stouts
regardless
one
4pack
is
more
than
enough
for
me
in
a
season
this
was
a
great
wet
barrel
bourbon
scottish
ale
glad
to
get
this
in
trade
d
amazingly
drinkable
i
let
my
wife
take
a
sip
who
hates
strong
beer
and
she
even
enjoyed
it
tastes
nothing
like

excellent
beer
d
this
is
not
my
favored
style
of
ale
but
i
did
enjoy
it
it
was
nice
to
drink
it
out
of
a
thistle
glass
and
just
sip
away
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
you
question
what
beer
is
a
sophisticated
and
acquired
taste
i
tend
to
enjoy
high
abv
brews
that
mask
the
alcohol
a
little
better
but
i
will
look
forward
to
the
other
2
bottles
i
have
left
its
a
quality
brew
and
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
i
ate
some
gouda
with
this
good
call
it
balances
it
out
very
nicely
d
insanly
high
heavier
and
bigger
it
seems
than
the
old
ale
this
beer
is
a
champion
of
barrel
aging
and
has
done
very
well
for
itself
looks
pretty
drinks
easy
and
feels
great
on
the
pallate
a
great
beer
all
around
d
the
abv
and
the
taste
of
alcohol
make
this
one
hard
to
want
a
second
however
i
do
feel
that
its
a
much
improved
version
of
dirty
bastard
and
wish
it
would
be
a
year
round
staple
founders
has
once
again
created
another
amazing
beer
a
must
try
as
far
as
im
concerned
founders
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
d
very
overbearing
would
tire
easily
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
wee
heavy
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
i
think
there
is
just
too
much
barrel
aged
flavors
and
alcohol
burn
to
make
this
a
great
beer
solid
and
certainly
worth
a
try
ill
have
to
compare
notes
later
when
i
crack
open
my
alesmith
barrel
aged
wee
heavy
and
see
how
it
compares
every
one
of
the
above
scores
was
barely
achieved
founders
managed
to
take
a
great
beer
and
a
great
concept
bourbon
barrel
aging
and
turn
it
into
merely
good
beer
it
would
still
be
fantastic
if
they
make
this
a
regular
release
because
the
potential
for
greatness
is
definitely
there

it

im

for
these
treats

d
i
had
this
at

the
great

and
thought
it
was
awful
nice
to
try
it
with
a
clean

a
nice
sipper
d
tasty
brew
that
would
probably
be
better
suited
for
a
chilly
indian
summer
night
but
was
just
fine
tonight
too
di
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
bourbon
barrel
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
damned
good
avery
interesting
wee
heavy
my
buddy
who
mainly
drinks
lagers
decent
ones
tried
it
and
loved
it
he
referred
to
it
as
dessert
i
thought
of
it
as
the
main
course
i
purchased
a
couple
bottles
of
this
stuff
a
few
months
ago
and
i
am
really
kicking
myself
right
now
for
not
buying
more
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
this
bottle
tastes
much
better
than
the
previous
bottle
ive
had
my
share
of
barrel
aged
beers
and
this
is
right
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
dark
brown
in
color
with
an
aroma
that
is
totally
dominated
by
bourbon
vanilla
oak
caramel
this
brew
is
totally
inviting
the
taste
is
great
hints
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
an
obvious
bourbon
overtone
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
richer
but
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
treat
for
real
easy
drinking
highly
recommended
a
nice
sipping
beer
with
good
complexity
pours
to
a
murky
dark
brown
body
hosting
a
creamy
tan
head
that
stands
at
one
finger
but
fades
quickly
to
just
a
skim
leaving
no
lace
right
up
front
on
the
nose
you
are
greeted
by
huge
bourbon
tones
wraped
around
dark
fruit
coco
and
carmalized
malt
oh
wow
is
all
i
can
say
after
first
sip
this
is
so
right
take
dirty
bastard
mellow
it
out
perfectly
develop
all
the
flavors
and
then
add
a
pinch
of
bourbon
creamy
on
the
mouth
are
a
mix
of
flavors
including
hot
buttered
rum
toffee
dark
fruits
and
bitter
chocolate
a
bitter
bourbon
hint
shows
off
a
hop
profile
as
well
as
aged
bourbon
on
the
end
of
the
palate
bourbon
is
big
on
the
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
wonderful
sipper
that
should
be
savored
definitely
for
bourbon
fans
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
noting
too
special
i
am
a
big
fan
of
wee
heavys
and
really
wanted
to
try
a
barrel
aged
one
my
bottle
said
8
7
nice
first
experience
would
drink
again
noticeably
better
than
dirty
bastard
in
my
opinion
recommended
drinkability
woooowee
d
love
it
maybe
one
of
my
favorites
just
wish
the
smell
wasnt
so
dominated
by
bourbon
thanks
hoppymeal
for
these
quite
a
good
beer
actually
this
is
not
a
style
im
too
fond
of
but
the
oak
bourbon
ageing
gave
this
one
some
more
dimension
nice
beer
overall
though
its
not
as
intense
as
i
would
have
expected
this
is
a
good
use
of
bourbon
barrels
the
bourbon
flavors
really
add
another
dimension
to
the
beer
without
overwhelming
the
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
pours
a
foggy
dark
mahogany
with
a
tan
colored
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
frothy
layer
of
bubbles
a
good
amount
of
lacing
remains
on
the
sides
smell
is
dominate
by
the
bourbon
aromas
with
a
good
amount
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
lots
of
vanilla
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
mostly
fig
and
raisins
some
faint
woody
scents
find
their
way
in
the
nose
as
well
smokey
malt
flavors
with
a
creamy
coffee
bitterness
up
front
molasses
and
carmelized
almonds
on
the
tongue
as
well
aftertaste
is
actually
pretty
dry
and
woody
more
than
i
expected
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
bubbles
i
had
a
difficult
time
drinking
this
one
because
of
the
dry
aftertaste
and
boozy
flavors
founders
still
does
a
great
job
once
again
though
a
nice
warm
feeling
left
in
the
tummy
after
this
one
pours
a
ruby
brown
in
color
with
no
head
smell
is
exactly
what
youd
think
a
scotch
ale
with
bourbon
oak
and
rum
notes
they
must
have
used
the
same
barrels
as
for
their
curmudgeon
this
has
many
of
the
same
characteristics
taste
is
bourbon
oak
and
some
fig
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smoothcreamy
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
you
get
a
hit
of
the
alcohol
warmth
in
the
aftertaste
the
aroma
is
strong
bourbon
and
malt
maybe
you
could
guess
it
was
even
a
rum
and
coke
the
flavor
is
way
complex
rum
coke
bourbon
sweet
and
roasted
malts
unreal
alcohol
is
really
evident
as
well
which
limits
the
drinkability
for
me
the
bourbon
aroma
and
taste
is
just
right
its
not
overpowering
overall
a
drinkable
beer
that
im
sure
will
get
better
with
some
age
drinkability
is
great
alcohol
is
dangerously
well
hidden
i
could
drink
this
all
night
perfect
balance
great
malt
profile
excellent
balance
of
the
barrel
character
against
the
base
beer
too
this
is
good
stuff
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
and
quite
complex
wee
heavy
i
have
had
ones
strong
then
this
but
this
was
almost
borderline
on
a
old
ale
it
was
just
full
of
alcohol
and
really
sweet
tones
very
nicely
crafted
and
definitely
a
quality
brew
i
look
forward
t
having
another
one
day
i
really
like
that
the
malt
character
plays
a
slightly
bigger
role
in
the
flavor
profile
than
the
bourbon
barrel
does
this
keeps
the
integrity
of
the
rich
scotch
ale
style
but
with
an
offsetting
bourbon
component
that
helps
to
offset
balance
the
thick
malt
character
of
this
brew
having
said
that
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
seem
to
be
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
get
behind
there
is
something
about
the
bourbon
notes
that
add
a
harshness
the
beers
aged
in
the
barrels
that
just
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
as
the
beer
warms
up
from
its
initial
50f
10c
it
picks
up
more
of
the
sharp
hot
bourbon
flavors
which
pull
this
away
from
being
balanced
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
bourbon
character
is
a
bit
much
especially
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
very
big
beer
good
drinkablity
will
drink
this
one
again
one
per
sitting
though
poured
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
with
a
bit
of
a
ruddy
hue
at
the
edges
a
little
muddy
little
foam
just
a
smattering
of
fine
beige
bubbles
that
produced
a
bit
of
spotty
lace
vanilla
and
bourbon
aromas
up
front
with
toffee
and
a
bit
of
smoke
in
the
background
low
bitterness
relative
to
malt
same
characters
as
in
the
aroma
there
was
a
bit
of
fruity
raisin
to
start
plus
cocoa
notes
in
the
middle
and
finish
bourbon
character
was
more
pronounced
and
it
had
a
warm
alcohol
finish
really
good
stuff
the
texture
was
rich
and
malty
with
light
carbonation
founders
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
thanks
to
hoppymeal
derek
for
sending
kentucky
breakfast
stout
is
an
awesome
beer
and
ive
even
rated
it
more
highly
than
this
one
but
i
actually
like
what
the
bourbon
does
for
this
beer
more
than
what
it
does
for
kbs
its
too
dominant
in
kbs
in
my
opinion
where
here
it
is
just
a
perfect
complement
to
the
brew
really
tasty
beer
that
is
most
certainly
worth
a
try
a
viry
nice
scottish
ale
but
it
is
a
little
boozy
and
is
a
sipper
for
sure
a
nice
drink
that
would
make
a
nice
nightcap
d
this
one
is
a
very
sweet
brew
but
that
is
balanced
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
drinability
is
good
but
the
abv
puts
the
limit
at
one
per
sitting
d
the
abv
is
too
far
to
make
this
a
goto
beer
if
you
like
the
punch
of
a
bourbon
aged
beer
this
is
worth
a
visit
the
bottle
is
not
as
powerful
as
i
remember
the
growler
being
but
that
could
just
be
the
passage
of
time
pretty
easy
to
drink
even
for
the
high
abv
think
it
would
be
too
much
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
like
drinking
a
beer
and
a
shot
of
bourbon
but
i
could
drink
one
every
day
this
is
an
entertaining
beer
i
wonder
what
would
happen
after
aging
it
for
a
year
or
two
id
be
curious
to
read
about
this
later
this
has
a
decent
drinkablility
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
the
aroma
is
nice
caramel
milk
chocolate
and
notes
of
the
oak
barrels
it
tastes
wonderful
of
syrupy
bourbon
ripened
berries
some
alcohol
and
a
perfectly
complementing
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
but
i
wanted
it
to
be
slightly
more
harsh
less
watery
still
good
though
that
said
it
went
down
so
easily
and
was
a
most
pleasant
drinking
experience
i
look
forward
to
finding
this
one
again
thanks
again
derek
it
tries
to
settle
at
midbottle
but
it
stays
on
the
sweet
side

and
this
hides
any
thought
of
8
7
alcohol
but
eh
ill
try
again
next
year
very
nice
deep
rich
reddish
hue
to
it
some
head
though
not
overly
carbonated
somewhat
muted
aromaslight
oakiness
and
sweet
caramel
malt
big
malt
flavor
with
a
very
heavy
handed
oakiness
to
it
great
caramel
sweetness
slight
tinge
of
alcohol
burn
very
soft
and
smooth
body
well
balancedmaybe
a
touch
of
harshness
off
the
alcohol
but
i
am
amazed
how
soft
the
beer
seems
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
not
a
big
fan
of
oak
or
bourbon
aged
beers
but
this
one
is
quite
good
for
my
tastes
flavor
is
full
and
rich
hops
are
hardly
noticeable
huge
smokey
malt
character
matches
well
with
strong
woody
bourbon
alcohol
is
clearly
present
but
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
it
is
9

a
tasty
and
flavorful
brew
drinkability
this
is
excellent
and
quite
hearty
only
the
high
abv
limits
sessionability
body
is
thick
but
far
from
syrupy
finish
is
dry
as
one
might
expect
from
a
barrel
aged
brew
although
the
drinkability
score
might
seem
lessthanstellar
im
yet
to
find
a
barrelaged
brew
that
is
sessionable
this
is
a
remarkable
example
of
what
the
barrel
treatment
can
do
for
a
beer
and
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
a
mistake
like
say
imperial
brown
goose
that
was
a
style
christmas
ale
that
didnt
have
the
fortitude
to
stand
up
to
the
treatment
this
scotch
ale
presumably
dirty
bastard
beer
had
what
it
takes
to
deliver
the
goods
really
good
bottled
version
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
a
very
easy
to
drink
big
beer
founders
does
it
again
they
just
keep
impressing
me
beer
after
tasty
beer
i
would
drink
lots
of
this
if
it
were
more
readily
available
aftertaste
is
boubon
and
alcohol
warmth
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
i
dont
think
this
needs
to
be
said
but
this
is
another
great
beer
from
founders
theyve
really
opened
things
up
this
year
with
all
the
new
bottled
releases
a
great
beer
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
i
also
picked
up
old
curmudgean
tasted
side

id
be

pressed
to
drink
more
than

in

overall
its

id
definitely
pick
it
up
again
if
i
happen
to
see
it
prosit

nice
a

id
recommend
a
bottle
but
not

i
like
it
would
i
want
it
all
the
time
no
way
not
as
well
integrated
as
the
superb
kfbs
but
still
a
very
good
brew
d
a
very
interesting
beer
for
sure
this
is
just
essentially
bourbon
beer
unique
tasty
and
worth
trying
pours
a
great
deep
ruby
that
stubbornly
lets
a
little
light
pass
through
it
makes
me
think
of
a
mans
cognac
or
brandy
no
head
or
lace
to
speak
of
very
meaty
aroma
of
sugared
fruits
like
pruins
figs
and
apricots
with
a
definite
touch
of
oak
and
alcohol
the
taste
starts
with
vanilla
and
malty
figs
a
good
oaky
finish
but
with
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
that
lingers
a
little
toolong
still
a
good
sipping
beer
the
palat
is
thick
and
fruity
with
an
undeniable
oak
and
creamy
standard
vanilla
tone
good
for
a
long
sipping
night
cap
no
more
than
one
a
day
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
considering
i
really
like
the
old
dirty
bastard
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
dump
the
dirty
the
bastard
and
only
make
this
liquid
nectar
from
now
on
drinkability
suffers
from
the
big
bourbon
flavors
but
is
still
pretty
good
d
dangerously
so
this
is
one
great
bourbon
aged
beer
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
dirty
bastard
so
for
this
to
come
out
so
well
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
would
give
it
a
higher
score
if
the
beer
showed
through
a
bit
more
regardless
this

is
creamy
and

the

end
a

d
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
if

you
should
enjoy

this

naaaaa
reminds
me
of
a
red
ale
overall
not
my
preferred
style
but
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
id
opt
for
one
of
my
favorite
quads
if
given
the
choice
but
wouldnt
mind
drinking
one
of
these
again
a
pretty
heavy
beer
with
a
full
flavor
and
some
bfoen
sugar
sweetness
got
a
bit
boozy
as
it
warmed
up
this
is
probably
the
best
scottish
ale
ive
ever
tasted
over
8
f
abv
you
cannot
go
wrong
first
i
have
to
say
that
i
love
the
color
of
this
beer
it
is
one
of
the
most
unique
ive
seen
a
light
chocolate
color
and
the
texture
of
this
beer
is
phenomenal
i
absolutely
love
the
scotch
flavor
in
this
rich
dark
beer
if
you
like
your
dark
beers
with
a
liquor
taste
then
give
this
one
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
its
really
hard
to
describe
why
i
like
this
beer
but
i
really
like
it
a
lot
good
beer
best
one
i
tried
today
strong
couldnt
drink
more
then
one
its

i
seem
to
be
preferring
lighter
beers

lighter
than
expected

bitter

overall
i
wouldnt
say
that
im
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
in
general
but
this
one
might
well
have
me
converted
its
definitely
a
beer
to
savour
unless
you
want
to
get
completely
trashed
in
short
order
and
savouring
it
will
undoubtedly
yield
good
results

fruity
aromas
from
hops
with
a
slight
aroma
of
roasted
malts
are
present
initial
taste
is
fruity
and
hoppy
a
pleasant
bitterness
combined
with
roasted
malts
follows
and
overtakes
the
initial
taste
with
a
caramel
flavor
coming
in
last
a
wonderful
scotch
ale
very
good
beer
i
felt
like
i
could
feel
the
spirits
in
every
gulp
yum
overall
what
an
awesome
malt
bomb
this
is
i
get
a
whole
range
of
aromas
from
the
malts
the
taste
is
a
little
less
satisfying
but
still
very
good
iv
had
my
fair
share
of
scotch
ales
and
this
is
easily
the
best
one
to
date
founders
is
my
personal
favorite
brewery
and
this
beer
is
another
reason
why
cheers
first
experience
with
this
one
enjoyable
looks
and
feels
like
a
brown
ale
nothing
too
crazy
in
this
one
will
enjoy
a
couple
more
times
im
sure
very
dark
ruby
red
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
it
produces
a
small
head
that
doesnt
last
smell
and
taste
are
similarly
thick
and
sweet
taste
is
complex
with
bitterness
prevailing
over
a
sweet
dark
sherry
mouth
is
heavy
almost
syrupy
i
wont
try
this
again
as
it
is
too
thick
for
me
ive
been
drinking
this
for
over
a
decade
its
my
goto
scotch
ale
its
rich
in
smell
complicated
in
flavor
and
a
wee
heavy
my
only
fault
with
it
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
a
bit
sticky
its
sufficiently
boozy
that
this
doesnt
matter
much
poured
into
a
10oz
snifter
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
smell
is
lightly
hopped
heavy
malt
and
yeast
taste
is
heavy
at
first
from
the
malt
finish
is
relatively
smooth
and
refreshing
deep
mahogany
pour
with
thin
clingy
white
head
aromas
of
fruit
yeast
and
bread
with
some
winelike
quality
flavors
are
many
prune
toast
cooked
sugar
so
smooth
and
malty
this
is
just
great
overall
good
twang
of
hops
mild
grains
except
in
the
mouthfeel
better
complexity
in
the
mouthfeel
than
in
the
taste
a
nice
scotch
ale
leaning
toward
the
barley
wine
neighborhood
pours
dark
you
can
taste
the
scotch
good
on
its
own
or
perfect
for
boilermakers
not
good
so
much
better
being
offered
in
this
style
let
me
sum
it
up
for
you
fantastic
very
enjoyable
beer
it
is
8
5
so
watch
out
have
this
by
itself
or
at
the
end
of
rounds
overall
a
pretty
decent
wee
heavy
and
one
that
i
recommend
getting
the
beer
is
pretty
good
for
a
year
round
beer
and
worth
getting
the
taste
reminds
me
of
eating
all
the
flavors
out
of
a
typical
bag
of
jelly
beans
at
once
having
read
a
few
previous
reviews
i
think
that
people
might
be
misrepresenting
the
taste
of
this
beer
simply
put
the
flavor
was
completely
offputting
had
almost
no
beer
flavor
just
a
very
alcoholflavored
kick
usually
not
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
one
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
winter
night
tastes
and
feels
a
helluva
lot
better
than
it
smells
nice
deep
brown
color
rich
flavor
tough
one
to
beat
beautiful
looking
beer
with
a
tremendous
alcoholic
bite
to
my
taste
that
bite
seems
to
cover
up
some
of
the
flavors
for
me
also
it
is
much
more
than
a
wee
heavy
maybe
a
little
too
heavy
for
me
style
def
not
my
sweet
spot
but
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
expected
kinda
sweet
and
slightly
complex
taste
dont
make
the
mistake
of
drinking
this
too
cold
i
liked
it
best
when
it
was
closest
to
room
temp
all
the
flavors
really
came
out
almost
has
the
appearance
of
a
top
notch
scotch
which
i
love
drink
more
than
one
and
youll
feel
like
youve
been
sipping
on
scotch
as
well
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
you
just
cant
appreciate
it
high
quality
beer
with
an
identity
crises
dark
but
thin
full
of
flavor
but
no
distinction
one
and
done
for
me
exceptional
beer
wonderful
flavor
for
a
scotch
ale
this
beer
filled
the
glass
with
a
beautiful
dark
brown
liquid
that
display
ruby
highlights
under
a
tan
frothy
head
rich
caramelization
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
ad
a
different
flair
to
this
beer
compared
to
other
wee
heavy
beers
medium
body
and
a
finish
that
is
balanced
not
deeply
malty
overall
a
delicious
beer
and
a
great
offering
from
founders
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
nice
no
head
or
lacing
to
be
seen
maybe
poured
to
cold
color
is
a
beautiful
rich
copper
aroma
full
of
sweet
caramel
raisiny
maybe
initial
taste
was
sweet
full
lots
of
alcohol
cause
it
was
too
cold
let
it
warm
a
bit
and
i
taste
orange
and
caramel
and
a
cookie
like
sweetness
alcohol
still
there
but
much
less
astringent
taste
lingering
on
palate
is
earthy
sweetness
raisins
and
plums
come
to
mind
this
is
a
nice
package
pretty
spot
on
for
what
i
expect
from
the
style
plenty
of
alcohol
bite
married
to
malty
sweetness
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
body
i
think
ill
have
another
leaves
a
nasty
aftertaste
that
ill
never
care
for
founders
centennial
has
the
same
problem
very
malty
but
followed
by
a
sweet
chocolatey
toffee
flavor
smooth
but
very
pungent
the
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
amber
with
a
slight
dark
khaki
head
the
nose
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
subtle
roast
undertones
but
mostly
dark
fruits
the
first
taste
was
an
intense
maltiness
with
sweetness
and
a
roastiness
at
the
same
time
that
ended
with
a
slight
bitter
hop
profile
there
was
a
sweet
dark
fruit
and
an
almost
chocolate
and
coffee
aftertaste
that
lingered
on
my
palate
and
was
a
tantalizing
reminder
of
what
was
to
come
with
each
sip
this
was
a
very
rich
and
deeply
layered
scotch
ale
that
was
like
sipping
a
nice
after
dinner
aperitif
this
creamy
brew
was
a
very
satisfying
and
robust
drinking
experience
and
a
very
well
done
scotch
ale
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
scotchstyle
ale
malty
sweet
a
little
fruity
earthy
as
a
2012
vintage
this
beer
aged
very
well
this
was
good
certainly
not
among
my
favorite
offerings
from
founders
though
just
too
malty
and
way
too
sweet
for
my
taste
o
reminds
me
of
the
ommegang
abbey
ale
i
had
before
nice
flavor
the
darkest
shade
of
red
with
a
remarkable
feel
and
texture
the
taste
was
still
the
best
full
body
and
medium
carbonation
great
tasty
beer
a
very
malty
beer
my
second
favorite
wee
heavy
scotch
ale
after
belhaven
it
has
a
beautiful
chocolately
aroma
the
flavor
is
more
in
line
with
roasted
chocolate
and
peated
malt
o
very
interesting
complex
flavors
t
this
beer
takes
all
the
woodsy
grain
and
squeezes
all
the
fraoch
herbalist
to
create
a
sharply
bitter
contrast
to
the
sweet
caramel
malted
rye
really
pleasing
ethyl
flavor
a
few
of
these
could
knock
you
flat
seems
spot
on
for
a
wee
heavy
v
medium
great
smooth
taste
best
example
of
this
style
ive
had
pours
a
deep
browncaramel
color
with
a
small
head
this
is
peat
malt
and
smoke
a
beer
that
would
go
down
a
treat
with
a
whiskey
chaser
all
the
typical
characteristics
of
a
scotch
ale
but
ramped
up
to
a
bold
finish
not
bad
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
deep
amber
in
color
light
lacing
toasted
flavor
great
flavor
great
mouth
feel
not
a
big
fan
of
scotch
aged
beer
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
have
had
differing
levels
of
enjoyment
sometimes
the
hops
feel
too
strong
other
times
they
seem
like
a
nice
accent
i
feel
the
rating
is
an
average
of
these
tastings
this
beer
needs
some
warmth
regardless
its
okay
not
the
best
ale
nor
the
best
founders
beer
ive
had
too
hoppy
for
my
pallet
overall
decent
bigish
beer
teeters
on
the
edge
of
cloying
but
stays
on
the
right
side
of
the
line
its
just
kind
of
meh
overall
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
scothc
ale
and
noticed
this
style
is
very
close
to
a
porter
the
flavor
is
good
and
although
thick
in
body
this
is
a
great
sipping
ale
well
suited
for
winter
since
it
has
a
warming
quality
to
it
very
good
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
but
i
would
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
of
this
genre
i
couldnt
tell
it
was
8
5
abv
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
well
bodied
and
quite
big
in
flavor
yet
drinkable
hops
are
more
prevalent
in
the
taste
than
the
aroma
agrh
the
curse
of
the
scotch
ale
too
sweet
too
cloying
too
alcoholic
instant
headache
very
pleasing
served
from
growler
and
will
seek
on
draft
again
wow
just
wow
powerful
up
front
incredibly
complex
and
appealing
flavors
and
long
delicious
finish
this
beer
has
everything
i
want
in
a
scotch
ale
but
its
just
a
bit
on
the
dark
side
and
a
little
too
bitter
for
this
style
i
know
hoppy
beers
are
all
the
rage
with
the
kids
these
days
but
theres
a
such
thing
as
overdoing
it
i
couldnt
taste
any
smoke
in
it
but
im
not
sure
i
was
supposed
to
either
in
spite
of
my
gripes
dirty
bastard
is
very
drinkable
and
the
high
abv
is
masked
well
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
and
i
buy
it
frequently
this
is
so
close
to
being
an
amazing
beer
but
the
bittersweet
ratio
is
just
a
little
off
for
this
style
dark
red
brownish
appearance
with
creamy
head
poured
from
bottle
malty
bready
boozy
aroma
head
dissipated
quickly
and
no
lacing
rich
malty
and
toasty
flavors
with
a
slight
boozy
finish
slight
smoky
hint
but
not
too
much
to
overshadow
the
rich
malts
nice
brownish
red
color
and
clear
smells
faintly
of
caramel
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
a
nice
finish
recently
had
the
backwoods
bastard
which
this
seems
similar
too
minus
the
bourbon
overall
very
enjoyable
pours
a
brilliant
ruby
color
with
a
one
finger
yellow
head
that
disappates
quickly
aroma
is
plum
dark
fruit
and
molasses
taste
is
plum
molasses
a
bit
of
roast
bite
and
a
little
alcoholic
burn
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
but
it
works
with
the
flavors
to
allow
them
to
linger
in
the
finish
overall
a
very
well
done
scotch
ale
that
manages
to
hit
the
high
points
without
the
harshness
of
some
in
the
style
very
drinkable
smooth
delicious
and
reliable
one
of
founders
best
everyday
beers
scotch
ales
arent
my
favorite
but
such
good
ones
as
this
never
disappoint
o
i
guess
these
scotch
ales
all
have
that
rough
alcohol
taste
in
the
middle
which
im
not
too
fond
of
but
the
other
flavors
seem
to
remedy
that
better
than
most
of
the
style
overall
really
interesting
beer
not
one
id
drink
regularly
but
definitely
a
great
latenightdessert
beer
if
there
is
such
a
thing
wait
what
am
i
saying
of
course
thats
a
thing
o
a
really
well
made
scotch
ale
not
as
rich
or
smooth
as
backwoods
harsher
but
still
a
quality
wee
heavy
good
taste
of
barley
sugar
and
toffee
hint
of
cocoa
small
astringency
by
alcohol
tasty
and
long
bitterness
i
thought
this
beer
was
initially
good
but
then
after
taste
lingered
way
too
long
almost
becoming
bitter
in
the
mouth
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
this
excellent
example
of
a
scotch
ale
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
firm
tan
head
of
dissipating
foam
and
fantastic
lacing

of
brown
sugars
toasted
malts

of

pretty
good
michigan
based
beer
meh
its
a
little
too
roasted
with
not
quite
enough
backbone
for
my
tastes
overall
nice

abv
not
noticeable
its
a
nice
looking
beer
a
deep
mahogany
with
beautiful
ruby
highlights
low
head
minimal
retention
spotty
lace
the
smell
is
closest
to
what
i
typically
associate
with
bsds
but
not
quite
as
potent
flavor
is
long
and
lasting
evolving
over
time
i
can
sense
the
alcohol
throughout
but
it
but
only
really
feel
it
slightly
on
the
back
end
otherwise
its
primarily
a
dark
fruit
maybe
some
nutty
character
no
smokiness
nice
mediumbodied
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
in
there
although
nothing
is
visible
this
is
a
treat
scotch
ale
not
sure
what
that
is
but
i
know
this
is
well
made
enjoy
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
smells
of
wood
with
some
fruits
hidden
underneath
giving
a
complex
smell
that
is
quite
intriguing
the
taste
was
great
with
heavy
malt
flavors
in
the
beginning
as
well
as
heavy
dark
fruits
the
overall
feeling
of
the
beer
is
very
heavy
but
with
wonderful
flavor
layers
this
beer
is
a
definite
winner
for
me
pours
like
a
root
beer
same
kind
of
coloring
head
up
and
quickly
down
little
bitter
on
the
back
taste
but
not
unpleasant
nice
malty
feel
nice
scotch
ale
i
would
put
oneof
these
in
with
some
arrogant
in
my
pick
six
o
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
is
very
high
evidenced
by
the
low
perceived
bitterness
despite
50
ibus

founders
lots
of
juicy

aroma
and
taste
definitely
open
up
as
the
ale
rises
to
room
temperature
a
dark
and
mildly
vinegary
aroma
taste
has
notes
of
prune
and
brown
sugar
or
light
molasses
plus
a
very
mild
spiciness
very
subtle
hops
are
complemented
by
a
sweetish
roasted
malt
whose
character
is
a
bit
elusive
at
first
but
which
comes
more
to
the
fore
in
the
early
finish
with
a
note
of
walnuts
in
the
end
which
i
recognized
after
reading
another
review
finish
is
moderately
drying
but
the
alcohol
is
not
overly
dominating
there
are
slight
nasal
alcohol
fumes
with
exhalation
overall
this
brew
is
a
nice
change
from
my
usual
fare
and
from
one
of
my
favourite
breweries
but
i
find
it
a
bit
too
dominated
by
dark
fruit
for
my
taste
and
this
years
batch
doesnt
seem
as
tasty
as
last
years

i
really
enjoyed
this

and
was
surprised
by
its
level
of
drinkability
its
full
bodied
but
not
overly
thick
or
syrupy
great

overall
a

this
is

brew
recall
having
a
sixer
when
vacationing
in
north
carolina
several
years
ago
definitely
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
big
malt
based
brews
probably
the
most
flavorful
beer
ive
had
cant
say
enough
about
the
strong
malt
complexities
in
combo
with
the
caramel
profile
also
the
scotsman
on
the
bottle
is
the
ultimate
personification
of
this
beer
no

pours
a

solid
beer
predominantly
malty
as
should
be
expected
aromatic
tasty
as
can
be
i
tend
to
be

this
is
a
solid
goto
when
i
need
a

break
compares
really
well
to
other
american
scotch
ales
it
is
the
signature
beer
of
one
of
americas
greatest
craft
breweries
be
warned
though
the
alcohol
effect
is
definitely
wee
heavy
but
does
nothing
to
detract
from
the

dirty
bastard
is
one
of
the
finest
wee
heavies
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
in
my
8
years
on
this
site
with
a
beautifully
bold
malt
backbone
that
works
perfectly
with
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
earthy
hop
finish
this
is
not
one
of
my
favourite
styles
but
like
all
of
founders
offerings
at
least
the
ones
ive
tried
so
far
id
be
more
than
willing
to
pick
up
a
sixer
at
some
point
in
the
future
as
this
is
a
quality
malt
bomb
that
is
sure
to
be
a
crowd
pleaser
a
fabulous
brew
to
ring
in
my
700th
ba
review
o
a
very
solid
beer
goes
well
with
fruitflavored
cheesecake
and
chocolate
fudge
this
was
a
really
underwhelming
beer
for
me
i
have
enjoyed
most
of
founders
offerings
so
far
but
this
one
just
misses
the
mark
for
me
not
an
undrinkable
beer
by
any
means
just
something
i
wont
be
revisiting
anytime
soon
the
first
time
i
drank
this
it
hurt
my
taste
buds
and
i
was
leery
of
trying
it
again
over
the
course
of
the
six
pack
and
a
weeks
time
it
really
grew
on
me
a
good
beer
to
keep
on
hand
and
a
regular
in
my
fridge
tastes
as
good
ice
cold
as
it
does
at
room
temp
o
exceptional
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
the
gold
standard
kudos
to
founders
out
of
the
bottle
it
pours
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
although
it
pours
out
a
nice
head
it
has
no
staying
power
and
little
to
no
lacing
smellwise
it
was
rich
and
aromatic
with
hints
of
almonds
distinct
roasted
malt
and
even
slighter
hints
of
caramel
it
felt
thick
and
bold
sloshing
around
not
watery
at
all
very
bold
but
it
did
leave
a
strong
aftertaste
i
didnt
quite
like
as
far
as
the
taste
i
think
it
was
bogged
down
with
the
overpowering
flavor
of
burnt
malt
rather
than
a
lighter
roasted
flavor
it
just
took
away
something
from
what
was
otherwise
a
pleasant
experience
overall
it
was
outstanding
and
i
was
saddened
to
only
have
had
two
of
these
pours
out
a
ruddy
brown
with
a
thin
ring
of
head
smells
of
toasty
malts
cane
sugar
dried
fruits
and
grape
juice
flavor
is
chewy
malty
toasty
way
too
much
estery
fruitiness
for
me
more
of
an
american
yeast
profile
than
anything
british
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
expectedhoped
carbonation
is
great
scrubs
the
tongue
but
not
too
active
overall
i
like
elements
of
this
beer
but
the
fruity
esters
are
overbearing
o
scotch
ales
and
in
particular
wee
heavys
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
nice
american
take
on
it
i
would
say
the
i
prefer
dark
horses
scotty
karate
over
this
one
slightly
though
it
think
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
much
and
i
really
like
how
much
they
tone
down
in
backwoods
bastard
my
favorite
founders
beer
still
its
hard
to
beat
being
able
to
get
sixers
of
this
stuff
all
year
long
o
this
is
nice
stuff
founders
continues
to
impress
o
seemed
to
have
put
together
a
decent
product
overall
this
is
a
delicious
scotch
ale
which
will
make
me
reconsider
the
style
overall
very
flavorful
filling
and
overall
a
great
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
have
had
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
from
the
bottle
with
a
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
dark
fruit
tastes
of
toffee
chocolate
malt
and
a
nice
balance
of
cherry
and
plum
a
good
bit
of
booze
to
boot
medium
mouth
with
good
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
better
wee
heavies
that
ive
had
so
much
flavor
and
everything
blends
together
so
so
well
just
a
really
good
beer
smooth
and
tasty
id
try
it
again
poured
a
rich
clear
deep
dark
brown
with
deep
ruby
red
highlights
and
a
thin
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
a
nice
ring
of
lacing
an
excellent
looking
beer
and
completely
true
to
the
style
excellent
scent
begins
with
rich
dark
fruit
raisins
plum
and
figs
with
an
equally
rich
malty
character
alongside
aromas
of
caramel
and
hints
of
banana
bread
a
moderate
aroma
of
alcohol
is
also
present
an
excellent
aroma
profile
rich
sweet
malty
and
strong
flavor
begins
strong
and
assertive
with
a
strong
hit
of
sweet
malt
with
rich
flavors
of
caramel
dark
fruit
especially
raisin
and
prune
this
moves
into
some
roasted
malt
flavors
balanced
by
the
same
excellent
caramel
sweetness
and
some
smokey
flavors
and
faint
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
caramel
sweetness
continues
but
is
joined
by
a
stronger
alcohol
presence
and
a
stronger
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
a
faint
touch
of
hops
very
low
that
is
quite
nice
aftertaste
is
roasted
malt
and
some
slight
nutty
flavors
faint
cinnamonlike
flavors
are
present
in
the
background
at
low
levels
throughout

excellent
deep
rich

a
good
true
to

very
nice
for
sipping
overall
this
is
an
excellent
scotch
ale
it
has
a
fantastic

an
amazing

and
an
excellent

aids
the
drinking

taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
flavors
along
with
a
hint
of
fruit
maybe
plum
or
blackberries
this
beer
has
a
bitter
after
taste
but
is
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
very
good
beer
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
as
they
are
rather
filling
overall
a
great
scotch
ale
very
smooth
especially
when
considering
the
abv
full
flavor
and
body
without
being
too
strong
o
not
at
all
bitter
nice
balance
of
flavors
with
the
bold
alcohol
flavor
out
front
the
other
flavors
work
well
and
the
solid
mouth
feel
makes
this
easy
to
drink
but
i
couldnt
put
back
more
than
12
at
one
time
this
is
my
first
wee
heavy
and
i
will
investigate
the
style
further
tried
this
years
ago
and
wasnt
very
impressed
oh
how
we
change
over
the
years
pours
a
dark

in

with
a
good
1finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
the
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
some
sediment
is
seen
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
spotty
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
dark
fruits
malt
and
boozy
the
taste
has
a
lot
going
on
as
well
with
dark
fruit
plum
and
maybe
fig
caramel
and
roasted
malts
with
a
light
hint
of
licorice
perfect
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
bit
hoppy
and
dry
wasnt
bad
but
different
another
fantastic
beverage
from
the
folks
at
founders
loaded
with
character
but
not
too
sweet
a
great
winter
beer
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
but
what
one
can
expect
from
founders
a
perfect
rendition
of
the
scotch
ale
style
but
perfect
for
an
beer
lover
o
very
good
variation
of
the
style
strong
but
doesnt
turn
the
stomach
great
beer
for
the
price
6
pack
instead
of
a
4
which
is
typical
for
this
style
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
bigger
hop
profile
than
other
scotch
ales
cuts
through
the
sweetness
setting
it
apart
from
the
typical
style
o
my
first
scotch
ale
and
i
would
call
this
a
keeper
i
have
yet
to
have
anything
from
founders
that
i
dislike
they
make
quality
beer
overall
all
scotch
ales
are
unique
i
like
it
a
lot
love
this
beer
and
this
brewery
i
dont
see
why
they
named
this
beer
dirty
bastard
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
homeless
guys
beard
sweat
this
scotch
ale
pours
a
deep
brownish
mahogany
hue
with
a
very
slight
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
thin
film
and
substantial
lacing
the
aroma
is
deep
rich
and
sweet
lots
of
burnt
sugar
caramel
and
toffee
notes
plus
a
little
vanilla
and
alcohol
it
is
definitely
a
thicker
side
of
medium
bodied
beer
with
lots
of
coating
sweetness
the
flavor
is
amazing
lots
of
rich
malts
following
the
profile
set
up
by
the
nose
there
is
a
little
bitterness
on
the
tail
that
just
makes
one
want
to
dive
back
in
for
another
sip
of
the
awesome
caramely
malts
on
the
front
end
this
is
a
great
example
of
this
style
and
always
a
favorite
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
a
really
good
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
good
for
dessert
in
the
springtime
o
an
awesome
beer
reminds
me
of
old
scotch
a
lot
akin
to
the
flavor
profile
with
some
slight
deviations
awesome
brew
by
founders
eric
overall
this
is
a
lovely
scotch
ale
so
good
and
complex
overall
a
great
scotch
ale
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
here
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
nice
thick
head
the
first
sip
is
magical
nice
sweetness
and
lots
of
flavor
i
get
hints
of
raisin
plumbs
and
prunes
you
can
taste
and
feel
the
alcohol
at
the
end
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
that
i
could
drink
a
few
bottles
at
a
time
this
is
a
strong
dark
red
the
color
is
attractive
the
smell
is
a
little
spicy
and
sweet
the
taste
is
awesome
somehow
the
alcohol
content
is
hidden
in
a
sip
even
though
a
full
glass
will
knock
me
over
i
have
never
had
a
red
like
this
before
and
i
beg
everyone
to
try
this
one
i
someday
hope
to
find
this
one
on
tap
o
one
of
the
most
quintessential
stateside
scotch
ales
founders
dirty
bastard
is
fullflavored
and
nearly
fullbodied
but
isnt
intense
as
most
of
the
style
reflect
instead
the
sweet
caramelized
wort
opens
up
nuanced
complexity
of
sweets
and
bread
carefully
balanced
by
hops
and
alcohol
dryness
for
a
smooth
beer
that
can
quickly
sneak
up
on
you
well
crafted
wee
heavy
that
really
could
pass
as
a
barleywine
highlights
the
complex
malt
packed
into
it
the
flavor
is
bold
and
complex
with
whiskey
sweetness
and
fruit
features
and
is
easily
the
best
part
of
this
beer
founders
is
always
solid
this
one
is
no
exception
overall
pretty
solid
scotch
ale
on
the
wee
heavy
side
enjoyed
a
lot
over
the
years
overall
very
enjoyable
scottish
ale
with
a
different
slightly
richer
porter
like
take
on
the
style
would
like
to
see
this
aged
in
an
whisky
cask
to
really
make
it
perfect
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
evening
which
seems
to
be
never
ending
in
20132014
would
buy
again
nicely
balanced
scotch
ale
one
of
my
favourites
along
with
skull
splitter
brewdog
dogma
and
traquair
jacobite
similar
to
doppelbocks
like
ayinger
celebrator
and
weltenburger
asambock
but
with
more
bitterness
when
fresh
ive
tried
one
from
the
old
bottle
and
bitterness
was
very
low
the
beer
reminded
me
of
english
strongold
ales
and
classic
scotch
ales
from
scotland
nice
winter
warmer
especially
if
you
want
to
take
a
break
from
imperial
stouts
a
great
beer
strong
taste
probably
too
strong
for
most
tasted
like
a
porter
to
me
the
high
abv
really
gives
it
a
kick
i
was
buzzing
hard
before
i
even
knew
it
the
smell
was
almost
of
chocolate
which
i
like
because
it
didnt
taste
like
chocolate
some
of
the
best
whiskeys
also
smell
like
chocolate
im
assuming
its
because
its
a
scotch
style
ale
if
you
like
strong
beers
of
good
quality
try
this
but
as
their
saying
goes
its
not
for
the
wee
lads
so
be
prepared
also
this
is
my
first
full
review
on
the
site
and
am
really
happy
dirty
bastard
was
my
first
overall
an
outstanding
scotch
ale
that
leaves
a
warm
glow
and
a
desire
for
more
od
very
drinkable
good
scotch
ale
powerful
and
flavourful
while
not
exactly
blowing
you
away
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
deep
dark
ruby
colour
with
relatively
thin
off
white
head
strong
fruity
malt
aroma
hints
of
raisin
and
apple
quite
a
varied
palate
very
sweet
with
strong
flavours
of
molasses
apple
and
toffee
a
very
christmasy
beer
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
but
still
rather
syrupy
in
the
finish
balance
is
a
little
too
sweet
while
the
hop
presence
is
there
it
comes
up
only
around
the
finish
while
the
syrupy
fruity
malts
dominate
at
the
start
still
a
very
drinkable
yet
flavourful
beer
great
as
an
aperatif
manifestation
tastes
the
same
threw
and
threw
not
really
interesting
per
say
if
you
like
guineas
give
it
a
try
if
not
i
wouldnt
waste
your
money
pretty
good
a
big
malty
brew
looks
alright
with
an
aroma
and
flavour
dominated
by
sweet
fruity
malt
and
yeast
nice
body
it
does
seem
a
shade
too
bitter
for
the
style
but
perhaps
thats
just
the
us
take
on
things
a
solid
effort
that
bludgeons
the
senses
with
alcohol
worth
a
punt
if
you
stumble
across
it
its
rare
that
anyone
drink
any
beer
from
founders
and
be
left
anything
but
pleased
dirty
bastard
is
unlikely
to
disappoint
it
is
a
rich
and
deliciously
malty
ale
with
layers
of
flavour
that
amidst
all
the
requisite
nutty
smoky
and
fruity
notes
also
includes
a
great
deal
of
hoppiness
which
is
rare
for
the
style
hops
not
being
native
to
scotland
a
nice
interpretation
i
would
recomend
this
beer
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
ruby
color
body
with
no
head
the
smell
has
a
malty
dark
fruit
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
dark
fruit
malty
with
a
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
over
all
a
good
version
of
the
style
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
styles
this
is
a
ruby
crimsonamber
in
color
it
has
a
mellow
malty
aroma
i
get
a
caramelly
flavor
coming
through
from
the
malt
bill
its
sweet
not
sharp
and
not
harsh
not
syrupy
although
it
could
easily
be
if
there
wasnt
just
the
right
balance
to
this
nice
without
being
a
big
destroyer
but
strong
enough
to
sip
and
enjoy
on
a
cold
night
o
no
date
but
at
least
a
year
or
two
old
and
way
past
its
prime
o
very
enjoyable
began
to
feel
the
8
alcohold
during
the
last
13
excited
founders
will
soon
be
available
in
kansas
o
good
drinkability
another
founders
masterpiece
it
sounds
like
they
cant
make
a
mistake
overall
another
good
one
from
founders
this
is
probably
a
bit
under
appreciated
considering
its
available
year
round
but
this
is
absolutely
a
beer
thats
worth
a
repeat
purchase
overall
a
good
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
better
when
it
is
warmer
o
4
25
great
wee
heavy
id
love
to
compare
it
to
old
chub
and
see
how
they
stand
up
next
to
each
other
pours
a
clear
mahogany
in
color
with
a
short
tan
bubbly
head
falling
quickly
with
some
ephemeral
lacing
the
nose
is
big
and
sweet
and
opens
up
as
the
beer
warms
it
highlights
rich
caramel
sticky
toffee
some
butterscotch
and
hints
of
spice
hops
and
maybe
some
cinnamon
the
taste
is
very
similar
featuring
heavy
sweet
malt
caramel
toffeebutterscotch
that
ends
with
bit
of
spice
but
also
a
touch
metallic
and
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
this
has
a
nice
rich
body
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
very
tasty
scotch
ale
rich
and
sweet
a
great
example
of
this
style
here
and
it
drinks
dangerously
easy
for
how
strong
it
is
caramel
in
color
clear
copper
shine
with
an
inch
of
airy
head
without
much
to
it
fades
out
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
a
complex
mix
of
sweet
grains
with
toffee
and
butterscotch
notes
molasses
too
with
its
earthy
spice
the
flavor
is
just
as
sweet
and
malt
driven
as
the
nose
only
the
layers
of
grain
sort
of
come
in
waves
i
get
some
wheat
malt
in
here
a
ton
of
pale
and
and
caramel
malts
maybe
some
chocolate
malt
too
finish
is
sweet
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
of
this
but
its
a
smooth
feeling
beer
with
quite
a
lot
of
body
and
it
hides
its
strength
well
its
a
good
winter
drinker
but
for
the
sweeter
beer
drinker
i
also
should
mention
that
this
burps
real
well
i
was
tasting
it
for
a
long
time
after
drinking
it
and
it
was
pleasant
the
entire
time
another
solid
offering
from
founders
a
very
well
balanced
example
of
the
scotch
style
ale
this
is
the
one
that
got
me
trying
them
again
an
outstanding
beer
that
went
to
far
with
the
bitter
awesome
for
the
hop
head
just
outstanding
for
me
which
of
course
is
a
good
thing
overall
great
scotch
ale
the
thinner
body
makes
it
go
down
easy
and
the
8
5
could
be
dangerous
excellent
winter
beer
they
put
alot
of
thought
into
replicating
a
scottish
ale
and
will
purchase
this
again
i
find
it
considerably
better
than
oskar
blues
artifically
carbonated
scottish
ale
which
we
had
last
eve
ive
had
six
of
these
now
very
good
fresh
not
so
great
with
six
to
eight
months
of
age
at
first
glance
this
pours
with
a
nice
head
that
diminishes
fast
deep
scarlet
with
good
clarity
no
lacing
and
average
level
of
carbonation
certainly
a
harder
task
with
a
beer
of
this
size
and
malt
complexity
the
aroma
has
smokey
notes
with
a
shadow
of
caramel
and
plums
reminds
me
of
some
flavors
from
marris
otter
on
the
front
end
the
alcohol
warms
the
mouth
with
toffee
plum
like
flavors
following
finished
with
a
light
puckering
bitterness
that
holds
a
noble
east
kent
goldening
spiciness
again
founders
created
a
winner
for
this
style
and
would
be
my
benchmark
overall
a
good
try
i
would
be
curious
to
find
out
what
the
recipe
was
because
it
seems
like
there
is
too
much
roasted
malt
present
its
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
a
schwarzbier
and
a
strong
scotch
ale
at
least
the
ssa
is
part
of
the
combo
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
a
friend
over
other
examples
of
this
style
and
i
wouldnt
buy
again
but
i
can
enjoy
the
six
pack
i
have
o
a
solid
representative
of
the
class
remarks
enjoyed
it
overall
but
the
hop
profile
seems
to
be
off
for
the
style
definitely
something
ill
be
drinking
again
a
great
beer
thats
worthy
of
its
name
its
thick
and
muddy
colored
but
tastes
almost
cheeky
overall
great
scotch
ale
probably
the
best
ive
had
so
far
well
balanced
plenty
of
scotch
notes
but
without
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
that
can
be
present
with
this
style
complex
and
great
on
a
cold
day
overy
enjoyable
scotch
ale
from
founders
glad
i
got
a
six
pack
wow
this
beer
has
a
ruby
reddish
color
in
a
glass
smell
is
of
malts
and
smoke
nice
lacing
on
glass
flavor
is
very
up
front
of
bitter
malts
but
its
worth
its
price
tag
alcohol
is
present
in
taste
but
not
too
bad
this
beer
will
fill
you
up
thats
a
fact
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
2
a
day
its
a
big
beer
missing
a
little
complexity
or
maybe
suffering
a
little
from
transportation
but
with
plenty
to
offer
nonetheless
o
i
had
to
come
back
to
this
beer
to
really
appreciate
craft
that
goes
into
the
making
of
this
beer
its
so
widely
available
in
michigan
that
i
had
a
tendency
to
overlook
it
i
wont
make
that
mistake
again
nice
not
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
ever
had
but
a
perfectly
respectable
effort
nothing
against
this
beer
or
founders
this
just
isnt
my
style
of
beer
maybe
im
not
a
wee
heavy
guy
easy
to
see
how
founders
built
on
this
as
a
flagship
an
excellent
beer
to
drink
all
year
round
but
would
be
especially
good
with
dessert
or
in
the
depths
of
winter
founders
dirty
bastard
45
o
definitely
a
sweet
and
complex
beer
heavy
leafy
bitterness
in
the
finish
adds
a
nice
balance
thanks
again
matt
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
both
fresh
and
aged
the
bottle
im
having
now
is
from
2911
and
is
honestly
one
of
the
best
off
the
shelf
beers
to
age
overall
i
dont
drink
many
scotch
ales
so
i
cant
review
well
to
style
but
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
i
hate
to
say
itbut
i
much
prefer
this
to
backwoods
bastard
which
is
similar
of
course
but
just
over
the
top
in
so
many
ways
wow
this
is
one
if
not
the
best
american
wee
heavys
ive
had
to
date
probably
the
most
bitter
scotch
ale
but
it
works
excellent
layering
of
toffeecaramel
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
coffee
fruity
and
bready
with
a
stellar
rounded
out
bitter
finish
what
more
could
you
want
in
a
scotch
ale
overall
its
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
if
it
was
paired
with
the
right
meal
it
would
be
a
good
sipper
for
dinner
i
will
get
it
again
though
its
worth
a
try
buy
it
with
a
six
mix
bottom
line
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
you
will
probably
be
satisfied
fantastic
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
not
a
lot
of
light
gets
through
this
one
a
half
inch
layer
of
foam
rests
on
top
i
get
some
caramel
malt
and
honestly
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
the
flavor
is
caramelized
malt
and
it
hits
hard
and
quick
on
the
front
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
bit
thick
and
substantial
you
get
a
nice
malt
fade
at
the
back
of
the
palate
with
a
warming
from
the
alcohol
in
your
throat
i
am
having
fun
with
this
site
and
although
i
do
not
know
how
to
review
like
most
of
you
that
i
have
read
i
know
what
i
like
i
really
like
this
beer
the
taste
is
crisp
clean
and
offers
a
mouth
full
of
taste
that
makes
drinking
this
beer
pleasurable
this
is
an
exemplary
display
of
how
to
do
a
maltysweet
style
without
being
cloying
or
onedimensional
dirty
bastard
is
complex
well
balanced
and
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
another
ace
effort
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
nose
is
of
spice
smoke
and
malt
moderately
hopped
this
brew
lets
the
malts
shine
with
their
complexity
of
sweetness
smoke
and
roast
flavor
for
an
8
5
alcoholic
brew
the
balance
is
a
brew
masters
masterpiece
no
alcoholic
faults
are
present
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
coupled
with
an
outstanding
flavor
profile
from
start
to
finish
tastes
earthy
and
rich
immediately
i
note
the
slick
oily
feel
smooth
slight
molasses
nondescript
dark
fruit
rye
and
just
when
i
think
the
flavor
apex
is
going
to
lend
itself
to
the
satisfying
profile
akin
to
a
quaddrupel
a
woody
burn
and
a
dry
aspect
creeps
in
at
the
end
different
to
me
then
again
my
first
try
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
for
sure
i
can
say
but
i
can
also
tell
this
is
wellcrafted
for
what
it
is
due
especially
to
the
superb
mouthfeel
an
ok
beer
with
way
too
much
hops
for
this
style
the
hops
left
a
heavy
bitterness
on
the
mouth
that
was
not
balanced
by
other
elements
in
the
brew
too
many
craft
brewers
are
of
the
more
is
more
persuasion
when
it
comes
to
hops
and
i
hope
this
trend
ends
othis
beer
was
great
it
had
plenty
going
on
overall
this
was
good
not
great
i
usually
expect
scotch
ales
to
be
really
heavy
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
one
were
good
but
not
amazing
i
recall
other
scotch
ales
where
i
took
a
sip
and
immediately
said
wow
not
the
case
for
this
one
although
it
is
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
others
ive
had
this
is
a
delicious
glass
of
scotch
ale
from
one
of
the
nations
finest
breweries
and
i
like
it
more
and
more
with
each
passing
sip
the
alcohol
level
is
higher
than
the
average
beer
but
it
isnt
as
noticeable
as
i
expected
it
to
be
the
interplay
between
the
hops
and
malts
and
the
great
deal
of
complexity
are
this
beers
strong
points
and
they
just
keep
on
giving
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
glass
its
certainly
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
its
an
excellent
beer
side
note
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
mug
for
the
first
tasting
then
i
used
a
basic
reidel
wine
glass
finally
i
tried
it
in
a
tulip
in
all
three
the
flavor
profile
did
not
change
enough
to
matter
even
straight
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
opened
well
onto
the
palate
o
soothing
delicious
a
terrific
scotch
ale
o
its
a
good
beer
it
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
but
i
would
drink
it
again
and
i
would
enjoy
it
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
preferred
it
on
tap
over
the
bottle
but
bottle
is
still
great
i
enjoyed
the
warmth
and
depth
of
scotch
flavors
a
little
sweet
and
hit
the
spot
i
wanted
to
pair
it
with
another
one
and
maybe
some
charceuterie
it
would
be
great
with
smoked
meats
or
a
steak
pretty
world
class
brewwish
this
were
available
to
me
on
the
regular
i
like
this
one
a
lot
it
is
not
your
average
scotch
ale
it
has
that
dark
fruit
you
think
of
being
a
mainly
belgian
charachter
it
works
well
and
the
fact
it
is
a
regular
release
for
7
996
at
8
5
abv
well
you
sure
can
not
beet
that
if
i
were
looking
to
get
shitty
some
night
i
could
see
my
self
grabbing
a
6
or
2
of
this
and
goin
at
it
o
a
nice
big
malty
scottish
ale
tasty
enjoyable
stuff
that
left
the
finish
not
the
way
this
one
started
out
i
think
that
was
my
major
reason
why
i
couldnt
give
this
one
higher
grades
pours
a
clear
ruby
color
with
thin
off
white
head
couple
dots
of
lace
smell
earthy
heavily
caramelized
sugars
dark
fruit
fig
black
cherry
taste
dirty
i
suppose
earthy
toasted
dark
bread
caramel
fig
fruit
candy
good
not
terribly
interesting
overall
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
and
balanced
brew
quite
smooth
and
yet
complex
totally
worth
the
12
i
paid
for
a
6
pack
this
will
be
my
goto
scotch
ale
for
a
nice
smooth
sipper
on
a
cold
winter
night
the
fascination
of
this
brew
isnt
in
its
complexity
or
nuance
but
how
you
can
keep
such
a
sweet
maltbomb
contained
and
drinkable
there
are
just
enough
drying
aspects
around
the
edges
to
keep
this
going
down
smoothly
mouthfeel
is
medium
thickness
but
sticky
and
slick
overall
nice
beer
although
outside
of
my
normal
style
range
these
days
o
decent
beer
will
try
again
in
a
bottle
of
from
a
growler
in
the
comforts
of
home
so
i
can
get
the
full
flavor
and
aromas
from
this
one
good
example
of
a
pretty
unfashionable
style
not
too
many
misses
come
from
these
guys
regardless
of
the
style
o
wonderful
scotch
ale
great
variety
of
malt
flavors
all
well
balanced
and
providing
excellent
complexity
one
of
the
very
best
out
there
i
think
if
she
was
oaked
it
would
be
like
a
perfect
scotch
ale
everything
you
need
is
right
there
sweet
high
abv
woodsy
maltiness
the
only
downer
is
that
you
can
taste
the
boozyness
a
little
too
much
but
hey
dont
be
troubled
this
is
a
btchin
beer
to
have
any
time
brothers
graduation
alien
invasion
wednesday
brunch
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
o
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
it
hits
the
mark
too
easy
to
sip
away
at
this
one
i
rated
this
a
4
previously
probably
due
to
the
malt
complexity
and
low
alcohol
bite
good
scotch
ale
for
the
rare
occasion
im
in
the
mood
for
one
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
a
fantastically
done
scotch
ale
a
style
that
we
really
dont
see
nearly
enough
of
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
as
an
after
dinner
beer
its
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
unless
paired
with
a
good
that
would
cut
the
sweetness
i
usually
like
scotch
ales
but
this
one
was
far
too
hoppy
and
bitter
founders
is
a
terrific
brewery
but
i
wish
they
would
scale
back
on
the
hops
in
their
beers
that
are
stylistically
defined
as
being
more
maltcentric
ok
i
know
i
rated
this
as
perfection
but
i
really
have
not
met
a
founders
beer
i
dont
love
they
do
their
beers
proper
and
dirty
bastard
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
have
had
it
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
and
loved
it
equally
i
am
planning
a
trip
to
founders
soon
looking
forward
to
having
it
fresh
this
bastard
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
pungent
mix
of
yeast
and
hops
the
taste
starts
very
sweet
and
malty
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
scotch
ale
but
still
very
good
a
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
last
few
weeks
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
again
considering
it
wasnt
the
most
expensive
a
very
nice
and
wonderfully
complex
aroma
that
fades
slightly
in
the
taste
but
in
nonetheless
still
an
excellent
beer
overall
a
primo
example
of
the
style
esp
for
being
a
year
round
offering
very
hard
to
beat
for
the
price
overall
i
quite
liked
this
beer
not
a
highlight
of
all
beers
but
a
great
beer
as
far
as
wee
heavies
go
i
known
i
will
be
sharing
in
the
future
with
others
definitely
a
reason
to
respect
founders
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
copper
and
golden
edges
the
finger
of
buttery
brown
head
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
has
some
malt
notes
but
it
is
not
very
strong
the
flavor
is
hearty
and
malty
but
it
is
not
super
heavy
considering
the
style
and
the
abv
there
is
a
slight
malty
sweetness
on
the
finish
very
interesting
for
me
and
i
like
that
i
can
see
where
the
alcohol
can
be
distracting
but
thats
part
of
the
schtick
of
a
scotch
ale
decent
offering
from
founders
very
drinkable
though
bigger
bodied
nice
beer
another
good
showing
from
founders
o
a
strong
representative
of
the
style
very
intriguing
as
well
dark
yet
refreshing
smells
of
toffee
yet
has
barely
any
sweetness
strong
flavors
yet
muted
aromas
a
good
brew
not
quite
up
my
alley
but
ill
still
enjoy
it
if
i
find
one
in
my
hand
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
i
found
backwoods
bastard
to
be
memorably
mediocre
and
after
drinking
this
my
dislike
may
be
even
more
this
isnt
a
burly
monster
that
would
benefit
from
barrelaging
this
is
actually
pretty
balanced
with
a
nicely
complex
malt
profile
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
would
have
preferred
a
slightly
sweeter
version
while
still
staying
faithful
to
the
style
overall
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
hid
pretty
well
fairly
sweet
with
just
enough
roasty
bitterness
to
help
balance
it
d
highly
drinkable
pun
intended
at
8
5
this
will
do
you
right
too
highly
carbonated
overall
a
great
take
on
the
style
not
the
biggest
fan
but
this
is
on
par
with
old
chub
as
my
favorite
per
se
very
well
balanced
yet
with
no
intention
of
hiding
the
alcohol
lots
of
other
flavors
as
well
great
for
the
price
i
love
the
fact
i
get
to
review
this
thank
you
founders
great
name
too
and
pours
a
very
deep
tawny

a
little
too
much
and
has
tastes
of
vanillacarameltoffee
maltscandied
plums
and
finishes
with
a
nuttybiscuity
bittersweetness
and
overall
its
very
drinkable
for
the
style
but
not
sensational
cheers
availability
yearround
o
great
scotch
ale
hides
the
8
5
abv
very
well
overall
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
founders
beer
or
a
scotch
style
ale
and
i
am
very
impressed
delicious
and
smooth
o
an
amazing
scotch
ale
very
dangerous
doesnt
have
a
10
feel
to
it
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
mediocre
it
was
thick
enough
to
have
sort
of
an
oily
feel
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
but
still
managed
to
seem
a
little
boring
in
flavour
it
was
drier
than
any
scotch
style
ale
ive
had
which
was
interesting
but
i
also
didnt
taste
nearly
as
much
smoke
flavour
as
im
used
to
so
that
was
a
pretty
big
bummer
overall
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
it
has
a
fairly
complex
taste
and
its
pretty
sweet
and
malty
but
well
balanced
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
if
i
am
in
the
mood
although
this
beer
is
not
necessarily
my
favorite
style
o
outstanding
scotch
ale
definitely
a
sipper
as
its
so
filling
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
do
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
gladly
get
again
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
the
caramel
tasting
darker
malts
when
i
first
got
into
craft
beer
but
it
is
definitely
growing
on
me
thanks
to
beers
like
this
would
certainly
recommend
overall
a
great
version
of
the
style
mostly
sweet
but
its
done
in
a
way
that
is
clean
and
balanced
it
would
be
entirely
too
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
doubt
id
buy
a
sixer
of
this
style
but
this
one
would
certainly
tempt
me
poured
into
thistle
glass
dark
brown
and
clear
showing
deep
garnetruby
in
light
with
a
minimal
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
rim
of
fizz
smells
like
grape
nuts
cereal
and
thats
a
good
thing
in
this
case
nutty
crackery
slightly
caramelized
malt
with
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
cant
wait
to
taste
this
with
a
nose
like
that
and
i
am
not
disappointed
sweet
crackery
caramel
malts
are
all
over
the
place
with
warming
alcohol
hiding
in
the
background
between
a
pinch
of
bittering
herbal
hop
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
full
but
smooth
a
bit
sticky
delicious
o
a
great
take
on
the
style
earthy
dirty
rich
with
a
surprising
spiciness
there
is
a
lot
more
hops
than
i
expected
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
o
a
solid
scotch
ale
overall
that
really
only
falls
short
on
a
subdued
aroma
its
tasty
and
drinkable
without
being
overly
sweet
mahogany
pour
with
a
two
finger
creamy
off
white
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
with
nice
lacing
a
somewhat
subdued
earthy
malty
nose
with
hints
of
caramel
maple
wood
toffee
and
a
touch
of
herbal
perfume
as
it
warms
the
complex
taste
is
rich
and
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
along
with
hints
of
maple
dark
fruits
wood
molasses
butterscotch
vanilla
and
a
distinct
herbal
piney
note
that
ive
tasted
with
heather
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
slightly
syrupy
with
a
subtle
warming
burn
on
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
overall
this
is
not
a
style
im
really
familiar
with
but
as
always
founders
leaves
me
wanting
more
pours
dark
brown
rich
no
foam
to
speak
of
woodsy
nose
caramel
malt
too
taste
is
a
peatearthy
with
a
whiskey
back
clingy
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
overall
decent
good
take
on
the
style
but
quite
earthy
to
be
fair
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
o
outstanding
beer
im
new
to
this
particular
style
but
as
for
the
experience
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
others
glad
to
have
gotten
a
bottle
for
my
birthday
update
122713
had
two
more
from
a
sixpack
i
purchased
bottled
100813
probably
much
fresher
than
the
one
reviewed
last
may
and
the
head
on
initial
pour
was
three
inches
requiring
a
second
pour
same
great
taste
as
the
first
o
full
disclosurethis
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
that
said
this
beer
is
for
me
one
of
the
best
executions
of
this
unique
style
in
dirty
bastard
not
too
alcoholic
and
not
too
sweet
the
8
5
is
perfect
and
the
beer
is
just
heavy
enough
without
being
pretentious
very
highly
recommended
up
there
with
the
imperial
stout
among
the
best
offerrings
out
of
grand
rapids
if
you
can
find
its
more
sophisticated
brother
backwards
bastard
youll
be
in
for
a
rare
treat
o
this
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
that
is
not
available
to
me
here
in
louisiana
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
once
wish
i
could
get
more
founders
brews
here
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
another
if
i
had
a
second
bottle
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff

db
was
my
first
offering
from
founders
and
i
was
not
disappointed
db
is
a
great
scotch
alewee
heavy
that
is
a
bit
more
sweet
and
a
bit
less
smokey

others

abv
overall
very
nice
beer
even
nicer
is
its
availability
at
least
here
in
cleveland
basic
flavors
surround
this
beer
and
seems
to
fit
well
to
its
style
overall
a
good
drink
for
the
seasoned
beer
drinker
may
ward
off
those
who
arent
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
light
scents
of
honey
molasses
and
cloves
the
color
is
a
beautiful
deep
reddishbrown
or
mahogany
tastes
of
burntsugar
sourdough
toasted
marshmallows
and
currants
on
the
fore
lemongrass
oranges
and
piney
on
the
finish
with
a
nice
light
hoppiness
and
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
a
wonderful
beer
through
and
through
very
wellbalanced
if
i
had
to
say
that
it
left
anything
to
be
desired
perhaps
id
enjoy
a
tad
more
hops
on
the
finish
but
that
would
really
be
nitpicking
its
another
outstanding
offering
from
founders
a
great
beer
o
a
very
good
beer
probably
my
2nd
favorite
of
the
style
im
happy
to
finally
have
founders
in
texas
i
actually
confused
this
brew
with
backwoods
bastard
and
was
a
little
disappointed
at
first
when
i
realized
my
mistake
however
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
it
was
fairly
harsh
at
first
but
i
think
that
was
just
because
it
was
my
first
beer
of
the
day
this
beer
is
just
wonderful
beautiful
pour
and
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
even
more
complex
i
cant
really
compare
this
to
other
scotch
ales
as
i
havent
had
many
but
dirty
bastard
is
good
no
matter
the
category
buy
it
and
dont
look
back
o
its
just
a
good
brew
overall
the
only
way
to
really
get
a
good
feel
for
it
is
to
get
one
for
yourself
highly
recommended
im
not
a
normal
drinker
of
the
wee
heavy
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
great
price
for
a
sixer
makes
this
one
a
no
brainer
when
i
want
a
break
from
ipas
and
stouts
just
another
fine
beer
from
a
great
brewery
give
it
a
try
folks
pours
a
rich
murky
copper
color
akin
to
an
old
suitcase
head
is
slight
maybe
a
finger
or
slightly
less
but
the
lacing
stays
throughout
nose
is
strong
of
molasses
raisins
prunes
and
a
bit
of
scotch
smokiness
taste
is
wellbalanced
with
molasses
and
figs
coming
through
most
prominently
overall
a
great
beer
as
founders
is
want
to
make
and
a
great
example
of
scotch
ale
gorgeous
old
dark
leather
wallet
color
deep
brown
with
transparency
and
hints
of
red
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
easy
feeling
with
a
nice
crisp
taste
all
and
all
very
satisfied
id
give
this
sucker
a
solid
93
o
by
far
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
few
revisits
cheers
this
is
a
great
beer
i
think
it
may
be
my
favorite
scottish
ale
im
glad
founders
is
finally
available
in
my
area
pours
a
dark
cloudy
redbrown
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
sweet
with
a
big
alcohol
presence
its
not
very
strong
and
not
exactly
pleasant
lets
just
say
the
smell
alone
would
probably
turn
me
off
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
sting
and
bitterness
the
alcohol
aftertaste
lingers
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
dissipates
over
time
overall
this
is
an
alright
brew
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
though
i
guess
im
just
not
much
of
a
scotch
ale
fan
wow
founders
really
knows
how
to
get
styles
and
turn
them
upside
down
to
the
point
where
theyre
stylistically
innovative
and
super
flavorful
as
well
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
maltfocused
beer
of
its
kind
great
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
as
there
is
a
subtle
blend
of
toasted
malt
and
dried
fruit
the
dirty
bastard
makes
an
exquisite
quaff
for
any
lad
and
lassie
willing
to
experience
a
complex
concoction
of
a
style
that
is
truly
hard
to
get
right
founders
really
got
this
dirty
bastard
right
and
gave
us
an
example
of
a
wonderful
scottish
beer
that
will
bring
out
the
braveheart
in
all
of
us
freedom
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
irish
red
style
beers
so
far
although
im
not
very
experienced
in
these
styles
of
beers
yet
overall
one
of
my
favorite
founders
beers
a
nice
example
of
the
style
very
comparable
to
robert
the
bruce
maybe
even
better
o
very
very
good
beer
its
very
strong
but
you
would
never
know
it
from
the
taste
its
very
smooth
and
leaves
a
taste
that
lingers
in
a
good
way
definitely
tastes
like
caramelvanillabourbon
and
goes
down
smooth
will
leave
you
wanting
more
overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
overall
after
a
winter
of
disappointing
scotch
ales
it
is
nice
to
have
had
this
experience
i
will
be
making
the
trip
to
ny
again
soon
to
acquire
more
i
like
this
a
lot
not
life
altering
but
a
very
solid
beer
overall
this
is
good
beer
though
the
smoky
peats
could
have
been
stronger
and
the
sugars
somewhat
lighter
to
achieve
a
better
sense
of
balance
the
hops
were
also
rather
strong
in
the
aftertaste
for
while
the
malts
could
largely
overcome
the
heavy
50
ibus
in
the
main
mouthful
they
lose
to
them
in
the
aftertaste
still
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
quite
delicious
o
i
really
like
founders
but
this
is
not
doing
much
for
me
if
im
looking
for
a
scotch
ale
brewed
in
michigan
it
is
going
to
be
scotty
karate
100
of
the
time
o
this
is
the
best
weheavy
that
i
have
tried
there
may
be
other
great
ones
out
there
but
this
one
is
a
winner
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
porter
its
surpsingly
easy
to
drink
despite
the
abv
just
got
back
from
my
friend
kats
wedding
this
brew
pours
up
mahogany
with
light
off
white
lacing
aroma
is
malty
caramel
molasses
red
apple
peel
subtle
kiss
of
hops
the
taste
is
subtle
smoky
caramel
vagina
little
bittering
hop
background
full
bodied
nice
crispy
carbo
bite
im
scottish
and
i
gotta
say
this
is
a
damn
fine
wee
heavy
even
though
there
was
an
extensive
selection
of
beers
i
was
enjoying
the
dirty
bastard
so
much
i
just
stuck
with
a
couple
of
them
before
coffee
and
dessert
i
like
the
high
abv
darker
malt
beers
and
this
was
a
good
one
a
thick
feel
compliments
the
robust
malt
flavor
touches
of
raisin
prune
cracker
bread
and
sorghum
waft
smoothly
along
the
palate
with
a
smooth
easy
taste
and
feel
this
a
solid
entry
for
a
sipping
winter
warmer
the
color
is
dark
cola
and
it
delivers
a
nice
1inch
beige
head
that
lingers
quite
long
smell
is
very
pleasing
carameldriven
good
body
and
carbonation
the
high
abv
can
barely
be
felt
crispy
aftertaste
courtesy
of
the
well
balanced
hoppiness
the
dominant
flavor
i
found
was
that
of
prunes
intermixed
with
caramel
malt
and
some
light
roasted
notes
very
enjoyable
i
wish
i
had
more
bottles
in
my
fridge
wee
heavys
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
think
founders
really
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
food
pairing
i
find
myself
drawn
to
a
briskit
sandwich
with
some
jus
to
dip
into
i
could
also
get
into
some
orange
ginger
chicken
id
love
to
try
this
also
with
some
mutton
stew
for
dessert
pineapple

down
cake
i
picked
this
up
at
the
piggly
wiggly
on
a
whim
not
knowing
anything
about
it
glad
i
did
its
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
times
its
dark
but
not
syrupy
and
cloying
its
tasty
but
the
taste
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
drinkability
i
usually
like
my
dark
beers
to
taste
like
a
meal
but
this
one
doesnt
and
i
dont
mind
with
a
8
5
abv
its
a
lot
of
bang
for
your
buck
great
stuff
overall
i
guess
not
worth
aging
overall
thought
i
give
this
one
a
try
since
i
am
a
big
fan
of
strong
malts
the
raisiny
taste
throws
me
off
of
it
solid
another
great
take
on
a
style
by
founders
but
it
ultimately
lacks
the
more
intricate
malt
flavors
i
expect
from
the
style
o
i
really
loved
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
grabbed
some
more
im
really
starting
to
fall
in
love
with
this
style
a
great
sweet
dessert
beer
or
just
a
nice
sweet
winter
beer
i
would
drink
this
anytime
however
o
a
very
tasty
and
well
made
scotch
ale
its
almost
night
and
day
when
compared
to
backwoods
though
backwoods
really
loses
quite
a
bit
of
the
dark
fruits
as
a
year
round

is

dirty
bastard
is
quite
the
scotch
ale
it
is
rich
and
packed
with
all
sorts
of
caramel
dark
fruit
light
hops
and
peaty
flavors
quite
complex
and
just
the
right
amount
of
decadence
to
be
an
excellent
afterdinner
beer
would
go
great
with
a
traditional
bavarian
meal
its
too
early
to
be
having
these
thoughts
go
out
and
buy
a
sixer
great
value
overall
really
dug
the
taste
nothing
fancy
but
good
d
solid
scotch
ale
malty
and
rich
not
a
blow
away
try
backwoods
for
that
but
certainly
tasty
and
moderately
priced
o
wow
another
hit
from
founders
they
really
know
what
theyre
doing
and
have
done
nothing
but
impress
me
o
a
really
nice
scotch
the
peat
and
smoke
are
pretty
subtle
which
i
like
also
not
overly
sweet
or
sugary
o
the
first
founders
i
ever
had
and
not
a
bad
one
to
start
with
definitely
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
tried
o
complex
flavor
very
pleasant
definitely
a
little
spice
o
i
would
say
the
best
scotch
style
ale
ive
had
but
only
really
had
the
sam
adams
variant
though
so
i
guess
i
cant
really
judge
the
style
as
much
for
a
beer
overall
though
this
is
some
good
stuff
very
complex
taste
the
fruity
character
is
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
ale
but
the
slight
smokey
peat
taste
sets
it
apart
not
bad
for
the
price
per
six
pack
will
definitely
purchase
again
thanks
founders
you
have
yet
to
let
me
down
overall
this
brew
is
good
on
the
nose
but
the
taste
does
not
follow
the
nose
as
well
as
it
should
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
but
it
would
be
better
if
all
of
the
smells
were
present
in
the
taste
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
and
some
citrus
hops
also
a
good
bit
of
dark
fermented
fruit
oak
and
some
boozieness
taste
is
light
bitter
and
light
sweet
lots
of
caramel
and
citrus
hops
with
dark
fruit
and
oak
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
lively
carbonation
and
a
long
finish
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
another
great
beer
by
founders
i
am
a
bit
of
a
hophead
but
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
bit
more
hops
overall
it
was
delicious
and
i
know
that
i
will
be
having
it
again
what
more
can
you
say
this
could
be
considered
a
freaking
good
beer
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
small
14
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
pretty
much
a
perfect
balance
between
malthops
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
one
of
my
top
5
all
time
favorites
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
is
that
i
dont
live
closer
to
the
brewery
and
its
utopian
taps
o
theres
a
reason
this
is
one
of
founders
mainstays
such
a
great
example
of
the
style
if
i
close
my
eyes
and
pretend
i
can
taste
backwoods
i
do
like
the
beer
on
occasion
but
i
just
cant
get
over
the
ending
flavor
this
beer
smells
and
looks
great
as
it
is
unfiltered
which
i
love
the
abv
content
is
awesome
if
you
drink
only
a
couple
per
sitting
as
i
do
maybe
there
is
something
wrong
with
my
pallet
as
it
is
not
my
favorite
however
i
will
give
it
a
break
and
definetly
try
it
again
down
the
road
as
it
is
still
on
my
list
of
top
fives
i
will
pay
the
extra
for
the
skull
splitter
for
now
still
looking
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
little
bit
one
dimensional
the
caramel
maltiness
is
excellent
but
i
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
complexity
the
sweetness
is
a
little
much
for
me
as
well
backwoods
bastard
is
ten
times
better
than
the
dirty
excellent
scotch
ale
great
even
who
does
not
dig
the
style
got
balance
character
and
lots
of
flavors
o
enjoyable
choice
seemed
to
get
better
the
more
i
drank
and
the
warmer
it
became
the
last
few
sips
near
room
temperature
were
the
best
easy
drinking
beer
caramel
fruits
and
a
peaty
character
i
guess
fairly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
excellent
scotch
ale
full
body
and
smooth
finish
maybe
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
not
bad
considering
the
abv
o
incredible
beer
this
style
has
always
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
sometimes
too
sweet
but
other
times
balanced
and
properly
malty
this
is
definite
hit
a
direct
hit
if
other
scotch
ales
were
like
this
id
drink
them
more
often
now
on
to
backwoods
bastard
the
progression
in
taste
is
certain
one
that
rises
in
its
intensity
which
is
always
welcome
the
first
thing
that
hits
the
palate
is
a
very
sweet
brownsugary
scotch
taste
dont
mistake
this
as
an
indication
that
the
8
5
abv
isnt
masked
well
for
this
is
quite
the
contrary
near
the
middle
there
is
an
odd
hop
presence
that
falls
somewhere
between
the
earthy
and
grassy
area
of
the
spectrum
excuse
my
ambiguous
terminology
im
not
wellversed
in
specific
hop
varieties
enough
to
accurately
diagnose
it
beyond
that
each
sip
taste
a
bit
different
for
i
just
tasted
an
almost
milkshake
chocolately
note
that
ive
never
found
before
which
itself
is
a
testament
to
the
devious
sweetness
of
this
heavy
brew
not
much
carbonation
here
gives
rise
to
a
syrupy
texture
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
oddly
wet
finish
everything
here
is
really
well
balanced
and
in
order
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
very
good
ill
be
glad
to
drink
it
anytime
o
great
beer
worth
buying
all
the
time
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
like
a
very
dark
honey
with
a
fleeting
yellowish
head
rising
up
a
halffinger
on
a
good
day
and
rather
quickly
dissipating
to
a
thin
lace
then
fragmenting
into
mere
wisps
but
beneath
this
theres
noteworthy
substance
notes
of
caramel
rise
up
with
chocolate
and
coffee
that
inhabit
the
taste
too
along
with
a
hit
of
butter
to
boot
and
a
touch
of
toffeeyum
the
mouthfeel
being
medium
and
impressively
smooth
from
start
to
finish
a
satisfying
and
highly
recommended
scotch
ales
a
very
nice
beer
a
bit
heavy
on
the
abv
but
tasty
the
color
and
head
are
average
it
has
a
nice
carbonation
throughout
even
after
the
head
settles
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
but
the
hops
lingers
for
quite
a
while
after
you
put
the
glass
down
a
six
pack
was
about
14
bucks
which
i
think
is
this
beers
only
downfall
it
is
good
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
lay
down
this
much
money
for
it
again
there
are
many
beers
as
good
or
better
for
a
few
bucks
less
i
find
yards
esa
is
comparable
in
style
and
flavor
for
about
10
bucks
a
six
pack
over
all
it
is
worth
a
try
o
a
solid
scotch
ale
hits
the
basic
criteria
of
a
scotch
high
abv
smoky
strong
taste
however
its
not
as
good
as
arcadias
loch
down
the
dirty
bastard
is
a
bit
thicker
without
a
corresponding
stronger
taste
the
taste
could
be
clearer
and
bigger
for
the
body
around
it
the
typical
tea
like
bitterness
was
not
present
instead
the
taste
buds
are
overwhelmed
with
mroe
bitterness
than
what
is
typical
of
the
style
very
american
interpretation
lots
of
caramel
sugar
and
biscuit
in
the
malt
backbone
slight
spicyness
from
the
alcohol
o
another
great
beer
from
founders
these
guys
do
not
know
how
to
make
an
average
beer
everything
is
high
quality
and
tasty
and
strong
cheers
o
this
is
a
truly
interesting
brew
that
is
a
superbly
crafted
and
dazzles
the
taste
buds
overall
nice
drinkable
scotch
great
allaround
balance
does
well
to
hide
the
8
5
my
guess
wouldve
been
around
6
i
could
stand
to
drink
several
more
of
these
ive
only
tried
a
handful
but
this
is
probably
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
to
date
dont
stay
thirsty
my
friends
get
some
founders
and
quench
that
thirst

i
have

flavors
good

presence
great
feel
pours
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
scotch
ale
a
deep
color
that
is
somewhere
between
a
copper
and
a
dark
brownruby
rather
flat
on
the
pour
which
was
a
bit
disappointing
aromas
of
coffee
and
candied
fruits
very
very
pleasing
aromas
that
do
remind
me
of
mccallan
12yr
toasty
but
sweet
at
the
same
time
with
a
hint
of
that
peat
my
biggest
disappointment
on
the
beer
came
on
taste
it
is
just
sort
of
meh
not
much
intensity
or
the
sweet
fruits
on
the
pallet
rather
a
bit
of
maltiness
followed
by
a
bitter
finish
may
have
to
add
a
few
tasting

a

not

hides
the

and
a

pleasant

this
is
a
very

that
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
available

in
most

definitely
a

very

o
its
different
unique
its
strong
so
drink
it
slow
the
hard
bourbon
after
taste
is
interesting
put
it
on
your
list
wow
this
turned
out
to
be
a
beer
that
i
liked
much
more
than
i
expected
great
golden
brown
color
nose
with
lots
of
grape
fig
flavors
an
extremely
smooth
and
malty
taste
with
alcohol
nicely
in
a
supporting
role
a
superb
creamy
mouth
i
just
hope
i
dont
like
it
less
the
next
time
even
though
i
like
founders
a
lot
this
was
a
nice
pleasant
surprise
still
thinking
about
that
backwoods
though
this
is
a
rich
heavy
sweet
tasty
beer
nice
looking
great
smelling
with
a
bourbon
influenced
feel
not
sure
if
this
was
aged
in
oak
but
it
sure
tastes
like
it
o
simple
but
very
good
usually
i
am
looking
for
more
depth
from
a
beer
but
the
flavor
profile
on
this
one
works
extremely
well
with
such
few
elements
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
after
a
few
sips
as
it
numbs
the
back
of
your
throat
but
i
never
tasted
it
really
well
done
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
dark
stuff
could
be
better
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
slight
haze
in
the
glass
a
quick
pour
gives
a
thin
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
dissipate
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
of
all
malt
and
just
what
a
scotch
ale
should
be
caramels
dominate
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
bready
notes
in
there
as
well
a
sugary
sweetness
and
touch
of
alcohol
are
also
present
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
strong
caramel
maltiness
as
the
base
surprisingly
this
beer
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
have
expected
given
the
smell
and
the
style
as
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
bitterness
with
little
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
malt
beyond
the
caramel
there
is
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
earthy
yeast
character
that
add
to
the
complexity
of
this
beer
alcohol
is
also
present
but
it
is
restrained
and
seems
just
right
for
this
style
this
is
a
big
rich
and
creamy
beer
that
floats
along
the
tongue
leaving
a
tingle
and
slight
alcohol
numbing
character
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
i
personally
would
have
liked
tit
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
throughout
but
that
is
a
small
complaint
as
this
is
still
a
good
beer
pours
a
dark
red
almost
brown
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
nice
some
roasted
malt
and
caramel
notes
slight
earthy
notes
taste
is
good
slightly
alcoholic
flavor
roasted
bitterness
and
slight
earthy
characteristic
notes
wonderful
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
overall
a
very
good
beer
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
very
very
good
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
scotch
ale
my
hats
off
to
this
beer
by
founders
my
first
scottish
ale
has
a
dark
caramel
appearance
a
strong
scent
of
malts
and
toffee
dirty
bastard
is
both
thick
and
creamy
with
toffee
and
caramel
tastes
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
full
bodied
and
warming
it
stays
with
you
and
you
should
try
it
o
nice
overall
a
touch
sweeter
than
i
like
deep
redbrown
colour
fairly
murky
looking
just
a
whisp
of
white
head
little
to
no
lace
present
smell
is
big
and
malty
sweet
caramel
toffee
some
dark
bread
dark
fruit
raisin
and
plums
light
booze
comes
off
as
well
taste
is
rich
and
malty
dark
druits
come
across
initially
caramel
and
toffee
lightly
sweet
throughout
long
fruity
finish
and
aftertaste
lightly
carbonated
full
body
chewey
and
very
thick
a
delicious
and
complex
offering
from
founders
really
nice
stuff
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
in
my
glass
anytime
overall
incredible
beer
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
founders
is
definitely
on
my
radar
for
dark
beers
o
limed
this
beer
a
lot
i
have
a
slight
cold
atm
so
my
smell
and
taste
might
be
a
tad
off
really
enjoyed
the
earthy
taste
it
leaves
on
back
of
rougemouth
mouth
a
light
body
with
a
close
to
medhigh
carb
level
a
nice
body
to
it
but
could
have
been
a
little
to
carbed
aside
from
the
exceptional
name
this
beer
is
just
above
average
the
malt
profile
is
anemic
for
the
strong
hop
front
flavor
the
balance
swings
heavily
towards
ibus
which
just
ruin
a
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
if
this
beer
was
bitter
more
on
the
front
or
middle
i
would
be
able
to
enjoy
it
more
but
as
a
finishing
flavor
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
malty
caramel
to
balance
out
a
very
unconventional
scotch
ale
to
say
the
least
at
50
ibus
with
a
much
less
pronounced
malt
profile
than
expected
this
beer
surprised
me
it
was
fantastic
beer
but
did
not
seem
at
all
true
to
style
the
hops
are
great
for
someone
like
myself
but
may
not
be
what
others
are
looking
for
when
they
choose
to
purchase
this
beer
founders
dirty
bastard
is
a
cloudy
redbrown
ale
topped
with
a
thin
bubbly
yellowish
film
it
has
a
sweet
whiskey
like
aroma
malty
and
resiny
its
pretty
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
dusty
finish
its
sweet
and
syrupy
it
tastes
malty
and
resiny
just
like
the
aroma
there
may
be
a
hint
of
peat
and
lots
of
toffee
this
is
a
solid
and
well
done
scotch
ale
mouthfeel
is
very
silky
and
full
a
tasty
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
drink
i
guess
i
just
like
my
scotch
ales
bb
this
was
a
good
beer
from
founders
but
like
the
amped
up
version
better
i
still
have
one
of
these
to
sit
on
for
a
year
so
we
will
see
what
happens
to
it
o
this
was
a
very
good
scotch
ale
but
the
scotch
ale
style
may
not
appeal
to
every
beer
drinker
also
this
one
has
just
has
just
a
little
bit
of
harshness
from
its
boozy
flavor
but
hey
its
called
dirty
bastard
so
you
should
expect
a
little
extra
harshness
the
maraschino
cherry
and
the
toffee
sweetness
were
balanced
by
the
booziness
and
the
peaty
and
earthy
hops
bitterness
it
all
worked
together
well
to
create
a
scotch
ale
just
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
and
just
simple
enough
to
be
bold
o
this
is
a
big
beer
with
significant
alcohol
otherwise
id
have
3
or
4
you
generally
cant
go
wrong
at
founders
but
this
was
just
a
great
pint
and
a
nice
finish
on
a
lovely
evening
pours
an
attractive
ruby
color
with
a
small
shortlived
creamy
head
a
brief
whiff
of
booze
gives
way
to
dark
fruit
brown
bread
tobacco
prune
and
toffee
smooth
malty
flavors
chocolate
berries
nuts
earthiness
and
a
wee
bit
of
smoke
not
terribly
sweet
which
is
good
finishing
with
a
moderate
bitterness
a
hint
of
oxidation
is
present
in
the
nose
but
i
cant
make
out
the
date
on
the
bottle
to
tell
how
old
this
is
body
is
a
little
better
than
medium
and
fairly
creamy
i
havent
had
this
in
years
and
though
quite
tasty
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
i
remember
poured
into
a
snifter
the
color
was
a
deep
reddish
brown
and
exhibited
no
head
and
no
lacing
smell
was
roasted
malt
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
upfront
with
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
the
finish
is
grapefruity
and
sort
of
warm
due
to
a
higher
than
usual
abv
i
enjoyed
this
one
we
finally
got
it
in
alabama
a
month
or
so
ago
previously
it
had
been
banned
due
to
the
name
go
figger
smooth
hint
of
choc
and
robust
i
loved
it
i
have
had
other
scottish
ales
and
this
was
as
good
as
any
i
have
had
the
most
recent
dirty
bastard
that
i
have
had
was
at
mellow
mushroom
in
myrtle
beach
a
draft
from
highland
brewery
in
asheville
nc
the
founders
was
much
better
in
taste
and
was
definitely
smootherwhich
i
enjoy
i
am
not
a
major
hops
fan
i
prefer
smoother
taste
and
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
know
when
founders
does
a
beer
they
usually
hit
the
mark
and
this
is
no
exception
i
like
it
ill
come
back
to
review
again
if
i
ever
get
on
a
scotchwee
heavy
kick
i
love
founders
a
true
sipper
o
interesting
note
after
not
having
this
beer
in
some
time
the
first
bottle
of
the
six
pack
comes
across
fairly
heavy
on
the
dark
fruits
however
my
taste
buds
seem
to
adapt
for
subsequent
bottles
in
the
following
days
masking
most
of
the
raison
flavor
and
allowing
the
sweeter
malts
to
shine
and
making
the
beer
more
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
the
nose
was
really
sweet
and
it
tasted
like
a
scotch
ale
o
this
beer
was
my
first
review
ever
back
in
early
june
at
the
time
i
actually
thought
this
stuff
was
strong
and
harsh
now
i
see
it
as
weak
and
slightly
bland
since
i
know
what
im
talking
about
beerwise
it
is
very
drinkable
though
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
the
dark
fruit
tastes
and
smell
are
great
would
have
like
the
body
to
be
a
bit
heavier
im
going
to
come
straight
out
and
admit
this
first
i
am
comparing
this
to
oskar
blues
old
chub
when
i
think
of
scotch
ale
i
think
of
old
chub
when
i
hear
scotch
ale
i
think
of
scotch
the
liquor
this
dirty
bastard
tastes
like
a
soured
malt
with
a
little
hops
to
attempt
to
weakly
offset
it
it
isnt
terrible
but
it
certainly
isnt
great
i
dont
recommend
it
unless
its
all
you
can
get
because
its
at
least
a
high
alcohol
content
so
if
its
cheap
for
you
to
get
grab
it
and
get
wasted
if
not
pass
it
up
for
some
flavor
o
very
sweet
and
malty
hides
the
booze
pretty
well
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
tastefeel
this
is
my
first
scotch
ale
and
i
really
quite
like
it
i
thought
it
would
be
extremely
big
bold
and
heavy
but
it
really
isnt
you
get
some
sweet
malty
flavor
at
first
sip
but
a
warming
on
the
swallow
as
well
as
a
nice
bready
aftertaste
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
a
decent
bit
as
well
which
i
expect
would
be
typical
from
a
beer
of
this
style
yet
again
another
solid
founders
beer
theres
sufficient
complexity
in
the
nut
and
bitter
flavors
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
scotch
ale
not
my
favorite
american
alesmith
or
european
traquir
but
really
solid
nonetheless
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
for
my
tastes
but
not
to
the
cloying
level
of
say
cigar
city
big
sound
which
is
just
way
too
sweet
recommended
for
sure
especially
because
its
available
to
numerous
markets
in
6pack
form
bottle
mahogany
brown
pour
with
neat
tan
head
slightly
alcohol
aroma
predominantly
like
prune
juice
with
butterscotch
notes
rich
peaty
flavor
of
dark
fruits
with
bitter
chocolate
was
not
expecting
that
and
anise
notes
snappy
mouthfeel
lively
on
the
tongue
but
heavy
on
the
lips
warms
the
belly
like
a
good
scotch
ale
should
this
is
a
very
smooth
ale
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
chocolate
in
the
taste
but
it
really
blended
the
other
flavors
beautifully
the
finish
was
much
more
traditional
and
good
a
very
nice
beer
my
first
from
founders
must
have
more
this
brew
poured
with
a
half
a
finger
of
thick
tan
head
it
dissipated
at
a
moderate
pace
and
left
a
hint
of
a
crown
on
top
of
the
body
yet
no
lacing
the
body
was
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
moderate
carbonation
visible
and
a
huge
amount
of
floaties
the
nose
presented
with
smoke
roasted
nuts
rich
caramel
and
even
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
a
very
robust
nose
to
say
the
least
the
taste
had
a
lot
going
on
i
got
nuttiness
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
then
smoke
there
was
also
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
background
as
well
the
booze
made
a
quick
appearance
at
the
end
of
the
sip
the
body
was
bigger
than
im
used
to
seeing
for
the
style
with
lower
than
expected
carbonation
the
finish
was
long
with
nuttiness
and
smoke
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
that
ive
had
all
of
the
flavors
worked
with
each
other
and
it
was
a
great
sipping
beer
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
this
is
the
beer
im
using
as
a
benchmark
for
the
style
oa
good
benchmark
for
those
looking
for
characteristics
of
a
scotch
ale
bigger
than
expected
however
so
maybe
not
the
best
intro
to
an
uninformed
palate
overall
a
very
good
scotch
ale
probably
my
2nd
favorite
after
old
chub
well
balanced
smoke
and
sweet
with
a
fruity
hop
that
all
balances
well
together
bittering
finish
fairly
smoothe
throughout
decent
but
not
up
to
the
standards
of
other
founders
stuff
ive
had
or
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
check
it
but
dont
rush
out
to
get
it
a
pretty
solid
scotch
ale
but
its
definatly
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
its
an
amazing
beer
barrel
aged
crazy
how
much
better
it
makes
it
this
beer
hit
me
like
an
oskar
blues
old
chub
see
review
38
without
the
whiskey
burn
not
bad
overall
lots
of
malt
complexity
not
overly
smoky
or
peaty
good
albeit
higher
in
alcohol
example
of
the
style
the
taste
was
a
delicious
bready
malty
sweetness
with
a
fairly
substantial
alcohol
kick
on
the
back
end
to
be
honest
i
am
going
to
have
to
taste
this
one
again
and
compare
it
to
some
of
my
other
favorite
scotch
ales
but
my
initial
impressions
are
that
this
is
a
great
offering
by
founders
overall
i
like
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
regularly
its
simply
too
sweet
otherwise
quite
nice
although
definitely
a
winter
warmer
overall
interesting
and
quite
big
i
havent
had
many
of
this
style
but
certainly
havent
had
one
like
this
interesting
beer
for
sure
final
thoughts
this
beer
accomplishes
the
main
goal
of
being
a
scotch
ale
and
also
delivers
a
robust
palate
with
a
lot
to
like
about
it
although
i
cant
see
myself
opting
for
a
six
pack
of
this
it
is
a
nice
treat
in
small
doses
goes
down
good
with
some
wilco
playing
on
the
jukebox
o
a
very
delicious
brew
that
represents
the
style
nicely
founders
brewery
does
very
well
to
represent
the
style
and
this
is
another
example
of
how
well
they
can
achieve
that
a
goal
a
definite
must
try
thin
tan
head
did
not
last
too
long
dispersed
into
pretty
much
nothing
looks
flat
color
is
super
dark
red
and
brown
almost
rusty
smell
is
just
ok
nothing
spectacular
hints
of
vanilla
some
caramel
even
smoke
maybe
some
dark
fruit
aromas
and
minimal
hops
taste
is
similar
but
very
smooth
and
light
not
a
ton
of
bite
in
this
overall
this
is
just
ok
i
prefer
other
of
founders
offerings
to
this
not
bad
but
just
does
not
compare
to
others
ive
had
o
this
beer
is
terrific
there
is
so
much
malty
goodness
in
the
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
perfect
example
of
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
i
wish
founders
brewery
was
in
my
backyard
so
i
could
just
drink
all
of
their
beer
all
the
time
they
kill
it
every
single
time
dark
brownmaroon
with
a
tan
head
light
retention
and
lace
nose
has
lots
of
caramel
toffee
and
candy
sweetness
even
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
maybe
nice
complex
malt
character
all
round
taste
is
again
all
malt
caramel
dark
breads
candy
and
syrupy
sweetness
perhaps
even
a
shred
of
peat
dark
dried
fruits
and
some
caramelized
banana
neutral
finish
as
the
sweetness
doesnt
carry
on
for
too
long
which
was
a
definite
plus
alcohol
is
evident
but
is
well
incorporated
into
the
flavour
full
bodied
and
coats
the
mouth
an
excellent
scotch
ale
for
sure
o
the
dirty
bastard
isnt
much
of
a
bastard
its
actually
quite
nice
and
smooth
with
rich
malty
flavors
very
enjoyable
o
one
of
the
most
sessionable
scotch
ales
ive
had
even
though
at
8
5
itll
get
you
into
trouble
quickly
its
delicious
goes
down
easy
and
is
allaround
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
think
ill
have
another
ill
give
this
beer
4s
all
around
for
a
scott
alewee
heavy
this
beer
is
great
i
drank
this
right
after
having
an
ipa
brew
so
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
strong
malt
presence
and
caramel
great
mouthfeel
and
perfect
carbonation
if
you
like
a
beer
thats
sweet
malty
and
heavy
dirty
bastard
is
a
must
try
12oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
brown
with
reddish
tinges
thinner
foamy
tan
head
holds
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
earthy
peat
malty
brown
sugar
caramel
raisin
toffee
booze
tastes
are
earth
peat
brown
sugar
molasses
toffee
faint
chocolate
as
it
warms
a
little
bit
of
spice
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
while
being
medium
bodied
overall
always
a
favorite
of
mine
for
the
style
well
balanced
with
good
complexity
wellbrewed
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
just
find
it
a
bit
too
sweet
taste
starts
out
with
the
caramel
roasted
malt
front
a
nice
sweetness
of
dark
fruit
very
sticky
with
a
slightly
syrup
like
texture
somehow
it
avoids
being
overly
sweet
or
cloying
soft
yet
ample
amount
of
carbonation
strength
is
very
well
hidden
nice
overall
a
nice
beer
and
in
the
end
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
this
is
the
best
way
to
explain
what
i
think
its
shortcoming
is
it
has
all
the
darkness
that
i
expect
from
beers
of
its
style
but
none
of
the
depth
its
an
above50thpercentile
scotch
ale
but
still
meh
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
some
big
sweet
caramel
peat
butterscotch
strong
up
front
butterscotch
and
booze
flavor
but
finishes
nicely
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
and
a
bit
of
lingering
peat
these
are
generally
sippers
for
me
though
this
one
goes
down
pretty
easily
for
the
abv
a
winner
from
founders
and
very
popular
for
a
reason
overall
i
love
scotch
ales
this
is
a
pretty
decent
american
offering
of
this
style
not
exactly
as
smokey
and
big
as
a
true
scotch
ale
but
this
one
is
smooth
and
at
8
5
surely
to
please
slainte
dark
brown
pour
small
tan
head
little
lacing
light
vanilla
and
scotch
smell
though
nothing
too
distinct
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
bourbon
vanilla
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
other
flavors
that
blend
very
well
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
yet
lightly
carbonated
very
likeable
beer
would
get
again
this
beer
was
a
great
surprise
not
a
usual
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
delivered
the
malt
profile
was
so
much
more
complex
than
a
usual
scotch
ale
wonderful
sweetness
was
met
with
a
touch
of
smoke
and
a
sensational
mouthfeel
a
real
treat
to
drink
all
the
way
ill
definitely
get
another
beautiful
deep
maple
exceptionally
clear
with
radiant
copper
hues
in
the
light
a
very
nicely
lacing
beige
head
keeps
its
integrity
the
entire
time
incredibly
clean
nose
with
notes
of
caramel
toffee
carob
brandy
and
dates
flavor
is
unsurpassed
in
balance
intensity
complexity
and
the
long
lasting
finish
all
the
flavors
of
malts
dark
fruits
treacle
and
a
hint
of
spice
from
the
alcohol
melds
perfectly
on
my
palate
touch
of
roast
in
the
finish
too
an
unexpected
surprise
prickly
carbonation
with
this
heavy
bodied
hitter
i
would
prefer
slightly
less
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
the
dirty
bastard
with
whom
to
drink
cheers
o
very
nice
malty
brew
with
complex
sweetness
and
minimal
bitterness
very
enjoyable
overall
another
solid
brew
from
founders
full
of
flavor
yet
never
harsh
can
even
be
enjoyed
for
breakfast
which
this
one
was
i
will
now
go
on
record
by
saying
if
bastards
in
the
name
i
am
going
to
enjoy
whatever
is
in
the
bottle
founders
dirty
bastard
is
an
outstanding
ale
that
has
earned
a
place
in
my
inventory
for
the
foreseeable
future
enjoyed
straight
from
the
bottle
chilled
to
approximately
42
degrees
the
taste
is
extremely
satisfying
not
as
harsh
as
the
8
5
abv
would
imply
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
definite
twinge
to
it
reminiscent
of
barley
wine
style
ale
being
that
this
is
the
first
scotch
style
ale
ive
sampled
if
this
represents
the
genre
i
do
not
have
anything
to
compare
it
too
but
if
it
does
it
now
ranks
among
my
favorites
o
looks
better
than
it
tastes
flavors
and
smells
not
nearly
as
lively
and
rich
as
i
was
hoping
for
certainly
not
bad
but
there
are
much
better
scotch
ales
out
there
o
i
love
this
beer
perfect
for
one
of
the
last
chilly
rainy
days
before
summer
this
beer
will
warm
you
up
but
so
far
it
has
been
of
my
least
favorite
scotch
ales
founders
does
a
great
job
with
every
beer
and
this
beer
wasnt
bad
but
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
below
average
for
the
style
i
would
probably
still
drink
it
again
and
maybe
even
buy
it
again
its
a
sipper
certainly
not
going
to
drink
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
given
night
i
gave
it
lower
scores
due
to
the
fact
that
i
have
found
several
other
scotch
ales
i
enjoyed
as
much
or
more
for
a
lower
price
i
havent
had
too
many
scotch
ales
but
this
is
by
far
the
top
of
my
list
c
o
liking
this
beer
will
buy
again
but
not
so
much
in
the
summer
o
a
classic
scotch
ale
not
overwhelmingly
caramelly
or
sweet
nicely
smoked
and
dried
great
mouthfeel
o
this
beer
has
all
the
great
elements
of
a
scotch
style
ale
with
the
perfect
amount
of
smoke
and
maltiness
without
being
too
sweet
a
nice
sipper
at
8
5
too
overall
another
staple
in
the
founders
lineup
happy
i
can
finally
get
it
in
ny
fairly
versatile
for
a
strong

great
flavor
and

fantastic
o

the
king
of
malts

the
taste
of
this
beer
was
all
over

each
flavor
beautifully
balanced
with
the
others
i
will
definitely
be
having
again
pours

the
maltheads
caramel
and
brown
sugar
coated
cherries
and
raisins
mixed
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
a
touch
of
ethanol
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
just
enough
smoke
and
burnt
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
lots
of
caramel

dark

overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
one
works
well
for
me
because
it
seems
like
more
of
a
barley
wine
the
hops
add
a
nice
zip
to
the
aftertaste
and
the
booze
is
incredibly
well
hidden
id
like
to
have
a

of
this
stuff
tucked
away
somewhere
o
a

and
very

on
o
a
great
wee
heavy
founders
can
almost
do
no
wrong
in
my
book
the
subtle
nuances
of
this
beer
the
straightforward
nose
and
the
mouthfeel
just
prove
how
well
craft
beer
can
be
done
o
this
brew
is
everything
i
expected
from
founders
which
is
already
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
whose
product
is
sadly
hard
to
come
by
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
in
the
future
and
wishing
it
were
more
readily
available
o
it
was
definitely
a
solid
scottish
ale
and
was
glad
to
try
another
great
brew
from
founders
d
not
a
chugger
but
so
vibrant
for
a
wee
heavy
if
you
like
heavy
scotch
ales
check
this
one
out
a
lot
of
character
here
that
sets
it
apart
from
others
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
mad
elf
tulip
glass
this
beer
gave
off
an
instant
carmelsweet
vibe
in
aroma
im
not
in
love
with
wee
heavys
of
the
world
but
i
respect
this
one
first
sip
is
the
like
the
first
bite
of
a
rich
dessert
you
love
it
at
first
realize
only
the
heavyweights
can
really
go
for
multiple
rounds
i
began
to
feel
a
sweetness
driven
nausea
at
the
end
this
brew
which
through
me
for
a
loop
because
i
enjoyed
the
taste
note
weizen
glass
was
the
only
glassware
available
pours
a
hazy
rich
copper
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
no
visible
carbonation
to
speak
of
dirty
bastard
smells
of
bread
toffee
spice
floral
hops
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
i
wish
i
had
snifter
and
perhaps
a
fine
cigar
it
is
malty
and
finishes
a
bit
sweet
with
a
hint
of
smoke
this
dirty
bastard
packs
a
wallop
this
is
my
first
foray
with
a
scotch
ale
and
i
find
it
quite
enjoyable
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
tap
of
this
one
and
i
still
get
to
try
an
aged
bottle
thanks
to
papat444
sending
me
a
mini
vertical
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
a
founders
brew
and
this
one
pleases
too
i
advise
avoiding
this
one
too
weird
to
be
enjoyable
o
it
represents
its
style
nicely
i
cant
go
too
crazy
for
it
though
o
a
beer
so
rich
and
complex
you
might
mistake
it
for
stew
with
an
old
boot
thrown
in
i
think
i
had
a
hangover
halfway
through
it
pours
a
dark
chestnut
with
good
lacing
the
nose
is
interesting
on
this
one
with
some
alcohol
wood
nutty
caramel
vanilla
etc
obviously
malty
the
taste
evens
out
the
sweetness
with
a
comforting
bitterness
and
a
smooth
feel
due
to
low
carbonation
which
i
tend
to
love
as
it
warms
some
dried
dark
fruit
flavors
open
up
very
easy
to
drink
good
offering
from
founders
o
great
looks
and
tastes
but
not
so
much
on
the
smell
and
feel
i
somewhat
enjoyed
the
bottle
but
wont
be
looking
for
more
in
the
future
great
coffee
notes
on
this
extremely
flaverfull
full
bodied
ale
lots
of
layers
of
malt
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
it
seems
as
if
there
is
another
flavor
picked
up
with
your
first
five
to
ten
sips
is
that
chocolate
a
little
caramel
some
coffee
delicious
go
beer
a
decent
brew
and
i
can
understand
why
a
lot
of
people
would
like
it
perhaps
its
silly
to
say
that
i
expected
a
little
more
refinement
from
a
beer
called
dirty
bastard
but
i
just
went
there
yep
nice
job
founders
love
it
and
am
coming
to
buy
more
of
you
soon
the
finish
is
nicely
bitter
with
smoky
highlights
along
with
more
citrus
hoppiness
than
i
typically
associate
with
the
style
as
thats
my
own
personal
preference
i
rate
this
more
highly
than
many
regardless
this
beer
is
still
capable
of
knocking
you
on
your
arse
do
try
to
enjoy
it
o
an
excellent
scotch
ale
incredibly
easy
to
drink
nice
complex
malt
profile
with
a
surprising
amount
of
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
another
great
offering
from
founders
o
this
is
a
fairly
average
beer
the
taste
lacks
luster
however
the
other
components
of
the
beer
are
give
it
some
redeemable
traits
o
this
beer
is
fine
i
guess
but
certainly
worst
ive
had
from
founders
no
hard
feelings
guys
everything
else
you
do
is
great
o
ive
never
liked
wee
heavys
but
this
is
magical
o
dirty
bastard
is
a
great
example
of
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
nothing
too
complex
but
very
enjoyable
o
a
excellent
world
class
beer
love
it
havent
had
too
many
scotch
ales
but
i
will
be
trying
some
more
because
founders
did
such
a
good
job
pours
a
deep
burnt
orangeamber
with
a
finger
of
shortlived
offwhitetannish
head
sporadic
beading
the
nose
offers
waves
of
toffee
toasted
bread
consistent
and
somewhat
pungent
the
beer
has
already
taken
a
distinct
direction
the
taste
highlights
much
of
the
aroma
plus
some
peat
and
smoky
wood
drinkability
is
pretty
low
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
beer
im
not
an
avid
scotch
ale
drinker
but
from
what
little
i
know
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
beer
to
give
somebody
who
is
curious
about
what
a
benchmark
wee
heavy
tastes
like
it
may
not
be
the
very
top
best
in
the
style
but
it
is
close
enough
and
in
enough
available
supply
locally
to
become
my
new
90
gold
standard
of
measurement
for
wee
heavies
o
a
nice
dirty
amber
thats
a
little
on
the
strong
side
overall
another
world
class
beer
from
founders
before
this
beer
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
a
scotch
ale
was
let
alone
if
i
liked
it
now
its
safe
to
say
ill
be
trying
a
few
more
revisited
in
sept
2012
aroma
is
rather
delicate
and
flavor
has
only
a
light
and
pleasant
earthypeat
aspect
although
still
too
much
of
a
hint
of
liqueur
different
batch
improvement
by
aging
not
sure
why
but
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
my
original
rating
indicated
and
tweaked
my
overall
rating
up
and
again
in
sept
2014
overall
an
amazing
beer
and
the
thing
that
really
stood
out
to
me
is
that
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavors
retained
their
synergy
which
left
me
astounded
another
great
beer
from
founders
o
dirty
bastard
is
a
great
offering
from
fouders
and
had
me
from
the
first
bottle
just
a
solid
scotch
ale
with
the
world
class
style
of
founders
i
couldnt
find
any
real
faults
with
this
dirty
bastard
of
an
ale
and
ill
buy
again
in
the
very
near
future
a
real
treat
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
not
as
upfront
in
the
taste
and
smell
as
you
sometimes
get
also
this
beer
is
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
other
examples
of
the
style
definitely
more
of
a
sipping
beer
overall
much
more
complex
than
i
expected
good
o
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
very
good
looking
beer
great
colors
the
smells
and
flavors
are
pretty
close
to
each
other
but
nothing
really
explodes
the
feel
of
it
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
mean
who
wants
to
drink
syrup
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
a
slow
sipper
for
me
overall
this
scotch
ale
is
missing
the
peat
smoked
maltiness
and
overall
depth
of
character
an
ale
of
this
style
using
7
different
types
of
malt
the
nose
is
severely
lacking
and
the
flavour
profile
is
average
at
best
that
doesnt
make
this
a
bad
beer
its
definitley
sturdy
and
well
built
probably
will
not
revisit
m
fairly
flat
with
little
carbonation
it
must
just
be
me
but
based
on
the
ba
founders
hype
this
seems
to
be
another
of
thiers
that
i
just
dont
see
where
the
hype
is
coming
from
ive
had
much
better
scotch
ales
than
this
o
i
cant
drink
a
lot
of
this
style
of
beer
but
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
takes
on
the
style
that
ive
had
certainly
something
everyone
should
at
least
try
o
solid
beer
from
founder
i
havent
had
many
wee
heavies
so
not
a
lot
to
compare
too
but
solid
nonetheless
reviewed
from
notes
originally
had
on
tap
reviewed
here
from
bottle
notes
pours
a
rich
dark
amber
into
dimpled
mug
with
little
head
presence
what
so
ever
smells
of
malt
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
like
plum
and
raisin
a
rich
hearty
mouthfeel
of
maltiness
and
alcohol
but
with
the
slight
sweetness
of
dark
fruits
a
very
good
and
balanced
scotch
ale
without
being
too
sweet
or
rich
with
the
8
5
abv
very
much
in
the
mix
but
not
overly
so
providing
a
nice
warming
effect
i
enjoyed
this
more
from
the
bottle
than
the
1st
time
which
was
on
tap
the
aroma
has
a
nice
scotch
and
malt
smell
while
the
taste
is
much
the
same
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
taste
without
it
being
overwhelming
it
has
a
creamy
texture
there
is
a
distinct
taste
of
hops
in
the
background
and
it
finishes
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
very
pleased
with
this
there
is
a
musty
earthiness
to
this
beer
that
i
find
quite
intriguing
it
adds
a
dimension
that
transcends
a
maltheavy
bitter
scotch
ale
its
like
eating
a
thick
slice
of
rye
bread
with
raisins
in
a
cave
im
not
sure
if
that
sounds
appetizing
but
it
was
truly
delicious
o
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
tried
to
date
also
a
fan
of
the
backwoods
bastard
when
i
can
find
it
overall
i
love
these
beers
it
was
great
to
have
both
at
once
the
base
beer
is
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
the
barrel
aged
big
brother
is
sweet
smokey
greatness
that
any
fan
of
big
beers
scotch
bourbon
life
itself
will
love
seek
these
out
enjoy
them
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
color
that
is
clear
but
difficult
to
see
through
has
a
nice
one
finger
of
a
smooth
creamy
light
brown
head
there
isnt
much
on
the
nose
but
it
very
malty
similar
to
a
red
ale
also
has
a
lot
of
caramelized
dark
fruit
flavors
taste
is
smooth
and
not
as
heavy
as
it
looks
a
complex
malt
profile
consists
of
dark
fruits
and
caramel
and
various
spices
this
beer
drinks
rather
well
for
8
5
this
is
a
good
scottish
ale
that
i
have
had
before
and
will
likely
have
again
it
wont
disappoint
o
surely
im
no
expert
on
what
a
wee
heavy
should
taste
like
but
for
what
its
worth
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
higher
alcohol
beers
ive
ever
had
its
amazing
how
the
complexity
doesnt
hinder
its
drinkability
either
big
thumbs
up
pours
an
alluring
deep
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
a
redness
to
it
bone
white
head
recedes
to
a
thin
sliver
atop
the
beer
but
it
does
adhere
to
the
glass
nicely
barely
translucent
some
sediment
is
visible
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
yeast
the
aroma
is
very
decadent
with
a
maltiness
dominating
amongst
raisins
pineapple
and
maple
candy
taste
wow
very
full
bodied
yet
the
alcohol
content
is
undetectable
it
begins
with
a
splash
of
sweetness
then
hops
rush
in
with
a
very
nice
bitter
shot
to
the
palate
immediately
following
i
really
like
the
way
it
coats
the
mouth
fully
and
gives
me
that
great
warming
sensation
on
the
way
down
truly
a
great
beer
i
have
to
start
seeking
out
more
scotch
ales
like
this
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
true
beer
lover
i
gave
it
to
my
wife
not
a
beer
lover
and
she
thought
it
was
horrific
but
she
also
thinks
bud
light
lime
is
good
this
brew
is
certainly
worth
your
time
nice

this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
alethis
is
not
my
style
usually
but
i
could
see
getting
into
it
a
bit
more
with
brews
like
this
its
like
a
nice
richer
and
fuller
american
amber
with
very
wellbalanced
hops
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
and
id
love
to
try
some
backwoods
bastard
to
see
what
the
barrel
aging
brings
to
the
malty
core
of
this
beer
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
provides
a
simple
pleasant
base
for
the
much
stronger
backwoods
bastard
overall
i
love
it
this
is
a
heavenly
wee
heavy
that
is
practically
perfect
in
every
way
ill
take
it
over
any
founders
beer
that
i
have
had
to
date
especially
over
the
backwoods
bastard
i
feel
saddened
that
some
of
this
ambrosia
should
have
been
sullied
in
such
a
way
o
overall
a
great
scotch
ale
balanced
and
massively
flavorful
easy
to
drink
compared
to
many
of
its
competition
and
the
warming
effect
is
great
this
is
a
great
beer
for
late
autumn
and
through
winter
m
medium
bodied
with
perfect
touch
of
carbonation
extremely
smooth
and
pleasant
o
pretty
complex
and
true
to
the
style
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
bomb
but
thankfully
thats
far
from
the
truth
pretty
good
all
around
in
my
opinion
would
definitely
buy
again
o
i
can
definitely
tell
the
greatness
of
backwoods
is
right
here
this
is
a
few
notches
below
that
beer
but
still
pretty
tasty
o
nice
scotch
ale
i
will
drink
again
this
is
my
goto
beer
for
every
iwanttogetenjoyablydrunkbutidontwanttospend20ona4pack
beer
day
so
props
for
making
a
great
beer
founders
drinkability
good
for
an
8
3abv
brew
very
warming
and
relaxing
o
one
of
my
fav
scotch
ales
an
awesome
overall
brew
thats
perfect
for
making
a
little
inner
warmth
on
a
cold
night
perfect
to
sip
and
enjoy
not
really
my
style
but
it
was
quite
enjoyable
not
as
good
as
backwoods
but
this
is
the
base
right
great
beer
filling
and
heady
in
the
best
way
get
one
o
very
easy
drinking
and
a
solid
scotch
ale
the
variety
of
malts
used
really
give
this
beer
different
layers
of
flavor
single
finger
head
on
a
brown
and
light
amber
cloudy
body
lots
of
lacing
not
much
head
retention
aroma
is
a
mix
of
caramel
cocoa
dark
fruit
and
booze
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
caramel
and
cocoa
initially
and
a
nice
musty
dark
fruit
finish
medium
to
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
very
flavorful
scotch
ale
one
of
my
least
favorite
genres
but
this
one
is
actually
pretty
good
overall
why
drink
this
when
you
could
drink
backwoods
bastard
in
fact
why
bother
brewing
this
unless
you
are
going
to
barrel
age
it
served
to
me
in
a
16
oz
glass
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
head
of
about
an
inch
retains
a
small
amount
of
foam
with
a
little
lacing
smells
strongly
of
dark
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
tastes
very
much
like
dark
malt
with
chocolate
and
maybe
a
little
nip
of
hops
but
its
very
subtle
im
unfamiliar
with
this
style
so
its
hard
to
say
what
it
should
taste
like
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
great
good
carbonation
and
full
bodied
chestnut
brown
with
a
off
white
head
smells
of
sweet
caramel
peat
and
a
little
hoppiness
tastes
of
caramel
toffee
and
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
hoppygrassywoodsy
flavor
a
nice
dose
of
smoky
peatiness
is
very
prevalent
as
well
along
with
a
nice
boozey
kick
slightly
viscous
with
a
dry
finish
a
very
nice
rich
beer
founders
never
dissapoints
not
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
but
this
is
a
good
take
on
it
id
love
to
try
backwoods
bastard
the
bottle
had
a
faded
stamp
but
it
looked
a
bit
like
no
aulfe0503111545
sampled
on
january
2
2012
it
pours
a
handsome
looking
dark
amber
with
a
shortlived
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
and
then
nothing
the
aroma
is
like
a
mild
barleywine
with
its
sweet
malty
character
some
yeast
and
bitter
hops
the
body
is
of
a
heavy
quality
but
easily
drinkable
nice
strong
barley
grain
malty
sweetness
with
a
moderately
bitter
hoppy
ending
o
good
beer
strangely
lacking
in
the
smell
department
but
in
all
other
facets
it
is
solid
goes
down
fast
for
an
8
5er
o
tasty
drinkable
really
only
two
dimensional
with
smokey
malts
and
scotch
flavors
a
very
good
2
dimensions
but
i
would
have
like
for
this
brew
to
be
a
bit
heavier
on
the
palet
very
good
regardless
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
wee
heavies
ive
had
in
a
while
generally
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
this
style
but
i
believe
it
fits
well
with
my
current
look
and
feel
of
things
poured
a
cloudy
dark
brownbrick
red
with
a
sudsy
tan
halfinch
head
that
quickly
breaks
up
leaving
scattered
bubbles
the
smell
is
rich
dark
fruits
and
boozy
this
is
really
good
a
rich
but
clean
malty
blend
there
is
caramel
and
toffee
up
front
with
nutty
and
smokey
flavors
following
the
dark
fruit
and
yeast
play
their
part
as
well
a
clean
aftertaste
follows
this
brew
balances
out
nicely
masking
the
alcohol
well
moderately
carbonated
and
a
creamy
full
feel
to
this
wee
heavy
im
not
picking
up
on
alcohol
taste
like
i
did
on
the
aroma
a
great
wintertime
brew
and
quality
all
around
from
founders
overall
a
nice
beer
on
a
winter
night
and
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
as
usual
founders
delivers
i
dont
enjoy
it
as
much
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
but
it
certainly
holds
its
own
and
would
be
perfect
after
a
long
day
of
skiing
this
is
another
fine
brew
from
founders
perfect
for
this
christmas
eve
cheers
ya
all
overall
truly
a
great
beer
my
new
baseline
for
this
style
pours
a
beautiful
deep
red
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
smell
is
reminds
me
of
a
bit
of
burnt
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
taste
is
very
close
to
the
smell
with
a
very
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
this
beer
is
viscous
and
coats
the
tongue
nicely
scottish
type
ales
are
not
generally
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
one
is
just
fine
on
this
overcast
cool
christmas
eve
pours
an
chocolate
brown
thick
body
not
much
head
residual
bubbles
around
the
sides
bit
of
a
roasted
smell
with
dark
fruit
and
faint
hops
taste
is
very
well
balanced
black
cherry
other
dried
fruits
sweet
cream
and
hops
to
even
it
out
creamy
drinkable
smooth
slides
down
easily
and
alcohol
content
unnoticed
overall
a
very
nice
beer
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
smooth
drinking
no
alcohol
heat
with
a
malty
finish
overall
very
nicely
done
by
founders
as
expected
founders
has
another
winner
here
not
as
interesting
of
a
brew
as
its
mr
hyde
backwoods
bastard
but
still
solid
and
readily
available
i
imagine
this
one
is
nice
on
a
cool
crisp
fall
night
poured
12
oz
bottle
in
a
snifter
very
cloudy
dark
iced
tea
color
with
very
light
head
this
beer
really
needs
to
be
served
warm
poured
it
cold
and
it
had
no
aroma
and
very
harsh
flavor
as
i
let
it
warm
up
the
flavors
and
body
began
to
show
up
along
with
some
aroma
as
expected
a
malty
aroma
very
sugary
caramel
and
some
bread
notes
heavy
sweet
taste
with
slight
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
bit
thin
creamy
texture
flat
carbonation
and
long
finish
im
not
sure
i
really
like
this
style
of
beer
based
on
this
selection
sitting
at
the
whole
foods
in
sauganash
served
in
a
pint
glass
with
an
inch
and
a
half
of
creamy
cafe
latte
colored
head
smells
of
butter
and
malt
pleasant
not
much
hops
tastes
of
butter
again
then
the
hops
bitterness
not
a
lot
of
citrus
feels
silky
on
the
tongue
big
in
the
mouth
overall
i
like
this
beer
for
me
it
misses
the
mark
as
an
enjoyable
drinker
but
as
far
as
style
goes
its
probably
an
a
brew
ill
go
with
the
latter
and
say
that
it
is
pretty
spot
on
as
far
as
style
description
goes
overall
quite
good
definitely
a
solid
scotch
ale
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
it
is
lived
up
for
or
costs
would
not
buy
on
any
regularity
and
would
choose
other
founders
beers
over
this
an
interesting
and
decent
beer
though
im
not
sure
that
it
is
even
remotely
with
the
style
this
is
certainly
a
very
interesting
take
on
it
and
it
isnt
bad
by
any
means
overall
this
beer
more
closely
resembles
an
amberwest
coast
red
if
i
were
left
to
guess
too
much
bitterness
for
a
beer
brewed
in
the
notoriously
hopstingy
scottish
style
my
serving
was
too
cold
which
may
make
for
an
unfair
assessment
i
understand
the
relationship
between
coldness
and
the
maintenance
of
many
tap
handles
bitterness
may
be
accentuated
under
these
circumstances
however
good
beer
nonetheless
id
like
to
try
this
from
a
bottle
and
will
next
chance
i
get
o
dirty
bastard
is
a
delicious
wee
heavy
consistent
flavors
really
showcase
and
make
this
enjoyable
i
need
founders
to
come
to
cuse
dangerous
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
enjoyable
year
round
but
outstanding
as
a
winter
brew
i
am
an
irreverent
beer
snob
taste
is
similar
to
smell
malty
sweet
raison
with
a
bit
of
slight
hops
the
hops
actually
separate
this
from
most
scotch
ales
ive
had
and
for
the
better
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
is
pretty
good
high
abv
and
you
can
taste
it
great
example
of
scotch
ale
red
sweet
great
mouthfeel
nice
thick
head
head
and
shoulders
above
the
vast
majority
of
beers
in
this
style
strong
and
sweet
so
tread
lightly
or
your
head
will
feel
like
someone
whacked
you
with
a
bagpipe
in
the
morning
edit
this
give
this
style
a
good
name
but
unfortunately
have
had
few
others
that
stood
out
in
any
way
this
is
where
its
at
d
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
like
every
other
founders
ive
had
its
far
from
the
best
of
the
style
and
pretty
one
dimensional
so
i
cant
find
it
to
be
worth
going
back
to
overall
its
a
beer
that
smells
better
than
it
tastes
i
was
expecting
more
flavor
out
of
this
but
theres
nothing
really
offensively
wrong
with
it
i
love
my
scotch
ales
but
i
was
really
expecting
more
out
of
this
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brownish
red
color
the
head
is
thin
and
it
creamy
looking
it
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
sweet
caramel
aromas
along
with
some
earthy
aromas
too
the
taste
is
very
nice
on
this
one
the
sweetness
was
really
nice
and
finished
with
a
light
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
very
smooth
with
a
really
nice
carbonation
to
it
overall
its
a
damn
good
beer
founders
strikes
again
with
yet
another
really
tasty
beverage
mouthfeeldrinkability
full
bodied
and
has
a
lasting
impression
on
the
tongue
so
not
one
to
chug
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
by
the
various
flavors
in
the
beer
but
there
is
a
lot
to
try
and
concentrate
on
its
a
solid
scotch
ale
pours
semithick
with
a
quick
fading
head
nice
dark
brown
color
rich
caramel
flavor
with
a
sweet
malt
overtone
definitely
above
average
a
little
thin
on
the
body
but
the
abv
isnt
noticeable
finishes
smooth
and
just
a
hint
of
dryness
overall
its
a
very
good
scotch
ale
and
worth
the
price
o
good
example
of
the
strong
scotch
ale
style
like
previously
mentioned
this
beer
has
a
multidimensional
malt
profile
that
once
you
think
you
figured
out
on
the
next
sip
you
recieve
a
whole
different
cascade
of
tastes
too
numerous
to
mention
and
too
good
to
pass
up
i
found
this
beer
nice
and
thick
full
bodied
with
carbonation
that
was
just
enough
to
ease
it
over
your
tongue
although
i
caught
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
it
was
not
apparent
anywhere
else
in
the
beer
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
scotch
alewee
heavy
that
i
have
ever
had
highly
recommended
this
scotch
ale
is
served
in
a
12
oz
bottle
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
thick
amber
brown
color
produces
a
small
tan
head
average
retention
and
leaves
only
a
small
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
malt
and
molasses
medium
bodied
beer
it
starts
off
with
a
sweet
bread
flavor
moves
to
toasted
malt
then
finally
to
spicy
bitter
rye
and
then
a
dry
finish
it
warms
as
it
goes
down
excellent
brew
to
enjoy
around
a
bonfire
on
cold
night
there
is
an
extended
aftertaste
that
is
left
behind
partly
warm
and
partly
sour
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
excellent
example
of
a
scotch
ale
there
are
not
a
lot
of
brewers
that
try
to
brew
this
style
so
hats
off
to
founders
for
another
awesome
beer
o
displays
the
maltiness
of
the
style
well
without
being
overpowering
on
either
sweetness
or
alcohol
hints
of
a
bitter
hop
balance
balance
well
the
malt
flavors
are
complex
in
this
one
interesting
style
that
i
have
not
experienced
much
of
d
aside
from
the
aspirin
taste
this
is
great
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
ive
had
taste
is
malty
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
earthiness
not
quite
the
smoky
peat
found
in
the
sam
adams
wee
heavy
but
some
green
earthiness
o
pretty
good
a
fine
example
of
a
scotch
ale
at
the
very
least
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
viscosity
from
the
body
but
it
does
have
a
pretty
respectable
syrupy
consistency
the
carbonation
is
thin
yet
has
sharpness
a
finish
this
dry
is
going
to
lead
to
some
swift
consumption
as
well
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
considering
6
packs
of
these
go
for
less
than
10
it
will
be
a
common
sight
in
my
fridge
o
great
regular
beer
definitely
to
buy
again
a
range
this
was
an
unexpected
addition
from
a
trade
gone
awesome
from
tburk
and
im
super
thrilled
to
try
it
there
isnt
much
wrong
with
the
beer
not
that
im
an
expert
on
scotch
ales
but
id
definitely
get
this
beer
again
o
a
good
wee
heavy
but
the
yeasty
esters
in
the
taste
are
a
bit
out
of
balance
for
me
i
prefer
the
backwoods
bastard
to
this
pours
very
dark
umber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
ordinary
pint
glass
smell
is
light
but
of
caramel
malts
raisins
and
alcohol
tastes
of
caramel
malts
raisins
a
little
smokey
and
some
evident
barley
alcohol
taste
is
there
in
the
end
and
exists
through
the
after
taste
along
with
some
raisins
and
barley
a
bit
drying
and
an
overall
decent
beer
complex
and
powerful
a
deep
beer
might
rate
it
even
higher
if
i
were
a
bigger
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
clearly
an
extremely
well
made
and
highly
nuanced
brew
a
potent
blend
of
malt
goodness
hot
booziness
and
lasting
bitterness
o
first
time
having
a
scotch
ale
pretty
satisfied
and
feel
it
is
a
great
example
personally
too
malt
forward
though
im
sure
that
is
indicative
of
the
style
o
very
good
malty
brew
that
i
would
highly
recommend
overall
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
this
was
my
first
founders
beer
and
its
a
solid
one
for
sure
id
like
to
try
more
from
them
especially
their
stouts
because
theyve
proven
that
they
can
do
a
good
job
balancing
malt
sweetness
and
other
flavors
o
the
20
months
this
beer
has
been
aging
has
definitely
improved
it
this
is
substantially
better
than
when
it
was
on
tap
a
few
weeks
ago
at
a
local
bar
a
fine
example
of
a
wee
heavy
and
completely
worthy
of
the
above
average
rating
im
giving
it
far
from
my
favorite
from
founders
but
a
solid
brew
d
although
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
heavy
side
in
terms
of
body
and
flavor
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
through
whatsoever
this
is
a
great
brew
for
the
colder
seasons
one
of
my
first
scotch
ales
and
the
first
i
have
reviewed
cant
wait
to
try
its
oak
ages
counterpart
o
founders
dirty
bastard
has
one
thing
completely
right
taste
while
the
appearance
and
smell
are
somewhat
lacking
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
are
far
and
above
others
that
may
strive
harder
just
to
have
a
better
appearance
and
smell
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
have
dirty
bastard
on
tap
at
a
pubbar
near
you
i
highly
recommend
giving
it
a
try
4
0
overall
decent
example
of
the
style
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
my
only
problem
was
that
the
finish
could
be
a
bit
more
refinedbalanced
and
less
boozy
appearance
is
dark
and
clear
smell
is
hoppy
and
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
thick
and
heavy
the
taste
is
better
up
front
and
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
bitter
start
with
a
slight
sweet
finish
overall
this
is
a
strong
beer
in
flavor
and
in
abv
this
beer
will
go
well
with
anything
hot
o
a
great
tasting
beer
overall
if
i
want
some
great
malt
character
id
come
back
to
this
one
in
a
heartbeat
founders
did
an
excellent
job
on
this
one
o
this
is
the
beer
i
want
on
cold
wet
fall
day
in
michigan
gets
my
malt
fix
for
me
every
time
o
solid
brew
pours
a
really
nice
amber
with
minimal
head
that
recedes
quickly
smell
is
heavily
malty
really
caramel
with
significant
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
booze
some
sweet
dark
fruits
hide
on
the
nose
behind
the
malt
and
booze
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
taste
is
very
malt
forward
with
a
touch
of
roastiness
balanced
with
just
enough
bitterness
plenty
of
sweet
dark
fruits
as
the
flavor
sticks
around
in
your
mouth
carbonation
is
pretty
low
which
works
for
this
style
it
drinks
smooth
with
getting
prickly
or
cloying
overall
a
really
nice
brew
definitely
worth
checking
it
out
but
it
wont
blow
your
mind
in
any
particular
way
odnot
one
of
my
favorite
founders
brews
but
their
company
is
so
good
that
this
one
still
is
above
average
one
of
the
better
wee
heavys
i
have
had
good
not
great
alcohol
masked
well
and
while
it
is
sweet
its
not
too
sweet
like
many
others
in
the
style
overall
a
nice
wee
heavy
although
i
prefer
the
innis
gunn
to
this
brew
for
the
style
do
perhaps
the
easiest
to
attain
wee
heavy
around
at
least
in
the
midwest
this
is
many
craft
newbies
first
of
the
style
thankfully
it
is
a
solid
representation
from
founders
overall
incredibly
finished
beer
i
loved
it
beginning
to
end
you
will
get
almost
everything
with
this
beer
lacking
maybe
appearance
which
isnt
much
since
its
going
to
end
up
in
your
stomach
best
of
all
you
can
get
it
year
round
this
beer
is
definitely
top
of
my
a
list
and
should
be
on
top
of
yours
salud
poured
into
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
brownish
red
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
a
little
lacing
smell
is
of
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
peat
and
some
hops
taste
is
that
very
easy
drinking
and
the
balance
is
wonderful
really
impressed
this
is
not
a
style
that
i
seek
out
but
founders
never
lets
me
down
nice
carbonation
and
a
perfect
mouthfeel
really
like
this
beer
didnt
want
it
to
end
overall
some
nice
aspects
but
im
not
terribly
impressed
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
style
that
have
more
complexity
to
the
malt
character
overall
scotch
ale
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
the
bitterness
might
scare
away
a
novice
drinker
but
any
fans
of
the
style
and
especially
any
lovers
of
fine
scotch
will
thoroughly
enjoy
this
effort
from
founders
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
possibly
one
of
my
favorites
from
founders
definitely
recommend
very
much
a
heavy
bodied
ale
full
of
characters
i
might
have
expected
more
from
stouts
but
very
nice
another
founders
success
o
a
decent
beer
i
remember
it
tasting
a
little
better
than
this
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
as
complex
and
interesting
as
i
remember
o
great
scottish
ale
strong
taste
great
taste
for
the
style
and
can
knock
you
on
your
ass
if
you
havent
had
anything
to
eat
lol
overall
this
has
all
of
the
characteristics
you
look
for
in
a
scotch
ale
the
peat
smoke
flavor
the
rich
malt
and
fairly
high
alcohol
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
herbal
hop
bitterness
or
maybe
just
a
little
more
malt
sweetness
to
balance
it
but
i
think
this
is
very
true
to
the
style
quite
nice
and
a
good
choice
for
sipping
on
a
fall
evening
the
finish
is
a
little
weird
but
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
glad
i
had
it
but
there
are
better
options
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
ale
good
to
sip
on
throughout
the
fall
like
evenings
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
m
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
though
this
beer
was
good
to
have
once
but
not
good
enough
to
revisit
imo
still
enjoyed
it
the
beer
looks
murky
rust
colored
reddish
brown
quite
brackish
and
cloudy
almost
no
head
looks
dull
and
lifeless
pours
a
deep
mahogany
and
brown
color
with
some
garnet
hues
develops
about
a
quarter
inch
of
foamy
offwhite
head
that
lingers
for
some
time
patches
of
wet
lacing
remain
smells
of
caramel
toffee
faint
bourbon
some
molasses
and
a
touch
of
oak
though
i
dont
think
this
one
is
barrel
aged
taste
is
very
similar
with
caramel
scotch
vanilla
and
some
molasses
coming
through
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
finishes
only
a
touch
dry
overall
a
very
good
highly
drinkable
scotch
ale
im
very
happy
i
have
another
to
enjoy
down
the
road
overall
definitely
glad
i
finally
bought
a
bottle
of
this
one
to
try
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
founders
rendition
of
it
is
an
excellent
one
o
decent
beer
for
the
style
would
be
good
with
food
or
standalone
overall
founders
never
disappoints
its
like
drinking
a
big
fresh
loaf
of
booze
soaked
yeasty
raisin
bread
toasted
slightly
dark
dont
get
the
hate
this
one
has
received
lately
its
spot
on
for
its
style
and
it
requires
it
not
be
mocked
ya
wee
lad
o
this
is
a
decent
scottish
ale
and
i
like
the
strength
of
malt
but
the
sugar
level
on
it
is
just
a
bit
too
high
dial
it
back
maybe
add
a
bit
more
hops
or
peat
quality
and
this
could
be
a
true
winner
while
this
is
a
bigger
beer
it
holds
it
very
well
on
the
fuller
and
richer
side
but
well
balanced
with
some
power
behind
it
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
but
the
scotch
ale
style
is
not
my
thing
so
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
with
that
said
it
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
still
want
to
try
the
backwoods
bastard
so
i
will
revisit
the
style
again
while
this
is
a
solid
well
made
beer
it
really
isnt
my
thing
i
can
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
that
goes
into
a
beer
of
this
quality
but
the
style
just
isnt
one
i
feel
strongly
about
cheers
a
dark
mahogany
colored
brew
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
and
similar
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
beautiful
charcoal
malt
with
a
hint
of
buttery
licorice
the
taste
buds
detect
more
charcoal
and
butterscotch
but
licorice
remains
a
key
ingredient
this
stuff
is
carbonated
with
fine
tingly
bubbles
that
keep
this
very
lively
in
feel
with
a
solid
medium
body
and
some
resinous
qualities
for
sure
there
is
also
some
booziness
present
but
overall
this
is
a
very
satisfying
scotch
ale
sort
of
brew
and
in
true
keeping
with
founders
reputation
o
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
packed
full
of
flavor
will
definitely
drink
again
color
is
a
orangebrown
much
like
iced
tea
the
tan
head
is
pretty
wimpy
and
fades
pretty
quickly
with
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
scents
are
noted
in
the
smell
the
malts
are
prominent
in
the
taste
caramel
with
a
slight
smoky
flavor
a
piney
hop
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
finish
fullbodied
and
chewy
mouthfeel
nice
balance
and
complexity
good
representative
for
the
style
but
not
a
fit
to
my
preferred
tastes
o
what
a
solid
beer
and
makes
me
want
more
of
the
style
aroma
was
a
bit
lacking
but
still
there
the
only
rival
that
ive
enjoyed
as
much
was
a
year
old
old
chub
from
oskar
blues
founders
just
continues
to
push
to
be
my
number
one
brewery
well
done
o
a
great
representation
of
the
style
really
needs
to
be
allowed
to
warm
up
before
all
of
the
great
flavors
come
out
and
it
really
hits
the
palate
right
overall
drinkability
first
founders
beer
i
didnt
really
care
for
i
guess
theres
a
first
for
everything
o
one
of
the
few
founders
beers
ive
had
that
didnt
do
much
for
me
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
really
think
founders
has
done
yet
another
fine
job
of
nailing
a
style
and
bringing
to
folks
that
may
otherwise
neglect
its
existence
overall
an
extremely
tasty
brew
with
the
alcohol
flavor
kept
to
a
minimum
yet
still
allowing
for
a
nice
warming
sensation
after
the
swallow
rich
fullbodied
with
a
light
effervescence
creamy
warming
smooth
seriously
good
beer
purchased
a
six
pack
of
bottle
at
the
local
grocery
store
for
9
99
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
thick
sticky
head
stick
your
nose
in
the
glass
and
you
are
greeted
with
a
wonderfully
complex
medley
of
smells
biscuity
malt
and
earthy
peat
are
balanced
with
vanilla
the
flavor
is
equally
complex
and
frankly
wonderful
it
starts
with
the
maltiness
but
finishes
with
the
smoky
peat
and
alcohol
of
good
scotch
the
smokiness
lingers
overall
an
exceptional
complex
standout
definately
worth
picking
up
fresh
811
from
the
cooler
pours
out
a
nice
dark
ruby
color
with
a
sticky
looking
head
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
slightly
smokey
and
mildly
sweet
with
some
vanilla
almost
reminiscent
of
a
fine
bourbon
really
a
complex
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
equally
rich
and
malty
but
has
a
nice
citric
resinous
hop
base
to
balance
it
all
out
nice
warming
alcohol
as
you
sip
this
one
and
it
works
well
on
a
cool
night
like
tonight
more
flavors
are
coming
forth
a
bit
of
molasses
from
all
that
alcohol
but
also
some
nicely
roasted
malts
sure
there
is
a
bit
of
earthy
peat
to
it
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
some
scotch
ales
ive
had
and
i
like
it
anyway
this
is
a
big
beer
one
to
be
sipped
and
slowly
warmed
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
too
overall
this
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
that
is
making
a
great
alternative
right
now
to
the
shelves
full
of
tired
but
true
oktoberfest
offerings
overall
a
fantastic
offering
from
founders
interesting
style
i
dont
find
myself
drinking
enough
of
this
is
my
second
time
purchasing
dirty
bastard
and
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
it
during
the
cold
chicago
winter
o
definitely
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
out
there
get
this
beer
if
you
havent
already
o
absolutely
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
ive
never
been
disappointed
by
founders
i
ate
some
mms
while
drinking
the
dirty
bastard
it
was
a
great
pairing
it
pours
a
light
brown
color
almost
like
the
darkest
iced
tea
youve
ever
had
the
flavor
is
very
complex
with
a
ton
of
different
malt
flavors
going
on
there
is
roastedness
piney
hoppy
a
little
bit
of
not
very
sweet
maple
even
a
hint
of
scotch
its
very
bold
and
has
a
long
bitter
but
not
acrid
finish
o
delicious
at
times
the
taste
resembled
a
rochefort
6
less
smooth
first
beer
ive
had
from
founders
not
disappointed
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
caramel
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
malty
nutty
some
caramel
alcohol
is
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
i
remember
back
when
this
was
founders
flagship
havent
had
it
in
years
but
its
quite
the
dram
for
the
end
of
the
night
o
drinkable
for
a
few
beers
id
need
to
switch
it
up
if
i
had
more
than
2
this
is
another
one
of
those
awesome
founders
beers
that
is
10
or
less
for
a
6
pack
and
thats
a
steal
for
this
one
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
coppery
amber
color
there
was
a
very
small
light
brown
had
on
it
that
didnt
linger
or
leave
much
lacing
at
all
big
nose
of
roasted
caramel
definitely
raisins
and
a
hint
of
smoke
in
there
also
very
nice
taste
it
is
smokey
and
a
little
bitter
then
you
get
some
of
that
roasted
caramel
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
popping
thru
faint
dark
fruits
to
the
taste
also
nice
o
a
unique
fantastic
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
in
sparing
amounts
i
truly
felt
one
12
oz
bottle
was
perfect
any
more
and
it
would
have
been
too
much
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
ale
that
is
packed
with
toasty
malt
and
scotch
flavor
while
still
remaining
very
smooth
o
overall
i
like
this
gotta
get
more
this
has
some
very
nice
characteristics
going
on
that
i
really
like
i
could
drink
this
like
eating
candy
can
never
get
enough
thumbs
up
thanks
dave
o
i
think
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
with
this
one
or
maybe
the
alcohol
content
has
caught
up
to
me
at
the
end
of
this
review
and
i
am
an
easy
grader
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
not
something
i
would
drink
a
bunch
of
at
once
but
overall
glad
i
tried
this
o
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
complex
intriguing
and
not
quite
like
any
other
scotch
ive
had
not
my
favorite
beer
style
but
this
is
clearly
a
good
example
of
it
malty
but
balanced
abv
is
almost
entirely
masked
avoids
the
smoked
malt
that
too
many
american
brewers
of
scottish
ales
insist
on
using
well
done
fans
of
old
chub
and
claymore
are
sure
to
love
dirty
bastard
othis
is
a
great
scotch
ale
it
may
actually
be
my
favorite
im
not
normally
a
scotch
ale
kind
of
guy
but
dirty
bastard
helped
me
appreciate
it
prosit
1359
im
no
expert
in
scotch
ales
but
this
beer
is
delicious
rich
mouthfeel
but
not
tacky
sweet
i
cant
analogies
the
taste
to
any
single
other
flavor
but
its
a
balanced
toasty
caramalized
deliciousness
its
not
too
thick
or
strong
that
it
cant
be
enjoyed
in
hot
weather
i
usually
avoid
ports
and
stouts
in
the
hot
summer
months
of
virginia
but
i
have
no
problem
enjoying
this
brew
on
an
august
night
the
abv
is
high
but
its
not
too
noticeable
on
the
palate
not
my
favorite
style
in
the
world
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
yet
another
example
of
why
founders
beers
continues
to
find
themselves
in
my
fridge
tried
the
dirty
bastard
from
founders
the
appearance
was
rich
reddish
amber
color
slightly
cloudy
with
decent
tan
head
with
some
lacing
smell
was
sweet
from
probably
molasses
and
some
roast
taste
was
dominated
by
alcohol
there
is
an
attempt
to
balance
the
beer
with
sweet
malt
and
roast
the
mouthfeel
was
downgraded
due
to
teh
alcohol
bite
this
is
not
a
session
beer
for
the
timid
this
beer
has
fortitude
and
gusto
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
wee
heavies
i
would
be
willing
to
purchase
again
just
to
get
out
of
the
usual
trend
of
beers
that
i
try
not
too
sweet
not
too
syrupy
not
too
thin
not
too
hopped
up
this
wee
heavy
is
juuust
right
wow
from
the
first
whiff
this
offering
has
proven
to
be
a
study
in
restrained
plaidclad
fury
and
tasty
as
fish
and
chips
in
seaside
aberdeenshire
o
a
good
beer
overall
but
being
from
ct
id
gladly
take
wet
willy
over
this
but
would
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
out
of
state
o
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
prefer
but
not
offensive
i
would
also
prefer
more
complexity
possibly
more
smokiness
and
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
id
put
this
at
a
solid
b
the
best
aspect
of
this
brew
is
its
ability
to
hide
the
alcohol
the
8
5abv
is
totally
masked
by
the
sweetness
this
is
one
of
many
times
ive
had
this
beer
tonight
in
a
bottle
but
many
times
on
tap
it
is
the
best
wee
heavy
i
have
had
to
date
i
love
as
it
warms
up
the
booziness
creeps
out
ever
so
slightly
but
just
as
smooth
as
can
be
at
the
same
time
if
you
think
dirty
bastard
is
good
you
have
to
try
its
big
brother
backwoods
bastard
this
is
totally
delicious
ale
bursting
with
flavor
as
it
warms
the
malt
hop
and
8
5
abv
become
very
distinctive
but
also
harmonious
and
balanced
as
always
with
their
dark
offerings
founders
has
another
winner
here
one
to
buy
by
the
case
overall
a
very
nice
brew
great
subtle
flavor
and
a
nice
nose
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
this
point
in
its
maturity
ive
had
it
fresh
before
too
and
can
tell
you
that
aging
it
certainly
does
meld
together
some
of
the
sweeter
flavors
and
kicks
out
some
of
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
another
good
one
from
founders
and
year
round
to
boot
not
too
much
carbonation
present
but
the
bitterness
and
booziness
encourages
slow
drinking
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
one
i
would
order
two
of
in
a
given
night
this
is
a
solid
welldone
example
of
the
style
founders
makes
some
quality
brews
and
they
do
not
disappoint
me
with
this
one
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
access
to
dirty
bastards
all
the
time
the
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
this
is
quite
a
bold
brew
but
fittingly
so
for
the
style
if
the
mineral
flavors
were
worked
out
of
this
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
much
more
overall
not
bad
with
that
8
5
hitting
fairly
hard
worth
a
try
for
sure
admittedly
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
it
is
a
good
rendition
of
it
o
really
fun
beer
it
seems
like
a
great
representation
of
this
style
a
great
beer
that
i
would
go
back
to
and
be
very
happy
be
careful
if
you
have
more
than
one
though
because
it
may
sneak
up
on
you
o
this
hoppedup
version
of
a
scotch
ale
may
have
a
hard
time
striking
a
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
but
its
still
amazingly
flavorful
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
a
cloudy
brickred
nice
unique
carameltoffeecolored
headring
smell
is
all
sweet
caramel
taste
is
a
ton
of
toffee
with
a
bit
of
mineral
clean
lightly
nutty
sort
of
like
peanut
brittle
as
beer
enough
bitters
to
satisfy
dry
finish
very
clean
brew
good
o
good
beer
slightly
better
than
i
remember
it
perhaps
i
quite
like
founders
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
not
exceptional
perhaps
and
not
one
for
regular
drinking
but
a
fullbodied
wellspiced
winter
sort
of
beer
i
would
recommend
it
even
if
its
a
while
before
i
have
another
i
found
a
case
of
this
at
kunda
beverage
in
king
of
prussia
another
strong
beer
this
poured
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
thick
twofinger
head
at
the
top
which
hung
around
for
a
pretty
substantial
period
of
time
real
smooth
beer
yet
it
still
had
a
fairly
pronounced
alcohol
profile
that
gave
it
a
tad
of
bite
i
would
have
to
imagine
this
is
much
better
suited
as
a
fall
or
winter
beer
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
oa
nice
scotch
style
ale
my
first
founders
beer
dark
coffee
color
with
a
decent
smell
with
some
hops
and
sweetness
like
molasses
good
carbination
and
a
dark
malt
taste
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
i
wasnt
that
crazy
about
the
beer
but
the
alcohol
was
hidden
fairly
well
for
8
5
abv
for
the
style
it
was
good
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
never
had
the
soapy
experience
i
had
this
night
i
will
try
this
beer
again
probably
from
a
bottle
as
founders
rarely
disappoints
ridiculously
casual
overall
for
the
usual
north
of
8er
id
order
this
on
tap
somewhere
if
i
could
then
have
someone
else
drive
home
o
a
very
complex
and
robust
americanized
wee
heavy
indeed
founders
dirty
bastard
is
a
deep
decadent
brew
to
sit
down
with
on
a
cold
autumn
night
although
i
enjoyed
it
just
fine
on
a
balmy
summer
night
too
the
8
5
abv
is
heady
indeed
but
there
is
a
fine
balance
amidst
the
chaos
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
with
minimal
carbonation
drank
pretty
well
personally
i
liked
it
havent
had
many
wee
heavyscotch
ales
besides
ddc
equinoxe
du
printemps
so
its
a
delightful
new
style
for
me
i
hope
to
experience
more
in
the
near
future
o
not
a
huge
scotch
ale
guy
but
this
is
a
good
one
the
blend
of
sweet
roast
spice
and
hops
make
this
a
very
well
balanced
beer
you
would
never
know
this
is
8
5
this
is
an
extremely
flavorful
brew
with
nice
balance
and
real
assertiveness
in
all
sensory
respects
it
surprised
me
with
its
creamy
sweetness
and
then
it
surprised
me
with
its
smokey
bitterness
whats
great
is
that
it
moves
so
effortlessly
between
its
flavors
definitely
a
wellcrafted
ale
thats
worth
a
purchase
overall
a
great
beer
to
share
with
your
friends
and
enjoy
over
and
over
again
o
pretty
tasty
and
probably
a
shoe
in
over
oskar
blues
old
chub
the
only
other
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
might
warm
up
to
this
style
o
i
am
not
gonna
be
drinking
many
of
these
in
one
night
nonetheless
a
very
nice
beer
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
think
it
just
didnt
quite
live
up
to
its
potential
i
think
it
could
be
better
by
lowering
the
attenuation
i
e
lowering
the
alcohol
but
increasing
the
sugars
left
in
the
beer
d
good
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
wish
it
was
a
little
sweeter
for
the
style
once
again
just
not
my
favority
style
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
were
the
malts
and
the
smokiness
they
impart
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
the
aroma
is
muted
at
first
but
blossoms
into
a
rich
mixture
exemplary
for
the
style
it
does
however
suggest
that
the
flavors
will
bring
a
bit
more
sweetness
this
is
not
to
say
that
we
were
let
down
but
rather
that
it
gives
a
little
bit
of
a
surprise
when
you
take
that
first
sip
o
ive
loved
founders
for
so
long
and
have
always
skipped
on
this
offering
because
i
was
not
a
malt
guy
today
i
have
been
sold
on
this
beer
i
will
be
picking
this
up
as
often
as
red
rye
pa
from
now
on
overalli
may
have
to
go
back
and
do
a
side
by
side
with
a
few
scotch
ales
this
beer
was
very
complex
alot
going
on
this
review
is
subject
to
change
for
the
positive
here
in
the
next
few
weeks
overall
another
amazing
beer
from
a
truly
amazing
brewery
i
have
not
to
this
day
tried
a
founders
brew
that
i
did
not
like
on
the
scale
of
amazing
founders
brew
i
would
probably
place
this
one
somewhere
in
the
middle
but
compared
to
a
lot
of
others
it
is
right
at
the
top
this
would
definitely
be
a
go
to
for
me
when
searching
for
beers
in
michigan
and
i
would
actually
love
to
have
this
one
again
good
thing
it
is
a
regular
offering
from
founders
o
not
a
bad
beer
wish
it
was
a
little
sweeter
for
the
style
i
can
see
why
so
many
love
this
beer
just
not
my
cup
d
not
too
bad
there
is
a
lot
of
complex
sugar
character
and
the
aroma
is
really
very
nice
some
of
the
dark
sugar
in
the
flavor
profile
is
accompanied
by
a
musty
note
that
may
be
diacetyl
or
possibly
even
cardboard
in
addition
to
that
slightly
unpleasant
note
it
has
a
touch
of
alcoholic
warmth
that
is
perhaps
understandable
considering
the
strength
but
kind
of
messes
with
the
smoothness
that
i
would
really
like
to
see
in
this
sort
of
beer
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
falls
a
bit
below
the
average
for
founders
and
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
myself
drinking
it
again
o
very
drinkable
for
8
5
and
would
definitely
go
for
again
if
anything
it
comes
through
slightly
sweeter
than
i
would
like
however
it
is
brewed
to
style
and
delicious
o
great
scotchale
was
very
surprised
by
this
one
even
though
founders
is
fantastic
all
around
pours
a
very
dark
ambermaroon
with
about
a
finger
of
very
light
orangish
head
retention
is
ok
with
decent
lacing
smell
is
rich
caramel
and
malts
a
little
dark
fruit
raisin
as
it
warms
the
aroma
is
kind
of
muted
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
taste
is
more
caramel
brown
sugar
and
malt
but
the
finish
is
mostly
a
notsopleasant
hop
bitterness
carbonation
is
on
the
light
end
not
bad
for
the
style
i
guess
maybe
a
little
lighter
than
id
prefer
medium
bodied
and
a
little
hot
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
more
after
enjoying
backwoods
bastard
12oz
bottle
thanks
to
auroracrisis
this
was
probably
my
least
favorite
founders
beer
to
date
the
color
was
a
turbid
and
murky
brown
scant
head
smell
was
slightly
malty
but
faint
the
taste
was
spot
on
for
the
style
but
just
didnt
wow
me
sure
its
malty
but
id
rather
have
anold
chub
any
day
of
the
week
notes
this
offering
from
founders
is
dam
tasty
nicely
sweet
with
bits
of
bitterness
cheers
o
overall
a
good
beer
one
of
fonders
best
brews
i
have
tried
thus
far
fair
price
but
not
an
everyday
beer
i
will
probably
buy
it
again
when
im
looking
for
a
higher
priced
relaxing
beer
poured
a
murky
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
smell
is
of
rich
malts
and
pine
taste
is
similar
with
a
rich
malt
base
overlaid
with
pine
and
peat
moderately
smokey
with
hints
of
indistinct
fruit
and
spice
relatively
low
alcohol
but
still
had
quite
a
sharp
boozy
kick
with
a
dry
and
bitter
finish
on
the
heavy
end
of
being
mediumbodied
smooth
and
creamy
complex
and
very
drinkable
omy
favorite
scotch
ale
out
there
so
far
founders
really
needs
to
to
distribute
to
upstate
ny
d
sits
a
bit
heavy
3
max
keep
around
definitely
the
tastiest
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
051011
pours
a
dark
brownish
ruby
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
zero
lacing
smells
sweet
with
some
malt
booze
raisin
and
berry
aromas
taste
is
a
sllightly
boozey
malty
sweetness
a
hint
of
smoke
somewhat
medicinal
at
the
end
but
its
not
too
bad
its
a
decent
wee
heavy
but
the
medicine
taste
is
now
starting
to
get
to
me
more
still
a
good
beer
overall
id
buy
it
again
but
a
6
pack
would
take
me
a
while
to
finish
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
do
not
care
for
i
find
it
hard
to
drink
unappetizing
too
sweet
and
heavy
the
scotch
ale
department
is
one
that
seems
to
have
a
hard
time
producing
outstanding
ales
and
while
dirty
bastard
is
better
than
say
oskar
blues
old
chubb
it
still
is
far
from
a
superb
brew
o
rich
and
tasty
quite
easy
to
drink
o
not
bad
dont
know
that
id
grab
it
again
though
as
there
are
other
beers
id
rather
sit
back
and
relax
with
glad
i
tried
it
though
nice
sweetness
to
it
but
really
lacks
that
pop
of
a
flavor
the
malt
is
there
at
the
front
but
i
would
have
like
a
bit
more
pop
from
it
all
given
what
it
is
not
too
bad
but
there
are
other
founders
brews
id
rather
go
with
and
other
similar
beers
i
like
better
given
the
flavor
profile
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
at
all
in
general
but
this
one
made
me
appreciate
how
good
scotch
ales
can
be
when
done
well
i
havent
had
too
many
scotch
ales
that
ive
enjoyed
i
tend
to
find
the
style
too
malty
for
my
taste
but
this
one
strikes
a
very
good
balance
pours
a
murky
dark
brownish
red
with
a
small
12
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
a
little
bit
of
ring
lacing
forms
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
dark
fruits
like
raisins
malts
and
alcohol
maybe
some
light
caramel
aromas
taste
is
of
some
malt
flavors
up
front
with
some
caramel
and
raisin
like
flavors
on
the
finish
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
after
each
sip
mild
carbonation
makes
for
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
a
a
good
beer
all
around
i
think
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
i
have
tried
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
would
try
others
in
the
category
in
the
future
o
damn
good
scotch
ale
its
sweet
but
somehow
keeps
it
in
check
with
enough
bready
flavors
worth
a
try
overall
this
has
been
one
of
my
goto
beers
recently
especially
in
the
colder
months
while
i
typically
gravitate
to
ipas
and
bolder
hefeweizens
in
the
warmer
ones
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
alot
very
satisfying
for
those
who
like
the
flavor
of
dark
fruits
molasses
and
malts
and
still
some
hop
gratification
at
the
end
of
the
sip
really
a
great
complex
beer
with
a
wonderful
progression
of
flavors
and
nuances
in
every
sip
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
at
8
5
abv
it
may
not
be
very
sessionable
but
2
of
these
is
a
really
nice
way
to
end
an
evening
overall
a
really
great
beer
o
there
is
certainly
a
good
and
bad
way
to
sample
this
beer
in
the
bottle
youll
find
a
funnytasting
dark
ale
ontap
you
will
get
a
brew
that
yells
at
you
in
a
crazy
scottish
accent
picks
a
fight
with
your
senses
then
pummels
you
to
the
ground
in
other
words
its
just
what
you
expect
from
founders
bold
flavor
o
my
first
wee
heavy
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
matches
the
style
notes
quite
well
and
would
be
a
great
beer
during
the
winter
months
o
an
excellent
scotch
ale
probably
the
best
when
availability
and
price
are
factored
in
another
great
founders
offering
a
very
creamy
red
beer
gorgeous
ruby
in
color
with
superb
head
and
lacing
very
malty
smell
sugary
raisin
and
malty
flavor
that
mix
very
smooth
nice
creamy
texture
with
a
bitter
bite
a
nice
complex
and
balanced
brew
will
try
it
on
a
crisp
cool
autumn
day
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
scotch
ales
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
pours
a
beutiful
copper
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
heavy
caramel
and
other
sweet
fruits
the
taste
hits
strong
with
the
caramel
up
front
then
gives
way
to
some
hoppy
bitterness
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
its
a
joy
in
your
mouth
was
my
first
wee
heavy
but
love
the
style
now
this
still
may
be
my
favorite
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
chewy
carbonated
warming
and
coating
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thick
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
a
really
good
scotch
ale
has
a
lot
of
character
well
made
i
would
however
like
to
see
the
beer
have
some
more
peat
to
to
and
a
bit
chewier
overall
great
example
of
style
2nd
only
to
nebco
wet
willy
o
a
decent
brew
that
im
sure
many
others
will
swoon
over
im
always
willing
to
sample
a
founders
brew
even
of
styles
i
dont
particularly
love
and
dirty
bastard
is
a
great
example
why
d
very
nice
lots
going
on
as
you
taste
through
the
brew
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
balance
of
carbination
and
smooth
creaminess
the
alocohol
is
there
but
its
more
mellow
than
anything
overall
another
fantastic
beer
from
founders
im
glad
that
this
one
is
easy
to
find
becuase
i
would
definatly
like
to
pick
this
one
up
from
time
to
time
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
that
does
remiind
one
of
a
scotch
quite
an
interesting
brew
and
another
solid
offering
from
founders
o
quite
drinkable
overall
ive
just
recently
started
drinking
more
scotch
ales
and
this
one
definitely
comes
to
the
top
of
the
list
in
terms
of
buy
agains
i
had
heard
a
lot
of
hype
for
this
beer
and
the
rumors
were
true
it
was
amazing
theres
no
mistaking
the
high
alcohol
but
its
a
relatively
smooth
drink
for
8
5
abv
it
does
lack
some
flavor
but
its
still
a
good
beer
m
medium
full
body
coats
your
mouth
without
being
overly
syrupy
sweet
brownsugar
finish
served
from
bottle
into
a
delirium
tremens
snifter
poured
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
chocolate
and
very
slight
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
quite
excellent
the
flavor
on
this
one
was
slightly
complex
and
very
well
balanced
very
nice
aroma
going
on
here
as
well
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
a
great
brew
for
the
style
and
a
definite
must
try
for
anyone
out
there
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
off
white
head
gentle
smoky
aroma
mixed
with
alcohol
and
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
a
little
spicy
from
the
alcohol
with
the
malts
and
smokiness
being
present
as
well
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
smooth
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
enjoy
whenever
i
have
the
chance
overall
if
not
for
the
heat
id
say
it
was
sessionable
tasty
good
smell
light
on
the
palate
good
to
drink
but
i
suspect
the
8
5
heat
will
keep
me
from
drinking
more
than
12
overall
an
excellent
beer
a
beautiful
colour
very
balanced
flavour
and
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
one
of
the
more
interesting
scotch
ales
ive
had
im
very
partial
since
i
just
made
a
batch
of
wee
heavy
so
im
not
really
impressed
the
malty
flavor
is
not
as
strong
as
i
feel
it
should
be
although
it
does
have
a
nice
finish
while
its
a
decent
wee
heavy
i
would
hope
next
years
batch
would
so
more
flavor
this
pours
like
a
really
dark
piece
of
bloodwood
with
a
light
khaki
head
thats
two
fingers
tall
and
leaves
big
chunky
lace
on
the
way
down
on
the
nose
there
are
caramel
and
toasted
malts
set
against
a
definite
background
of
alcohol
there
are
sooty
and
earthy
notes
here
almost
like
spent
oil
poured
on
a
pile
of
leaves
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
large
base
of
the
caramel
and
toasted
notes
from
the
nose
but
also
some
dark
fruits
come
out
buckeyenation
said
bourbon
soaked
figs
and
i
think
that
accounts
for
both
the
dark
fruit
and
the
alcohol
which
seems
like
its
there
by
design
rather
than
by
mistake
the
body
is
full
and
the
finish
is
long
but
conspicuously
absent
from
the
back
part
of
the
tongue
i
guess
due
to
the
absence
of
notable
bitterness
i
like
this
beer
a
good
deal
perhaps
not
a
staple
but
something
that
is
very
good
and
easily
enough
had
on
tap
when
im
at
home
in
michigan
o
love
founders
enjoy
this
style
after
not
liking
it
much
initially
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
and
thoroughly
enjoy
drinking
im
more
of
a
porter
or
stout
drinker
not
a
fan
of
scotch
ale
but
this
is
a
good
one
a
great
beer
to
sip
while
grilling
a
nice
porterhouse
steak
overall
i
think
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
im
not
really
even
particularly
fond
of
the
style
something
about
the
understated
balance
and
underlying
craftsmanship
of
this
brew
has
struck
a
chord
with
me
i
actually
think
i
feel
this
way
about
almost
all
of
the
beers
i
have
tasted
from
founders
doverall
this
is
a
great
beer
this
style
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
has
tons
of
flavor
but
nothing
is
overpowering
just
a
solid
complex
but
well
balanced
beer
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
style
grade
a
purchased
at
stoneys
10
99
per
6pack
overall
this
is
very
nicely
done
not
too
big
or
boozy
yet
rich
enough
to
let
you
know
youre
enjoying
something
special
fruity
but
not
sickeningly
sweet
the
bitterness
balances
this
well
i
might
not
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
id
not
turn
em
down
either
d
a
rather
nice
interpretation
of
a
scotch
style
ale
but
lacks
something
that
mcewans
no1
ale
has
full
bodied
with
slight
carbonation
this
beer
is
thick
and
slightly
sticky
it
coats
your
mouth
just
enough
to
allow
the
booze
warmth
to
last
properly
d
overall
much
too
bitter
and
full
of
roast
and
coffee
notes
that
are
not
part
of
the
traditional
style
i
appreciate
the
smoke
but
the
rest
is
too
much
of
a
culture
clash
from
what
im
expecting
oa
seriously
good
example
of
the
style
and
yet
another
notch
on
founders
belt
from
the
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
caramel
brown
with
a
moderate
whitish
head
decent
lacing
smells
of
carameltoffee
malts
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
full
and
robust
notes
of
malt
slightly
burnt
toffee
with
a
mild
somewhat
sweet
hop
bite
slightly
chewy
mouth
i
love
the
style
and
this
is
a
great
version
of
a
weeheavy
this
one
is
complex
strong
and
beautiful
a
powerhouse
ale
both
unique
and
delicious
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
from
founders
but
it
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
every
now
and
then
definitely
at
least
worth
a
taste
o
just
too
boozy
to
be
very
drinkable
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
founders
that
disappointed
me
this
drinks
more
like
a
hard
liquor
than
a
beer
with
the
booziness
and
burning
effect
the
alcohol
is
too
prominent
in
this
beer
to
the
detriment
of
everything
else
going
on
with
it
this
is
much
boozier
than
russian
imperial
stouts
and
barleywines
i
have
had
more
flavor
characteristics
came
out
as
the
beer
warmed
quite
a
bit
but
by
then
i
was
over
this
beer
carbonation
is
perfect
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
almost
creamy
perfect
carbonation
the
failry
high
abv
isnt
noticeable
at
all
a
definite
plus
a
solid
beer
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
via
trade
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
if
founders
were
available
around
here
o
great
scotch
ale
thats
deliciously
sweet
and
candylike

its

me
not
my
favorite
from
the
company
but
well
described
as
dirty
bastard
its
a
dirty
brown
looking
beer
with
high
inebriation
potential
othis
is
my
first
time
trying
this
style
its
certainly
not
my
new
favorite
but
after
this
bottle
im
willing
to
try
it
again
some
day
overallnotes
ive
had
this
review
written
for
a
long
time
but
drinking
it
again
reminded
me
that
i
was
member
here
watched
blade
runner
ate
an
applecrisp
granola
bar
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
all
three
you
should
do
the
same
owhen
trying
a
new
ale
theres
not
a
risk
with
founders
brewing
you
like
the
style
or
not
i
enjoy
scotch
ale
this
is
perfect
while
grilling
ribbs
easy
drinking
great
taste
o
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
scotch
ales
out
there
o
like
i
said
a
great
beer
for
its
price
really
solid
beer
very
malty
and
sweet
another
solid
founders
brew
d
ive
had
a
couple
scotch
ales
and
have
to
say
im
not
into
this
style
the
sweetness
combined
with
somewhat
sharp
hops
isnt
for
me
that
said
this
is
a
quality
brew
for
sure
and
for
fans
of
the
style
id
say
its
on
point
o
surprisingly
good
im
not
sure
why
i
was
surprised
but
absolutely
loved
this
beer
might
be
because
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
scotch
ale
tastings
to
compare
to
i
could
drink
this
fast
and
often
this
one
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
its
a
very
good
beer
regardless
but
be
careful
the
abv
doesnt
seem
as
high
as
it
is
im
not
always
sure
what
comprises
a
scottish
ale
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
has
the
rich
malts
of
a
dopple
nuttiness
of
a
nut
brown
and
a
pretty
big
kick
o
really
nice
beer
lots
of
great
flavor
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
whatsoever
and
very
drinkable
o
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
very
nice
and
well
balanced
given
the
abv
and
malt
complex
the
hop
profile
is
a
plus
o
this
is
very
mild
for
its
strength
and
it
needs
to
be
drank
between
5060
degrees
to
get
anything
out
of
it
on
the
plus
side
it
is
only
about
10
bucks
per
sixer
and
goes
down
easily
for
being
8
5
abv
d
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
does
get
a
bit
cloyingly
sweet
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
but
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
think
it
would
be
even
better
and
closer
to
style
if
they
reduced
the
bitterness
a
wee
bit
o
another
job
well
done
by
founders
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
weeheavy
session
because
it
doesnt
wear
you
out
but
it
can
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
reach
for
another
bravo
founders
this
beer
is
a
deep
mahogany
and
pours
with
about
a
quarter
inch
of
head
which
dissipates
to
a
film
quickly
there
is
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nice
with
a
lot
of
caramel
sweetness
and
maybe
a
bit
of
toffee
there
is
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
curiously
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
masked
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
flavor
as
well
with
a
mild
clean
bitterness
to
back
up
the
extremely
malty
character
good
medium
mouthfeel
and
pretty
good
drinkability
good
enjoyable
beer
waited
quite
awhile
to
try
this
brew
glad
i
finally
did
it
would
be
perfect
in
my
opinion
if
it
had
some
peat
malt
smokiness
i
really
like
this
style
to
do
that
the
presence
of
high
abv
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
more
then
say
two
at
any
one
sitting
overall
something
you
should
drink
during
a
special
occasion
great
brew
loved
it
good
for
a
cool
day
rainy
and
such
its
nice
good
stuff
d
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
my
first
beer
from
founders
i
would
have
this
one
again
if
offered
d
drinkability
improved
as
i
moved
down
the
glass
started
out
feeling
a
bit
discordant
but
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
the
flavors
smoothed
out
the
peaks
and
valleys
evened
and
it
went
down
quite
nicely
recommend
letting
it
warm
to
5055
degrees
before
drinking
d
great
scotch
style
beer
it
is
not
my
personal
favorite
style
but
they
have
done
a
great
job
with
it
no
surprises
d
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
sweetness
especially
in
the
throat
after
swallowing
almost
to
the
point
where
it
feels
like
ive
just
swallowed
some
seriously
sweetened
medicine
but
aside
from
the
throat
sugar
burn
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
cpj
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
that
is
almost
completely
opaque
there
is
a
fingers
worth
of
a
cream
colored
head
with
foamy
lacing
the
nose
offers
burnt
caramel
malts
with
some
roasted
malt
as
well
a
bit
boozey
after
a
long
whiff
the
taste
is
of
butterscotch
up
with
some
roasty
malts
a
well
blended
biscuit
flavor
is
noticed
right
before
the
8
5
is
noticed
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
creating
a
smooth
feel
because
this
brew
is
very
smooth
and
tasty
with
a
well
hidden
abv
downing
many
of
this
will
not
be
an
issue
drink
up
this
beer
and
old
chub
are
my
2
favorite
scotch
ale
beers
overall
pretty
good
nice
beer
to
open
the
night
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
can
never
seem
to
walk
away
from
whenever
i
go
to
binnys
i
always
find
myself
staring
at
it
i
always
want
to
walk
out
of
binnys
with
beers
i
have
never
had
but
this
one
always
seems
to
land
in
my
basket
with
a
name
like
dirty
bastard
i
was
expecting
a
more
aggressive
flavor
the
flavor
was
great
it
did
have
subtle
complex
flavors
but
i
wanted
something
more
nitty
gritty
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
dimpled
glass
mug
pours
a
cloudy
dark
red
with
a
nice
tan
head
leaving
thin
lacing
throughout
aromas
of
alcohol
toffee
and
bread
taste
is
very
malty
complex
with
alcohol
noted
up
front
brown
sugar
bread
sugar
caramel
maybe
cocoa
and
toffee
coming
in
later
on
a
dense
palate
with
a
heavy
and
thick
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
throughout
the
session
very
nice
long
finish
that
keeps
changing
this
is
a
very
nice
complex
brew
one
of
the
better
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
styles
ive
had
overall
i
enjoy
it
and
will
be
looking
for
more
scotch
ales
im
glad
there
is
something
in
this
style
easily
available
beer
is
thin
to
medium
in
body
and
a
little
sweet
with
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
finish
easy
drinking
and
smooth
throughout
i
was
expecting
a
higher
volume
on
the
flavor
but
i
guess
thats
what
i
get
for
having
only
had
the
barrelaged
version
of
the
beer
previously
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
this
is
a
very
solid
scotch
ale
with
maturity
and
complexity
im
looking
forward
to
aging
this
beer
the
beer
appears
dark
brown
with
crimson
hues
evident
when
held
to
the
light
the
beer
arrives
with
a
half
inch
of
head
that
generates
some
decent
lacing
as
it
recedes
the
beer
is
slightly
smoky
with
a
sweet
malt
character
evident
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
a
subtle
roast
aspect
contributes
to
the
flavor
profile
and
a
surprising
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
adds
the
finishing
touch
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
healthy
level
of
carbonation
a
good
but
not
great
example
of
the
style
id
drink
it
again
d
wow
i
think
this
is
my
first
scotch
ale
and
it
is
great
easy
to
drink
and
great
mouthfeel
great
show
of
different
malt
profiles
blending
well
cant
hardly
detect
the
higher
abv
looks
great
a
very
deep
amber
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
head
as
i
drink
it
it
laces
the
glass
very
well
there
is
a
good
full
body
malt
to
the
smell
then
some
hops
come
through
not
very
citrusy
taste
is
good
fairly
malty
with
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
the
bitterness
leaves
the
palette
very
quickly
it
has
a
good
mouth
feel
with
good
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
i
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
this
the
8
5
is
very
well
hidden
good
beer
over
all
i
have
had
this
on
draft
a
few
times
and
have
enjoyed
it
more
i
will
get
this
beer
again
d
a
nice
sipping
beer
nice
complex
scotch
ale
would
cerrtainly
seek
this
out
again
this
beer
in
my
opion
is
awesome
even
better
as
it
warms
up
i
highly
recommend
this
malt
bomb
d
looks
the
part
and
has
a
nice
aroma
malt
flavour
is
one
dimensional
and
the
hop
presence
is
too
strong
for
the
style
this
makes
it
very
apparent
its
an
american
take
on
the
style
albeit
thats
not
a
bad
thing
ill
mark
it
down
on
flavour
due
to
the
hop
presence
although
it
was
well
balanced
which
is
unusual
for
this
style
overall
an
interesting
beer
with
alcohol
well
hidden
albeit
not
true
to
style
a
scottish
ale
with
an
american
twist
aka
hops
nice
thick
head
of
tan
froth
dark
and
coppery
clear
really
nice
butterscotch
aroma
coffee
flavor
is
pronounced
some
smoke
a
little
sharp
bite
might
be
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
a
little
oily
overall
good
drinkability
for
a
higher
abv
and
good
flavor
drinkability
was
just
fine
for
the
style
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
red
with
a
thick
long
lasting
frothy
reddish
head
and
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
and
cherry
medium
creamy
smooth
body
bready
caramel
malt
is
balanced
on
the
palate
by
some
earthy
hops
and
dark
chocolate
long
dry
finish
delicious
brew
overall
a
good
drinker
but
not
nearly
as
complex
as
most
of
founders
other
offerings
in
fact
i
would
go
as
far
to
say
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
their
beers
which
only
adds
to
the
fact
that
founders
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
considering
i
still
enjoyed
it
least
none
that
i
have
had
a
reddish
beer
which
is
plus
smell
of
cherries
and
whiskey
taste
is
strong
but
unique
mouthful
speaks
for
itself
i
good
crisp
feeling
of
cherries
whiskey
and
a
tad
of
caramel
drinkability
is
only
average
because
of
the
higher
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
trying
overall
a
great
beer
overall
not
quite
a
d
this
drink
is
just
a
little
too
boozy
for
me
to
say
it
is
a
beer
id
like
to
have
several
of
in
a
night
not
necessarily
my
cup
of
beer
but
still
another
exceptional
example
of
the
style
from
founders
this
is
soso
get
if
youre
a
scotch
ale
fan
but
id
pass
in
the
future
d
very
good
beer
but
i
find
myself
thinking
what
kind
of
beer
do
i
want
next
rather
than
im
having
another
one
of
those
d
fairly
drinkable
very
rich
beer
and
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
thankfully
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
are
work
very
well
together
not
a
beer
to
gulp
down
and
with
the
high
abv
8
5
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
at
a
bit
of
a
slower
pace
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
8
5
alcohol
you
really
only
feel
it
in
the
swallow
and
its
not
overpowering
so
ill
have
no
reservations
about
opening
a
second
one
d
drinkability
is
medium
to
low
this
is
a
sipper
however
it
is
good
after
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
about
a
fingers
width
of
a
head
which
slowly
dissipated
there
was
a
nice
malty
aroma
the
texture
was
smooth
caramel
highlights
the
taste
for
me
this
is
an
ale
that
needs
to
be
slowly
drank
for
maximum
enjoyment
d
this
is
one
amazing
wee
heavy
a
bit
too
rich
for
more
than
one
but
youd
certainly
like
another
poured

took
a

to
dissipate

rich
taste
has
hints
of

malt
and
a

very

with
nothing
to
offend
my
only
complaint
is
im
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
dirty
bastard
sweet
nice
medium
in
body
but
that
doesnt
make
this
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
at

so
i
dont
really
have
anything
to
compare
it
to

a
serious

a

the

is
all

a

a

in

ways
its
full

backed
by

the

ive

toasted

a

carbonation

a

with
a

probably
the

i
am
seeing
a
trend
here
that
i
am
finding
to
be
rather
disappoiting
i
dont
think
that
i
keep
getting
off
bottles
so
i
am
left
to
assume
that
they
have
some
bottling
issues
d
love
this
stuff
this
was
my
first
taste
since
i
just
bought
singles
but
want
to
go
out
and
buy
a
sixer
poured
out
a
thick
molasses
color
with
a
tiny
reddish
head
taste
is
of
carmel
smoke
roasted
malts
hints
of
coffee
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
fairly
bitter
and
alcohol
unmasked
which
limits
the
drinkability
d
this
stuff
is
killer
at
about
8
it
can
creep
up
on
ya
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
hit
the
bed
the
more
i
drink
from
founders
the
more
i
love
founders
and
let
me
tell
ya
i
would
choose
this
over
their
breakfast
stout
any
day
very
good
beer
far
from
sessionable
for
me
at
least
but
id
be
happy
to
have
another
single
bottle
another
time
i
often
think
founders
brews
are
a
tad
bit
overrated
this
is
the
exception
definately
worth
a
try
drinkability
the
floaters
the
fruityness
and
all
that
make
this
beer
a
little
on
the
nondrinkable
side
for
me
i
did
enjoy
it
but
one
or
two
is
where
i
would
draw
the
line
with
this
offering
i
remember
liking
it
a
whole
lot
more
at
the
extreme
beerfest
maybe
my
tastes
were
out
of
whack
or
this
bottle
was
not
a
good
representation
of
the
beer
i
received
this
in
a
trade
and
whoever
traded
it
to
me
thank
you
wanna
trade
for
a
sixer
d
i
think
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
think
i
will
have
to
buy
a
6pack
off
line
everything
just
seems
like
it
is
meant
to
be
there
and
it
all
comes
together
very
nicely
a
good
scotch
ale
with
a
lot
of
personality
d
quite
enjoyable
the
10
different
malts
are
balanced
very
nicely
by
the
hops
d
very
well
balanced
so
soft
and
smooth
that
makes
me
think
its
actually
a
quad
and
not
a
scotch
ale
a
pleasure
to
drinkhands
down
a
great
beer
high
abv
goes
completely
unnoticedwell
masked
drinkability
for
a
stronger
scotch
alewee
heavy
this
is
very
drinkable
this
brew
is
perfect
on
a
cold
winters
day
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
flat
like
a
previous
reviewer
i
wonder
if
that
was
a
result
of
a
bad
bottle
drinkable
overall
for
a
relatively
high
abv
beer
took
a
bottle
out
of
the
fridge
and
poured
it
into
my
glass
very
small
head
that
dissipated
immediately
amberbrown
color
with
a
little
cloudiness
the
first
smell
that
jumped
out
at
me
was
alcohol
which
was
a
little
disappointing
maybe
a
little
licorice
too
but
nothing
very
distinctive
in
the
nose
for
me
mouthfeel
was
a
little
flat
which
when
combined
with
the
lack
of
head
makes
me
wonder
if
i
just
got
a
semiflat
beer
taste
was
good
with
alcohol
warmth
going
down
from
the
8
3
abv
decent
balance
of
malt
hops
and
neither
seemed
to
overpower
the
other
although
both
the
maltiness
and
bitterness
were
high
a
strong
but
drinkable
beer
d
as
previously
mentioned
much
more
drinkable
from
the
alcoholtaste
sense
not
the
abv
aspect
as
8
3
doesnt
allow
for
too
many
to
be
consumed
very
strong
scotch
ale
and
highly
recommended
d
a
very
tasty
wee
heavy
a
regular
drinker
of
mine
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
sly
fox
pint
glass
appears
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
an
inch
of
tan
colored
foam
smells
of
pineapple
caramel
molasses
and
has
a
sharp
alcohol
aroma
taste
is
of
sweet
prune
raisin
brown
sugar
and
molasses
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavy
side
with
medium
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
ale
again
but
probably
not
more
than
two
at
a
time
cheers
cheers
not
much
carbonation
nor
aftertaste
which
makes
this
an
average
scotch
ale
d
i
dont
know
know
if
this
beer
is
for
me
i
love
big
beers
but
this
one
is
a
tad
unbalanced
sweetness
is
far
more
subtle
in
the
flavor
with
strong
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
an
alcoholic
kick
overwhelming
the
caramel
and
dark
fruit
flavors
finish
is
fairly
bitter
medium
carbonation
balances
out
a
fairly
full
heavy
feel
ends
up
being
slightly
harsh
slightly
medicinal
slightly
off
ive
had
my
first
few
of
this
style
lately
dont
know
yet
if
itll
grow
on
me
but
this
is
surely
a
great
advocate
for
the
style
full
of
flavor
and
body
something
youd
like
to
session
but
probably
shouldnt
pours
a
dark
brownish
red
with
a
tan
head
that
lingers
around
as
you
sip
the
smell
is
inviting
roasted
malts
fruit
some
sweet
notes
the
taste
is
big
and
bold
as
with
most
founders
beers
and
starts
off
with
the
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
smoke
and
some
hops
thrown
in
the
mix
the
alcohol
flavor
dominates
this
beer
especially
as
it
warms
like
you
actually
are
drinking
scotch
very
potent
but
brings
out
a
nice
flavor
for
an
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
a
very
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
feel
this
one
isnt
the
easiest
drink
not
for
weak
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
for
starters
but
an
amazing
scotch
ale
definitely
worth
checking
out
enjoy
another
winner
from
founders
and
a
great
scotch
wee
heavy
very
tasty
all
around
and
well
made
recommended
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
full
bodied
not
my
favorite
founders
offering
but
i
tend
to
like
hopheavy
beers
rather
than
malt
bombs
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
as
soon
as
i
get
the
chance
pours
with
deep
red
hue
has
a
minimal
head
which
is
good
for
this
style
carbonation
level
is
perfect
just
enough
to
bring
out
the
flavor
a
nice
and
smooth
beer
this
is
with
a
little
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
a
roasted
character
not
much
of
any
hop
smell
to
this
one
as
it
should
be
just
the
great
malt
character
smell
with
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
hhhhmmmm
goood
this
certainly
isnt
a
beer
to
have
four
or
five
of
but
to
enjoy
one
is
a
pleasant
experience
drinkability
is
it
me
or
is
this
the
fruitiness
nonfruit
beer
to
date
d
a
nice
smooth
rich
malty
wee
heavy
taste
really
starts
coming
through
as
the
beer
warms
the
bottom
line
a
very
solid
regular
offering
by
founders
and
sure
to
be
a
mainstay
in
my
pint
from
this
point
on
i
founderd
out
that
when
this
flagship
sails
off
in
to
the
horizon
that
i
for
one
will
not
miss
it
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
on
the
label
was
a
nice
brownish
mahogany
had
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissappeared
aroma
was
a
nice
toasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
in
the
background
and
was
pretty
typical
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
and
let
you
know
you
were
drinking
a
good
beer
the
8
3
abv
definitely
warms
you
up
as
you
drink
it
but
was
not
to
overpowering
in
aroma
or
taste
overall
the
taste
was
excellent
and
what
i
expect
as
a
top
tier
example
of
the
sytle
due
to
the
higher
abv
not
a
session
beer
but
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
highly
recommend
4
hr
t
y
drinkability
this
is
delicious
and
mouthwatering
i
think
its
excellent
and
only
the
high
abv
prevents
it
from
being
sessionable
but
do
by
all
means
have
the
second
serving
i
e
12
oz
and
if
one
excersises
due
caution
the
third
great
rich
reddishbrown
color
and
beige
head
both
the
taste
and
aroma
are
just
fantastic
plum
fig
brown
sugar
molasses
without
being
overly
sweet
or
cloying
very
well
balanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
if
i
could
get
this
regularly
itd
probably
wouldnt
be
a
good
thing
purchased
at
local
liquor
store
poured
into
a
tumbler
a
deep
chocolate
with
plush
red
high
lights
tan
head
about
half
inch
thick
some
lacing
and
decent
retention
smells
of
medium
sweet
malt
with
coffee
and
toasted
notes
slightly
nutty
hops
are
present
although
more
in
support
formation
with
some
raison
bread
and
mild
dark
fruit
taste
wonderful
toasted
sweet
malt
immediately
followed
with
balanced
bitterness
imparting
sort
of
a
nutty
dark
chocolate
flavor
how
ever
i
would
not
describe
this
as
syrupy
or
too
thick
on
the
swallow
comes
another
nice
round
bit
of
milky
sweetness
balanced
again
by
mild
bitterns
this
is
a
tasty
scotch
ale
which
i
am
relatively
new
too
but
from
my
experience
thus
far
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
is
well
worth
a
having
around
especially
during
the
winter
months
i
know
ill
buy
it
again
yehve
nary
had
such
a
bonnie
taste
of
heavn
since
pullin
yer
mouth
off
yer
mammys
teet
need
i
say
more
d
i
only
bought
a
single
and
im
glad
i
did
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
and
the
ones
that
predominate
arent
pleasant
i
detected
slight
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
but
was
overwhelmed
by
the
harshness
of
it
if
it
werent
for
the
other
rave
reviews
on
beeradvocate
and
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
named
as
an
exemplar
for
the
style
by
the
bjcp
id
content
myself
to
have
tried
just
this
one
bottle
ill
probably
try
it
again
at
some
point
to
assure
myself
that
i
didnt
just
get
a
bad
batch
i
suspect
this
beer
at
8
3
abv
will
mellow
well
with
age
a
nice
example
for
me
of
how
palates
evolve
i
first
had
this
years
ago
before
id
tried
many
craft
beers
at
all
and
hated
it
thought
it
was
disgusting
now
that
ive
become
more
aware
of
the
characteristics
of
a
quality
beer
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
the
drinkability
as
also
very
good
i
will
seek
this
one
out
prosit
mk
pours
a
beautiful
deep
scarlet
with
thin
white
head
smells
of
nice
medium
bready
malts
tasted
of
bread
and
slight
fruits
i
can
only
compare
it
to
a
twohearted
without
as
much
of
a
hop
presence
still
an
enjoyable
drink
another
good
founders
brew
d
this
is
too
thick
and
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
but
its
wellbalanced
enough
that
the
bottle
went
quicker
than
i
would
have
expected
very
enjoyable
one
of
these
and
im
ok
though
i
wouldnt
readily
drink
more
love
the
creamysyrupy
mouthfeel
but
the
label
tells
no
lies
dirty
bastard
ale
aint
fer
the
wee
lads
drink
slowly
and
with
caution
recommended
for
a
try
d
if
this
is
your
kind
of
style
extremely
drinkable
i
love
it
d
very
drinkable
with
a
beefier
malt
body
that
goes
well
with
these
increasingly
colder
evenings
pours
a
murky
brown
with
some
burgundy
hues
under
a
thin
tan
head
head
quickly
settles
to
a
slick
film
which
persists
throughout
the
glass
the
initial
aroma
is
of
assertive
peat
smoked
malts
followed
by
faint
notes
of
burnt
caramel
candy
dark
wheat
bread
raisins
black
cherries
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
carbonation
is
appropriately
subtle
resulting
in
a
smooth
slightly
oily
and
slick
moutfeel
just
right
for
this
style
initial
flavor
leans
toward
the
sweet
side
presenting
burnt
caramel
brown
sugar
raisins
and
figs
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
hops
and
alcohol
eventually
emerge
in
the
late
palate
and
finish
with
a
fairly
crisp
dry
bitterness
and
ethanol
warmth
kind
of
an
amercanized
hoppy
version
of
the
style
reminiscent
of
old
bert
grants
scotch
ale
but
a
nice
winter
season
beer
appearance
was
a
reddishblack
with
a
nonpersistant
tan
head
odor
was
of
bourboncaramel
which
i
liked
flavor
was
also
that
of
bourbon
and
caramel
i
didnt
feel
that
the
bourbon
flavor
was
overpowering
and
thought
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
the
beer
was
quite
pleasant
drinkability
is
slightly
hampered
from
the
syrup
thickness
and
alcohol
content
but
nothing
quad
lovers
couldnt
easily
handle
slainte
d
the
50
ibus
in
this
beer
help
it
by
cutting
through
the
weight
of
the
beer
which
helps
with
the
drinkability
a
lot
otherwise
one
of
these
would
knock
you
out
very
carbonated
full
body
a
slight
aclohol
burn
lingers
for
a
second
or
two
after
swallowing
but
no
real
aftertaste
the
bitter
end
and
the
abv
makes
this
only
an
average
drinker
for
me
i
owe
this
beer
an
apology
after
a
couple
more
years
of
brewing
and
tasting
experience
i
am
recanting
my
previously
scathing
review
i
do
find
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
much
on
the
big
end
of
the
style
as
far
as
drinkability
i
find
other
wee
heavys
preferable
in
that
way
but
it
is
a
big
rich
and
daring
interpretation
of
the
style
i
was
cold
one
night
and
i
knew
this
would
fix
that
a
very
nice
winter
sipper
careful
with
it
though
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
hiding
deep
down
then
moments
after
you
swallow
the
sip
there
is
a
hop
bitterness
that
shows
up
its
several
seconds
after
you
swallow
though
quite
strange
in
fact
i
subtracted
half
a
point
in
the
taste
on
account
of
this
i
had
originally
placed
it
at
4
0
but
as
i
sipped
this
i
felt
that
while
better
than
average
it
didnt
quite
deserve
4
0
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
has
a
solid
feel
to
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
even
with
its
peculiar
hop
bitterness
in
such
a
malt
dominated
style
thanks
again
ding
d
definitely
not
for
the
wee
lads
d
delightful
and
complex
ruby
brown
color
nice
lacing
from
the
thin
film
that
remains
after
the
smallish
head
dissapears
very
full
caramel
flavor
and
taste
slight
burnt
flavor
in
the
finishing
taste
which
gives
it
a
slight
bitterness
at
first
that
builds
as
you
drink
more
of
the
beer
very
chewy
and
full
mouthfeel
my
first
founders
beer
and
it
did
not
dissapoint
read
the
description
for
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
and
this
is
it
to
a
tee
love
the
description
on
the
bottle
too
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
split
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
with
my
big
brother
our
reading
of
the
bottling
date
is
may
2006
poured
golden
brown
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
aromas
of
fruity
white
wine
that
give
way
to
a
burnt
caramel
im
really
enjoying
these
notes
of
crisp
fruitiness
that
im
finding
in
these
dark
scotch
ales
taste
begins
with
a
bite
from
the
alcohol
flavors
of
nicely
toasted
malt
good
balance
from
a
light
hoppiness
in
the
center
of
the
tongue
clean
dark
finish
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
i
mean
this
as
a
compliment
i
like
this
style
thicker
with
light
carbonation
like
a
very
thin
caramel
very
good
drinkability
although
this
style
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
contrary
to
my
brothers
analysis
i
prefer
founders
to
mcewans
although
both
are
excellent
beers
reminds
me
why
this
style
is
one
of
my
favorites
deciphering
founders
cryptic
dating
system
it
seems
that
this
was
bottled
in
may
poured
into
a
regular
wine
glass
it
came
out
reddish
brown
color
with
a
little
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
slightly
fruity
and
alcoholic
the
taste
was
again
malty
and
sweet
with
a
notable
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
the
alcohol
here
was
apparent
in
the
burn
at
the
end
overall
it
felt
smooth
mostly
it
was
good
but
felt
potent
and
i
couldnt
pack
in
much
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
man
this
is
so
dark
that
if
someone
told
me
it
was
a
stout
and
i
didnt
scrutinize
the
beer
i
would
believe
them
head
is
about
half
a
finger
thick
nose
is
mostly
sweet
caramel
toffee
a
bit
of
smoke
taste
is
much
the
same
but
i
get
a
strange
wheatiness
that
reminds
me
of
a
slice
of
whole
wheat
bread
in
the
start
and
overwhelmingly
in
the
finish
i
really
like
it
and
find
it
fascinating
oh
yeah
theres
also
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
as
well
mouth
is
like
velvet
smeared
with
vaseline
smooth
smooth
and
smooth
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
would
love
to
buy
it
over
and
over
it
isnt
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
but
it
really
does
taste
good
d
this
ones
very
tasty
and
the
type
of
beer
that
makes
you
crave
the
next
sip
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
giving
this
beer
a
5
in
this
category
is
that
its
kind
of
filling
however
its
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
is
it
fair
to
judge
this
against
other
scotch
ales
no
am
i
complaining
no
cheers
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
fitting
name
great
drinker
reminds
me
of
mcewans
purchased
in
bottle
in
menomonee
falls
wi
this
was
a
classic
scotch
ale
much
like
mcewans
if
there
was
ever
a
beer
to
put
hair
on
ones
chest
this
is
probably
it
a
deep
red
color
very
malty
this
beer
tastes
like
some
sort
of
masculinity
that
i
can
only
dream
of
i
had
a
few
beers
before
this
one
but
dirty
bastard
is
the
one
i
will
remember
a
fantastic
brew
very
sweettasting
and
smoky
but
not
overpowering
dirty
bastard
has
a
very
full
mouthfeel
one
can
taste
alcohol
when
you
breathe
in
with
a
mouthful
of
this
stuff
i
would
drink
this
stuff
by
the
gallon
if
my
liver
could
handle
it
highly
recommended
not
a
lasting
aftertaste
to
note
but
the
abv
packs
a
velvet
punch
with
the
swallow
a
nice
beer
that
ill
have
to
repeat
in
the
fall
d
drinkable
this
is
my
first
founders
brew
pretty
tasty
would
recommend
d
all
this
rsults
in
a
high
drinkability
a
great
wee
heavy
founders
got
it
right
only
the
above
average
abv
holds
it
back
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
amber
color
with
a
plumous
off
white
head
amazing
tracing
aromas
of
roasted
grains
sweet
licorice
fusels
just
overall
a
really
rich
impression
a
full
mouthfeel
fills
you
with
flavors
of
raisins
fruity
hops
dark
bitter
chocolate
a
malt
lovers
dream
i
imagine
this
is
a
hoppier
beast
that
your
average
scotch
ale
but
it
delivers
a
delicious
beverage
a
wonderful
beer
at
just
above
room
temp
served
in
a
snifter
i
wish
i
picked
up
more
than
the
single
but
it
will
do
to
make
a
nice
end
to
my
day
pours
a
deceptive
dark
brown
that
reveals
ruby
highlights
under
light
head
of
yellow
cream
dissipates
to
a
soft
ring
aroma
of
chocolate
molasses
and
smoked
peat
taste
is
initially
soft
with
caramel
malts
and
belgian
sweet
malts
the
smoke
hits
briefly
and
is
then
subsumed
under
a
fairly
powerful
alcohol
burn
very
silky
mouthfeel
like
a
thick
oatmeal
stout
quite
a
good
scotch
ale
overall
although
the
burn
does
distract
a
bit
my
first
scotch
ale
when
you
pour
this
beer
you
are
instantly
taken
by
the
dark
black
with
a
hint
of
ruby
coloring
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
the
beer
clings
to
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
aroma
is
strong
toasted
grains
and
malt
with
the
first
drink
you
get
the
toasted
malt
that
you
expected
as
well
as
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
flavor
this
is
quickly
followed
by
the
strong
abv
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
all
in
all
it
was
not
an
unenjoyable
experience
but
i
may
have
realized
that
i
am
not
a
scotch
ale
drinker
this
scottish
style
ale
pours
with
a
head
like
einstein
and
the
brain
of
a
speaknspell
im
mumbling
to
myself
right
now
with
a
bowl
of
salty
tortilla
chips
next
to
me
trying
to
keep
the
burn
from
my
throat
and
the
hot
tremors
from
the
rest
of
my
body
three
parts
propane
and
one
part
shark
liver
this
is
sure
to
rip
your
intestines
to
shreds
like
the
flag
on
a
paddle
boat
in
a
noreaster
i
kind
of
enjoyed
the
first
two
or
three
sips
but
in
a
similar
way
that
one
of
my
old
childhood
friends
did
when
he
got
an
egyptian
eye
tattooed
on
the
side
of
his
head
it
hurts
but
its
a
good
kind
of
pain
needless
to
say
he
was
an
idiot
and
time
has
caught
up
and
taught
me
a
few
lessons
about
practicality
get
a
fire
extinguisher
and
some
rolaids
because
the
whole
town
is
going
to
burn
down
inside
your
body
this
beer
has
flavor
that
is
bigger
and
more
aggressive
than
many
other
scottish
ales
i
have
had
another
great
beer
from
founders
deep
auburn
small
ring
of
tan
foam
big
caramel
toffee
malt
aroma
with
some
dark
fruits
on
display
also
great
finishing
hop
flavors
with
a
very
tasty
and
huge
malt
profile
dark
chocolate
sweet
brown
sugar
vanilla
molasses
burnt
oak
and
a
hint
of
smoke
complex
and
delicious
the
rich
flavors
are
really
quite
incredible
each
one
adds
to
the
unique
taste
the
8
3
abv
is
very
well
masked
which
makes
the
drinkability
insane
also
a
winner
from
founders
and
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
had
fills
the
mouth
effortlessly
and
smoothly
lack
of
head
fools
you
into
expecting
next
to
no
carbonation
but
its
there
in
proper
fairly
weak
proportion
so
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
in
the
cupboard
ill
want
more
ruby
red
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
leaving
spotty
lacing
around
the
glass
toffee
brown
sugar
malted
milk
balls
in
the
nose
malted
milk
balls
up
front
followed
by
toffee
in
the
finish
only
a
bit
of
hop
presence
average
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
wasnt
very
drinkable
split
the
bottle
perhaps
i
will
try
it
again
to
see
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
if
i
will
like
it
better
tried
this
beer
in
a
small
amount
at
a
tasting
and
liked
it
enough
to
buy
a
full
bottle
to
review
quite
brown
in
color
with
not
really
much
of
a
head
looks
about
right
for
a
scotch
ale
nose
is
earthy
and
malty
not
very
strong
nice
flavor
large
abv
is
obvious
but
blended
in
well
with
the
chocolatey
malts
and
caramel
consistency
a
good
example
of
the
style
by
founders
and
i
enjoyed
it
even
though
its
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
it
is
overall
a
good
session
beer
it
is
also
fairly
easy
to
get
drunk
off
of
the
well
hidden
8
3
abv
d
not
bad
i
would
have
actually
liked
it
to
have
been
smokier
but
i
really
enjoyed
to
strawberry
alcohol
esters
it
created
this
is
a
nice
wee
heavy
just
too
much
heavy
for
me
tough
to
drink
has
a
lofty
alcohol
kickback
nice
caramel
taste
to
this
very
heavy
bodied
wee
is
extremely
smooth
til
the
backlash
of
alcohol
kicks
in
i
dont
know
maybe
its
the
style
im
no
accustomed
to
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
medium
full
in
the
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
wash
everything
clean
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
rather
like
cherry
cough
syrup
kind
of
tingles
too
black
licorice
the
peat
tastes
like
it
has
turned
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
tries
to
cling
to
my
teeth
full
body
though
jut
not
so
sure
about
this
beer
overall
the
best
scottish
ale
i
have
had
since
robert
the
bruce
maybe
even
better
i
need
a
side
by
side
tasting
to
decide
try
it
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
watch
out
for
the
8
3
abv
one
of
the
best
non
brewpub
scotch
ales
ive
had
for
such
a
big
beer
its
surprisingly
watery
but
beyond
that
all
the
flavors
are
there
and
in
your
face
a
fantastic
scotch
ale
this
is
a
beer
that
i
come
back
to
time
and
time
again
i
say
it
is
very
drinkable
damn
nice
go
get
it
mmm
yummy
i
think
founders
did
a
really
nice
job
with
this
one
while
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
it
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
pours
a
very
clear
brown
with
minimal
carbonation
and
a
small
head
it
taste
of
roasty
malt
with
caramel
and
toffee
undertones
for
such
a
malt
monster
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
are
minimal
on
the
whole
i
would
say
that
it
is
spot
on
for
the
style
d
no
taste
of
alcohol
but
i
can
feel
it
after
a
pint
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
strong
malt
caramel
and
a
light
touch
of
smoke
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
strong
malt
presence
with
sweet
caramel
with
a
subtle
touch
of
peat
body
is
quite
full
and
carbonation
is
low
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
frighteningly
drinkable
for
me
the
abv
would
slow
me
down
but
id
make
a
good
run
at
it
a
wellexecuted
high
shilling
ale
there
is
just
a
kiss
of
smoky
peat
which
i
find
to
be
the
perfect
amount
in
a
scotch
ale
i
find
too
many
american
versions
of
this
style
tend
to
go
overboard
with
the
peated
malt
this
one
does
not
true
to
style
it
lets
the
malts
take
center
stage
with
the
hops
lending
just
enough
support
to
make
sure
it
isnt
cloying
its
one
of
those
beers
than
you
can
infer
has
a
lot
of
booze
though
you
cant
really
taste
it
that
to
me
just
screams
drinkable
good
beer
id
buy
it
again
and
love
to
have
it
around
the
house
or
at
the
bar
sweet
and
juicy
malt
mouthfeel
strong
hints
of
liquid
candy
sugar
caramel
and
dark
fruits
with
a
thick
malt
backbone
nice
hop
presence
on
the
finish
much
hoppier
than
most
wee
heavy
beers
that
ive
had
extremely
drinkable
at
a
surprising
8
3
abv
a
nice
scotch
but
not
one
i
would
rush
to
find
again
despite
my
score
a
slight
disappointment
to
me
as
i
expected
this
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
wee
heavys
brownish
barleywine
appearance
aroma
whaffing
of
alcohol
also
barleywineish
and
some
spice
and
roast
taste
well
balanced
though
followed
by
tongue
numbness
hops
at
finish
with
roast
very
well
malted
some
sweet
rather
than
bitter
chocolate
and
cinammon
and
a
touch
of
smoke
and
an
easy
drink
d
superb
drinkability
incredibly
well
disguised
alcohol
content
i
had
no
idea
it
was
an
8
beer
until
i
read
it
herecould
be
dangerous
goes
down
incredibly
smoothly
and
begs
for
another
to
replace
it
drinkability
yes
all
day
long
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
8
3
been
featured
as
the
beer
of
the
month
at
my
bar
and
i
can
put
away
more
than
a
few
without
complaint
a
good
everyday
colder
weather
beer
overall
an
enjoyable
scotch
ale
as
usual
its
a
shame
i
cant
buy
it
around
here
drinkability
a
very
good
wee
heavy
though
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
the
appearance
is
brown
like
a
dark
hazy
undercarbonated
root
beer
the
smell
is
sweet
and
like
a
weak
version
of
the
sam
adams
triple
bock
scaring
me
immediately
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
compared
to
what
the
aroma
prepares
you
for
it
has
a
tomoto
taste
on
the
front
palatte
and
a
chocolate
taste
on
the
back
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
definitely
the
most
drinkable
beer
with
bastard
in
the
name
that
i
have
come
across
it
is
also
quite
drinkable
for
its
high
alcohol
content
at
the
same
time
i
probably
wont
buy
this
beer
again
a
deadon
american
interpretation
of
the
style
verdict
auch
laddie
okay
the
label
is
pretty
cheesy
with
the
caricature
of
a
scotsman
on
it
and
the
scotchtalk
it
aint
fer
the
wee
lads
on
the
neck
but
i
like
this
beer
its
a
tasty
hefty
brew
drinkability
not
my
favorite
scotch
ale
but
pretty
drinkable
id
rather
have
a
belhaven
nice
full
bodied
beer
with
great
complexity
and
flavor
alcohol
is
well
subdued
as
well
probably
my
favorite
scotch
ale
so
far
but
not
even
close
to
my
favorite
style
of
beer
another
wonderful
beer
from
the
folks
at
founders
music
caukazoid
germ
by
sixtoo
this
beer
pours
a
bubbly
brown
with
a
thin
sparse
head
that
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
has
lots
of
biscuit
and
toast
aromas
along
with
some
date
and
raisin
notes
it
tastes
great
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
bread
chocolate
and
fruit
with
the
first
taste
the
carbonation
is
quite
crisp
but
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
will
definitely
have
another
when
the
opportunity
arises
another
great
beer
from
founders
anyway
i
digress
its
an
ok
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
however
look
forward
to
many
more
wee
heavies
in
my
future
drinkabilitynotes
ii
was
very
impressed
with
this
brew
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
got
the
world
should
have
known
better
considering
it
is
a
founders
beer
12
ounce
bottle
founders
dirty
bastard
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
inch
of
tan
head
very
sweet
butterscotch
aroma
caramel
and
fruit
flavor
with
some
bubblegum
overly
sweet
a
little
sour
some
woodchip
flavor
comes
in
at
the
finish
and
makes
the
beer
a
little
smoky
mouthfeel
is
full
drinkability
suffers
a
little
from
the
sweetness
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
really
like
the
bubblegum
flavor
i
was
a
bit
worried
because
of
the
high
carbonation
that
the
beer
was
infected
but
i
dont
get
any
of
that
in
the
taste
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
i
get
a
note
reminiscent
of
rum
in
the
finish
both
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
and
the
fermented
distilled
molasses
flavor
this
is
quit
a
tasty
beer
and
unlike
some
of
their
other
high
octane
offerings
this
one
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
despite
being
a
malt
bomb
nice
smooth
full
body
but
not
much
carbonation
overall
a
nice
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
make
this
a
drinkable
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
with
a
nice
bite
in
the
finish
body
is
fairly
full
and
coats
the
mouth
well
i
couldnt
or
wouldnt
want
to
manage
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
or
at
all
unfortunately
this
ones
kind
of
a
miss
from
founders
uncharacteristicly
of
their
other
beers
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
has
a
very
smooth
chewy
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
tasty
but
it
seems
to
have
an
identity
crisis
it
is
a
porter
ina
scotch
ale
bottle
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
like
rogue
dead
guy
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
row
but
i
will
make
sure
there
are
a
few
in
my
beer
fridge
at
all
times
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
scotch
ales
ive
had
just
fantastic
edit
i
think
i
reviewed
this
as
a
ba
neophyte
as
ive
really
grown
attached
to
it
in
recent
years
i
find
myself
getting
it
whenever
i
can
either
trade
or
travel
for
it
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
on
par
with
old
chub
best
name
ever
though
it
should
be
said
pours
a
murky
brown
in
my
glass
moderate
head
that
vanishes
quickly
not
a
ton
of
aroma
some
carmel
notes
there
though
taste
is
earthy
and
smoky
a
nice
blend
nice
body
lightly
carbonated
enough
but
not
overpowering
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
not
great
but
pretty
good
overall
a
very
good
wee
heavy
tons
of
flavors
and
complexity
i
have
to
wonder
why
i
havent
bought
more
founders
brews
in
the
past
when
i
have
had
the
chance
i
wont
pass
them
up
in
the
future
after
this
one
awesome
the
mouthfeel
is
heavybodied
but
not
quite
as
heavy
as
their
russian
imperial
stout
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
a
little
warm
at
8
3
which
i
gladly
welcome
the
drinkability
is
fine
for
maybe
a
couple
of
these
but
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
them
all
night
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
the
high
abv
is
certainly
noted
but
i
think
on
the
whole
it
gives
the
beer
a
very
good
sipping
quality
this
is
not
a
brew
to
drink
all
night
but
a
couple
suffice
nicely
cloudy
dishwater
murk
alternately
a
muddy
brown
and
a
tawny
red
complexity
in
the
appearance
hell
yeah
big
foamy
head
in
the
snifter
and
carbonation
rivalling
a
dry
irish
stout
nose
is
rum
soaked
butterscotch
and
caramelyou
must
let
this
beer
warm
to
bring
out
the
true
nose
and
flavors
taste
is
malty
sweet
up
front
with
more
of
the
caramel
coating
giving
it
a
fuller
mouthfeel
there
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
on
the
end
to
tell
you
that
this
is
american
again
this
comes
out
after
it
warms
a
bit
too
drinkable
to
be
8
3
another
excellent
american
take
on
the
scotch
ale
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
tried
by
founders
that
i
do
not
particularly
care
for
its
okay
but
only
a
tad
above
average
in
most
categories
the
color
is
a
good
brownish
amber
no
head
no
lace
slightly
flat
smell
is
malty
and
there
are
some
woody
hop
essences
all
the
smells
are
present
on
the
tongue
too
but
when
you
compare
this
against
a
robert
the
bruce
as
an
example
there
is
no
comparison
this
one
is
a
minor
leaguer
overall
this
beer
is
loud
and
in
your
face
but
i
like
it
good
for
when
your
looking
for
something
to
punch
you
around
a
bit
overall
pretty
nice
beer
balanced
flavors
with
smooth
feeling
and
roasted
malt
taste
nice
change
from
what
ive
been
drinking
lately
poured
dark
brown
from
growler
thin
head
with
lace
malt
alcohol
and
a
chocolate
nose
taste
is
a
mix
of
malty
chocolate
toffie
and
a
hint
of
smoke
mixed
with
alcohol
my
guess
is
wyeast
1728
for
the
yeast
a
bit
thin
feeling
at
first
with
a
malty
thick
finish
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
scottishwee
heavy
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
scottish
heavys
i
have
sampled
here
in
michigan
overall
my
hats
off
to
nate
and
the
staff
at
founders
you
have
a
winner
here
this
would
be
a
beer
to
have
again
as
a
sipping
beverage
like
wine
or
liquor
after
dinner
in
6oz
glasses
nice
of
course
id
prefer
a
stout
or
porter
but
man
a
good
beer
to
sit
down
and
really
enjoy
but
not
for
a
session
thank
you
good
night
and
always
get
the
cheese
course
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
tan
head
the
recedes
quickly
the
aroma
is
strong
and
relaxing
huge
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
alcohol
peaking
through
the
taste
is
malty
chocolatey
buttery
and
huge
all
around
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
more
than
medium
bodied
but
not
as
smooth
as
a
scotch
ale
can
be
overall
the
is
a
damn
good
brew
recomended
to
all
drinkability
alcohol
fairly
well
hidden
this
beer
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
that
lets
only
a
little
light
through
the
head
is
thick
fluffy
and
light
brown
it
fades
very
slowly
leaving
very
thick
laces
this
beer
had
a
malty
aroma
i
can
slightly
detect
an
alcohol
aroma
it
also
smells
of
caramel
this
beer
has
a
strong
malty
flavor
the
alcohol
makes
an
appearence
in
the
flavor
slightly
warming
my
throat
as
it
goes
down
it
has
a
slight
caramel
taste
the
hops
also
make
an
appearence
in
the
taste
the
hop
flavor
is
very
subtle
the
roasted
malts
are
the
most
noticable
flavor
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
it
is
full
bodied
the
carbonation
is
just
right
this
beer
might
not
make
the
best
session
beer
it
is
slightly
high
in
alcohol
so
you
might
not
be
able
to
drink
many
bottles
the
flavor
however
is
not
all
that
aggressive
so
you
might
be
able
to
enjoy
a
few
bottles
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
probably
keep
at
least
one
or
two
of
there
in
my
refrigerator
if
i
could
get
this
beer
in
san
diego
thank
you
karst
for
as
usual
sending
me
a
winner
the
beer
is
remarkable
smooth
and
slides
down
the
throat
with
a
sense
of
heaviness
that
is
not
too
intense
the
high
abv
is
hidden
very
well
its
only
presence
is
in
the
warmth
of
the
tummy
this
is
a
great
wee
heavy
that
hits
the
spot
reddish
brown
colour
mostly
clear
very
light
brown
head
that
sticks
around
very
malty
aroma
with
a
moderate
hoppiness
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
nearing
the
level
of
a
barleywine
theres
really
not
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
flavour
malty
sweetness
with
plenty
of
caramel
and
toffee
moderate
bitterness
with
a
malty
finish
full
bodied
low
carbonation
smooth
texture
and
slightly
drying
from
the
grain
this
is
a
really
good
beer
highly
drinkable
with
plenty
of
high
quality
malt
and
hops
another
winner
from
founders
pours
a
beautiful
ambergarnet
red
with
a
half
inch
creamy
tan
head
that
dies
quickly
nose
is
rich
scotchy
alcohol
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
heady
stuff
taste
is
almost
identical
to
lake
louies
warped
speed
scotch
ale
which
is
a
good
thing
rich
caramel
malts
and
pungent
scotch
which
explodes
into
the
sinuses
as
you
exhale
this
stuff
packs
a
punch
at
8
3
and
you
can
tell
the
alcohol
is
woody
and
aged
like
scotch
so
its
not
offputting
at
all
this
is
a
sipper
thats
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
with
a
nice
bite
a
treat
for
the
nose
and
the
mouth
equally
pours
a
hazy
redbrown
nice
head
that
goes
quick
and
lots
of
lace
smell
is
very
basic
hops
and
malt
not
complex
but
very
balanced
and
smells
great
the
malt
smells
really
deep
taste
is
sweet
malt
up
front
burnt
bread
some
floral
hops
and
a
bitter
finish
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
perfect
excellent
beer
thanks
drjay
it
came
with
a
very
nice
short
but
steady
and
well
retained
head
that
left
lacing
as
i
sipped
my
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
beer
itself
was
a
deep
brown
with
a
reddish
tinge
i
smelled
sweet
and
roasty
malts
with
this
one
dirty
bastard
tasted
like
strong
malts
that
smoothly
transition
to
a
dry
hopiness
that
finishes
off
the
palat
with
a
little
bit
of
the
alcohol
poking
through
at
the
finish
but
not
merely
as
much
as
i
expected
with
this
high
of
an
abv
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
heavy
side
but
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
and
something
that
ild
pick
up
some
other
time
when
the
weather
gets
colder
i
am
offically
old
now
as
i
have
forsaken
carnal
pleasures
with
my
fiance
on
my
birthday
in
favor
of
a
series
of
malty
beers
looks
like
a
porter
or
a
stout
very
dark
with
a
modicum
of
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
small
appropriately
dirty
head
smells
of
burntroasted
coffee
and
chocolate
theres
a
nice
dark
chocolate
smell
and
taste
to
this
beer
tastes
pretty
bitter
and
alcoholic
but
not
unpleasantly
so
the
mouthfeel
takes
a
hit
from
the
burn
of
the
alcohol
which
isnt
hidden
especially
well
a
good
companion
to
the
breakfast
stout
another
outstaninding
offering
from
the
founders
folks
definately
need
to
stop
over
at
the
taprom
and
try
this
draught
but
not
too
many
ill
never
be
able
to
make
it
home
i
did
a
complete
reversal
on
drinkability
finding
this
most
enjoyable
after
some
initial
shock
if
you
see
this
give
it
a
try
it
is
truly
exceptional
dark
slightly
ruby
brown
i
coudnt
coax
too
much
of
a
head
out
of
this
malty
aromas
prevail
with
toffee
and
buttery
ripe
dark
fruits
raisin
mostly
at
times
i
pick
up
a
pumpernickel
smell
some
caramel
as
it
warms
juicy
malt
and
toffee
dominate
the
taste
a
fruitiness
sort
of
like
apple
cider
a
faint
spiced
flavor
goes
a
long
with
it
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
peaty
flavor
to
be
found
here
but
it
is
covered
up
a
lot
by
some
of
the
rich
malt
flavors
some
bitterness
balances
things
out
some
caramel
and
chocolate
come
out
in
the
taste
with
some
warmth
full
rich
mouthfeel
lends
itself
well
to
the
flavors
good
drinkability
for
relatively
high
alcohol
a
good
sipping
beer
and
a
solid
scotch
ale
id
like
to
see
some
more
peat
in
here
though
another
nice
beer
from
founders
poured
out
to
a
amber
burnt
red
color
with
low
carbonation
and
a
short
lived
head
minute
traces
of
lace
were
noted
scent
is
slighly
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
brew
is
all
in
the
flavor
first
sip
and
you
are
pummled
with
an
array
of
flavors
malt
sweetness
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
smoke
like
finish
quite
impressive
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
overly
sticky
and
syrupy
for
me
and
seeming
quite
thick
finished
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
somewhat
reminded
me
of
a
grand
cru
recommended
for
fans
of
the
scotch
ale
style
drinkability
is
very
good
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
i
have
had
even
if
my
score
doesnt
indicate
it
love
the
guys
at
founders
most
of
the
stuff
from
them
has
been
very
nice
indeed
wish
i
could
buy
this
stuff
locally
man
i
could
spend
500
and
12
hours
to
road
trip
just
to
buy
founders
stuff
want
to
thank
merlin48
yet
again
for
another
great
sample
finishes
warm
and
sticky
drinkable
as
a
sippin
brew
very
similar
to
a
liquor
or
scotch
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
pretty
thin
offwhite
headbig
bold
aromas
of
butter
and
brown
sugar
with
some
whiskey
notes
in
there
as
well
the
alcohol
is
very
prevelant
flavors
of
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
are
big
here
with
some
caramel
just
adding
to
the
sweetness
but
this
is
fine
for
the
style
a
big
malt
bomb
for
sure
here
a
warmer
a
sipping
beer
alcohol
makes
itself
known
for
sure
i
have
to
stop
now
or
i
wont
see
the
ending
of
revenge
of
the
sith
i
picked
up
a
six
pask
of
this
american
made
scotch
ale
at
sams
wine
on
butterfiled
in
downers
grove
right
off
the
bat
the
smell
from
the
bottle
is
rich
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
the
first
taste
is
computed
by
my
brain
is
coffee
with
a
quickly
depleting
toffee
aftertaste
one
rule
of
thumb
i
apply
to
moutfeel
is
its
chugability
not
implying
that
i
chug
every
beer
i
try
but
to
get
an
idea
if
this
beer
is
something
that
lends
itself
to
be
guzzled
easily
this
beer
is
not
condusive
to
chugging
the
name
beer
advocate
gives
as
an
alternate
name
for
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
which
fits
this
beer
very
well
a
strong
coffee
like
taste
covers
up
any
hint
of
alcohol
but
since
its
flavor
is
so
heavy
you
can
only
drink
a
couple
of
them
before
you
get
full
of
this
great
american
made
scotch
ale
really
getting
into
this
brewery
after
trying
their
black
rye
ive
been
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
their
other
stuff
this
is
another
solid
offering
pours
a
deep
but
clear
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
pretty
good
head
that
sticks
aroudn
for
a
while
a
real
strong
bourbon
smell
coming
from
this
one
nice
its
present
in
the
taste
as
well
but
it
isnt
overwhelming
as
it
mixes
nicely
with
all
the
sweet
flavors
this
beer
has
to
offer
nice
toffee
malts
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
as
some
raisins
and
a
slight
very
slight
smoked
feel
very
warming
this
is
great
right
now
may
but
would
be
even
better
on
a
cold
winter
evening
when
youre
snowed
in
slick
and
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
but
still
pretty
drinkable
at
8
3
an
interesting
brew
from
a
company
that
tends
to
produce
some
pretty
unique
stuff
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
drinkability
is
rated
lower
because
it
just
didnt
meet
my
image
of
a
scotch
ale
as
much
so
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
as
readily
as
say
a
sam
adams
scotch
ale
nice
brew
a
real
delight
and
very
much
recommended
comes
on
a
bit
strong
definitely
a
sipper
very
tasty
though
i
wouldnt
mind
another
wee
glass
the
taste
is
just
about
on
par
with
the
scent
you
get
the
caramels
and
roasted
tastes
mingled
with
an
apple
cider
like
base
brown
sugar
finish
with
a
dryness
that
could
either
be
alcohol
or
hopping
or
a
mixture
of
both
flavours
cover
the
alcohol
accents
very
well
but
one
can
definitely
sense
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
content
this
is
a
good
beer
it
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
flavour
though
overall
i
would
like
to
have
jut
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
the
hopping
seems
to
be
good
but
could
benefit
from
a
more
intense
sweetness
to
make
this
thing
a
smoothly
balanced
beast
it
just
seems
to
be
missing
thickness
or
something
still
the
odb
is
a
good
mofo
somewhat
muddy
brown
in
color
hazy
little
to
no
head
very
low
aromawhat
i
do
get
has
a
wet
towel
smell
to
it
not
sour
but
something
wet
or
stale
malty
flavorsome
notes
of
licorice
and
caramel
nice
sweetness
behind
it
all
very
nice
full
body
for
the
style
an
ok
beer
im
a
tad
dissappointed
as
the
other
founders
products
i
have
had
have
all
been
outstanding
perhaps
this
was
out
of
date
this
is
a
definate
try
again
beer
to
see
if
my
opinion
holds
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
i
love
scotch
ales
and
i
dont
think
there
are
enough
of
them
out
there
although
i
do
get
sick
of
explaining
to
my
friends
that
it
doesnt
mean
they
put
whiskey
in
the
beer
i
am
always
excited
to
find
this
one
on
the
shelf
slàinte
drinkability
tasty
and
eaasily
habitforming
full
bodied
ok
drinkability
the
full
taste
and
abv
would
have
me
looking
for
something
else
after
a
couple
thanks
to
brewedlyhooked13
for
this
12
oz
bottle
founders
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
this
wee
heavy
doesnt
disappoint
dirty
bastard
pours
a
hazy
deep
burnt
orange
body
with
a
very
small
beige
head
that
quickly
vanishes
leaving
only
a
few
spots
of
patch
lace
aroma
is
complex
and
inviting
big
malty
notes
of
toffee
maple
syrup
and
molasses
are
complimented
by
a
touch
of
charred
wood
and
some
prominent
hop
notes
of
spruce
pine
and
citrusy
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
bodied
almost
chewy
with
somewhat
low
carbonation
taste
is
plenty
malty
for
the
style
with
caramel
toffee
and
molasses
lots
of
burnt
and
roasty
malt
flavors
as
well
as
a
note
of
smoked
almonds
surprisingly
tart
with
grapefruit
and
pine
cone
hops
that
suggest
some
cascades
hops
in
the
mix
some
green
apple
notes
add
to
the
tartness
alcohol
is
very
well
concealed
malt
character
reasserts
toward
the
finish
but
this
one
is
very
well
balanced
overall
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
an
interesting
take
on
a
scotch
wee
heavy
that
works
for
me
this
scotch
ale
poured
a
cloudy
teacolored
brown
with
tan
foam
that
settled
flat
the
smell
was
caramel
malty
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
the
taste
was
very
nice
malty
caramel
light
sweetness
and
only
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
full
body
and
modest
carbonation
the
caramel
malt
flavor
lingered
pleasantly
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
it
was
somewhat
unusual
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
in
that
it
was
less
sweet
than
many
scotch
ales
that
i
have
sampled
this
has
a
nice
overall
body
for
a
scotch
ale
but
lacks
something
i
think
i
was
looking
for
a
greater
malt
flavor
something
a
little
deeper
fuller
dirty
bastard
is
a
litlte
hoppier
than
i
expected
too
if
i
was
in
the
mood
id
probably
seek
this
out
again
murky
brown
body
that
reveals
violetruby
highlights
in
the
light
capped
by
a
creamy
light
sandy
head
laces
the
glass
nicely
aromas
of
sweetish
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
rich
smoky
peaty
accent
and
a
whiff
of
scotchy
alcohol
rich
sugary
malt
up
front
along
with
dark
fruits
plums
and
chocolate
light
smoky
character
throughout
tanninlike
bitterness
leads
into
a
bitter
woody
finish
with
residual
brown
sugar
sweetness
big
thick
full
creamy
exquisite
feel
a
nice
beer
and
unlike
most
scotch
ales
ive
had
i
always
look
forward
to
a
founders
brew
i
havent
tried
as
they
have
always
impressed
me
appears
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
small
cap
of
tan
foam
floating
on
top
the
foamy
topping
dissipates
fairly
quickly
leaving
some
scattering
of
lace
to
decorate
the
glass
malty
sweetness
fills
your
nose
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
fruits
notes
really
stand
out
as
this
warms
pleasant
but
a
bit
simple
overall
chocolate
covered
fruits
are
tasted
first
before
a
hint
of
alcohol
there
are
roasty
malt
notes
as
well
finishes
with
a
roasty
chocolate
sweetness
about
a
medium
body
though
a
little
thin
but
smooth
easy
drinking
stuff
here
tasty
brew
that
i
could
easily
drink
several
off
but
not
quite
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
style
thanks
for
sharing

ummm
hmmm
dirty
bastard
indeed
poured
a
great
hazy
brownruby
red
with
a
lite
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipated
unfortunately
however
the
taste
was
superb
great
caramel
malt
was
that
some
scotch
whisky
start
with
a
lite
hop
finish
whoo
a
medium
texture
that
chewed
a
little
bit
got
a
nice
alcohol
glow
gonna
look
for
more
founders
varieties
in
the
future
and
would
luv
to
see
some
more
d
b
scotch
ale
in
my
fridge
thanks
for
the
brewski
moesizlak
this
has
a
sweet
malty
nose
with
some
bubblegum
in
the
taste
coupled
with
dark
malt
flavors
with
raisin
overtones
it
has
a
thick
mouthfeel
and
is
on
the
sweet
side
the
carbonation
in
this
is
abundant
and
contributes
to
a
nice
mouthfeel
the
hops
impart
a
bitterness
to
the
beer
that
cannot
offset
the
sweetness
it
is
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
pours
a
murky
copper
with
a
frothy
dirty
looking
head
nice
head
retention
on
this
one
smells
alcoholic
and
of
caramel
taste
is
caramel
and
toffee
followed
by
a
blast
of
grassy
hop
bitterness
and
finishes
off
with
some
warming
alcohol
to
it
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
and
good
for
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
for
being
8
overall
a
solid
scotch
founders
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a
solid
all
around
good
brew
not
my
favorite
style
and
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
this
is
a
nice
well
made
beer
had
this
one
based
on
the
amusing
name
im
sure
im
not
the
first
nor
the
last
anyway
it
poured
with
a
mostly
brown
body
and
a
very
thin
layer
of
head
that
produced
a
surprising
amount
of
lace
my
first
reaction
was
how
huge
chewy
and
full
bodied
the
mouthfeel
was
there
is
a
nice
candied
malt
flavor
that
waltzes
nicely
with
a
brandylike
quality
the
real
beauty
is
in
the
finish
it
starts
with
sweet
licorice
intermingled
with
faint
grape
and
woody
notes
ultimately
there
is
just
enough
balancing
bitterness
deep
in
the
palate
really
an
awesome
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
idle
question
are
founders
and
dragonmead
using
the
same
yeasts
is
there
a
cultural
underpinning
to
the
shared
sweetness
of
their
styles
a
bit
raw
with
its
grainy
alcohol
and
it
has
its
moments
both
pro
and
con
but
regardless
this
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
from
the
bottle
poured
a
nice
dark
ruby
with
a
tan
head
aroma
malts
caramels
light
smoke
hints
of
raisins
and
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
enjoyed
the
aroma
of
this
one
flavor
mlats
raisins
caramels
chocolte
toffee
and
some
cheeries
this
was
a
good
beer
many
thanks
to
the
man
cokes
himself
for
my
first
sample
of
founders
theyre
off
to
a
good
start
with
me
what
a
great
scotch
ale
malty
and
roasty
very
smooth
brew
a
little
peppery
with
a
slight
soy
flavor
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
little
head
didnt
notice
much
lacing
so
there
was
nothing
exceptional
about
the
appearance
alcohol
content
is
noticable
and
had
a
nice
warming
effect
not
a
beer
youd
want
to
sit
down
and
finish
a
whole
six
pack
of
a
nice
domestic
craft
brew
highly
recommended
nice
rich
flavors
with
an
attractive
spicy
touch
good
times
had
by
all
just
tasty
all
the
way
came
is
a
short
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
a
nice
quote
on
the
neck
putting
me
in
the
mood
for
the
experience
the
beer
poured
dark
red
with
an
inch
thick
head
on
top
lacing
was
top
notch
the
aroma
was
malty
and
dusty
with
some
floral
hops
peeking
through
the
taste
was
sweet
raisins
cherries
and
chocolate
nutty
and
smoky
the
bitterness
was
minimal
and
the
aftertaste
was
clean
the
mouthfeel
was
chewy
with
a
tongue
coating
stickiness
a
nice
soothing
beer
for
a
damp
and
dark
winters
night
drinkability
suffers
some
just
because
the
alcohol
is
not
shy
about
making
its
presence
known
good
stuff
definitely
something
to
warm
the
cockles
in
the
winter
poured
a
semihazy
burnt

initially
monstrous

finally
settled
down
to
a

level

notes
of
dark

flavor
is

but
tempered
somewhat
by

ma
not
bad
but
not
interesting
either
definitely
below
average
not
worth
another
shot
founders
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
dirty
bastard
has
done
nothing
but
move
them
farther
up
the
list
if
you
like
scotch
ales
or
just
like
big
rich
interesting
delicious
beer
then
you
have
to
seek
this
one
out
mouthfeel
is
quite
pleasant
and
there
is
surprising
drinkability
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
and
maltiness
the
hop
level
isnt
to
style
but
it
makes
it
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
more
interesting
and
really
improves
the
drinkability
nice
noveau
strong
scottish
i
dont
know
but
after
a
six
pack
its
pretty
damn
tough
to
finish
just
one
bottle
its
mean
to
compare
but
this
is
a
rough
mix
compared
to
say
orkney
skullsplitter
a
nice
beer
to
have
everyone
once
in
awhile
but
a
real
mouthkicker
that
slows
the
quaffing
down
appearance
pours
a
thick
murky
mahogany
brown
with
a
big
creamy
tan
head
leaves
behind
scattered
specks
of
lacing

deep
roasty
caramel
notes
touch
of

flavored
scotch

ripened

the

a
scotch

should
be

gets
even
better
as
it
warms

allowing
full
enjoyment
of
all
the
flavor
this
brew
has
to
offer
drinkability
decent
one
at
a
time
brew
definitely
wouldnt
mind
more
access
to
some
of
the
founders
lineup
a
dark
brown
ale
with
amber
hints
has
a
very
small
dark
beige
head
that
leaves
a
small
bit
of
lace
there
is
a
nice
caramel
toffee
sweetness
to
the
aroma
maybe
even
a
light
hint
of
smoke
in
the
aroma
also
molasses
licorice
roasted

all
jump
all
over
your
tongue
a
nice
sweet
carmel

flavor
sits
down
on
the

of
your
tongue
for
a
smooth
warm
finish
much
thanks
to
tikigodxxx
for
sharing
this
grand
rapids
treasure
with
me
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
being
made
in
the
midwest
it
stands
tall
next
to
three
floyds
robert
the
bruce
which
i
think
is
a
good
point
of
comparison
thicker
and
more
achoholic
tasting
but
less
chocolately
and
complex
its
really
too
close
to
call
between
the
bobby
the
bruce
and
the
odb
either
way
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
which
is
able
to
keep
a
high
level
of
drinkability
despite
the
booze
taste
by
compensating
with
a
velvety
mouthfeel
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
two
finger
head
that
lasted
a
bit
then
dissipated
into
great
lacing
smell
is
heavy
on
the
malt
but
with
distinct
fruity
quality
somewhat
like
cherries
and
plums
initial
sweetness
lasted
through
midpalate
and
the
drifted
into
a
light
slightly
dry
and
bitter
finish
that
lasted
and
left
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
for
the
high
abv
quite
drinkable
although
a
couple
would
mellow
one
out
quite
nicely
alos
definitely
let
this
one
warm
up
it
improved
greatly
as
it
warmed
poured
into
an
imperial
pint

12
tan

above
the
murky
reddish
brown

head
showed
reasonable
retention
and
laces
with
a
layer
foam
pretty
much
wherever
it
has
been
aroma
is
a
sweetly
malty
with
an
alcohol
undercurrent
as
expected
taste
follows
the
nose
heavily
malty
and
the
alcohol
packs
quite
a
punch
on
the
back
of
the
throat
a
bit
overboard
in
that
department
for
me
mouthfeel
is
okay
as
i
said
the
alcohol
character
could
be
abit
more
subdued
but
it
grows
on
you
or
numbs
you
perhaps
the
drinkability
is
good
enough
to
convince
you
drink
more
than
you
probably
need
big
bold
smooth
intense
malt
drips
all
over
the
tongue
some
fruity
accents
weave
in
and
out
and
hints
of
chocolate
come
out
as
it
warms
just
the
slightest
kiss
of
hops
balance
quite
nicely

danks

pours
a
nice
deep
amber
to
brown
liquid
with
a
white
foamy
head
the
head
on
this
beer
stayed
for
a
long
time
and
there
was
a
great
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
like
a
toasted
malt
and
not
a
whole
lot
alse
nice
toasty
to
roasted
malt
leaving
almost
a
toffe
like
taste
very
little
bitterness
and
not
much
hop
presence
in
this
this
one
is
all
about
the
malt
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
scottishscotch
ale
pretty
drinkable
and
easy
to
enjoy
notes
this
seemed
like
a
fine
americanized
scottish
style
of
beer
it
seemed
a
bit
too
roasty
to
me
and
less
heavy
on
the
caramel
of
the
malt
but
its
definately
a
good
beer

bad
for
an

brew
a
fair
american
representation
of
a
scotch
ale
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
at
all
especially
for
scotch
whiskey
lovers
who
would
appreciate
the
very
peaty
smoked
character
to
it
i
personally
prefer
mine
a
bit
more
sweet
but
this
isnt
bad
at
all
and
i
would
have
this
one
again
thank
you
to
trbeer
for
the
beer
theres
a
bit
less
smell
associated
with
db
than
i
would
have
thought
for
such
a
strong
malty
brew
but
the
flavor
this
is
immediately
recognizable
as
a
scotch
ale
as
you
taste
the
sweet
malts
and
thinly
masked
alcohol
i
was
reminded
of
southern
comfort
as
i
took
more
sips
sweetness
malts
and
alcohol
if
you
dont
like
those
flavors
then
step

the

long
and
deepthe
only
way
to
stop
the
delightful
lingering
flavor
would
be
to
get
out
some
grub
i
can
see
this
standing
up
to
something
rich
and
meatyperhaps
a
dry
aged
hanger
steak
accompanied
by
some
fries
and
a
side
of
super
fresh
crispy
vegies
of
choice
or
maybe
a
beef
stew
with
plenty
of
potato
pea
and
carrot
a
great
choice
for
a
winter
warmer
drinkable
but
you
wouldnt
spend
all
night
with
it
a
solid
beer
given
to
me
by
jahnoth
thanks
there
is
a
thin
and
slightly
mouthfeel
to
the
brew
but
personally
that
doesnt
effect
the
drinkability
too
much
this
a
keeper
one
to
be
enjoyed
during
its
seasonal
run
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
hue
with
a
white
head
a
very
nice
deep
maltiness
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
thrown
in
to
provide
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
a
little
bit
more
than
i
hav
tasted
in
this
style
of
beer
before
but
it
does
not
really
seem
out
of
place
nice
caramelly
maltiness
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
saw
the
name
on
this
one
and
a
i
couldnt
pass
it
up
im
a
sucker
for
offensive
marketing
i
guess
pours

color
with
a
moderate
brown

the
aroma
was
very
sweet
a
bit
of
caramel
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
very
sweet
like
the
aroma
but
not
too
sweet
the
maltiness
is
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
the
alcohol
and
a
tiny
bit
of
the
vanilla
this
was
an
interesting

thus
avoids
a
cloying

is
both
satiating
and
appetizing
my
belly
craves
more
with
a
firmer
body
this
could
be
top
notch
an
impressive
find
ng
on
rare
occasions
i
find
a
beer
that
has
as
its
major
attribute
the
aroma
that
it
provides
such
is
the
case
with
dirty
bastard
a
lovely
strong
ale
that
provides
volumes
of
rich
malty
aroma
with
a
faint
whiff
of
the
hops
presence
a
lovely
brew
to
look
at
as
well
its
hazy
red
hues
are
quite
warming
to
behold
the
flavor
is
of
the
malt
richness
but
it
also
provides
a
surprising
level
of
hop
bitterness
i
was
at
once
surprised
and
delighted
by
the
beer
after
having
my
palate
set
up
by
two
hoppy
offering
just
before
it
the
fullness
of
this
malty
brew
countered
their
light
bodiedness
quite
well
the
feel
is
rich
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
hampered
rather
more
by
the
fullness
of
its
body
than
by
its
high
abv
its
great
to
see
founders
in
ohio
one
if
not
my
favorite
michigan
brewer
a
wee
heavy
scotch
on
thisone
but
a
nice
warm
youup
brew
it
pours
a
dark
burgandy
deep
red
with
a
thick
pillowtop
off
white
head
with
super
lace
thick
sticky
not
a
strong
aroma
just
a
hint
of
a
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
for
a
scotch
its
floral
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
malt
the
mouth
is
left
with
a
floral
hopoil
coat
while
a
slight
alcohol
dryness
or
bitter
settle
in
a
good
drinkable
strong
ale
though
a
bit
bitter
than
others
of
this
style
a
good
find
for
winter
cellar
stock
the
body
is
rubied
leather
topped
by
a
fading
crown
of
buttered
straw
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
faded
khaki
with
an
oddly
strongly
yellow
tint
the
aroma
is
nicely
malty
but
it
hints
that
this
is
a
bit
old
still
a
beer
this
old
shouldnt
have
too
much
of
a
problem
surviving
the
flavor
is
brown
sugar
and
leaf
litter
and
a
surprising
amount
of
hop
bitterness
for
a
scotch
unfortunately
theres
a
bit
of
a
metallic
nature
about
the
hops
that
i
find
slightly
unpleasant
this
beer
does
not
really
resemble
most
scotch
ales
the
alcohol
taste
which
is
predominate
in
most
scotch
ales
ive
tried
isnt
even
there
what
i
do
taste
though
is
something
good
a
pretty
thick
body
to
this
one
that
starts
out
with
a
malty
brown
sugar
type
sweetness
its
followed
up
by
an
onslaught
of
malts
hops
and
spices
i
taste
a
bready
chewy
texture
in
this
one
it
finishes
with
more
of
that
brown
sugar
sweetness
much
sweeter
than
most
scotch
ales
but
it
is
also
better
than
most
scotch
ales
another
great
one
from
founders
on
draught
at
lazy
chameleon
in
powell
oh
this
beer
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
copper
hue
and
a
thin
light
beige
head
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
malt
with
a
little
spice
thrown
in
the
flavor
was
not
really
reminiscent
of
other
scotch
ales
i
have
tried
it
seemed
to
be
leaning
more
toward
a
brown
ale
flavors
of
caramel
malt
molasses
and
brown
sugar
are
all
there
but
not
in
the
doses
you
would
expect
still
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
the
finish
is
more
bitter
than
most
scotch
ales
as
well
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
reddish
brown
color
and
formed
light
tan
foamy
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
some
sediment
is
present
a
complex
aroma
of
malt
caramel
raisins
and
other
dark
fruit
not
as
heavy
an
aroma
as
others
but
more
in
the
mix
if
you
will
the
flavor
was
of
malt
caramel
slight
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
raisin
a
slightly
lighter
body
than
i
would
expect
for
this
style
and
slightly
sweet
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
one
also
best
if
had
at
cellar
temp
or
just
slightly
cooler
to
help
draw
out
more
of
its
character
a
light
brown
with
some
red
highlights
thin
head
a
complex
aroma
some
bread
malt
alcohol
and
raisins
to
be
noted
simply
awesome
a
full
bodied
beer
hence
the
abv
with
some
complex
flavors
as
well
oak
raisin
some
port
and
bready
taste
up
front
the
alcohol
is
hidden
yet
noted
the
flavors
get
better
as
this
baby
warms
up
one
of
the
top
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
or
one
of
the
top
beers
ive
ever
had
get
some
now
crystal
clear
dark
garnet
brew
forms
a
thin
beige
head
atop
small
bubbles
with
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
heavy
with
amber
malts
with
subtle
notes
of
figs
and
dates
a
fruity
fermentation
some
incense
and
mild
dusty
hops
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
with
a
medium
dense
body
taste
starts
out
with
a
brief
upfront
subdued
hop
notes
then
immediately
cascades
into
a
firm
chewy
malty
body
with
hints
of
peat
smoked
malt
ending
in
a
mildly
astringent
malty
finish
a
spicy
yet
rubbery
hop
note
and
some
brief
fusels
not
being
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
i
thought
this
was
okay
but
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
founders
dirty
bastard
let
me
start
this
review
by
pointing
out
that
i
do
not
like
scotch
ale
but
i
love
this
scotch
ale
deep
brownish
black
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
and
no
lace
really
nice
sweetness
from
the
malts
that
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
to
savor
buy
it
if
you
find
it
reddishbrown
in
color
has
a
huge
foamy
clingy
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
clingy
lacing
in
my
glass
has
a
sweet
fruity
bready
and
citrusy
hoppy
aromas
nice
sweet
fruity
cherry
flavors
balanced
with
alot
of
hops
nice
bitter
finish
medium
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
damn
good
drinkability
good
for
an
8
3abv
brew
drink
a
few
of
these
and
you
will
feel
it
very
warming
and
relaxing
an
awesome
beer
to
warm
yourself
with
in
the
winter
this
was
my
first
brew
from
founders
but
it
wont
be
my
last
glass
snifter
great
aroma
and
taste
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
maybe
a
little
heavy
on
vanilla
but
i
like
that
taste
thick
maltiness
smooth
creamy
sweet
alcohol
warming
woody
brown
sugar
mildly
peppery
mineral
wood
tannin
bourbon
faint
vanilla
sweet
finish
why
dont
they
age
scotch
ales
on
scotch
barrels
makes
no
sense
had
tasting
with
a
friend
of
three
scotch
ales
scotty
karate
wulver
and
backwoods
bastard
in
that
order
expected
ratings
to
be
3rd
2nd
and
1st
if
you
think
bb
is
very
good
as
i
do
wulver
is
even
better
more
bourbon
more
vanilla
really
quite
a
treat
very
boozy
on
the
nose
at
first
as
it
warms
this
beer
opens
up
and
becomes
a
thing
of
beauty
one
of
the
very
best
wee
heavys
ive
had
smooth
vanilla
and
booze
finish
boozy
bourbon
not
really
my
thing
it
was
a
bit
too
much
had
at
pittsburgh
winter
beerfest
belongs
on
your
bucket
list
o
an
excellent
scotch
ale
one
of
the
finest
and
as
far
as
ive
had
very
true
to
style
these
ales
are
perfect
for
barrelaging
as
the
flavors
and
feels
meld
seamlessly
together
this
edges
out
the
others
ive
had
from
the
style
even
just
barely
backwoods
bastard
a
beautiful
beer
gorgeously
presented
fantastic
sweet
barrel
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
ba4d
very
sweet
pronounced
coconut
vanilla
and
sweet
toffee
wee
heavy
is
a
great
style
for
a
barrel
as
it
allows
for
significant
influence
without
being
overbarreled
the
palate
is
a
bit
thin
and
doesnt
carry
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
still
though
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
worth
seeking
out
top
notch
sipper
drinks
slow
and
with
potency
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
a
very
good
representation
of
ba
scotch
ale
honestly
prefer
this
one
over
backwoods
bastard
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
delicious
beer
one
of
the
best
things
i
can
recall
having
from
thirsty
dog
this
is
one
amazing
brew
if
it
werent
for
ba
i
wouldnt
have
bought
this
if
i
cant
get
bcbw
im
going
for
this
some
of
the
flavors
were
far
too
stark
on
tap
at
torst
brooklyn
ny
5
oz
poured
into
a
wine
glass
clear
light
cola
brown
color
molasses
sweet
malty
aroma
big
malty
nutty
lightly
toasted
taste
without
deeper
burnt
notes
vanilla
barrel
notes
relatively
light
bodied
given
full
flavors
low
carbonation
overall
man
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
one
i
usually
like
beers
nice
hot
and
fresh
but
this
one
is
a
bit
much
almost
spot
on
with
the
look
and
feel
but
i
think
the
flavors
just
need
some
time
to
get
along
beer
and
mellow
out
a
bit
next
time
i
plan
on
putting
some
years
on
it
overall
the
is
an
exceptional
version
of
the
style
with
barrel
aging
the
barrel
aging
works
well
in
conjunction
with
the
style
of
beer
well
done
very
heavy
on
bourbon
but
super
smooth
for
a
12
bba
beer
much
better
than
backwoods
bastard
bottom
line
excellent
beer
this
beer
puts
the
scotch
in
scotch
ale
definetly
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
to
date
this
wolf
can
hunt
split
with
the
wife
from
12oz
into
stem
less
wine
glasses
looked
great
nose
was
amazing
bourbon
vanilla
caramel
vanilla
oak
hints
and
nice
bourbon
balanced
though
on
the
tongue
velvet
mouthfeel
wulver
dominated
backwoods
in
my
reviews
need
to
do
a
sidebyside
get
it
get
it
now
the
best
bourbon
barrel
beer
i
have
had
so
far
going
to
be
tough
to
beat
very
easy
drinking
sorry
when
the
glass
was
empty
ive
had
a
couple
better
beers
but
never
a
better
wee
heavy
the
11
months
of
barrel
aging
pays
off
the
aroma
complexity
of
flavors
is
amazing
this
was
one
of
those
great
beer
moments
for
me
i
was
given
a
bottle
and
did
not
know
anything
about
it
felt
like
something
bourbon
ahead
and
it
was
in
the
front
of
my
cellarfridge
gave
it
a
quick
whiff
and
had
to
do
the
double
take
wonderful
caramel
bourbony
nose
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
after
taste
was
was
a
fizzy
jd
single
barrel
with
a
splash
of
coke
yet
it
was
somehow
not
too
boozy
i
loved
every
sip
of
this
if
you
have
friends
who
love
bourbon
but
not
beer
i
highly
suggest
you
get
them
to
try
this
awesome
the
best
wee
heavy
bb
sctoch
ale
you
can
buy
well
worth
the
high
price
tag
and
a
must
try
for
any
and
all
craft
beer
drinkers
just
had
the
founders
backwoods
a
couple
of
days
ago
and
this
sure
beats
that
excellent
beer
i
am
simply
in
love
tried
but
hard
to
give
any
suggestions
worth
it
every
cent
overall
i
am
in
love
with
a
weeheavy
a
regular
weeheavy
i
usually
am
not
that
impressed
with
yet
age
one
in
a
bourbon
barrel
for
1214
months
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
offering
i
had
backwoods
bastard
which
is
great
in
its
own
right
yet
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
wulver
this
brew
for
being
12
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
high
gravity
beers
on
this
planet
with
that
said
this
brew
is
recommended
tmo
rather
impressive
beer
taste
matches
the
nose
but
disability
is
through
the
roof
abv
is
well
integrated
and
this
puppy
slides
down
too
easily
not
sure
why
you
dont
hear
more
about
this
one
super
good
from
bottle
at
home
excellent
brew
pours
to
a
firm
off
white
head
that
descends
to
a
light
lacing
liquid
has
the
look
of
a
strong
coffee
aroma
remind
me
of
some
nice
barley
wines
toffee
vanilla
with
no
bitterness
a
pleasant
sweetness
a
very
full
body
rounds
out
this
12
ale
like
most
rich
victuals
less
is
more
o
this
may
be
the
single
best
execution
of
an
aged
wee
heavy
i
have
ever
had
including
the
founders
backwoods
bastard
incredibly
easy
to
drink
allows
the
malty
sweetness
to
star
with
the
bourbon
barrel
as
the
supporting
cast
hides
the
abv
well
this
is
a
really
well
done
beer
o
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
simply
an
exceptional
beer
and
a
wonderful
expression
of
a
wee
heavy
its
hard
to
think
of
something
that
needs
to
be
tweaked
they
set
out
to
create
a
beer
whose
purpose
was
to
spend
almost
a
year
in
bourbon
barrels
rather
than
simply
be
a
barrelaged
version
of
an
offered
style
and
theyve
succeeded
in
spades
aging
this
in
the
cellar
may
well
make
it
perfect
wulver
is
the
best
wee
heavy
on
the
market
not
sure
of
the
date
but
i
bought
this
a
while
ago
deep
mahogany
colored
body
with
a
little
creaminess
on
the
surface
that
all
but
disappears
smooth
bourbon
aromas
woody
spice
molasses
toffee
berries
and
coconut
not
particularly
hot
smelling
which
is
nice
flavor
is
smooth
and
rich
wow
the
bourbon
blends
nicely
with
the
base
beer
which
results
in
something
sweet
like
pure
honey
and
toffee
ice
cream
vanilla
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
but
absolutely
no
harsh
barrel
notes
warm
cinnamon
way
in
the
back
along
with
some
coconut
super
smooth
creamy
body
has
some
thickness
and
leaves
a
bit
of
heat
in
the
throat
sweetasfuck
which
is
my
only
gripe
but
this
is
a
dessert
beer
right
price
point
6
9912
oz
bottle
pours
the
deepest
brown
i
could
imagine
with
the
slightest
red
hints
around
the
edges
almost
no
head
but
leaves
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
heavy
oak
and
stone
fruit
in
the
aroma
with
some
tobacco
vanilla
and
raisin
chocolate
came
out
in
the
taste
particularly
strong
in
the
beginning
then
gave
way
to
the
bourbon
with
an
emphasis
on
oak
and
vanilla
as
well
creamy
mouthfeel
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
to
carry
everything
nice
amount
of
sediment
at
the
end
and
clean
easy
maybe
too
easy
to
drink
if
you
have
a
chance
try
this
one
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
its
incredibly
dense
with
flavors
due
in
no
small
part
surely
to
the
masterful
incorporation
of
the
barrel
this
beer
has
some
power
i
like
them
strong
and
wulver
has
some
allaround
strength
unfortunately
quite
thin
and
flat
oh
my
goodness
this
is
soooo
good
the
smooth
malt
blending
with
the
woody
bourbon
is
off
the
hook
after
just
a
couple
sips
this
might
be
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
had
one
of
the
smoothest
12ers
for
sure
at
the
very
least
i
wish
i
could
write
more
but
i
already
finished
my
6
oz
sample
want
moar
the
mouthfeel
is
heavybodied
with
low
amounts
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
sticky
and
leaves
the
taste
hanging
around
for
a
while
works
really
well
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
it
is
extremely
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
the
complexities
are
crazy
everything
works
together
in
beautiful
ways
and
keeps
you
going
back
for
more
the
price
is
a
bit
high
but
understandable
for
this
brew
a
year
has
done
wonders
for
this
marvelous
beer
i
cant
wait
too
see
what
happens
to
this
one
with
time
this
is
a
great
tasting
brew
must
enjoy
strong
bourbon
barrel
brews
this
is
a
whopping
12
alcohol
and
the
taste
is
unreal
i
highly
recommend
this
for
those
who
enjoy
a
strong
beer
i
cannot
wait
to
try
others
from
thirsty
dog
the
flavors
are
unbelievable
making
it
a
tasty
beer
o
my
mind
is
properly
blown
easily
one
of
my
top
5
bba
beers
the
aroma
alone
makes
me
wish
i
had
more
than
just
one
of
these
the
flavor
brings
a
lot
of
malt
with
moderately
woody
flavor
and
light
caramel
with
buttery
toffeelike
taste
with
slight
toasted
character
and
mild
warming
flavor
from
bourbon
in
the
background
the
taste
has
a
good
cohesive
sweetness
with
barrel
blended
well
into
the
base
and
nicely
balanced
malt
with
scotch
ale
flavor
smooth
yet
still
strong
as
it
finishes
more
on
the
sweet
side
overall
this
is
a
great
mix
of
scotch
ale
with
bourbon
in
an
almost
seamless
combo
this
is
like
a
match
made
in
heaven
with
malt
complexity
enhanced
nicely
by
the
woody
barrel
aging
wulver
is
an
enjoyable
wee
heavy
that
stays
rather
true
to
the
style
a
slightly
more
robust
flavor
profile
and
a
bigger
mouthfeel
however
might
have
lent
itself
well
to
the
barrel
aging
wow
that
is
one
sweet
sob
barrel
is
really
prevalent
but
man
the
sweetness
takes
this
btch
to
a
whole
new
level
and
the
abv
is
very
noticeable
tasted
like
liquor
at
times
also
it
got
sweeter
as
it
warmed
up
i
loved
the
first
few
sips
then
the
sweetness
started
to
get
a
bit
much
glad
i
shared
it
with
a
buddy
because
it
would
have
been
too
much
for
me
very
strong
i
expected
this
however
it
was
a
bit
strong
for
my
taste
i
am
a
very
big
bourbon
fan
so
i
decided
to
give
this
a
shot
strong
rich
coffee
sent
with
a
similar
bite
to
the
tongue
heavy
in
abv
and
you
can
tell
i
feel
like
one
or
two
of
these
12
would
knock
me
out
not
my
favorite
but
doable
a
dark
rich
brown
color
like
a
stout
s
nutty
hint
strong
coffee
stout
aroma
hint
of
alcohol
t
tasted
like
a
stout
with
a
smack
of
yummy
bourbon
at
the
end
m
thick
and
rich
no
complaints
o
about
what
i
expected
not
gonna
have
to
drink
to
many
of
these
to
enjoy
a
good
night
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
well
worth
the
price
the
flavor
is
excellent
the
aroma
is
excellent
the
palate
is
very
good
and
the
appearance
is
good
but
somewhat
lacking
because
of
the
absence
of
lacing
o
this
beer
definitely
tastes
strong
but
rather
manages
to
mask
most
of
the
alcohol
from
the
taste
except
for
the
bourbon
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
sip
and
savor
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
beige
collar
the
aroma
brings
a
huge
dose
of
bourbon
followed
by
malt
brown
bread
oak
bourbon
steals
the
show
delicious
flavor
following
the
aroma
an
almost
tannic
character
the
aroma
is
the
star
of
the
show
here
thin
body
with
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
a
touch
of
spice
with
a
hearty
malt
body
very
tasty
i
had
this
blind
against
backwoods
and
this
knocked
that
beer
off
its
feet
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
i
think
they
werent
joking
around
when
they
said
this
beer
was
made
just
to
be
aged
in
barrels
the
flavors
work
so
well
with
barrel
and
i
can
see
a
good
amount
of
thought
went
into
the
base
beer
and
it
seems
like
it
sat
in
the
barrel
for
the
perfect
amount
of
time
and
it
achieved
some
killer
balance
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
a
little
rich
a
little
sticky
not
crisp
a
little
silky
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
an
awesome
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
mind
sipping
on
this
all
night
and
it
really
amazes
me
how
smooth
it
is
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
they
were
among
some
of
the
best
ive
experiences
in
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
i
would
change
but
i
did
think
it
was
a
little
pricey
and
it
would
be
great
to
see
it
at
around
the
same
price
point
as
backwoods
bastard
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
and
im
kicking
myself
for
not
picking
up
more
when
i
had
the
chance
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
and
its
a
must
try
if
you
like
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
all
in
all
i
was
straight
up
impressed
with
this
beer
i
had
some
high
expectations
and
it
met
every
single
one
of
them
and
even
surpassed
them
in
some
aspects
this
is
without
a
doubt
my
new
favorite
beer
from
thirsty
dog
and
its
right
up
there
with
backwoods
bastard
as
my
favorite
of
the
style
these
beers
are
very
similar
and
i
would
have
to
have
them
side
by
side
to
fully
get
an
idea
as
to
which
is
the
better
beer
fantastic
job
guys
keep
up
the
great
and
impressive
work

hold
your
fire
a
debate
for
another
night
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
wee
heavy
i
can
recall
trying
id
definitely
recommend
seeking
this
out
and
hope
to
have
it
again
sometime
it
definitely
is
a
sweet
boozy
thing
not
something
i
really
need
to
do
again
3
75
d
pretty
good
beer
only
complaint
is
that
id
love
some
more
carbonation
for
a
scotch
ale
this
is
not
bad
looking
it
is
murky
and
brown
but
there
is
a
decent
head
and
decent
belgian
lacing
the
initial
aroma
is
a
blast
in
the
face
of
super
fresh
bourbon
barrel
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
etc
as
the
beer
warms
you
can
pick
up
some
more
earthy
notes
downside
it
is
kind
of
a
one
note
aroma
unidimensional
to
start
with
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
as
the
beer
warms
though
it
becomes
easier
to
pick
out
chewy
raisin
vinious
flavors
and
a
smokey
maple
syrup
quality
its
nice
thick
sticky
slick
however
not
cloying
over
the
palate
really
good
beer
here
actually
love
it
here
is
the
problem
it
is
28
dollars
a
four
pack
thats
a
lot
and
i
think
value
is
important
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
balanced
the
alcohol
keeps
my
mouth
nicely
warmed
as
the
carbonation
bounces
the
flavors
around
for
a
while
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
that
moment
o
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
beer
dont
usually
care
too
much
for
this
brewery
but
this
outstanding
got
a
few
stored
away
to
see
how
it
matures
my
first
beer
tried
from
thirsty
dog
and
i
am
thirsty
for
more
o
how
is
this
beer
so
underrated
i
was
blown
away
by
its
complexity
and
decadence
this
bottle
must
be
a
few
years
old
because
of
how
mellow
and
integrated
the
flavors
are
i
could
sip
this
all
day
thank
you
again
turdfurgison
happy
holidays
ba
o
wow
is
this
tasty
i
paired
it
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
i
had
at
home
and
it
was
a
match
made
in
heaven
it
would
probably
make
a
nice
dessert
by
itself
too
given
its
smoothness
and
12
i
could
see
it
creeping
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
clear
dark
amber
pour
with
a
deep
dark
ruby
cast
nice
head
and
lacing
that
retains
for
3
minutes
the
nose
is
bourbon
over
sweet
dark
fruit
mostly
plum
and
raisin
coupled
with
notes
of
vanilla
caramel
and
oak
over
molasses
almost
full
bodied
with
a
very
rich
creamy
texture
the
superb
flavor
profile
is
complex
yet
balanced
unlike
founders
backwoods
bastard
bourbon
doesnt
predominate
you
get
a
complex
balance
of
bourbon
against
the
flavors
of
the
nose
it
begins
with
the
dark
fruit
progresses
to
the
caramel
and
molasses
based
sweetness
then
bourbon
and
the
associated
vanilla
and
oak
notes
the
finish
is
a
smooth
bourbon
forward
sweetness
counter
balanced
with
an
oak
astringency
that
flows
into
that
nice
alcoholic
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
compared
to
fbb
the
wulver
wins
by
a
nose
for
the
wee
heavy
title
o
interesting
brew
its
big
and
complex
pretty
well
balanced
too
but
boy
is
it
sweet
like
drinking
maple
syrup
sweet
its
got
that
same
cloying
sweetness
that
you
get
in
a
lot
of
the
bigger
hebrew
beers
like
drinking
pure
molasses
i
am
glad
this
bottle
was
only
12
ounces
because
i
dont
think
id
make
it
through
a
larger
format
sipper
for
sure
dessert
beer
o
one
of
the
best
wee
heavies
right
up
there
with
backwoods
bastard
a
really
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
night
overall
i
would
call
this
an
occasional
treat
for
more
reasons
than
the
price
its
sweeter
than
other
barrelaged
scotch
ales
like
backwoods
bastard
but
executed
better
than
most
central
waters
for
example
the
availability
of
wulver
makes
it
an
excellent
contender
as
a
flagship
beer
for
a
brewery
that
should
work
to
emphasize
their
higher
abv
offerings
do
they
barrel
age
bernese
if
not
they
should
try
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
when
backwoods
bastard
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
naturally
i
will
compare
it
to
that
beer
i
just
think
that
it
is
very
close
to
bb
but
not
quite
there
plus
the
fact
that
this
is
over
twice
the
price
per
bottle
really
is
a
negative
on
wulver
still
a
fine
example
of
bourbon
barrel
wee
heavy
i
found
this
beer
interesting
in
that
at
12
it
pushes
ohios
abv
law
about
to
the
limit
oone
off
the
best
ba
wee
heavies
i
have
tried
great
for
sipping
on
a
cold
night
overall
its
a
nice
much
subtler
version
of
a
barrel
aged
wee
heavy
but
its
done
very
well
and
enjoyable
to
drink
all
around
wulver
is
a
nearperfect
wood
aged
beer
where
the
scotch
industry
has
used
bourbon
barrels
for
centuries
its
no
surprise
to
find
all
that
woodaged
character
playing
out
on
a
base
beer
that
supports
the
wood
seamlessly
overall
this
is
the
best
beer
that
i
have
drank
from
thirsty
dog
wulver
is
effortlessly
the
very
best
ba
wee
heavy
that
i
have
drank
backwoods
bastard
doesnt
even
hold
a
candle
to
wulver
wulver
has
many
layers
of
flavors
and
fantastic
complexity
found
in
this
beers
aroma
and
flavor
profile
a
great
beer
to
slowely
sip
on
and
contimplate
its
many
complexities
i
cant
remember
enjoying
a
ba
wee
heavy
as
much
as
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
right
now
i
hope
this
is
a
yearly
release
by
thirsty
dog
they
would
be
crazy
not
to
release
this
brew
on
a
yearly
basis
pours
a
brownish
copper
with
less
than
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
enjoyed
some
decent
retention
the
nose
has
soft
but
distinct
bourbon
notes
the
malt
profile
is
weak
for
the
style
and
the
body
is
also
too
thin
to
properly
balance
with
the
bourbon
flavors
the
bourbon
almost
completely
takes
over
on
the
finish
and
this
offering
ends
up
tasting
like
a
shot
rather
than
a
beer
o
a
very
nice
barrelaged
scotch
ale
the
barrel
works
really
well
to
add
some
sweetness
and
complex
flavors
to
the
big
maltiness
o
very
tasty
and
nice
low
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
take
much
away
o
overall
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
had
makes
me
want
to
stand
in
the
cold
rain
wearing
a
kilt
while
bagpipes
play

distance

abv
i
had
hyped
this
beer
up
and
it
was
one
of
the
beers
i
was
most
looking
forward
to
trying
the
appearance
was
a
little
light
and
pale
for
a
beer
of
the
style
the
nose
had
faint
vanilla
notes
that
were
hardly
detictable
the
taste
was
lacking
as
well
it
seemed
watered
down
and
lacked
any
complexity
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
thin
if
i
hadnt
seen
the
bottle
opened
i
would
swear
that
this
beer
was
cut
to
serve
more
people
maybe
its
because
the
night
started
with
a
big
barrel
aged
stout
but
i
found
this
beer
lacking
in
every
category
i
would
try
it
again
just
to
see
if
i
was
given
a
bad
bottle
thirsty
dog
really
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
overall
one
of
ohios
best
offerings
a
must
try
for
all
serious
craft
beer
drinkers
at
25
per
4pack
the
beer
isnt
cheap
but
worth
every
penny
d
really
good
stuff
and
one
of
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
brews
ive
had
unbelievably
smooth
i
have
one
in
the
cellar
but
i
really
dont
know
what
it
will
do
to
this
brew
might
even
be
better
fresh
at
these
prices
this
is
a
no
go
for
me
i
will
say
make
sure
you
drink
this
one
on
the
colder
side
it
isnt
an
imperial
stout
that
can
be
had
at
6070
degrees
and
still
be
wonderful
it
needs
to
be
in
the
40s
once
i
was
at
a
burrito
restaurant
in
a
place
you
wouldnt
expect
to
find
delicious
burritos
id
never
been
it
was
two
in
the
morning
and
the
guy
in
front
of
me
was
drunk
i
asked
him
how
the
food
was
he
grabbed
me
by
the
shirt
and
said
id
kill
my
mother
for
this
st
he
thought
he
meant
those
burritos
which
are
indeed
the
best
on
the
planet
but
that
kind
of
accolade
should
be
reserved
for
a
beer
like
wulver
amazing
i
have
never
downed
a
beer
this
fast
absolutely
ridiculous
but
i
couldnt
quit
reaching
for
the
glass
my
first
sip
i
thought
meh
but
it
improved
every
time
i
put
my
worshipful
lips
up
to
it
excellent
close
to
top
shelf
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
yes
it
is
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
treat
yourself
once
in
a
while
first
time
i
had
this
it
was
at
the
brewery
on
tap
based
on
that
experience
i
have
had
no
problem
ever
since
paying
24
a
4
pack
for
it
to
be
a
permanent
resident
in
my
home
aroma
of
toffee
vanilla
caramel
molasses
wood
sweet
dark
fruits
and
last
but
not
least
bourbon
taste
follows
everything
you
smell
with
some
peat
moss
to
boot
the
very
subtle
perfectly
integrated
bourbon
up
front
the
deep
rich
scotch
ale
flavors
on
the
back
end
a
slow
mild
heat
in
the
finish
i
cant
overstate
how
balanced
and
smooth
this
is
for
a
12
ba
beer
the
body
is
just
a
hair
on
the
thin
side
for
a
wee
heavy
but
expected
overjoyed
that
this
is
in
my
back
yard
i
wont
say
that
there
isnt
another
brewery
making
something
as
good
but
i
havent
had
it
and
cant
imagine
anything
being
better
this
is
like
a
backwoods
bastard
bourbon
county
style
world
class
look
me
up
if
you
cant
find
it
o
overall
a
very
nice
ba
scotch
ale
and
another
really
good
ba
beer
from
thirsty
dog
i
liked
the
ba
siberian
night
a
little
bit
better
but
this
is
up
there
with
it
as
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
them
worth
checking
out
overall
the
most
bourbonforward
of
my
three
favorite
barrel
aged
scotch
ales
this
plus
backwoods
bastard
and
ride
the
lion
a
well
crafted
beer
by
any
standards
is
it
worth
the
oftencharged
10
per
bottle
you
need
to
decide
but
its
a
musttry
for
wee
heavy
lovers
overall
not
a
bad
ba
beer
but
not
digging
the
wood
and
too
long
in
the
barrels
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
beer
because
i
expected
more
complexity
but
instead
it
was
dominated
by
the
bourbon
this
is
the
first
barrel
aged
beer
i
have
had
since
bourbon
county
brand
stout
so
my
expectations
are
slightly
skewed
however
it
is
still
a
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
o
very
good
barrel
aged
wee
heavy
not
the
most
complex
ive
had
but
it
accomplishes
the
bourbon
forward
flavor
that
i
like
in
the
style
definitely
something
i
look
forward
to
drinking
again
easily
my
favorite
ba
scotch
ale
that
ive
had
overall
a
great
sipper
not
for
a
long
night
of
drinking
but
perfect
for
staying
in
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
more
of
this
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
good
ba
scotch
ale
the
dark
fruit
notes
are
a
bit
atypical
and
give
this
scotch
ale
hints
of
belgian
dark
ale
this
brew
doesnt
hide
the
boozebut
it
certainly
isnt
off
putting
either
id
like
the
beer
to
taste
more
like
it
smells
on
a
side
notemy
husband
absolutely
thinks
this
beer
is
exceptional
o
very
good
wulver
pours
up
with
ample
effervescence
creating
ample
lacing
that
creates
a
tightly
clustered
ring
of
beigishwhite
bubbles
that
manage
to
hold
on
above
the
bright
burnt
reddishbrown
body
alcohol
certainly
diminishes
the
head
retention
the
aromatics
are
simply
divine
with
nuances
of
four
roses
kentucky
straight
bourbon
that
show
some
spicy
sweet
notes
of
rye
cinnamon
sweet
molasses
which
carry
a
hint
of
roasted
barley
deep
caramel
cherry
vanilla
the
alcohol
is
noted
and
certainly
gives
hints
to
the
strength
contained
within
the
flavor
starts
off
very
cloying
at
first
with
big
hits
of
charred
brown
sugar
e
g
steens
pure
cane
syrup
before
the
underlying
spicy
hops
bourbon
character
help
lend
balance
towards
the
very
warming
slightly
stealthy
alcohol
laded
finish
wulver
is
really
a
werewolf
in
disguise
as
it
starts
off
innocent
enough
before
unleashing
the
beast
beware
of
the
full
moon
or
prepare
for
wulvers
fangs
claws
to
ripe
out
your
throat
brown
pour
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
some
strong
bourbon
notes
with
a
lot
of
maple
vanilla
and
peat
malt
character
the
flavor
is
similar
the
scotch
and
peat
notes
come
through
up
front
but
are
complimented
by
a
heavy
dose
of
bourbon
character
i
get
a
lot
of
maple
oak
vanilla
and
whiskey
notes
that
really
add
to
the
base
beer
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
with
a
tiny
light
tan
head
smell
is
vanilla
bourbon
and
oak
with
some
butterscotch
and
molasses
bourbon
and
vanilla
dominate
the
taste
with
hints
of
the
butterscotch
and
molasses
heavier
bodied
with
a
lower
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
great
scotch
ale
had
this
side
by
side
with
founders
backwoods
bastard
and
prefer
this
heavier
body
and
stronger
vanilla
notes
with
less
booziness
no
head
but
bits
of
lacing
on
a
clear
copper
with
amber
hues
body
aroma
of
oak
wet
towels
bourbon
caramel
red
wine
and
molasses
flavor
follows
with
an
excellent
complex
mixture
including
notes
of
vanilla
caramel
bourbon
and
oak
with
a
nice
balance
between
sweetness
and
boozy
bourbon
although
not
at
all
overwhelming
boozy
the
base
beer
is
still
well
represented
it
seems
light
carbonation
and
medium
to
full
oily
body
very
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
would
love
to
come
across
this
one
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
is
surprisingly
very
smooth
the
whole
way
through
it
leaves
just
the
faintest
residue
at
the
back
of
the
throat
carbonation
is
just
right
subdued
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
bourbon
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
toffee
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
barrel
aged
presence
that
is
slightly
better
in
the
aroma
in
my
opinion
o
flavorful
and
interesting
oas
good
as
they
say
as
great
as
ohio
is
doing
with
ipashead
hunter
white
rajah
bodhi
great
lakes
offerings
its
good
to
see
a
big
beer
holding
its
own
against
the
big
boys
i
think
this
might
be
a
hair
better
than
backwoods
bastard
one
if
my
favorites
solid
beer
from
thirsty
dog
which
before
this
had
always
been
a
meh
brewery
for
me
glad
to
have
a
few
more
o
very
nice
scotch
ale
and
it
is
similar
to
central
waters
bbsa
the
difference
is
that
cw
is
10
less
a
4
pack
bwb
remains
my
favorite
bbsa
poured
into
a
16
oz
snifter
not
sure
of
the
bottle
date
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
amber
with
a
quarter
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
attractive
lace
smell
is
all
about
the
toffee
caramel
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
bourbon
dipped
raisins
taste
is
really
the
same
but
vanilla
and
toffee
dominate
with
the
other
flavors
in
a
supporting
role
body
is
medium
with
enough
life
a
touch
dry
and
a
sipper
for
sure
this
is
a
fairly
smooth
monster
of
a
beer
that
really
deserves
its
recognition
and
tickles
the
palate
in
the
best
way
reviewed
on
barrel
aged
beer
day
and
a
delicious
treat
cheers
overall
as
crazy
as
it
is
to
say
this
definitely
worth
the
23
99
for
a
4
pack
will
be
buying
this
one
again
coukd
easily
go
through
a
4
pack
its
so
good
clear
dark
town
pour
almost
no
carbonation
except
a
thin
tan
halo
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
potent
overwhelming
butterscotchy
caramely
sweetness
little
bite
the
taste
is
relatively
potent
barrely
sweetness
a
bit
of
prune
tobacco
heavy
flavors
that
coat
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
heavysyrupy
as
well
pure
caramelized
wood
sugar
sweetness
and
almost
no
bite
really
rounded
flavors
masked
ethanol
drinkable
and
certainly
worth
trying
the
appearance
is
a
dark
color
with
a
hint
of
some
amber
no
head
the
nose
is
a
lot
of
bourbon
and
sweetness
as
soon
as
i
took
a
sip
i
was
blown
away
i
literally
said
aloud
wow
wow
i
was
really
shocked
by
this
beer
i
taste
a
lot
of
vanilla
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
like
velvet
its
creamy
you
taste
the
bourbon
but
oaky
caramel
vanilla
sweetness
balances
everything
out
to
be
honest
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
excellent
beer
from
thirsty
dog
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
no
bottle
dating
but
was
a
recent
release
pours
moderately
hazy
and
cloudy
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
fairly
dense
off
white
head
with
decent
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
lace
that
lingers
light
spotty
lacing
clings
on
the

aromas
of
big
caramel
toast

with
absolutely
perfect

that
is
fantastic
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
light
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
world
class
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
all
around
insane
complexity
and
balance
of
malt
and
barrel
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
amazing
what
a
beer
its
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
as
much
a
big
bourbonbarrelaged
english
barleywine
as
a
scotch
ale
it
packs
a
sizable
sweet
boozy
punch
yet
still
insists
on
teasing
you
with
its
power
the
brewers
took
this
one
right
to
the
limit
one
more
microbe
of
booziness
and
it
would
slide
completely
over
the
edge
and
become
a
chore
to
drink
it
is
wonderful
how
it
toes
the
precipice
without
falling
in
and
serves
itself
up
as
a
classic
sipper
if
i
had
to
compare
this
to
backwoods
bastard
id
say
this
compares
to
backwoods
bastard
like
bcbs
compares
to
kbs
interpret
that
any
way
you
like
me
im
gettin
back
into
this
here
glass
cheers
o
what
a
surprise
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
would
buy
and
recommend
all
day
long
overall
a
great
way
to
end
the
evenings
drinking
after
a
couple
of
summer
ales
early
on
nursed
this
for
an
hour
or
so
and
enjoyed
every
minute
have
one
more
in
the
fridge
will
try
to
pour
a
bit
more
agressively
to
see
if
head
can
be
maintained
nicely
done
thirsty
dog
balanced
with
strong
aromatics
dark
brown
sugar
notes
but
not
too
sweet
it
just
tastes
damn
good
overall
really
nice
not
complex
but
its
got
a
great
barrel
character
o
this
wee
heavy
is
as
good
as
any
of
the
style
made
in
scotland
well
made
and
delicious
what
a
kickass
scotch
ale
up
there
with
founders
backwoods
bastard
dessert
in
beer
form
overall
delicious
i
wish
that
i
had
another
and
will
stop
at
no
lengths
to
acquire
one
thats
a
lie
if
you
see
this
beer
buy
it
and
drink
it
immediately
very
nice
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
that
drinks
pretty
nicely
the
bourbon
pounds
its
chest
and
flexes
hard
in
the
aroma
yet
still
shows
you
that
it
has
a
softer
side
when
you
finally
decided
to
take
a
sip
its
like
when
you
find
out
that
the
240
pound
weight
lifting
muscle
head
jock
cries
whenever
he
watches
the
notebook
get
your
kleenex
ready
bro
thanks
again
kevin
overall
this
is
the
best
ba
scotch
ale
ive
had
thirsty
dog
really
set
a
new
standard
for
ba
scotch
ales
with
this
beer
for
me
it
beats
out
backwoods
by
just
a
little
i
had
them
side
by
side
and
i
felt
the
wulver
was
just
a
little
better
it
was
also
very
hard
to
compare
though
since
both
are
world
class
beers
o
a
very
nice
bba
wee
heavy
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
flavors
are
nice
overall
and
the
booze
is
very
wellhidden
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
in
a
while
weakness
being
this
slight
thinness
but
drinks
very
easy
for
the
style
this
is
great
for
the
price
probably
only
a
one
time
try
though
glad
i
picked
this
up
before
the
fourth
of
july
going
through
ohio
this
is
a
great
beer
ive
had
it
ontap
before
and
its
nice
to
see
it
in
the
bottles
im
sure
this
would
age
well
but
its
definitely
ready
to
drink
right
now
this
one
gets
extra
credit
for
being
so
easy
to
drink
recomended
my
sister
in
law
got
this
for
me
while
in
ohio
and
she
said
it
was
pretty
pricey
doubt
i
would
grab
it
again
but
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
try
overall
a
sturdy
barrel
aged
scotch
that
can
stand
up
to
any
occasion
a
fine
beer
from
thirsty
dog
would
make
a
compliment
to
any
pint
glass
or
snifter
o
i
was
completely
surprised
by
this
one
it
was
my
first
thirsty
dog
experience
and
it
was
a
good
one
im
a
pretty
harsh
critic
of
this
style
as
its
one
of
my
favs
but
this
definitely
delivered
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
thistle
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
reddishbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
light
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
very
sweet
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
bourbon
vanilla
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
molasses
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
nuts
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
its
a
very
sweet
tasting
brew
full
of
malty
goodness
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
slick
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
certainly
doesnt
drink
like
a
12
abv
brew
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
overall
yeah
its
pricey
at
23
99
a
4pack
but
its
tasty
and
i
dont
regret
buying
it
luckily
i
have
3
bottles
left
worth
trying
for
sure
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
it
honestly
but
a
very
nice
drinking
brew
not
that
id
trade
for
it
but
if
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
i
may
pick
a
4
pack
up
im
waiting
for
it
to
warm
up
and
see
if
more
of
the
nuances
come
out
pours
a
deep
rich
amber
with
a
thinner
but
well
sustained
slight
off
white
headjust
great
color
clarity
going
on
here
wow
the
aromas
are

blowingbig
sweet
caramel
and
vanilla
with
a
toastiness
from
the
barrelit

almost
a
pecan

element
to
it
to
go
along
with
dark

in

you

keeps
me
harkening
back
to
pecan
pie
damn
thirsty
dog
have
hit
home
runs
in
their
barrel
aged
beersdo
more
overall
this
and
the
ba
siberian
night
have
to
become
regular
yearly
releases
these
beers
are
far
to
good
to
release
once
this
is
quality
4

overall
superb
bba
wee
heavy
here
right
up
there
with
the
very
best
of
them
overall
this
is
the
best
wee
heavy
that
i
have
ever
had
so
smooth
and
delicious
at
7
99
per
bottle
i
wasnt
going
to
pull
the
trigger
but
an
employee
was
raving
about
it
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
wow
i
was
not
disappointed
going
to
be
picking
up
a
4
pack
of
this
despite
the
heavy
price
tag
its
that
good
d
this
is
an
insanely
good
beer
that
earns
its
high
price
tag
between
this
and
bba
siberian
night
thirsty
dog
has
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
galaxy
i
prefer
bba
siberian
night
because
i
favor
the
style
but
this
is
the
best
damn
wee
heavy
to
cross
my
face
thanks
to
the
precise
11
month
bourbon
barrel
aging
that
fits
this
style
so
well
i
love
you
thirsty
dog
i
love
you
with
all
my
senses
o
exceptional
brew
and
a
really
good
example
of
what
thirsty
dog
can
do
if
you
are
a
fan
of
backwoods
bastard
and
similar
beers
this
is
one
to
seek
out
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
this
any
time
later
note
it
did
come
out
in
bottles
at
least
in
a
limited
run
and
the
bottled
version
is
as
good
as
the
draft
the
brewery
tells
me
they
had
some
trouble
getting
the
label
approved
by
the
us
government
so
it
took
a
while
i
wasnt
able
to
make
good
on
my
word
to
stock
up
on
it
because
it
sells
for
six
bucks
a
bottle
but
ive
been
buying
it
while
its
available
as
my
budget
permits
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
kiss
of
carbonation
not
bad
but
nit
something
i
would
have
again
in
any
quantity
larger
than
a
couple
ounces
its
an
interesting
change
of
pace
for
the
style
but
too
sweet
and
medicinal
for
me
to
really

a
massively
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
remained
throughout
maintained
excellent

throughout
the

the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet

roasted
malt
caramel
wood
sweet

red

vanilla

sweet

the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
sweet
alcohol
vanilla
spices
wood
and
barrel
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
flavor
and
aroma
on
this
one
really
screamed
barrel
to
me
that
nice
sweet
woodiness
with
a
kiss
of
vanilla
shined
throughout
and
really
made
this
one
quite
pleasant
with
all
of
this
it
still
managed
to
be
quite
well
balanced
and
complex
at
the
same
time
i
just
hate
that
so
few
have
gotten
to
try
this
one
as
of
this
review
as
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
thirsty
dogs
barrel
program
this
is
saying
a
lot
as
i
usually
do
not
like
this
style
well
done
thirsty
dog
well
done
a
little
darker
than
normal
as
expected
from
the
ol
bourbon
barrel
doi
g
its
thing
in
fact
its
darn
near
black
a
thin
layer
of
head
stays
a
whilethis
big
boy
beckons
like
a
mythological
siren
the
nose
is
straight
bourbon
its
like
ive
hanged
myself
upside
down
in
a
bourbon
barrel
soggy
wet
oak
with
vanilla
undertones
bombard
the
malty
wee
heavy
the
taste
confirms
an
earthy
bourbony
goodness
this
makes
me
wonder
why
more
wee
heavys
arent
bba
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
basic
style
but
its
as
if
it
hugs
the
bourbon
influence
with
lots
of
love
and
kisses
that
sweet
oaky
bourbon
really
imparts
its
influence
to
what
might
otherwise
be
a
malty
mess
i
cant
help
it
compare
it
to
the
template
of
a
backwoods
bastard
and
this
one
hold
its
own
id
like
to
try
em
sidebyside
a
deliciously
done
dog
from
thirsty
ohio
lower
carbonnation
medium
bodied
a
sipper
with
a
slight
warming
effect
overall
a
great
brew
by
thirsty
dog
pricey
at
5
for
a
7
oz
bottle
jeez
pours
amber
with
very
little
head
strange
aroma
oyster
sauce
tabasco
spaghettios
malt
spaghettios
for
sure
wife
confirms
this
flavor
is
nice
with
a
scotch
and
malt
backbone
on
top
if
some
sweet
dark
candy
flavors
and
yes
a
sweet
tomatoey
essence
somewhat
unique
but
one
of
the
funkiest
smelling
beers
i
have
encountered
medium
slick
mouthfeel
with
some
creamy
finish
not
bad
but
a
little
weird
overall
rogue
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
promise
but
unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
with
way
too
light
wouldnt
min
trying
this
fresh
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
definitely
overall
what
we
like
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
there
was
such
a
nice
robustness
to
the
nose
with
hearty
sweetness
warmth
and
spice
this
however
did
not
translate
very
well
into
flavor
or
feel
as
both
let
up
some
lightness
around
the
edges
by
the
end
this
made
for
a
decent
beer
that
was
drinkable
but
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
that
is
pretty
much
still
for
being
17
years
in
the
bottle
it
is
surprisingly
full
of
character
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
thinned
out
body
distracted
a
bit
from
the
overall
experience
but
asis
this
was
not
bad
the
nose
on
this
was
pretty
phenomenal
the
taste
however
was
a
bit
lackluster
perhaps
a
year
ago
there
might
have
been
a
heavier
influence
of
earthy
hopping
than
this
and
i
can
speculate
all
i
want
about
how
that
couldve
been
somewhat
better
in
terms
of
complexity
and
sweetness
balance
than
this
but
ill
have
to
make
do
with
what
ive
actually
got
in
the
real
world
o
not
entirely
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
for
a
5
7
oz
bottle
i
cant
really
recommend
this
beer
also
it
didnt
taste
like
and
wee
heavy
i
have
ever
had
its
not
that
strong
and
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
scotch
ale
it
is
however
a
solid
beer
just
not
one
to
sip
and
savor
like
i
was
expecting
to
get
i
wish
the
flavor
would
have
been
as
good
as
the
nose
flavor
was
thinner
than
i
expected
overall
a
pretty
good
sipper
o
this
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
glad
it
was
on
tap
at
44
stone
the
taste
is
actually
really
good
very
malt
forward
with
a
strong
caramel
presence
toffee
is
right
behind
in
second
but
its
close
its
so
smooth
and
drinkable
i
even
think
my
girl
might
like
how
sweet
and
tasty
this
is
thats
how
sweet
it
is
overall
not
a
typical
example
of
the
style
but
this
beer
stands
on
its
own
quite
well
o
slightly
lacking
in
hop
character
and
undercarbonated
but
pretty
good
overall
overall
the
beer
did
have
some
nice
flavor
profiles
for
the
price
however
it
was
not
really
worth
it
overall
a
nice
drinkable
balanced
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
final
thought
4
is
a
bit
much
for
7
or
so
ounces
but
at
7
abv
and
great
tasting
this
is
awesome
not
a
huge
rogue
fan
but
their
xs
line
is
solid
overall
pretty
good
not
mind
blowing
and
slightly
disappointing
from
the
nose
but
i
certainly
wont
turn
one
down
thats
for
sure
i
had
generally
been
unimpressed
with
this
lineup
by
rogue
but
this
ale
has
helped
restore
some
of
my
faith
i
dont
know
if
this
particular
brew
was
just
better
than
the
others
or
if
it
was
aging
it
alomst
two
years
either
way
it
was
a
wee
heavy
i
would
have
again
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace

me
o
definitely
one
of
the

ive
had
very
pure
tasting
lots
going
on
in
this
beer
great
flavors
and
very
nice
feel
to
it

i
had
about
11
more

elements
very
understated
almost
watered
down

use
a

what
there
is
is

nice

with
a
very
thin

nice

along
with
some
buttery
notes
buttery
nugget
and
toasty
on
the
palate
with
a
shot
of
fruitit
doesnt
tase
like
your
typical
wee
heavy
but
its
good
sweet
alcohol
begins
to
creep
at
warms
but
the
sweetness
never
becomes
obtrusive
likely
because
of
a
decent
shot
of
drying
hops
it
is
rogue
not
bad
but
it
isnt
true
to
stylei
would
like
to
try
on
cask
so
all
the
flavors
could
really
come
out
m
a
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
that
goes
a
long
way
to
making
this
beer
enjoyable
o
great
scotch
ale
it
is
very
rich
but
not
overtly
filling
great
taste
to
it
and
although
it
isnt
a
session
beer
i
could
get
stuck
drinking
this
for
a
long
time
happily
o
fantastic
scott
ale
great
balance
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
o
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
i
have
had
lots
of
rich
malt
flavor
would
certainly
seek
this
out
again
this
beer
has
elements
of
barley
wines
sweet
with
a
high
level
of
alcohol
it
is
a
thinbodied
but
low
carbonated
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
brown
ales
with
a
light
hop
bite
grade
b
o
a
drinkable
scotch
ale
whose
taste
is
affected
by
the
presence
of
alcohol
o
decent
brew
but
it
doesnt
taste
near
as
good
as
it
smells
o
enjoyable
brew
too
bad
it
was
just
a
small
bottle
would
drink
again
o
a
fairly
nondescript
beer
that
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
pick
out
of
in
a
lineup
of
mediocure
scotch
ales
o
not
the
best
scotch
ale
its
okay
but
ive
had
better
rogues
as
well
not
recommended
but
i
might
try
it
again

some

a

and
a

and
pretty
drinkable
but
perhaps
one
serving
is
enough
o
good
offering
nothiung
bad
about
this
scotch
imo
to
me
this
is
not
really
a
scotch
ale
it
is
certainly
a
decent
and
drinkable
beer
but
the
lack
of
caramelised
malt
complexity
and
esters
lets
this
down
grade
d
purchased
at
stoneys
4
99
each
overall
very
disappointed
in
this
one
as
i
was
expecting
more
it
just
seemed
too
bland
and
one
noted
maybe
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
but
if
this
was
the
representation
of
this
particular
beer
i
would
not
be
coming
back
to
this
one
again
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
has
a
very
unique
character
compared
to
many
others
of
this
style
too
bad
it
only
comes
in
tiny
single
bottles
from
the
minibottle
marked
bottled
in
2010
sampled
on
april
8
2011
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
comes
on
strong
with
a
powerful
chocolate
rush
and
malty
sweetness
the
body
is
slightly
heavy
and
at
the
same
time
sharp
the
alcohol
bite
is
pretty
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
so
are
the
chocolate
malts
and
dryer
hops
nicely
done
and
likeable
served
from
bottle
into
a
surly
darkness
snifter
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
slight
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
cream
and
dark
chocolate
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
the
flavor
profile
on
this
one
was
very
complex
and
quite
tasty
in
all
honestly
i
really
only
bought
this
one
for
the
little
bottle
but
glad
that
i
did
the
aroma
wasnt
too
bad
on
this
one
either
allaround
a
very
solid
brew
that
is
a
must
try
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
softer
and
the
body
seems
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
is
surprising
light
bodied
with
a
fairly
long
sweet
and
malty
finish
over
this
is
a
good
beer
but
a
one
and
done
for
me
because
of
the
extreme
sweetness
to
be
true
to
style
this
could
have
used
more
darker
malts
to
balance
the
slightly
cloying
sweetness
even
though
i
had
this
on
draft
i
understand
now
why
its
only
sold
in
such
small
bottles
some
would
have
a
hard
time
finishing
a
whole
bomber
of
this
best
after
a
year
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
id
swear
it
was
a
completely
different
animal
back
when
this
beer
only
came
in
the
7
ounce
xs
bottles
now
this
beer
just
comes
across
as
a
sweet
malty
wee
heavy
ale
its
ok
but
is
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
mouthfeel
drinkability
not
bitter
at
all
sort
of
like
a
smooth
whisky
flavor
very
light
bodied
and
delicious
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
have
this
ontap
definitely
a
differenttasting
beer
that
is
worth
checking
out
edit
i
am
an
idiot
for
not
realizing
this
was
an
xtra
special
feel
extra
special
after
enjoying
it
on
tap
for
that
matter
opinion
well
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
am
enjoying
drinking
it
i
am
not
sure
how
much
i
paid
for
this
little
bottle
but
i
imagine
that
it
was
too
much
i
am
not
trying
to
slam
the
beer
or
anything
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
example
so
i
would
expect
it
to
be
in
pretty
much
average
packaging
to
get
it
in
a
7oz
bottle
means
imo
that
this
is
super
fking
special
as
it
turns
out
it
is
ok
it
is
on
the
higher
side
of
this
style
and
coming
from
a
brewer
like
roue
it
is
clean
and
well
presented
overall
it
just
lacks
the
pizazz
that
you
would
expect
for
what
is
obviously
such
a
highly
acclaimed
beer
whatever
you
decide
it
doesnt
suck
thats
for
sure
too
bad
its
8
bucks
a
bottle
and
only
7
oz
id
like
more
if
it
wasnt
so
freaking
expensive
id
hate
to
see
the
prices
of
a
12
oz
or
even
a
bomber
still
good
though
glad
rogue
made
a
scotch
ale
and
more
of
this
style
should
go
this
route
d
easy
to
finish
this
bottle
is
too
small
for
a
beer
like
this
its
also
overpriced
i
figured
that
switching
from
the
large
format
ceramic
swing
top
bottles
would
cause
the
price
to
drop
but
i
was
wrong
i
dont
think
ill
be
willing
to
pay
for
this
ever
again
i
had
to
knock
the
drinkability
a
little
because
of
that
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
mild
burnt
toffee
scent
along
with
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
and
a
hint
of
peat
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
caramel
malt
flavor
along
with
a
touch
of
peat
smoke
the
burnt
toffee
character
is
reserved
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
just
an
average
scotch
ale
its
quite
reserved
for
the
xs
series
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
reddish
brown
hue
around
the
glass
not
much
head
is
formed
on
top
a
little
bit
of
lacing
stays
around
the
glass
the
nose
says
scotch
ale
its
got
a
smoky
aroma
mixed
with
bakers
chocolate
and
a
fruit
snack
note
that
melds
together
well
in
the
mouth
its
smoky
and
sweet
thats
the
way
xs
scotch
ale
rolls
the
peat
seems
to
echo
and
perfume
in
the
mouth
and
into
the
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
a
wee
prickly
the
body
being
medium
and
sweet
overall
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
but
the
4
pricetag
for
one
of
those
tiny
bottles
is
poor
bang
for
the
buck
i
just
wish
i
was
able
to
have
more
of
this
beer
is
bland
and
thin
with
a
late
taste
of
medium
roast
nothing
to
see
here
this
is
about
a
plain
as
a
beer
can
get
mcrogue
scotch
ale
from
a
tiny
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
mocha
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
and
piney
hops
flavor
follows
suit
on
the
maltier
side
a
bit
nutty
and
bready
hint
of
peat
but
not
as
smokey
as
other
examples
of
the
style
full
bodied
mouthfeel
a
decent
example
of
the
style
albeit
a
simple
one
easy
to
drink
but
they
need
to
put
this
brew
in
12
oz
bottles
not
a
bad
beer
all
in
all
its
really
drinkable
for
its
size
and
it
tastes
just
fine
butcall
me
pickybut
i
when
i
spend
five
bucks
on
an
8
ounce
bottle
of
beer
i
expect
that
beer
to
have
a
bit
more
going
on
than
this
one
does
not
disappointing
really
tho
not
stellar
by
any
means
this
held
up
reasonably
well
considering
it
is
only
7
but
the
rich
fullness
and
toffee
sweetness
has
mellowed
considerably
with
time
and
it
drinks
much
like
a
flat
60
shilling
rather
than
an
80
shilling
as
it
used
to
to
my
taste
still
these
guys
have
been
making
extreme
beers
hate
that
term
while
the
guys
in
delaware
and
san
diego
etc
were
still
home
brewing
the
body
was
fairly
decent
although
somewhat
thin
for
the
style
drinkability
was
pretty
especially
considering
this
isnt
among
my
favorite
styles
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
certainly
worth
picking
up
nip
and
trying
for
yourself
the
flavors
are
unfortunately
mild
especially
compared
to
the
rich
creamy
aromas
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
that
stands
out
either
just
kind
of
bland
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
get
one
of
the
really
small
bottles
because
that
is
all
i
want
this
was
a
thin
almost
nonexistent
beer
more
sweetness
than
anything
else
poured
a
wonderful
dark
brown
with
copper
flashes
of
light
throughout
with
excellent
head
and
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
very
deep
malty
scent
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
in
the
nose
wonderful
flavor
with
deep
malt
tones
a
great
smokiness
hints
of
peat
and
a
touch
of
caramel
goes
down
quite
smoothly
but
it
does
have
an
odd
almost
generic
flavor
on
the
tongue
at
the
very
end
i
am
very
let
down
by
this
beer
as
i
had
heard
good
things
about
the
older
version
by
far
my
biggest
disappointment
from
rogue
7oz
is
more
than
enough
d
nicely
done
there
is
a
great
deal
of
malt
character
with
an
appropriate
emphasis
on
toffee
while
the
malt
is
central
to
the
experience
there
is
more
than
enough
hop
character
to
balance
things
out
and
it
has
a
touch
of
english
bitter
character
as
a
result
the
yeast
comes
in
at
the
finish
with
some
red
apple
character
that
works
nicely
and
makes
for
a
drawn
out
finish
with
the
toffee
and
butterscotch
drinkability
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
above
average
but
the
astringency
prevented
it
from
being
great
i
will
certainly
try
to
brew
a
version
of
this
for
use
personally
but
maybe
i
will
decrease
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
slightly
and
sub
glacier
for
wilamette
drinkability
would
be
only
ok
if
this
thing
had
some
flavor
very
bland

com
bought
this
on
a
whim
at
payless
liquors
in
fishers
in
while
looking
for
3
floyds
brews
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
ive
known
for
awhile
smuttynose
is
considered
a
quality
brewer
but
this
is
the
first
of
their
beers
ive
ever
had
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
reminded
me
a
little
of
kahlua
and
the
appearance
is
nice
a
creamy
head
with
a
dark
auburn
body
this
is
a
very
smooth
scotch
ale
there
are
strong
chocolate
coffee
and
carmel
notes
the
moment
it
hits
the
tongue
followed
by
a
nice
complex
tangy
finish
it
seemed
to
get
better
the
further
into
the
bottle
i
got
very
impressed
smuttynose
scotch
ales
are
not
usually
my
favorite
but
this
is
one
ill
definitely
scoop
up
again
the
next
time
i
see
it
overall
this
is
the
biggest
scotch
ale
ive
tried
very
big
flavor
and
mouthfeel
definitely
a
sipper
it
went
great
with
my
familys
pretend
were
irish
meal
of
corned
beef
and
cabbage
overall
this
is
certainly
a
solid
beer
at
a
great
bomber
price
point
comes
off
malt
forward
and
has
great
appeal
to
scotch
lovers
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
hints
of
peat
smoke
and
toffee
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
only
hints
of
the
peat
smoked
malts
which
gives
way
for
the
nutty
and
sweet
flavors
to
shine
the
beer
finishes
with
only
a
slight
bitterness
and
the
carbonation
is
very
slight
so
the
beer
and
a
nice
dry
and
crisp
mouth
feel
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
scotch
ale
and
it
is
definitely

best
one
that
i
have
had
so
far

still

with
nothing
offputting

severely

well

question

it
says

on

there
be

is

and
nutty
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
quite
drinkable
and
makes
an
excellent
strong
nitecap
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
it
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
the
sweet

the
smoky
flavor
and
the
dark
bitterish
finish
from
the
22

bottle
purchased
from
bine
vine
in
san
diego
the
color
is
caramel
brown

is
topped
with
a
thin
head
which
gives
off
some
sticky
lacing
around
the
goblet
pleasant
aroma
consisting
mostly
of
molasses
and
kilned
smoke
that
takes
us
to
the
taste
which
is
very
surprising
it
could
have
been
the
cold
night

this
is
a
tasty
scotch
ale

time

not
a

beer
very
subtle
and
well
balanced

refreshing
overall
quite
unusual
a
very
good
approach
to
the
style

lots
of
fruity
i
notes
not
typically
experienced
in
a
scotch
ale
which
works
nicely
with
the
caramel
malty
sweetness
o
not
as
big
and
beefy
as
many
scotch
ales
youll
find
on
the
market
today
but
its
still
a
satisfying
malty
treat
theres
some
nice
complexity
and
nuance
a
more
subtle
approach
to
the
style
for
sure
o
really
nice
scotch
ale
the
peated
malt
is
not
overpowering
at
all
i
think
that
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
have
been
eminently
enjoyable
so
far
they
have
all
been
satisfying

the

this

wonderfully
creamy
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
quite
an
enjoyable
afterdinner
drink
o
i
enjoyed
the
smoky
nature
of
this
beer
because
it
helped
to
cut
through
the
strong
sweetness
and
syrupy
nature
that
is
usually
associated
with
beers
of
this
style
making
it
rather
drinkable
the
second
and
third
sips
were
even
better
i
really
liked
the
overall
round
and
full
body
this
ale
had
not
hoppy
not
bitter
not
too
much
of
anything
just
a
real
good
sipping
beer
overall
simply
a
very
enjoyable
scotch
ale
well
worth
a
try
o
overall
very
enjoyable
subtle
balance
of
flavors
although
i
do
wish
there
was
a
touch
more
peat
to
it
very
nice
it
hits
up
front
with
tingle
of
tasty
yeast
almost
like
a
belgian
not
in
flavor
but
in
feel
fresh
baked
bread
faint
caramel
and
some
rich
roasted
malt
are
all
there
in
a
harmony
of
flavor
this
is
very
tasty
and
almost
too
drinkable
with
subtle
complexity
a
very
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
odthe
smoked
peated
and
herby
aspects
of
this
beer
set
itself
apart
from
many
of
the
style
it
was
cool
but
like
a
few
others
from
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
i
found
this
to
be
a
bit
too
boozy
o
tasty
beer
that
is
pretty
nice
all
around
overall
pretty
much
on
par
with
the
style
hits

and
a

little
on
the
thin
side
ample

overall
this
was
pretty
good
its
obvious
that
the
brewing
process
was
done
properly
for
the
style
with
some
partial
fermentation
tastes
rendered
this
is
a
real
nice
scotch
all
that
accents
the
smoky

leaves

a
smoky

to
it
also
some
earthy

aroma
the
toasted
malt
and
smoked
peat
flavor
is
apparent
up
front
and
then
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
with
an
alcohol
bite
that
fades
into
a
toasted
grain
and
alcohol
flavor
and
warmth
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
and
peppery
feel
with
alcohol
warmth
definitely
a
quality
scotch
ale
it
tastes
like
this
is
the
beginning
of
whisky
here
very
similar
flavors
some
scotch
ales
are
heavy
on
the
caramel
malt
this
beer
is
not
and
has
a
very
pure
flavor
to
it
the
smoked
peat
and
alcohol
flavors
are
simple
yet
the
taste
is
very
deep
o
pretty
solid
offering
by
smuttynose
i
really
enjoy
the
uniqueness
of
this
brew
as
i
feel
that
the
herbal
spices
really
allow
for
a
nice
balance
with
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
glad
to
have
tried
it
just
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
it
i
wish
the
flavor
was
a
bit
stronger
but
i
liked
this
alot
great
balance
and
pretty
easy
drinking
a
bomber
of
this
solo
would
be
no
problem
which
is
rare
for
the
style
id
say
gotta
hunt
down
a
bottle
or
2
of
this
o
a
good
example
of
a
more
classic
style
doesnt
just
throw
smokiness
in
there
its
nice
and
subtle
leans
highly
on
the
malts
as
well
which
is
also
very
tostyle
this
would
definitely
age
well
simply
because
it
is
very
malt
forward
absolutely
worth
picking
up
o
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
as
a
comparison
to
see
how
it
has
developed
over
nearly
five
years
of
aging
im
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
an
incredible
beer
that
has
benefitted
immensely
from
bottle
conditioning
for
a
long
period
of
time
o
aged
too
long
but
i
still
like
it
i
bet
this
would
have
been
quite
nice
into
maybe
2009
at
the
latest
still
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
but
nearly
5
years
of
age
is
certainly
too
long
smutty
is
bringing
this
beer
back
this
year
after
a
several
year
hiatus
and
i
would
suggest
drinking
it
fairly
fresh
for
best
enjoyment
none
the
less
it
was
quite
good
very
sweet
malty
flavors
poured
as
part
of
a
barrel
tasting
this
is
from
the
2007
vintage
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
is
a
muddled
reddish
brown
coloring
with
a
yellowbeige
head
that
is
low
profile
and
clingy
slow
bubbling
of
carbonation
throughout
aromas
are
blended
well
with
a
fruit
cocktail
sweetness
earthy
notes
and
a
strong
aged
booze
character
flavors
are
robust
and
full
but
only
for
an
instant
earthy
malt
forward
with
currant
and
grape
character
abound
followed
by
an
earthy
somewhat
watery
caramel
apple
flavor
the
flavors
are
surprisingly
mild
and
subtle
from
the
aging
process
and
the
barrel
imparts
only
slight
woody
characteristics
the
aftertaste
is
no
different
with
a
light
effervescent
caramel
and
roasty
quality
the
finish
is
slick
and
oily
leaving
a
slightly
cloying
linger
on
the
palate
strong
and
flavorful
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
brine
and
peat
both
mellow
but
both
still
the
most
dominant
flavors
in
this
rather
mildly
flavored
brew
this
is
followed
by
toffee
burnt
sugar
and
a
mild
yeasty
fruitiness
oxidation
is
unbelievably
low
here
this
smells
and
tastes
remarkably
fresh
fresher
than
the
07
speedway
that
preceded
this
it
drying
and
mildly
smoky
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
pretty
excellent
medium
in
body
and
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
my
palate
this
is
rather
stunningly
good
just
a
hair
watery
but
not
enough
to
significantly
detract
from
enjoyment
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
highly
recommended
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
picked
up
an
aged
bottle
of
this
at
smuttynose
after
a
tour
and
opened
it
up
during
a
far
too
early
of
the
season
snowstorm
that
killed
the
power
nothing
special
during
the
pour
or
aroma
but
man
is
this
a
tasty
beer
nice
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
that
metallic
earthy
taste
i
love
to
find
in
a
good
scotch
ale
great
beer
that
i
wish
they
still
made
the
only
complaint
i
might
have
about
this
brew
is
that
the
aftertaste
is
vaguely
metallic
as
if
i
were
sucking
on
a
penny
still
thats
a
very
small
complaint
for
what
is
otherwise
a
great
scotch
ale
good
work
smutty
d
very
good
drinkability
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
but
its
nothing
something
over
which
id
clamor
to
have
again
worth
a
shot
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
order
again
alcohol
was
listed
in
the
menu
as
over
8
not
what
i
expected
from
a
scotch
ale
much
lighter
in
body
and
color
than
others
of
the
style
ive
tried
lets
face
it
smuttynose
does
not
make
a
bad
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
these
flavor
is
like
your
typical
wee
heavy
ale
with
an
ample
amount
of
biscuit
caramels
toffee
dark
fruits
and
peat
smoked
malts
finish
is
bittersweet
with
a
touch
of
spice
hoppiness
coming
through
to
balance
the
sweetness
not
the
best
example
of
a
scotch
ale
by
any
means
but
worth
the
try
for
the
value
d
as
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
scotch
ale
i
cant
make
a
comparison
between
aged
and
new
though
fresh
beer
is
usually
the
most
desirable
this
vintage
sipper
was
still
wonderful
thank
you
kind
and
distant
trader
for
sending
i
would
definitely
look
for
this
again
smooth
creamy
medium
body
with
lots
of
roasted
chocolate
maltiness
dark
fruitespecially
dark
cherry
licorice
and
surprisingly
earthy
and
floral
hops
nice
balance
of
malty
sweetnessroastiness
and
bitter
earthy
hops
this
beer
is
pretty
complex
but
unfortunately
it
just
doesnt
taste
that
good
to
me
would
i
buy
more
of
it
this
is
one
i
really
wish
i
could
get
more
of
it
fresh
so
i
could
see
what
it
was
like
right
off
the
bottling
line
the
second
chapter
in
todays
snow
day
beer
odyssey
did
not
disappoint
its
worth
a
try
particularly
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
other
big
smuttynose
beers
i
like
most
but
not
all
of
smuttynoses
offerings
but
the
scotch
style
ale
is
my
favorite
a
great
brew
ill
be
getting
much
more
of
this
one
overall
very
rich
and
tasty
fairly
complex
and
goes
down
pretty
easily
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
it
and
recommend
trying
it
if
you
can
a
sipper
as
it
should
be
but
more
due
to
the
potency
of
flavor
than
any
sort
of
assault
from
alcohol
d
moderate
but
very
nice
i
enjoyed
this
bomber
one
is
enough
but
ill
be
buying
more
thank
you
again
smuttynose
smuttynoses
good
game
led
me
to
hope
for
something
more
this
is
a
straightforward
interpretation
good
but
without
any
of
the
singular
character
ive
come
to
expect
from
smuttynose
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
picked
up
at
jessup
beverage
over
a
year
ago
bottle
conditioned
in
2007
printed
on
the
lower
right
corner
of
the
label
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
copper
color
with
crimson
hues
and
a
two
finger
thick
tan
head
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
smokey
peat
malt
brown
sugar
unripe
bananas
toffee
more
caramelized
malt
scotch
whiskey
notes
drinks
as
though
its
higher
than
8
2
higher
than
average
carbonation
levels
with
a
medium
body
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
leaves
the
tongue
a
bit
numb
and
tingling
after
every
sip
glad
i
tried
it
check
it
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
d
not
bad
wish
the
beer
was
a
bit
more
bold
in
flavor
though
being
on
the
milder
side
it
is
drinkable
though
d
this
is
a
great
brew
to
sip
after
dinner
overall
very
solid
scotch
ale
not
my
favorite
that
ive
encountered
and
could
have
been
a
little
thicker
for
my
liking
but
id
have
it
again
d
a
solid
and
interesting
scotch
ale
the
appearance
and
aroma
are
top
notch
while
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
slightly
above
average
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
and
it
has
peeked
my
curiosity
to
try
some
more
overall
a
very
well
done
beer
nice
and
flavorful
but
drinkable
as
well
the
smell
is
all
malt
sweet
big
thick
chewy
malt
the
taste
goes
down
the
same
road
thick
chewy
sweetness
warming
on
chilly
evening
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
are
the
strongpoints
the
thick
viscous
mouth
is
complimented
by
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
things
from
being
cloying
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
drinkability
a
very
mellow
scotch
ale
but
also
one
thats
brilliantly
balanced
and
delicious
this
was
probably
the
consensus
favorite
from
todds
tasting
light
to
medium
body
slightly
more
watery
than
expected
with
acidic
touch
into
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
d
strong
stuff
not
sure
on
its
food
friendliness
but
otherwise
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
notes
pretty
well
balanced
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
expected
great
edges
from
the
hops
and
alcohol
a
little
boozy
but
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
and
smooth
wow
i
cant
believe
i
just
used
the
word
smooth
pours
dark
brown
with
12
fingers
head
that
eventually
dissipates
good
carbonation
a
little
bit
of
lacing
but
really
just
leaves
a
thing
ring
of
foam
around
the
edge
of
the
beer
slightly
smoky
and
malty
nose
with
a
powerful
following
of
malts
alcohols
and
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
considering
the
abv
but
as
it
sits
the
alcohols
start
to
come
out
in
force
not
a
summer
beer
but
good
for
cold
days
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
and
this
ones
an
interesting
interpretation
its
complex
and
pleasant
but
a
little
on
the
dry
fruity
end
too
do
i
like
it
yes
would
i
like
perhaps
ever
so
slightly
a
little
more
sure
wouldnt
hurt
either
way
this
ones
good
another
solid
smuttynose
brew
and
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
it
for
a
good
drink
m
a
bit
watery
good
carbonation
this
is
a
really
nice
wee
heavy
and
not
to
be
confused
with
a
scottish
ale
a
big
brew
with
complex
flavors
but
so
damn
drinkable
be
on
alert
for
its
release
dates
enjoyed
at
the
first
warwick
drinking
societys
beer
tasting
session
of
the
year
at
ohooves
last
night
this
donation
from
ben
the
pull
up
king
pours
a
murky
greytan
color
with
a
full
and
lasting
light
oatmeal
colored
head
and
similar
lacing
the
aroma
is
not
nearly
so
meaty
as
the
appearance
but
hints
weakly
at
malty
smoke
but
its
hard
to
pick
up
the
subtleties
here
the
flavor
comes
charging
back
with
a
breadyearthy
malt
blended
into
a
smooth
somewhat
resinous
brew
that
goes
down
quite
nicely
i
like
how
this
captures
that
scotch
quality
a
touch
of
burnt
peat
and
alcohol
while
holding
the
neutralizing
sweetness
in
grainy
overtones
to
make
for
a
drinkable
pint
or
two
or
three
this
is
the
side
of
scotch
ales
that
i
like
although
perhaps
it
is
not
everyones
definition
of
the
style
put
this
one
on
your
shopping
list
pours
a
very
dark
shade
compared
to
other
scotch
ales
whereas
they
are
usually
very
colalike
this
is
more
like
root
beer
smell
is
a
bit
malty
but
not
too
noticeable
unless
you
really
focus
on
it
when
drank
in
a
more
social
setting
it
can
go
completely
unnoticeable
taste
is
a
bit
similar
its
got
a
roasy
malt
character
but
its
not
as
assertive
as
you
find
in
say
skullsplitter
or
such
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
is
in
there
as
well
as
an
earthy
woodlike
flavor
mouth
is
fairly
light
with
good
carbonation
its
easy
to
drink
down
the
whole
bomber
though
not
one
of
the
best
scotchs
score
another
for
smutty
dark
brownmahogany
colored
ale
with
a
flimsy
wispy
light
tan
head
nose
dominated
by
smoke
caramel
tinged
malts
with
a
touch
of
apple
flavor
lacks
malt
depth
has
a
poor
thin
mouth
feel
only
a
light
hint
of
smoke
with
a
touch
of
caramel
a
major
disappointment
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
fluffy
full
but
not
heavy
well
this
is
quite
delicious
initially
sweet
with
a
brown
sugar
and
maple
flavor
finishes
semi
dry
with
some
smokiness
peaking
through
as
well
as
a
warming
presence
of
alcohol
to
round
out
the
beer
nicely
smooth
and
soft
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
touch
of
carbonation
highly
drinkable
even
at
this
elevated
alcohol
content
i
will
be
picking
up
more
if
i
can
still
find
it
on
the
shelf
should
be
sublime
with
roasted
game
birds
lamb
and
beef
a
lovely
rich
copper
with
slight
haze
a
slight
flaw
a
coif
of
light
tan
foam
tops
the
ale
overall
still
the
head
clings
to
the
sides
nicely
and
has
excellent
legs
for
style
the
aroma
is
primarily
smoky
peat
and
earthy
minerals
the
hops
are
robust
for
the
scotch
ales
almost
too
its
detriment
the
caramel
malts
are
also
absent
tastes
of
roast
malt
and
smoky
flavor
the
mineral
flavor
as
well
as
a
dry
assertive
tannins
dominate
the
finish
smooth
with
an
alcoholic
warmth
too
thin
for
style
interesting
and
fairly
complex
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
it
really
strays
from
the
style
too
often
and
in
the
wrong
directions
i
feel
the
hops
presentation
is
more
in
line
with
a
scotch
export
d
very
drinkable
but
not
as
complex
as
others
in
the
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brown
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
brown
bread
malty
hint
of
peat
and
smoke
nice
aroma
though
not
very
strong
a
bigger
smoked
peat
presence
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
bready
malt
backbone
carob
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
feel
is
thick
and
chewy
fizzy
carbonation
makes
for
easier
drinking
there
is
some
belly
burn
from
the
abv
i
like
my
scotch
ales
with
some
smoke
flavor
and
this
delivered
nicely
i
didnt
pick
up
on
the
heather
which
would
have
been
nice

this
is
still
a
great
brew
another
great
smutty
d
im
loving
this
one
they
changed
the
recipe
this
year
year
to
a
beech
wood
smoked

from
peat
smoked
malt
just
a
really
drinkable
big
brew
smuttynose
is
sooo
underrated
d
a
decent
scotch
ale
overall
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
giving
another
shot
definitely
worth
a
trybut
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
pizazz
and
comes
across
as
a
text
book
example
of
the
stylebut
nothing
more
to
me
22oz

carmelly
sweet

taste
has
the
standard
sweetness
of
carmeltoffee
and
malt
but
accented
with
some
raisin
and
a
bit
of
apple
more
lively
in
the
mouth
than
it
appears
like
it
would
be
yet
sticky
enough
to
represent
the
style
well
nearly
no

me
always
quality
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
tan

it
smelled
like
nutty
malt
and
earthy
caramel
with
copper
hops
and
a
bit
of
roasted
coffee
sour
yeast
and
alcohol
it
tasted
like
earthy
caramel
and
nutty
malt
and
copper
hops
with
a
bit
of
creamy
yeast
and
grassy
hops
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
with
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
with
a
nice
clean
malty
character
it
had
good
body
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
harsh
maybe
some
aging
could
help
mellow
this
out
it
was
still
enjoyable
fresh
although
not
terribly
exciting
bomber
from
whole
foods
reston
va
purchased
a
few
months
ago
the
body
is
closer
to
full
than
moderate
easy
drinkability
but
leaves
some
flavor
into
the
finish
overall
very
nice
wee
heavy
to
be
really
picky
i
would
like
more
of
a
malt
character
and
less
on
estersalcohol
but
really
a
nice
beer
d
only
slightly
above
average
at
best
it
takes
awhile
to
warm
up
to
this
beer
thankfully
its
a
22oz
bomber
think
it
falls
short
in
comparison
to
others
top
in
class
founders
dirty
bastard
and
was
only
moderatly
good
in
overall
enjoyability
flavor
department
shows
a
classic
wee
heavy
ale
with
an
ample
amount
of
peat
smoked
malts
caramels
toffee
and
dark
fruits
finish
is
bittersweet
with
a
touch
of
spice
hoppiness
coming
through
to
balance
the
sweetness
not
a
topshelf
scotch
ale
but
worth
the
try
pours
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
red
color
big
foamy
tan
head
is
very
slow
to
fade
and
leaves
big
sheets
of
lacing
in
the
glass
deep
rich
malt
aroma
almost
a
burnt
caramel
smell
some
floral
citrus
hops
in
the
mix
too
smokey
flavors
earthy
some
big
yet
somehow
dark
citrus
flavors
pretty
fullbodied
some
lingering
bitterness
this
isnt
blowing
my
mind
but
certainly
tasty
and
well
worth
a
try
d
see
taste
t
flavour
comes
through
more
than
the
scent
bready
and
rather
spicy
malts
some
nice
hoppy
notes
that
i
just
dont
get
out
of
the
aroma
quite
nice
and
full
maybe
not
as
complex
as
some
but
very
good
still
it
drinks
well
prost
d
not
bad
but
one
would
probably
be
enough
for
me
i
am
always
happy
to
see
another
smuttnose
brew
on
the
shelves
of
the
charleston
beer
exchange
this
was
one
of
their
first
big
beer
series
brews
to
enter
sc
this
scotch
ale
looks
like
a
typical
scotch
ale
it
is
dark
browncopper
with
little
to
no
head
it
may
have
been
too
cold
in
smuttys
defense
it
smells
of
caramel
biscuit
malts
and
light
neutral
hops
the
taste
is
very
light
on
bitterness
it
has
a
nice
bready
and
malty
finish
medium
body
allows
for
an
easy
consumption
the
22oz
is
not
difficult
to
consume
if
you
are
drinking
alone
over
all
this
brew
is
decent
i
didnt
expect
any
extreme
flavor
or
exotic
spices
so
this
met
my
expectations
d
except
for
the
underwhelming
nose
this
is
a
great
wee
heavy
the
meatiness
is
filling
with
no
sign
of
of
the
slightly
high
alcohol
d
outstanding
drinkability
cant
wait
for
tomorrow
night
great
drinkability
and
another
great
big
beer
from
smuttynose
a
wonderful
early
winter
release
that
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
all
season
long
22oz

a

definitely
invites
another
i
wish
my
review
were
more
glowing
but
this
honestly
is
the
best
weeheavy
ive
ever
had
and
another
slamdunk
for
smuttynose
full
bodied
and
mouth
coating
a
terrific
beer
for
the
cool
weather
great
before
with
or
after
the
big
holiday
meal
and
at
7
8
not
the
overkill
on
the
booze
taste
or
effect
it
was
great
to
share
one
of
these
before
thanksgiving
dinner
another
great
beer
from
smutty
most
scotch
ales
imo
are
heavy
and
drinking
more
than
one
is
difficult
not
in
this
case
very
drinkable
nice
balance
and
just
a
hint
of
smoke
great
beer
overall
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
another
winner
from
smuttynose
worth
a
try
a
rich
and
warm
brew
that
works
well
on
a
cold
day
such
as
this
one
gotta
be
at
least
2530
degrees
out
now
its
not
the
most
complex
at
first
but
with
some
aging
this
beer
surely
can
only
get
better
with
time
d
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
the
2007
bottling
i
had
this
last
year
or
very
early
this
year
i
forget
and
the
aging
has
served
it
well
big
blast
of
smoke
and
peat
in
the
nose
sweet
caramel
and
raiseny
tastes
offset
by
smokiness
very
nice
hides
the
alcohol
well
but
is
still
a
sipper
the
sweetness
prevents
this
from
being
a
session
beer
in
my
book
ill
definitely
buy
a
few
of
these
every
year
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
hints
at
the
edges
and
a
bit
over
a
finger
of
rocky
light
khaki
head
that
is
relatively
persistent
and
leaves
some
great
lacing
nice
deep
malty
aroma
with
lots
of
caramel
and
some
nice
earthy
and
smoky
undertones
taste
is
very
complex
lots
of
malty
goodness
here
with
strong
doses
of
caramel
a
sturdy
but
not
overwhelming
smokiness
a
nutty
character
and
some
more
subtle
esters
raisinsplums
fairly
sweet
but
finishes
a
bit
dry
mediumfull
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
thick
mouthfeel
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
very
high
this
is
simply
exceptional
great
complexity
in
terms
of
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
all
in
all
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
pours
a
crystal
clear
brownish
red
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
laces
the
sides
on
the
way
out
smells
malty
lots
of
smoke
and
dark
fruit
in
there
with
the
smoke
being
the
dominant
aroma
tastes
of
smokey
malt
toffee
sweet
malty
goodness
a
little
roast
and
some
alcohol
peak
their
heads
up
in
the
middle
but
the
smoke
takes
over
for
the
finish
syrupy
mouthfeel
medium
to
thick
in
the
body
medium
carbonation
great
smokey
scotch
ale
im
going
to
have
to
try
one
from
last
year
and
compare
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
pleasant
experience
poured
a
cloudy
foggy
dark
brown
color
with
little
pieces
floating
and
settling
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
poured
a
thick
head
but
halfway
through
there
wasnt
much
left
malty
aroma
with
a
stronger
malt
tangy
flavor
with
some
spices
and
brown
sugar
was
a
little
harsh
not
terrible
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
drinkability
very
good
definitely
a
fall
brew
to
brush
the
chill
off
probably
an
acquired
taste
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
smoked
beers
despite
having
a
great
liking
for
this
style
i
find
most
of
them
to
have
a
subtler
milder
smokiness
but
sitting
with
this
acclimating
to
it
and
taking
it
for
what
it
is
it
grew
on
me
quickly
yet
another
impressive
brew
from
smuttynose
the
taste
starts
tart
smokey
with
some
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
of
tart
fruit
begins
to
be
apparent
nuts
a
vibrant
carbonation
with
just
enough
hops
to
tell
you
their
there
but
nothing
dominant
the
finish
is
again
smokey
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
in
the
finish
i
have
had
this
guy
in
my
beer
cellar
for
a
while
now
and
i
cracked
open
this
2007
version
the
other
day
to
celebrate
the
celtics
good
fortune
so
far
in
the
playoffs
poured
into
a
dfh
oversized
snifter
large
white
head
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
color
was
dark
brown
with
a
slight
hint
of
ruby
to
it
the
first
sniff
was
a
knockout
peat
and
smoke
all
up
in
the
nostrils
taste
was
delicious
too
lots
of
smokiness
and
caramel
notes
with
a
bit
of
raisins
thrown
in
the
mix
the
beer
is
a
pretty
hearty
so
just
a
bomber
is
all
i
needed
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
when
it
was
first
released
in
2007
and
it
was
really
peaty
a
year
later
this
beer
mellowed
out
a
bit
in
that
aspect
and
seemed
to
age
quite
nicely
can
find
them
drinks
good
for
the
abv
but
the
smokeyness
seems
a
bit
artificial
to
me
more
malt
backbone
is
needed
im
somewhat
suprised
this
one
didnt
measure
up
to
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
not
a
bad
little
scotch
ale
from
smuttynose
i
feel
i
have
had
better
though
from
other
craft
breweries
in
the
u
s
nothing
compares
to
the
ones
you
find
in
scotland
though
this
still
a
solid
beer
with
some
complexity
recommended
good
stuff
overall
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
could
perhaps
be
more
drinkable
if
it
didnt
end
so
harsh
just
a
little
bit
too
much
smoke
and
bitterness
for
me
at
the
finish
although
i
didnt
really
feel
that
way
until
about
midway
through
this
bomber
a
12
oz
beer
may
have
been
perfect
in
this
regard
big
but
very
drinkable
probably
not
more
than
a
bomber
in
an
evening
but
certainly
a
couple
of
points
is
not
out
of
the
question
if
you
had
it
on
draft
the
taste
gives
more
but
unfortunately
its
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
its
otherwise
great
but
a
wee
heavy
should
be
nearly
eatable
but
thats
not
stopping
me
from
liking
this
beer
all
the
characteristics
of
the
nose
but
better
it
just
falls
a
bit
short
which
is
upsetting
because
this
beer
should
be
fantastic
just
not
quite
having
lived
in
porstmouth
for
a
time
before
smutty
took
over
the
old
frank
jones
set
up
and
their
intial
offerings
i
have
a
very
special
place
for
these
guys
but
this
big
beer
series
is
a
disappointment
for
me
it
is
too
peatysmokey
and
unbalanced
in
the
end
of
the
flavor
profile
in
my
opinion
this
does
not
represent
the
scotch
alewee
heavy
style
at
all
it
is
more
of
a
scottish
rauchbier
i
would
not
recommend
the
smutty
scotch
ale
as
a
good
representation
of
this
beer
class
in
my
opinion
they
do
a
much
better
job
with
their
other
big
beer
series
a
scotch
ale
i
really
liked
great
malt
and
candi
with
a
fruity
mdi
sip
makes
this
very
drinkable
and
popular
carrying
the
peat
moss
smoke
which
is
controlled
and
you
can
smell
it
above
average
hoppiness
and
rich
brown
chcolately
colour
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
while
some
scotch
ales
inspire
nothing
but
eyerolling
with
every
strained
sip
this
ones
actually
pretty
tasty
thanks
again
to
mahars
for
another
great
brew
on
the
tap
another
good
one
from
smutty
i
would
have
another
in
a
heartbeat
the
flavor
sports
a
woody
smoky
element
which
manifests
itself
earlypeated
smoke
not
the
bamberg
kind
it
provides
a
bitter
and
harsh
fnish
actually
before
then
however
features
some
sweetness
that
sports
a
fair
complexity
pours
mildly
fogy
with
a
minimal
dark
crème
head
nose
is
nice
noticeable
malt
presence
with
some
almost
burnt
leaves
there
as
well
sweet
tones
lie
in
the
back
flavor
is
super
peat
its
just
like
peat
all
up
in
my
mouth
makes
motions
with
fingers
in
front
of
mouth
in
no
way
is
it
overdone
full
and
consistent
feel
is
full
with
carbonation
and
well
bodied
on
the
liquid
nice
to
drink
a
bit
too
much
going
on
here
to
go
far
beyond
large
sips
but
its
still
pretty
darn
good
a
great
way
to
start
my
ol
bday
off
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
underlying
flavors
but
the
bandaid
is
pretty
dominating
disappointing
is
the
best
descriptor
for
this
beer
i
bought
2
bombers
and
will
be
cellaring
the
secondary
for
a
good
year
to
see
if
this
improves
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
the
smutty
folks
overall
its
beer
years
since
my
last
sampling
of
this
one
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
flavourful
in
the
past
and
certainly
dont
recall
the
smoke
flavours
which
were
a
very
nice
touch
well
worth
a
bottle
or
two
if
you
see
it
around
aftertaste
of
smokey
malts
pleasant
and
letting
you
know
that
you
are
in
the
midst
of
enjoying
a
wonderful
scotch
ale
2007
bottle
smuttynose
scotch
ale
pours
a
deep
red
brown
with
a
beautiful
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
slightly
smokey
with
hints
of
the
malt
to
follow
the
flavor
is
malty
but
not
too
sweet
with
hints
of
peast
smoked
malt
there
is
some
fruitiness
but
not
a
lot
and
the
same
with
the
hops
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
the
smokiness
comes
through
a
bit
more
in
the
finish
but
still
not
over
the
top
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavor
is
the
only
hint
of
the
strength
im
on
a
scotch
ale
jag
right
now
and
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
really
fantastic
smell
the
scotch
vibe
hits
hard
the
appearance
is
average
but
i
dont
know
that
ive
had
one
that
was
really
distinctive
in
this
area
might
be
too
bubbly
for
a
scotch
ale
but
very
drinkable
the
scotch
taste
does
very
well
the
ol
red
wee
heavy
form
erie
is
the
closest
i
can
think
of
pretty
damned
good
beer
pours
with
a
nice
frothy
textured
head
dark
mahagoney
reddish
brown
really
good
traditional
smokey
peaty
malty
flavor
bit
thin
in
body
but
not
bad
drinkable
maybe
a
session
beer
decent
finish
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
in
a
boozey
warming
sensation
good
cool
weather
ale
deep
reddish
colorsomewhat
of
a
caramel
bronze
not
much
in
th
way
of
aromaslightly
malty
and
smoked
malty
enough
flavor
but
an
acrid
sharp
smoke
taste
to
it
quite
medicinal
and
solvent
like
ok
body
flavor
is
really
a
let
down
a
perfect
example
of
a
us
brewery
doing
a
scotch
ale
and
doing
it
wrong
smoke
is
way
overdone
takes
away
from
any
malt
whatsoever
cant
see
it
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
can
see
myself
drinking
it
again
if
i
wasnt
so
nice
and
shared
this
bottle
i
easily
could
have
consumed
it
in
its
entirety
and
loved
it
the
only
drawback
was
the
mouthfeel
but
the
overall
experience
was
enjoyed
good
example
of
a
scotch
ale
d
very
drinkable
once
it
warms
another
fine
example
of
the
quality
brewing
at
smuttynose
i
enjoyed
this
as
much
as
the
other
big
beer
series
beers
i
have
tasted
a
nice
weeheavy
i
was
served
this
beer
from
the
bottle
into
my
sniffer
glass
the
aroma
was
a
sweet
toasted
malt
there
was
a
hint
of
apples
and
alcohol
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
this
beer
the
smoke
grain
characteristic
was
pronounced
which
is
a
flavor
i
find
desirable
the
hop
presence
lended
the
beer
a
dry
perception
while
the
alcohol
gave
it
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
grainy
i
am
not
sure
this
is
a
beer
i
would
drink
a
full
pint
of
but
with
such
an
intriguing
flavor
it
really
was
enjoyable
to
sip
taking
down
a
bomber
of
this
is
easy
business
since
its
so
tasty
and
enjoyable
not
a
bad
beer
this
one
but
not
my
favorite
from
smuttynose
probably
because
of
that
ingredient
that
skews
my
olfactory
senses
strange
still
its
worth
trying
as
smuttynose
rarely
do
any
bad
beers
every
time
i
have
a
good
scotch
ale
i
think
boy
its
been
too
long
this
one
makes
me
feel
like
a
bit
of
a
fool
for
waiting
as
long
as
i
did
its
so
wonderfully
basic
and
comfortably
yummy
that
its
almost
like
a
chicken
soup
of
beers
whatever
the
abv
is
it
hides
especially
well
and
drinks
just
as
well
for
it
its
not
going
to
be
too
long
this
time
before
i
enjoy
my
next
good
scotch
ale
i
have
two
more
bottles
of
this
waiting
for
me
poured
into
a
chalice
a
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
tan
head
some
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
spicy
slightly
dark
fruits
figs
raisins
prunes
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
and
some
good
tones
of
dark
fruit
and
spice
and
caramel
the
taste
is
also
slightly
sweet
nice
warming
efffect
going
down
medium
body
very
drinkable
another
awesome
brew
from
smuttynose
getting
close
to
having
quite
a
few
offerings
from
them
highly
recommended
the
beer
menu
at
maxs
lists
this
as
a
7
8
abv
beer
but
otherwise
its
pretty
much
the
same
as
sampled
previously
l
this
is
a
nice
one
to
sip
complex
maltiness
with
an
intermingling
peat
smokiness
makes
this
one
a
good
example
of
the
style
welldone
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
wasnt
thrilled
at
first
but
then
it
started
to
grow
on
me
not
my
favorite
scotch
ale
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
i
poured
this
big
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
caramel
colored
brew
with
a
fat
fat
creamy
head
the
head
actually
decayed
rather
fast
the
smell
was
of
caramel
and
malt
that
smelled
like
it
had
been
around
a
campfire
with
a
hint
of
smoke
the
taste
was
kinda
strong
big
robust
malty
smoky
hit
that
stunned
you
for
a
monment
did
not
really
like
the
first
few
hits
but
then
it
started
gerowing
on
me
i
ended
up
listing
it
as
a
buy
again
it
is
an
interesting
beer
try
it
for
yourself
very
very
nice
i
do
not
think
the
recipe
has
changed
once
again
and
that
is
a
good
thing
this
is
a
wonderful
version
of
the
style
with
a
bolder
than
average
flavor
profile
and
a
wonderful
feel
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
in
the
style
and
i
find
myself
saying
that
about
most
of
the
smuttynose
beers
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
scotch
ale
this
would
be
one
of
the
first
beers
that
i
would
look
for
22
oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
tightly
packed
lightly
tan
head
over
top
there
is
a
very
steady
stream
of
carbonation
stirring
in
the
brew
clarity
on
this
one
is
very
good
taking
in
the
aroma
i
find
a
strong
peated
and
lightly
phenolic
smokeyness
over
top
a
caramel
malt
base
i
think
i
am
getting
some
buttery
diacetyl
in
there
but
this
may
be
a
interplay
between
other
aromas
from
the
brew
the
flavor
is
more
robust
than
the
aroma
i
get
a
very
nice
bready
character
that
mingles
with
peated
smokeyness
and
light
caramel
it
just
feels
deep
and
dark
not
it
a
roasted
sense
but
in
a
smoky
sense
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
very
weak
carbonation
it
works
very
well
with
the
flavors
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
the
smokeyness
and
peatyness
blend
with
the
mild
sweet
caramel
malt
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
carbonation
in
it
but
it
still
is
nice
as
it
stands
i
would
have
this
one
again
for
sure
cheers
looks
delicious
dark
brown
and
with
much
sediment
a
very
nice
creamy
tan
colored
lasting
head
forms
and
a
fairly
strong
sweet
aroma
both
smell
and
taste
have
a
bit
of
molasses
in
em
bitterness
fades
as
the
beverage
is
consumed
leaving
a
nice
sticky
sweetness
mouth
feel
is
quite
nice
as
it
is
somewhat
thick
and
buttery
i
suppose
i
didnt
pour
carefully
enough
as
the
sediment
was
a
bit
dangerous
but
other
than
that
i
found
this
beer
quite
drinkable
good
for
sipping
and
enjoying
over
some
time
poured
a
cloudy
deep
mahogony
color
with
boisterous
tannish
creamy
head
nice
coating
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
a
fine
mixture
of
caramel
and
toffee
taste
brings
a
stong
malt
note
without
being
overly
sweet
very
enjoyable
creamy
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
bitterness
presents
itself
at
the
finish
to
cap
off
a
nice
wellrounded
beer
great
almost
scary
drinkability
in
a
7
8
beer
vibrant
deep
red
with
mahogany
hues
at
bottom
of
glass
thin
head
retained
well
sexy
abstract
and
intricate
lacing
left
behind
by
beer
as
artist
maybe
its
my
mood
caramel
malty
sweetness
in
the
nose
balanced
well
with
a
touch
of
hops
tho
it
is
a
bit
too
faint
maybe
a
bit
herbal
wonderful
upon
the
sip
big
malt
sweetness
with
hazelnut
and
caramel
even
chocolate
way
back
there
somewhere
swishing
it
around
then
the
williamettes
steps
forward
swelling
with
a
sort
of
sweet
bitterness
that
segues
well
out
of
the
initial
maltiness
smack
of
coffee
in
a
last
death
spasm
before
the
swallow
nice
long
finish
after
this
final
impression
with
a
gradual
sweetness
replacing
it
smuttynose
nails
the
mouthfeel
excellent
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
intensely
and
then
settles
into
an
impressively
full
and
malty
body
actually
seeming
fuller
than
it
is
a
neat
trick
really
some
alchoholtype
warmth
and
a
nice
soft
malty
remainder
bringing
up
the
tail
a
brew
thats
not
hard
to
quaff
and
important
to
savor
seems
half
a
year
to
a
year
in
the
cellar
for
these
scotch
big
beers
yields
balanced
and
ripe
results
i
appreaciated
this
beer
more
tonight
than
i
ever
had
a
super
solid
scotch
style
ale
a
good
flavored
scotch
ale
with
a
silky
consistency
a
noble
well
crafted
offering
d
poor
here
i
cant
envision
drinking
this
again
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
scotch
ales
in
general
but
this
one
seemed
a
bit
below
the
others
ive
had
it
had
less
odd
qualities
but
stuck
with
the
tradition
of
being
absurdly
hard
to
drink
i
passed
the
rest
of
this
bomber
off
to
a
friend
a
redbrown
body
crowned
with
a
white
head
that
sinks
back
fast
and
rings
the
glass
giving
some
lace
mostly
smells
of
sweet
malt
but
some
smokey
hints
and
a
herbal
note
or
two
a
tasty
number
with
a
little
smokeyness
reminicent
of
belhaven
and
a
good
malt
flavor
but
the
hops
or
herbs
give
a
little
offflavor
good
body
and
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
d
definatly
a
heavier
warmer
beer
very
well
balanced
would
drink
again
for
sure
however
i
probably
couldnt
do
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
thanks
to
dmeadows
for
the
beer
which
i
recieved
via
trade
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
just
where
i
want
it
this
style
has
really
grown
on
me
and
smutty
does
it
right
on
this
one
goes
down
so
easily
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
drinkable
aye
laddie
aye
body
hovers
between
medium
and
large
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
chewy
dextrous
mouthfeel
and
smooth
texture
the
taste
is
a
bit
bolder
the
sweet
maltiness
really
warms
the
body
i
feel
as
if
the
alcohol
flavor
is
too
much
theres
a
bit
of
booziness
in
there
and
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
hidden
better
its
a
very
sweet
warming
beer
though
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
over
the
ultimate
wee
heavy
that
being
belhavens
i
was
impressed
and
enjoyed
this
wee
heavy
quite
a
lot
a
great
balance
of
flavors
with
an
abundance
of
sweetness
and
malt
not
a
session
brew
but
perfect
to
sip
and
enjoy
on
a
cold
night
this
beer
poured
deep
dark
amber
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
that
reduced
quickly
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
smoky
peaty
malts
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
some
alcohol
very
reminiscent
of
glenfiddich
more
of
the
alcohol
was
released
with
a
vigorous
pour
for
the
second
glass
i
love
the
full
body
of
this
beer
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
it
leaves
a
glycerin
type
film
in
the
mouth
it
left
some
legs
on
the
glass
like
a
big
wine
the
flavor
is
slightly
bitter
at
first
then
the
smoky
peat
takes
over
and
i
get
a
strong
taste
of
a
brandy
chocolate
covered
cherry
i
have
to
go
find
more
of
this
beer
i
think
it
is
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
a
wonderful
beer
its
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
fairly
substantial
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
had
a
predominately
malty
aroma
the
taste
was
more
complex
my
crummy
taste
buds
could
pick
out
fruit
and
malt
with
a
hoppy
backtaste
it
felt
very
smooth
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
25oz
bottle
was
just
the
right
amount
first
selection
ive
tried
from
those
at
smuttynose
what
a
great
name
thick
frothy
head
even
as
a
taster
quite
malty
indeed
easier
to
drink
than
i
first
thought
nice
bit
of
lacing
with
slight
carbonation
in
the
glass
one
of
the
better
scotch
style
ales
ive
tried
but
some
ive
tried
before
were
stifled
due
to
the
less
than
6
abv
cap
in
the
past
i
dont
think
you
could
have
too
much
of
this
in
one
sitting
as
it
is
so
filling
but
it
sure
does
go
down
easily
smuttynose
scotch
style
ale
is
one
i
would
definitely
like
to
come
back
to
bomber
bottle
wo
freshness
dating
pours
murky
and
cloudy
dark
chocolate
in
color
with
a
long
lasting
tan
head
leaves
extensive
sticky
lacing
nose
is
of
some
more
chocolate
and
peaty
earthy
goodness
this
is
a
smooth
full
bodied
brew
notes
of
semi
sweet
chocolate
more
peat
some
smoky
brandy
and
dark
berries
tasty
smokey
and
also
sweet
this
is
a
nice
malty
brew
with
pleanty
of
character
and
flavor
the
last
pour
adds
a
healthy
dose
of
yeast
adding
to
the
richness
and
complexity
chalky
dryness
late
well
worth
a
try
smuttynose
scotch
ale

in
a
22oz

a
nice
big
thistle
on

label
pours
a
slighly
hazy
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
tan

aroma
is
roasty
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
peat
with
maybe
a
slight
touch
of
spicy
hops
taste
is
dominated
by
caramel
and
roasted
flavors
with
some
chocolate
as
well
but
a
nice
dry
finish
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
full
without
being
slick
due
to
an
ample
amount
of
carbonation
no
sense
that
this
beer
is
7
8
extremely
drinkable
excellent
brew
cant
wait
for
next
in
the
series
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
amongst
all
of
those
malts
this
was
the
beer
that
inspired
me
to
consume
many
wonderful
craft
beers
another
good
brew
from
smuttynose
awesome
from
start
to
finish
for
the
next
bottle
i
need
to
get
some
dark
chocolate
ill
bet
that
would
be
a
perfect
desert
drinkability
is
okay
it
tastes
good
enough
to
leave
you
wanting
more
and
it
makes
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
night
i
will
pick
this
up
occasionally
but
it
will
not
be
one
of
my
gotos
murky
mahogany
brown

i
say

quite
caramelly

with
a

this
beer
just
gushes

not
nearly
cloying

becomes
more
and
more
apparent
as
it
warms

to
full
bodied
milder
carbonation
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
this
ones
a
deliciously
sweet
fullon
caramel
malt
bomb
d
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
i
find
that
the
winelike
characteristics
pull
it
a
bit
out
of
style
for
my
tastes
i
would
even
venture
to
say
that
this
beer
teeters
on
the
brink
of
being
a
porter
or
a
winter
warmer
my
tongue
says
porter
for
some
reason
more
robust
than
expected
full
bodied
and
pretty
easy
to
put
down
a
solid
offering
from
the
big
beer
series
i
will
be
getting
this
all
the
time
i
think
i
can
see
me
drinking
this
all
year
long
thanks
to
the
ultra
drinkability
medium
heavy
body
smooth
and
mildly
crisp
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
long
on
the
malt
and
peat
this
is
well
worth
seeking
out
an
extremely
enjoyable
and
flavorful
brew
another
tasty

series
by

the

lowered

this
will
keep
the
dampness
of
the
day
from
getting
to
mevery
solid

a
style
i
really
enjoy
i
would
drink
this
again
anytime
very
pretty

just
a
bit
of
haze
sticky

on

the
nose
is
malts
kick
me
in
the
nose
malts
but
they
come
across
as
bittersweet
not
all
sugars
tha
flavor
is
very
complex
in
the
malts
sweet
followed
by
an
over
sweet
that
comes
across
as
almost
sour
like
sweet
and
sour
also
just
a
tad
of
some
gummy
candylicorice
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
cloying
it
sticks
around
long
after
the
swallow
very
drinkableworked
my
way
through
my
glass
before
i
realized
it
pours
an
almost
opaque
brown
with
small
red
highlights
and
a
frothy
head
the
nose
is
basically
nonexistent
but
that
isnt
surprising
for
this
style
of
ale
the
taste
however
is
really
rich
deep
toasted
malt
that
is
slightly
smokey
but
without
any
rough
edges
it
is
not
really
hoppy
or
bitter
the
malt
is
the
center
piece
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
im
a
big
fan
of
belhaven
and
this
is
a
comparable
offering
at
a
very
good
price
around
5
a
bomber
good
for
a
cold
day
on
the
moors
to
be
sure
a
clean
dark
copper
beer
has
a
creamy
beige
head
a
whiff
of
alcohol
then
some
hops
and
lastly
amalty
sweetness
rounds
out
the
aroma
the
flavor
starts
out
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
licorice
and
ends
with
a
balance
of
hops
and
alcohol
warmthin
the
finish
i
feel
that
ive
been
too
hard
on
smuttynose
scotch
style
ale
but
only
because
i
wanted
to
love
it
i
dont
but
i
do
like
it
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
its
a
much
better
than
average
version
and
is
a
beer
that
im
enjoying
immensely
despite
my
bitchin
and
moanin
recommended
mouthfeel
is
full
creamy
and
chewy
goes
down
smooth
and
coats
the
palate
nicely
an
easily
drinkable
brew
but
a
bomber
is
enough
for
me
scotch
ale
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
however
smuttynose
has
done
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
look
forward
to
more
from
the
big
beer
series
drinkability
good
not
sure
i
could
down
another
22oz
but
another
glass
sure
tastes
great
refreshing
and
drinkable
for
such
a
dark
beer
very
sweet
and
rich
with
the
intense
malt
character
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
give
it
some
individuality
in
the
style
no
bitterness
is
another
surprise
would
drink
this
again
foamy
with
some
large
bubbled
frothiness
and
light
lacing
throughout
deep
rubylight
brown
hue
peaty
earthy
malt
and
smoked
flax
crunch
on
nose
controlled
clambake
roasted
character
on
mouth
to
start
with
just
a
touch
of
spiciness
comprised
of
black
pepper
licorice
and
liquid
smoke
sveltebodied
action
that
grows
and
grows
on
me
though
not
sure
id
have
more
than
one
as
you
pour
it
its
not
hard
to
coax
a
head
on
this
rich
but
still
drinkable
beauty
from
smuttynose
its
hazy
cherrystained
mahogany
body
appears
almost
black
as
it
sits
upon
the
bar
and
reveals
beautiful
gleaming
ruby
accents
when
held
to
the
light
the
creamy
ivorycolored
cap
upon
its
head
holds
quite
well
before
it
drops
slowly
to
a
wide
collar
and
lacy
surface
covering
and
it
leaves
some
minor
lacing
about
the
glass
as
well
dry
caramelish
malt
with
the
suggestion
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
yeasty
fruitiness
and
a
subtle
waft
of
roastiness
greets
you
in
the
nose
its
smooth
and
creamy
across
the
palate
with
a
gentle
caress
of
bubbles
that
awaken
the
tastebuds
and
a
full
body
that
smooths
them
out
as
is
appropriate
for
the
style
the
flavor
is
malty
and
rich
but
reigned
in
by
a
sublime
touch
of
roastiness
a
concisely
handled
firm
bitterness
a
sprinkling
of
subdued
mildly
floral
and
grassy
hop
flavors
and
a
soft
caress
of
alcohol
well
done
22
oz
with
no
bottledon
or
freshness
date
and
my
first
scotch
ale
pours
a
deep
amberred
with
a
23
finger
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
and
a
thin
layer
of
foam
smell
is
malt
nuttiness
dark
fruits
as
it
warms
alcohol
and
hops
in
the
background
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
tastes
malty
chocolate
nuts
with
a
warming
alcohol
kick
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
whiskey
has
a
slight
belgian
taste
and
the
malts
make
it
almost
chewy
the
taste
and
aroma
of
alcohol
lower
the
drinkability
but
despite
this
i
finished
the
bomber
fairly
quickly
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
solid
enjoyable
wee
heavy
shared
a
bottle
of
this
with
david
at
thanksgiving
and
just
found
my
review
in
my
notebook
cola
colored
when
poured
white
head
was
quick
to
arrive
and
then
died
down
as
we
drank
this
brew
i
enjoyed
the
maltiness
in
the
aroma
tastewise
most
of
what
i
am
experienced
is
rich
malt
with
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
i
find
the
body
medium
with
a
tingly
sensation
that
seems
to
come
more
from
the
hops
than
the
carbonation
easy
drinking
medium
bodied
brew
finished
dry
but
smoky
i
took
off
points
of
the
taste
due
to
the
hop
presence
not
being
traditional
for
the
wee
heavy
style
not
sure
whether
a
wee
heavy
needs
to
be
any
bigger
than
they
already
are
hops
detracted
from
the
strong
malt
baseinteresting
and
drinkable
nonetheless
rustic
looking
auburn
tone
a
bit
hazed
the
cigarette
stained
light
brown
head
leaves
adequate
lacing
aroma
is
heavy
in
its
maltiness
yet
quite
clean
a
little
peat
like
smokiness
is
picked
up
as
well
overall
the
taste
is
pleasing
but
very
mellow
a
little
black
cherry
in
the
flavor
and
some
wood
tones
cedarlike
soft
maltiness
and
subdued
flavor
profile
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
very
agreeable
smooth
velvety
and
creamy
this
makes
for
a
nice
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
but
it
wont
wow
the
hell
out
of
you
great
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
sans
the
abv
this
one
is
almost
chewable
but
yet
isnt
that
heavy
damn
tasty
rich
malty
taste
a
big
dose
of
toasty
caramel
and
toffee
up
front
fading
into
notes
of
candied
fruits
biscuit
plum
a
real
distinct
earthy
hop
flavor
in
there
too
but
these
flavors
may
be
separate
unto
themselves
perhaps
im
tasting
a
peat
flavor
there
is
something
like
a
smokiness
but
not
quite
maybe
woody
also
a
little
buttery
but
only
faintly
after
readin
a
couple
of
other
reviews
i
notice
a
sweet
tobacco
flavor
in
the
mix
as
well
nice
smooth
full
body
overall
i
have
to
say
its
a
pretty
damn
good
wee
heavy
maybe
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
nose
today
ill
pick
up
another
soon
to
make
sure
more
than
worth
atleast
a
try
for
any
fan
of
scotch
ales
mouthfeel
is
medium
sweet
without
cloying
very
complex
smooth
and
creamy
more
alcohol
in
the
aroma
than
comes
through
in
the
taste
heavier
on
the
brown
ale
flavors
than
traditional
scottish
ale
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
many
thanks
to
malto
for
convincing
his
company
to
send
him
to
dallas
on
business
as
a
ruse
for
transporting
beer
sheer
genius
taste
this
review
was
from
a
22oz
bottle
this
poured
out
a
caramel
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
there
was
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
retention
or
lace
here
just
a
light
scattering
of
bubbles
shortly
after
this
was
poured
aroma
was
malty
sweet
and
quite
fruity
there
was
a
touch
of
caramel
in
the
mix
as
well
taste
starts
off
fruity
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
there
was
not
much
else
i
could
get
from
the
taste
it
was
fairly
simple
and
mild
for
the
style
the
flavor
ended
with
a
mild
lingering
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
creamy
drinkability
is
pretty
good
also
while
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
scotch
ale
its
definitely
not
a
bad
one
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
one
in
the
future
this
is
a
very
drinkable
scotch
style
ale
the
malty
and
creamy
profile
makes
this
a
beauty
great
interpretation
of
this
style
and
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
yet
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
strong
nut
brown
type
scent
to
it
it
is
rich
in
pale
crystal
and
victory
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
roasted
barley
flavor
to
it
along
with
crystal
and
pale
malts
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
a
bit
warm
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
it
is
not
real
thick
yet
it
has
an
elevated
abv
and
great
flavor
this
is
a
great
drinker
and
another
winner
from
smuttynose
bender
factor
this
brew
will
seriously
degrade
your
typing
skills
the
abv
is
detectable
not
astringent
bombers
are
the
real
deal
i
have
had
better
scottish
ales
maybe
this
one
needs
to
age
awhile
to
develop
its
character
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
mug
this
beer
was
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
tam
head
and
a
mild
lace
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
malt
that
gives
the
nose
both
a
sweet
and
roastedsmoky
character
the
flavor
has
the
smoky
malt
flavor
in
the
front
of
the
taste
with
more
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
mild
hop
finish
it
has
an
appealing
lightness
to
the
mouth
feel
and
seems
very
drinkable
as
with
all
of
the
big
beer
series
this
one
is
a
nice
version
worth
a
taste
very
thick
malty
flavor
with
alcohol
taste
subduded
by
a
slight
sweetnessbitterness
the
body
and
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
sam
adamsdouble
bock
alot
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
this
style
of
beer
even
though
its
not
a
true
scotch
ale

59
22
oz
22
ounce
bottle
there
is
no
real
alcohol
present
in
the
aroma
flavor
or
finish
so
at
8
this
one
is
a
sleeper
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
white
head
the
nose
was
fairly
hoppy
rather
than
malty
this
beer
is
not
a
true
scottish
ale
in
that
the
hops
really
make
the
finish
bitter
lots
of
malty
goodness
but
a
lack
of
sweetness
that
i
come
to
expect
from
this
style
i
liked
this
beer
as
a
variation
of
this
style
its
a
nice
attempt
at
a
scotch
ale
but
the
bitter
roasted
malts
really
overpowered
any
sort
of
smooth
classic
scotch
ale
characteristics
sort
of
more
like
a
porter
mixed
with
a
scotch
ale
decent
beer
but
ill
pass
next
time
22oz
bottle
i
was
suprised
that
it
came
out
of
the
bottle
a
dark
amber
hue
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
brown
color
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
that
died
down
rather
quickly
the
aroma
has
hints
of
roastiness
peat
maybe
some
hops
down
in
there
the
taste
hits
you
with
a
balanced
mix
of
chocolate
coffee
roastiness
very
malty
there
is
some
smokiness
and
some
fruits
hidden
in
there
as
well
this
gets
better
with
each
sip
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
classic
example
of
style
imho
loads
of
malt
cut
with
appropriate
bitterness
mediumfull
body
its
good
but
the
sweetness
would
get
cloying
to
me
so
i
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
it
appearance
ruddy
burgundy
creamy
off
white
head
leaves
specks
of
lacing
not
bad
aroma
reserved
smokiness
rich
fruit
and

of

blends
beautifully
a
deep
bready
character
weighs
in
with
the
rich

very
nice

definitely
classifies
as
a
big

a

in

medium
bodied
ale
with
a
smooth
carbonation
hard
to
believe
how
easy
it
was
to
polish
off
one
with
a
friend
drinkability
could
a
drink
a
couple
of
course
however
save
these
for
special
occasions
and
share
with
friends
they
will
enjoy
imbibing
on
this
bad
boy
thick
and
somewhat
oily
smacks
of
malt
sweetness
with
a
thick
caramel
presence
of
course
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
considering
its
substantial
body
reminds
me
just
a
bit
of
the
light
creamy
almost
buttermilk
smoothness
of
arcadia
scotch
ale
it
certainly
has
a
light
nicely
subdued
hop
presence
that
lends
a
little
leafy
bitterness
to
the
end
but
this
is
just
an
awesome
brew
for
malt
lovers
and
scotch
ale
fans
teacolored
with
orange
highlights
where
the
light
gets
through
has
a
quickly
receding
foamy
light
brown
head
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
some
hop
smells
getting
through
and
some
hints
of
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
envelopes
the
mouth
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
some
molasses
and
a
bit
of
raisin
not
sweet
like
some
scotch
ales
and
very
even
the
abv
hides
beneath
the
flavor
and
does
not
overpower
the
tongue
it
was
a
bit
hard
during
this
session
for
me
to
crack
its
complex
of
flavors
any
hint
of
smoked
peat
so
i
just
continued
to
enjoy
its
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
bravo
as
far
as
the
appearance
think
pepsi
not
darken
it
a
shade
or
two
and
you
know
what
this
brew
looks
like
the
aroma
is
pleasant
but
very
subtle
a
bit
of
malt
some
floral
hints
and
just
a
tinge
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
this
is
a
brew
that
feels
good
the
taste
however
is
what
makes
this
brew
remarkable
it
is
extremely
complex
and
i
found
myself
experiencing
different
beers
with
every
sip
sometimes
even
during
the
same
draw
there
were
woody
flavors
spices
like
clove
and
cinnamon
and
a
world
of
other
tastes
every
time
i
tried
to
capture
the
flavor
to
describe
it
it
would
morph
into
something
else
this
is
a
chameleonlike
brew
that
just
keep
surprising
me
very
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
a
very
complex
beer
pours
out
to
a
brown
color
in
the
glass
with
a
generous
light
brown
head
there
is
alot
of
carbonation
present
the
smell
is
of
malted
milk
balls
really
and
hay
yes
hay
but
i
mean
it
in
a
good
way
the
taste
is
bizarre
there
is
a
the
malt
heaviness
of
a
brown
ale
coupled
with
the
fruitraisinplumfig
thing
of
a
barleywine
a
funky
spicy
finish
from
who
knows
where
and
a
nice
light
hop
presence
of
an
english
mild
which
all
in
all
makes
for
a
fine
drinkable
beer
thanks
to
my
man
beerboy21
for
sending
this
my
way
tatse
is
very
malty
to
start
with
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
there
is
a
nice
funky
hops
bitterness
to
keep
things
in
check
some
vinous
notes
emerge
midway
through
and
the
taste
develops
a
number
of
complexities
a
figdate
fruitiness
gives
way
to
more
dark
fruits
as
the
alcohol
content
becomes
noticeable
vinous
notes
try
to
reassert
but
get
knocked
back
by
the
bitter
floral
hops
and
heavyduty
malt
character
i
dont
pick
up
any
peat
or
smoke
flavors
here
but
its
still
a
very
tasty
scottish
style
ale
with
some
smokiness
this
would
earn
some
superlative
scores
from
this

apparently
this
was
a
very
rare
and
very
special
oakaged
version
of
the
regular
beer
still
this
is
considerably
better
than
some
other
local
scotch
ales
dang
theres
no
need
to
do
sidebyside
comparisons
when
you
can
taste
straight
off
the
full
body
and
flavor
in
this
one
woo
hoo
a
great
comforting
beer
it
is
dark
ruby
brownn
in
color
with
a
thin
head
there
is
little
to
no
hop
character
or
bitterness
in
this
bee
yet
it
seems
to
be
well
rounded
it
is
very
malty
with
tastes
of
caramel
and
a
slight
smokiness
the
smokiness
is
probably
from
the
use
of
some
peated
malt
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
smooth
taste
medium
body
with
a
taste
of
tootsie
rolls
but
lighter
a
touch
of
sour
bread
on
the
sides
of
my
mouth
as
it
fades
to
alcohol
not
overpowering
at
all
but
its
there
no
hop
tastes
but
it
has
to
be
there
as
the
beer
is
not
cloying
slick
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
im
wondering
how
the
other
bottles
will
keep
stored
in
the
cellar
the
beer
is
very
smooth
to
drink
and
the
abv
is
covered
up
nicely
average
body
with
slightly
prickly
carbonation
very
drinkable
scotch
ale
no
hints
of
the
alcohol
punch
that
i
know
is
in
this
bottle
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
almost
black
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
minimal
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
malty
and
sweet
with
aromas
of
caramel
and
toffee
not
too
strong
of
a
smell
the
taste
starts
malty
with
more
caramel
and
a
little
cinnamon
a
little
bit
of
sweet
fruit
in
the
middle
cherries
and
raspberry
the
finish
is
fairly
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
strong
yet
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
really
good
for
a
brew
thats
nearly
8
a
delicious
scotch
ale
thanks
to
chaduvel

this

with
an

smells
of
big
toasted
caramelly
malts
with
smoky

peaty

some

alcohol

a
fine
scotch
ale
though
not
a
standout
comfort
beer
to
go
with
comfort
food
a
huge
sweet
blast
of
malts
starts
you
out
some
delicate
hop
flavors
come
in
a
bit
later
but
there
really
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
there
are
some
roasty
notes
but
not
a
lot
of
smoky
flavor
like
i
enjoy
in
my
scotch
ales
it
would
give
this
one
a
little
more
character
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bold
richbodied
malty
scotch
ale
then
this
is
your
beer
it
was
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
but
it
was
just
a
bit
dull
for
me
to
really
love
it

is
slow
to
fade
and
leaves
ample

strong
aroma
of
maltiness
like
a
loaf
of
bread
in
a
bottle
but
this
breads
been
soaking
in
etoh
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
not
overdone

apparent
taste
does
not
disappoint
the
full

get
thee
to

and
try
it
for
yourself
a
fantastic
offering
from
smuttynose
and
one
of
the
best
wee
heavys
ive
had
hopefully
if
and
when
smuttynose
is
released
in
western
pa
this
will
be
one
of
the
first
i
go
for
i
really
like
this
beer
i
dont
really
mind
the
decision
to
buck
style
traits
with
the
use
of
the
smoother
beechwood
smoked
malts
as
opposed
to
the
peat
smoked
malt
but
i
think
the
sting
of
peat
malt
usually
helps
to
balance
the
sweetness
here
it
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
alcohol
flavor
to
make
up
for
that
this
brew
is
most
definitely
a
scottish
ale
not
a
scotch
ale
the
taste
and
feel
are
of
a
session
brew
the
alcohol
may
be
present

it

333443another
in
their
big
beer
series
first
scotch
ale
i
ever
had
made
me
a
believer
also
the
smokiest
scotch
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
really
great
example
of
a
scotch
ale
it
has
a
sweet
malty
caramel
smell
the
flavors
match
the
aromas
there
is
also
a
medium
flavor
of
smokiness
that
really
helps
cut
threw
the
carmelly
malty
sweetness
this
one
is
definatly
a
contender
against
founders
dirty
bastard
too
smokey
not
in
the
same
class
as
dirty
bastard
or
skull
splitter
pours
dark
brownish
red
a
smokey
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
smokey
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
to
it
smoky
and
rather
boozy
it
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
to
sip
on
o
not
only
is
pipers
one
of
sprechers
greatest
beers
its
also
one
of
the
best
scotchstyle
beers
made
in
the
states
this
complex
malty
brews
peat
smoked
malts
are
most
definitely
noticeable
and
might
surprise
the
uninitiated
but
certainly
wont
alarm
those
who
expect
whats
coming
the
waft
of
smokiness
that
caries
through
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
poured
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
very
nice
head
let
it
breath
for
a
minute
and
inhaled
but
couldnt
get
a
scent
from
it
the
taste
was
a
very
unpleasant
surprise
very
smokey
flavor
actually
overwhelming
first
impression
was
smoke
and
as
strange
as
this
may
sound
pine
tar
it
has
a
taste
reminiscent
of
what
pine
tar
smells
like
as
i
drank
the
beer
i
could
discern
the
smell
and
it
was
identical
to
the
flavor
this
beer
will
not
cross
my
lips
in
the
future
i
actually
dumped
the
first
bottle
thinking
it
may
have
had
something
wrong
with
it
next
question
what
do
i
do
with
the
two
remaining
bottles
from
the
4
pack
cheers
now
i
will
have
a
bottle
of
ballast
point
ipa
beer
of
the
month
club
bottle
pours
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
small
brownish
cream
colored
head
good
clarity
strong
scotch
aroma
with
lots
of
toffee
caramel
malt
biscut
and
some
dark
fruits
flavor
has
a
strong
smokey
peat
flavor
up
front
some
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
then
some
dry
peat
flavor
on
the
finish
this
one
is
a
bit
different
from
others
i
have
had
very
peaty
and
earthy
medium
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
and
relatively
easy
drinking
good
beer
overall
not
recommended
for
aging
overall
sweet
and
smoky
overall
this
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
interesting
use
of
smoked
malt
but
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
imo
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
the
scent
is
sweet
and
im
also
picking
up
hints
of
smokiness
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
also
has
a
strong
smoke
flavor
to
it
the
texture
is
thin
but
it
is
balanced
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
smokiness
i
hated
shiner
smokehouse
i
dont
hate
this
but
it
will
not
be
in
my
glass
ever
again
o
being
this
is
a
scotch
style
ale
i
think
it
fits
the
style
well
the
earthy
malty
and
smoky
flavors
associated
with
scotch
ales
and
wee
heavys
are
everpresent
but
perhaps
a
bit
skewed
too
much
in
that
direction
it
could
use
a
tad
more
balance
of
sweetness
perhaps
some
chocolate
notes
or
dark
fruit
not
bad
but
not
me
a
lot
of
rauchbier
characteristics
not
a
scotch
ale
that
i
would
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
pours
a
semiclear
medium
brown
color
with
only
a
slight
head
the
scent
is
sweet
and
im
also
picking
up
hints
of
smokiness
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
also
has
some
decent
smoke
flavor
to
it
the
texture
is
thinner
but
it
is
balanced
out
by
the
rich
flavor
of
the
ingredients
certainly
very
unique
for
a
socalled
scotch
ale
overall
this
was
pretty
good
it
went
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
kick
of
alcohol
d
im
a
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
devotee
and
this
one
misses
the
mark
by
a
mile
for
me
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
one
falls
short
in
every
category
there
is
are
some
slightly
off
bandaid
qualities
in
terms
of
both
aroma
and
flavor
that
are
the
primary
culprits
of
my
displeasure
trying
to
keep
those
aside
for
a
moment
this
still
an
average
at
best
representation
of
the
style
much
of
the
richness
and
depth
that
i
expect
in
the
style
are
present
but
blend
together
in
such
a
way
that
sum
of
the
part
doesnt
equal
the
whole
unfortunately
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wont
recommend
nor
seek
out
though
id
be
willing
to
try
again
if
im
convinced
that
i
had
an
off

great

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
really
enjoyed
this
one
very
well
done
overall
a
very
run
of
the
mill
scotch
ale
the
smells
and
flavors
are
very
feint
and
the
beer
is
watery
like
a
macro
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
a
bit
surprised
to
see
the
lowish
score
on
this
one
perhaps
its
simply
a
beer
one
needs
to
have
on
tap
a
hardhitting
linebacker
of
a
scotch
ale
that
sets
a
high
marker
for
others
excellent
overall
the
flavor
is
excellent
and
the
creamy
feel
of
it
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
ive
always
had
sprechers
craft
sodas
before
and
am
a
regular
buyer
of
puma
kola
best
soda
ever
so
its
awesome
to
see
their
beers
are
shaping
up
to
be
as
good
as
their
sodas

of
a
sampler
flight
of
5ouncers
at
sprechers
in
wisconsin
dells
coppery
colored
liquid
with
a
thin
head
that
didnt
leave
any
lacing
nose
was
faint
roasted
malt
and
slight
toffee
elements
so
far
as
i
could
discern
taste
similarly
was
fairly
lacking
across
the
board
malt
elements
were
roasty
caramel
toffee
slightly
sweet
not
much
else
and
the
mouthfeel
was
too
thin
for
the
style
no
complexity
i
found
this
wee
heavy
to
be
totally
average
fairly
bland
in
most
in
every
way
overall
a
decent
scotch
ale
but
does
not
stand
out
and
lacks
the
depth
of
other
scotch
ales
i
have
tried
this
scotch
ale
focuses
a
bit
too
much
on
the
smokiness
aspect
of
scotch
ales
to
the
detriment
of
the
malt
sweetness
aspects
12oz
bottle
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
red
hues
when
held
to
the
light
bubbly
offwhite
head
holds
some
retention
and
eventually
fades
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
atop
the
ale
not
much
for
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
earthy
peat
faint
roasted
malt
with
a
musty

kind
of
odd
tastes
are
more
interesting
and
actually
quite
complex
peat
mossy
earthy
smoky
and
musty
with
vanilla
and
white
pepper
on
the
finish
this
beer
reminds
me
of
something
that
would
have
come
from
my
grandfathers
basement
i
remember
it
being
dark
and
dank
but
he
did
have
a
kickass
barhomebrew
setup
down
there
anyway
back
to
the
ale
mouthfeel
is
thintomedium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
its
a
bit
boozy
but
not
overly
overall
this
is
different
than
most
scotch
ales
ive
had
and
i
do
like
it
when
i
first
smelled
it
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
it
is
quite
good
actually
the
color
of
this
scotch
ale
is
a
deep
brownish
copper
with
a
thin
but
full
near
oatmeal
colored
head
and
modest
lacing
follows
the
nose
picks
up
thick
caramel
and
alcohol
vanilla
with
the
emphasis
on
booze
considerably
more
than
i
expected
for
8
27
abv
fairly
intense
and
not
a
lot
more
complex
than
ive
described
the
flavor
jumps
out
with
tart
roasted
malt
and
a
scotch
whiskey
theme
the
booziness
remains
pretty
clear
but
maybe
a
little
less
dominant
than
the
aroma
brought
its
medium
bodied
but
the
feel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
with
pretty
tingly
carbonation
throughout
its
very
warming
when
it
reaches
its
destination
yet
drinkability
is
fair
theres
a
subtle
grassy
edge
in
there
with
a
little
of
the
peat
base
that
others
have
described
but
the
sweetness
stays
with
the
caramel
ideas
though
this
is
not
the
most
inviting
scotch
ale
ive
had
it
isnt
too
bad
i
tend
to
think
of
this
style
as
being
at
its
best
with
a
somewhat
thicker
body
and
feel
and
more
malt
dominated
than
this
one
offers
still
worth
a
try
though
i
would
not
revisit
right
away
very
good
scotch
ale
overall
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
of
this
beer
a
little
more
sweet
and
heavy
malt
could
have
carried
this
a
long
way
a
bigger
creamier
mouth
feel
would
have
certainly
been
welcome
as
well
i
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
this
is
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
one
i
would
recommend
to
a
friend
and
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
4
pack
of
16
ouncers
overall
really
good
choice
to
try
this
and
will
def
be
looking
forward
to
buying
it
again
little
over
a
fingers
worth
of
tan
to
camel
hair
colored
foam
poor
retention
with
it
swiftly
fizzing
down
to
not
even
a
full
surface
covering
in
turn
the
lacing
is
close
to
nonexistent
dark
reddish
copper
color
with
more
brown
than
orange
no
filminess
but
slight
translucency
a
few
random
bubble
beads
to
be
seen
the
nose
has
a
very
smoky
nature
with
peat
moss
tar
metallic
earth
and
mineral
water
notes
behind
this
wall
you
get
caramel
vanilla
banana
and
butterscotch
some
apple
and
pear
fruit
the
rambunctiousness
of
the
smoke
keeps
it
in
the
forefront
fullbodied
the
carbonation
is
average
and
theres
not
a
strong
sense
of
movement
however
it
never
feels
really
heavy
this
may
be
attributed
in
part
to
that
smokiness
has
a
sweeter
complexion
with
honey
mesquite
caramel
notes
the
peat
qualities
more
part
of
the
whole
here
not
as
acrid
still
has
a
metallic
rust
ring
to
it
enough
so
to
challenge
the
banana
peach
apricot
fig
fruit
flavors
smattering
of
mixed
citrus
zest
mouth
feel
gets
drier
as
it
finishes
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
with
some
unique
qualities
would
show
best
with
a
cigar
or
a
hearty
meal
like
beef
brisket
8oz
is
probably
the
ideal
serving
size
so
split
the
16
oz
bottle
with
an
adventurous
friend
good
stuff
i
like
it
rarely
do
you
find
an
american
scotch
ale
with
a
smoked
peat
flavor
drinkability
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
this
beer
the
first
time
i
tasted
it
i
felt
that
it
was
too
harsh
too
bracing
too
much
of
a
shock
but
now
i
love
it
the
harshness
comes
from
the
peat
smoke
but
that
harshness
is
wonderfully
balanced
by
the
caramel
malt
and
slight
sweetness
that
makes
you
want
the
next
sip
its
the
hashsweet
that
makes
it
extraordinary
d
a
decent
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
though
i
probably
wouldnt
purchase
it
pours
a
light
caramel
color
with
a
singlefinger
of
head
there
are
a
few
bits
of
spotty
lacing
here
and
there
along
with
a
pretty
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
pretty
light
with
a
tad
bit
of
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
cidery
along
with
some
caramel
peat
and
toffee
the
feel
is
quite
thin
and
slightly
astringent
this
drinks
well
enough
until
the
finish
which
is
quite
off
beer
is
medium
bodied
not
carbonated
in
the
mouth
its
smoky
in
the
late
palate
and
mildly
sweet
up
front
i
was
expecting
less
smoke
and
more
caramel
i
got
the
opposite
it
is
ok
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
drinkability
not
as
enjoyable
as
other
scotch
aleswee
heavys
that
ive
sampled
was
nice
to
try
it
out
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
tough
to
get
past
that
chalky
mouthfeel
that
ive
described
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
excess
smoke
character
and
too
thin
mouthfeel
pours
the
color
of
iced
tea
with
a
full
tan
head
that
leaves
thick
foamy
lacing
but
the
head
disappears
quickly
smells
of
slight
plum
apricot
sweetness
is
apparent
in
the
nose
overall
smell
is
clean
flavors
of
raisin
bread
and
toffee
with
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
lowers
the
score
because
it
is
a
bit
thick
flat
and
grainy
on
the
tongue
the
carbonation
is
there
but
it
gets
lost
in
the
thickness
drinkability
is
not
high
since
it
has
such
a
high
abv
and
im
not
enjoying
the
flattish
rinse
down
my
gullet
ive
had
many
scotch
ales
and
id
say
this
is
average
for
the
style
it
lacks
the
syrupy
quality
of
some
which
for
me
is
a
plus
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
flavor
is
strong
and
well
put
together
but
it
lacks
spark
and
well
defined
character
if
it
were
on
special
for
4
a
pint
at
a
wisconsin
bar
id
buy
it
and
enjoy
it
but
id
hesitate
to
shell
out
6
a
pint
for
this
one
d
ive
had
better
but
i
had
worse
even
though
the
taste
is
incredibly
good
its
incredibly
complex
that
makes
one
of
these
beers
probably
enough
d
a
relatively
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
especially
for
the
abv
being
so
high
found
my
way
through
a
glass
of
this
in
no
time
didnt
leave
any
lasting
impressions
though
drinkability
sprecher
makes
it
to
my
area
but
not
a
lot
of
variety
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
a
little
too
smoky
for
my
tastes
d
a
solid
malty
sweet
enjoyable
ale
with
great
flavors
pours
a
clear
ruddy
copper
color
15
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
alcohol
slight
dark
citrus
raisin
and
slight
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
slight
smoke
dark
citrus
and
a
hint
of
a
floral
aroma
overall
a
good
aroma
body
and
blend
d
not
a
bad
scottish
ale
a
little
on
the
smokey
side
but
that
adds
character
and
identity
to
this
beer
i
would
only
drink
just
one
of
these
in
a
night
so
my
drinkability
rating
isnt
that
hight
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
this
again
in
the
future
sprechers
black
bavarian
is
pretty
good
but
this
one
as
with
all
others
ive
tried
are
below
average
d
fairly
drinkable
because
of
the
lighter
body
but
gets
a
little
too
sweet
after
a
while
drinkability
it
is
tasty
so
you
could
down
it
just
fine
better
to
stick
with
sipping
considering
the
alcohol
and
overall
richness
opinion
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
this
example
has
some
age
on
it
which
helps
it
overall
as
i
imagine
that
a
fresh
example
may
be
somewhat
simple
regardless
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
someday
d
a
unique
scotch
ale
with
the
inclusion
of
it
being
smoked
generally
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
this
one
is
done
right
due
to
it
being
a
balancing
agent
adds
to
the
complexity
of
the
beer
instead
of
being
the
main
focal
point
of
the
beer
solid
stuff
just
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
a
few
of
purchased
from
the
sprecher
gift
shop
in
glendale
wi
pours
a
very
dark
amber
to
brown
body
with
a
thick
rocky
light
tan
head
aromas
of
smoked
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
beer
has
an
overpowering
smoke
malt
flavor
that
lingers
well
into
the
finish
clouds
any
hop
bitterness
i
find
this
beer
to
have
too
much
smoke
flavor
going
on
on
the
other
hand
if
thats
your
thing
you
will
love
this
beer
d
the
peat
is
dominant
and
excessive
the
aroma
had
some
promise
and
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
the
flavor
is
muddy
syrupy
and
unfortunately
bandaid
like
this
could
be
good
if
they
toned
the
smoke
down
a
bit
and
did
something
to
liven
up
the
malt
but
as
it
stands
it
is
almost
a
drain
pour
the
fact
that
this
apparently
won
a
gabf
medal
just
goes
to
show
how
hit
and
miss
the
judging
at
those
events
can
be
overall
excellent
smokey
scotch
ale
the
combo
of
sweet
and
smokey
is
a
great
one
i
am
warm
and
happy
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
good
sized
bubbly
beige
head
smells
of
smoke
and
bacon
initially
huge
smoky
aroma
dominates
my
nostrils
faint
dark
fruits
and
maybe
some
walnuts
hide
deep
in
the
bowels
of
my
glass
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
molasses
and
tobacco
flavors
that
are
scissored
by
some
smoke
to
finish
with
a
lingering
cured
meatalcohol
finish
definitely
a
sipper
here
carbonation
is
medium
to
high
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
affecting
the
creaminess
of
the
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
big
body
this
is
a
nice
sipper
its
a
bit
more
smokey
than
i
normally
like
but
what
the
hell
its
pretty
good
d
this
is
one
easy
drinking
brew
very
smooth
i
could
easily
down
more
than
one
of
these
maybe
i
should
drink
it
through
my
nose
p
a
decent
scotch
beer
from
this
decent
brewer
d
honestly
a
disappointment
i
like
sprecher
but
this
one
was
a
miss
pissed
at
myself
for
buying
the
overpriced
1
l
bottle
a
pretty
good
scoth
ale
nothing
overpowering
in
terms
of
flavor
which
is
pretty
unfortunate
as
the
aroma
shows
much
promise
a
little
thin
and
subdued
but
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
yuck
drainpour
picked
up
a
single
from
princeton
liquors
in
maple
grove
poured
a
redbrown
with
a
short
head
the
flavor
straight
out
of
my
fridge
is
a
rubbery
smoked
malt
but
it
smooths
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
flavor
has
a
slightly
meaty
roasted
caramel
taste
to
it
with
a
bit
of
candy
sugar
sweetness
the
aroma
also
has
a
bit
of
apple
to
it
and
the
body
is
reasonably
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
beer
though
worth
a
try
if
you
like
smoked
beers
drinkability
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
would
be
easy
to
put
away
a
couple
of
these
i
think
had
the
beer
been
a
little
less
carbonated
could
have
brought
up
a
few
of
the
more
subtle
notes
not
my
favorite
weeheavy
but
very
drinkable
brownish
color
with
big
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
malty
some
tobacco
smell
in
there
as
well
good
flavor
very
malty
with
a
dry
end
ok
slightly
below
average
there
are
a
lot
better
scotch
ales
out
there
maybe
this
on
is
better
fresh
drinks
okay
i
expected
a
helluva
lot
more
from
sprecher
this
is
just
just
soso
for
a
style
i
truly
love
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
thin
light
brown
color
but
when
held
to
the
light
the
red
amber
color
shines
there
is
a
very
thin
white
cap
that
just
layer
the
brew
and
leaves
a
nice
ring
as
the
drink
goes
down
the
smell
is
very
smoky
with
hints
of
sweet
caramel
and
nice
malt
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
strong
smokiness
and
nice
malt
balance
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
scotch
ales
but
i
got
a
beers
of
the
british
ilses
from
sprecher
and
this
was
one
for
the
style
this
is
a
good
example
smooth
malty
and
smoky
solid
beer
but
not
my
type
of
session
brew
d
not
quite
what
i
was
expectinga
little
underwhelming
the
lack
of
alcohol
taste
makes
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
but
overall
this
beer
is
very
unimaginative
i
doubt
ill
have
this
one
again
tastes
firm
and
very
peaty
lots
and
lots
of
smokiness
with
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
in
there
then
a
soapiness
comes
in
and
just
about
ruins
everything
what
the
hell
is
that
why
does
that
keep
popping
up
in
these
beers
smoke
lingers
in
the
back
not
bad
but
not
in
the
class
of
old
chub
or
skullspliter
for
instance
16oz
bottle
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
poured
copperbrown
with
a
thin

rich
malty
aroma
with
fruit
caramel
and
some
smoke
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
rich
mouthfeel
sweet
malt
with
toffee
and
more
fruit
good
amount
of
peat
smoke
in
finish
tasty
you
better
be
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
and
big
brews
to
attempt
this
one
super
heavy
mouthfeel
very
sweet
tasting
heavy
syrup
feel
alcohol
bite
just
plain
hard
to
swallow
any
good
roasty
maltiness
is
overpowered
by
the
sweet
taste
and
syrupy
texture
i
couldnt
even
choke
down
one
bottle
pipers
scotch
style
ale
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
sixteen
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
is
quite
good
the
flavor
isnt
as
intensely
malty
as
i
might
like
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
the
most
dominant
flavor
but
it
just
isnt
enough
you
can
taste
some
smoke
hops
are
not
really
in
the
picture
nor
should
they
be
worth
a
try
d
great
representative
of
the
style
solid
flavors
for
a
scotch
ale
and
i
would
put
it
up
over
a
mcewans
anyday
clear
brownamber
body
topped
by
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
but
as
is
fairly
typical
for
sprecher
the
foam
fades
quickly
modest
lacing
lush
aroma
full
of
roasted
malt
caramel
decent
citrus
hopsnice
the
taste
is
excellent
the
roasted
malt
is
front
and
center
with
caramel
most
prominent
but
citrus
malt
and
berry
also
emerge
very
delicious
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
certainly
say
it
again
heresprecher
does
not
get
its
due
for
making
very
good
beer
pipers
is
very
good
beer
creamy
and
smooth
if
a
tad
thin
the
mouthfeel
could
use
more
hops
highly
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
sprecher
which
makes
many
good
ones
pipers
impresses
me
solidifying
my
having
been
won
over
to
good
scotch
ale
best
of
all
with
this
the
high
abv
8

is
barely
noticeable
very
well
done
certainly
recommended
sprecher
continues
to
impress
drinkability
good
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
scent
with
a
nice
smokeypeated
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
roasted
and
crystal
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
all
around
good
beer
it
has
excellent
aroma
as
well
as
malt
character
and
drinkability
recommended
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
with
just
enough

to
sustain
the
character
and
richness
of
the
brew
nicely
crafted
by
sprecher
cheers
tasty
little
number
pours
amber
small
head
not
much
of
a
scent
which
disappoints
considering
the
taste
very
good
flavor
smoky
but
not
overpowering
it
would
make
an
excellent
transition
for
someone
who
likes
a
smoked
porter
to
try
this
style
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
the
8
3
abv
makes
it
a
nice
chestwarmer
on
a
chilly
spring
night
in
buffalo
i
honestly
cant
compare
it
to
other
examples
of
the
style
this
has
however
opened
my
eyes
to
what
would
of
otherwise
been
an
overlooked
style
ill
be
looking
for
more
scotch
ales
i
have
had
a
good
deal
of
scotch
ales
since
this
original
review
and
every
one
is
rated
to
style
let
me
say
that
for
6
74
a
four
pack
of
16
ounce
bottles
this
is
a
huge
bargain
not
to
mention
true
to
style
i
think
as
far
as
scotch
ales
go
this
interperstation
of
the
style
is
the
best
easy
drinking
and
tasty
as
hell
i
would
pay
way
more
for
a
four
pack
of
these
this
scotch
ale
is
peaty
earthy
and
malty
huge
the
best
thing
is
it
is
smokey
not
fake
smoke
but
peaty
smoke
like
a
good
scotch
i
know
smoke
and
this
is
not
fake
it
is
huge
and
it
appeals
to
me
so
i
move
the
marks
up
because
i
love
it
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
a
sprecher
brew
back
to
my
michigan
days
so
when
i
saw
a
bunch
available
here
in
the
blo
area
i
grabbed
some
this
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
some
amber
hue
a
thinner
but
well
retained
white
head
atop
deep
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
obviously
malt
tilted
in
its
malty
sweetness
and
cakelike
dominance
a
bit
of
alcohol
shows
thru
in
the
finish
but
doesnt
distract
from
the
flavors
a
decent
scotch
ale
to
be
had
d
8
27
scotch
ale
that
i
will
look
forward
to
on
certain
occasions
in
the
future
the
pipers
appears
quite
clear
orangey
bronze
in
my
glass
with
a
creamy
slim
light
tan
head
fruity
fig
aromas
accompany
a
toasted
caramel
and
cocoa
sweetness
it
is
nice
but
i
do
not
yet
detect
the
smokiness
advertised
by
the
bottle
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
fruity
with
some
sweet
caramel
toasted
malts
flow
through
to
join
unsweetened
cocoa
and
just
a
hint
of
smoke
in
a
lightly
bitter
finish
herbal
tealike
hops
help
smooth
and
balance
the
flavors
the
body
leans
toward
the
light
end
of
medium
yet
retains
enough
carbonation
to
stay
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
a
nicely
done
version
of
the
style
it
certainly
does
not
drink
as
heavy
as
the
abv
would
suggest
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
could
use
a
touch
more
smoke
both
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
otherwise
another
quite
fine
sprecher
offering
notes
not
my
cup
of
tea
litteraly
its
like
a
sweet
tea
with
a
thick
body
it
seems
like
its
brewed
very
well
and
achieved
their
goal
as
its
not
astringent
or
off
but
its
one
of
those
not
for
me
beers
although
i
have
liked
brews
from
this
style
sprecher
sells
a
good
value
too
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
example
of
the
style
on
offer
in
the
usa
the
fact
that
its
domestic
and
therefore
likely
fresher
than
any
import
is
a
bonus
thanks
to
sprecher
for
letting
american
drinkers
in
on
what
scotch
ale
is
about
check
it
out
d
nice
example
of
a
sctoch
ale
very
appraochable
if
not
familiar
with
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
thin
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
a
lot
of
butterscotch
i
like
a
little
diacetyl
in
a
scotch
ale
but
this
is
way
too
much
it
isnt
an
unpleasant
but
it
certainly
covers
up
other
nuances
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
scotch
ale
that
i
would
rather
not
drink
again
for
those
who
like
lots
of
peat
smoked
malt
in
a
beer
this
should
be
right
up
your
alley
despite
a
love
for
smoky
single
malt
islays
i
prefer
a
very
subtle
backdrop
of
peat
that
just
perks
up
the
complexity
of
a
brew
while
i
would
not
categorize
this
as
a
heavy
handed
use
of
peat
i
think
this
would
be
a
much
better
for
me
if
it
had
a
bit
less
half
this
amount
would
still
be
quite
noticeable
and
even
an
18
the
amount
that
was
used
would
add
to
the
complexity
of
the
base
beer
while
i
dont
quite
think
that
this
beer
works
it
is
quite
engaging
and
quite
contemplative
if
the
malt
character
were
kicked
up
a
notch
meaning
bumping
up
the
final
original
gravities
a
corresponding
amount
through
more
malt
used
and
a
higher
mash
temperature
this
beer
would
be
quite
a
bit
more
enjoyable
and
even
down
right
great
still
i
am
enjoying
this
brew
so
i
certainly
cant
complain
too
much
thanks
objectivemonkey
for
this
very
nice
brew
mk
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
kinda
wish
it
was
a
little
more
sessionable
but
i
know
that
this
style
does
not
lend
itself
to
sessionabilty
pours
a
ruby
brown
with
yeast
floating
throughout
the
head
is
thick
and
strong
the
aroma
is
smokey
sweet
caramel
toffee
some
coffee
spicy
sweet
herbs
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
sweet
and
smokey
upfront
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
finishing
with
a
light
boozey
heat
phenominal
balance
and
flavor
what
a
great
scotch
ale
pours
a
murky
deep
amber
hue
with
very
little
too
sluggish
bubbling
not
much
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
actually
a
little
scotchy
i
detect
a
profound
note
of
smoked
peet
adds
a
nice
warmth
to
the
sweet
malty
aroma
pretty
smokey
malt
taste
going
back
to
that
smoked
peet
i
had
mentioned
with
a
medium
malted
caramel
and
light
tapioca
flavor
pretty
sluggish
feel
on
the
palate
but
i
like
it
very
good
for
slow
sipping
and
contemplation
its
also
nice
to
notice
how
the
smokiness
increases
as
it
warms
certainly
a
sipper
one
to
try
if
you
like
scotchscotch
ales
alcohol
a
bit
too
dominant
age
might
help
it
from
a
style
standpoint
hops
are
probably
too
assertive
but
i
like
the
way
that
they
balance
the
overall
sweetness
pipers
scotchstyle
ale
is
yet
another
wonderful
beer
from
sprecher
one
simple
change
adding
more
malt
would
turn
this
already
excellent
offering
into
something
that
i
would
consider
worldclass
im
all
over
this
one
the
next
time
im
in
madison
md
fizzy
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
kinda
cheapens
the
flavor
in
the
beer
imho
but
a
very
nice
balanced
smokysweet
flavor
and
is
an
easy
drinker
body
was
just
medium
a
disappointment
with
light
effervescence
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
smokypeaty
meaty
like
smoked
sausage
or
some
other
cured
meat
but
a
little
watery
a
good
beer
but
no
more
overall
recommended
sprecher
is
quite
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
solid
cheers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sugary
and
slightly
thin
in
the
finish
label
depicts
a
filtered
view
of
the
tartan
pattern
of
a
scottish
kilt
beyond
that
the
hazy
figure
of
a
bagpipe
player
in
the
background
almost
what
youd
expect
to
see
if
you
were
the
drummer
in
the
marching
band
who
drank
too
much
scotch
and
ended
up
on
the
ground
a
distinct
note
of
chocolate
appears
upfront
in
the
flavor
its
not
particularly
to
style
but
its
rich
and
welcoming
and
it
is
of
course
only
scotchstyle
from
there
the
maltiness
diplays
a
good
deal
of
caramel
and
more
toasty
malt
across
the
middle
its
sweetish
but
not
overdone
supple
dark
fruit
appears
and
some
candyish
notes
come
through
along
with
a
flicker
of
alcohol
the
bitterness
balances
it
nicely
maintaining
a
presence
but
staying
lowkey
it
finishes
dry
despite
the
richness
of
the
malt
with
some
residual
soft
chocolate
and
caramel
and
a
light
roastiness
and
subtle
smokiness
that
dont
really
appear
prior
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
beer
if
the
mouthfeel
was
tweaked
around
a
little
bit
way
too
thin
besides
that
its
a
solid
beer
thanks
to
murrayswine
poured
from
a
16oz
bottle
into
my
pint
glass
appears
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
smells
of
smoked
malt
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
tastes
of
smoked
peat
and
nutty
sweet
roasted
malts
medium
to
moderate
in
body
this
is
the
first
and
hopefully
not
the
last
scotch
ale
ive
sampled
with
such
a
dominant
level
of
smokiness
very
different
but
nice
nonetheless
cheers
rich
mahogany
color
and
a
small
white
topper
if
the
likes
of
a
smoky

islay
is
to
your
linking
you
will
like
the
aroma
of
the
scotish
ale
caramel
and
a
brown
sugar
overtone
but
difinitely
a
peattish
theme
a
bit
thin
in
depth
and
bigger
on
the
carbonation
which
subsides
in
a
few
minutes
overall
it
is
a
flavorfull
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
like
i
personally
do
not
find
it
very
drinkable
d
first
and
foremost
the
smoke
flavor
in
this
beer
tastes
fake
with
that
said
this
beer
could
propably
use
some
age
to
allow
the
flavors
to
meld
a
bit
because
right
now
they
are
much
too
stark
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amberalmost
a
caramel
colorwith
a
very
slight
head
a
glass
of
this
brew
gives
off
a
very
pleasant
smokey
aroma
of
roasted
malt
perhaps
it
is
just
me
but
i
can
even
detect
a
bit
of
peat
in
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
beerjust
like
a
fine
scotch
this
brew
drinks
remarkably
easy
and
rewards
with
an
excellent
combination
of
smokey
flavors
definitely
to
be
recommendedalthough
in
moderation
as
this
beer
can
have
the
tendency
to
hit
fairly
hard
da
nice
drinker
being
picky
i
would
say
its
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
a
wee
heavy
still
a
tasty
brew
i
would
buy
again
d
crystal
clear
scarlet
red
hue
beautiful
thin
dusting
of
beige
froth
lace
is
adequate
the
aroma
is
thick
and
meaty
smokey
phenols
and
sweet
raisin
and
caramel
flavor
is
smokey
as
well
peat
makes
an
impression
a
big
impression
smokier
than
most
wee
heavies
ive
had
but
theres
also
a
juicy
maltiness
present
pretty
rich
in
flavor
overall
a
little
toasted
malt
flavor
mixes
in
with
a
light
hop
finish
this
is
reallyy
good
medium
to
mediumfull
in
body
and
quite
the
flavorful
easy
drinker
for
the
style
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
and
perhaps
one
of
sprechers
best
offerings
yum
semi
hazy
mohagany
color
large
tan
head
maintains
moderately
not
that
much
lacing
very
smoky
peaty
aroma
toasted
earthy
breadiness
as
well
very
inviting
taste
begins
dominate
in
peat
smoke
malt
is
lighter
but
shows
itself
a
bit
goes
from
smokey
to
roasty
malts
to
toasty
hops
then
finishes
with
more
peat
a
bit
of
alcohol
shows
but
not
that
much
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
nutty
toffee
flavors
lie
underneath
very
enjoyable
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
little
dryer
and
thinner
than
i
expect
from
a
scottish
ale
but
a
very
nice
beer
with
a
well
done
smoke
character
ill
certainly
grab
another
should
the
opportunity
present
itself
groundskeeper
willie
would
drink
this
on
special
occasion
but
i
think
hes
more
of
a
red
white
blue
session
guy
the
good
old
smoked
scottish
ale
this
one
is
definately
one
to
try
even
if
it
isnt
your
favorite
style
the
pour
is
deep
burnt
red
with
an
awesome
very
clear
ruby
body
that
holds
a
mocha
head
that
gives
a
a
great
overall
appearance
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
malt
and
toffee
no
hop
presence
is
noted
yet
which
is
great
for
a
true
wee
heavy
although
nice
smelling
there
was
room
for
so
much
more
malt
punch
the
peat
didnt
come
through
in
the
nose
yet
for
me
then
there
is
the
taste
the
smokey
earthy
baconlike
malt
definately
shows
up
for
the
party
the
crude
raw
punch
of
true
peat
smoked
malt
is
an
acquired
taste
for
me
being
vegetarian
it
doesnt
hit
home
and
make
me
want
some
ribs
but
i
can
appreciate
the
uniqueness
of
it
the
malt
seems
a
bit
overshadowed
by
the
smokiness
i
would
have
loved
it
to
be
the
other
way
around
a
thick
sweet
body
is
enjoyable
to
drink
but
16oz
is
enough
for
one
sitting
very
unique
mix
on
a
great
style
that
should
be
experimented
by
more
breweries
tried
paring
this
with
a
mild
cigar
on
a
cool
damp
autumn
night
the
cigar
totally
overpowered
this
scotchstyle
ale
nonetheless
it
was
still
an
enjoyable
experience
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
as
sprecher
does
not
release
new
beers
regularly
beer
poured
a
coppery
red
with
no
head
to
speak
of
smelled
like
damp
card
board
tasted
like
an
english
brown
ale
and
nothing
special
to
write
about
that
would
lead
one
to
think
it
is
a
scottish
ale
not
a
classicstyled
scotch
ale
but
rather
a
stylized
scotch
that
is
classic
in
itself
served
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
if
you
are
loyal
to
the
sprecher
name
then
pick
it
up
it
is
available
on
a
very
limited
basis
two

pours
a
redtinted
slightly
cloudy
dark

really
nice
creamy
white

that
sticks
around
the
edges
forever
and
gives
pipers
great
lacing
smell
is
kinda
faint
but
its
smoky
and
has
cherriesanise
chocolate
and
maltiness
tastes
tartly
sweet
again
like
cherries
and
anise
with
a
really
nice
toasted
malt
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
pretty
solid
new
beer
from
sprecher
the
toasted
malt
flavor
is
the
highlight
here
o
an
easy
to
drink
wee
heavy
at
9
75
avb
this
beer
is
all
bang
for
the
buck
not
a
strong
taste
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
which
i
really
enjoy
thirst
quenching
impeccable
overall
a
very
good

out
there
are
also
some
notes

there
to

this
beer
a
bit
more
roasted
notes
throughout
and
the
increased

is
hidden
very
well
in
this
beer
full
and
robust
in

it
remains

was
very

deserving
of
procuring
more
overall
this
a
supremely
flavorful
and
aggressive
scotch
ale
its
fruitiness
reminds
me
of
skullsplitter
but
more
balanced
and
bolder
scotty
karate
is
a
testament
to
what
a
nuanced
and
complex
style
this
can
be
when
properly
executed
a

thin

o
certainly
a
good
beer
a
good
goto
for
a
higher
alcohol
scotch
ale
thats
available
pretty
much
everywhere
year
round
o
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
which
seems
well
regarded
seems
well
made
but
its
a
lot
more
sweet
than
i
tend
to
like
maybe
ill
give
it
a
try
from
a
bottle
another
time
to
see
how
it
compares
o
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
cant
say
i
will
rush
out
and
buy
more
ill
jump
on
it
if
i
see
it
on
tap
my
first
beer
from
dark
horse
and
im
looking
for
more
overall
a
good
solid
scotch
ale
best
beer
these
guys
make
and
its
not
even
close
it
was
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
but
the
smokey
flavor
was
way
too
strong
overall
this
one
is
up
there
in
my
favorites
for
this
style
enjoyable
for
sure
but
lacks
the
wow
factor
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
boar
burger
on
a
cold
january
day
o
great
beer
took
the
whole
four
pack
to
appreciate
its
depth
the
scotch
flavoring
is
not
one
of
my
favors
one
of
the
first
scotch
ales
i
ever
had
will
be
purchasing
this
again
soon
overall
very
enjoyable
offering
for
the
style
the
fruitiness
really
sticks
out
the
most
and
adds
an
undeniable
sweetness
to
the
beer
has
a
wonderful
classic
smoky
malt
base
with
nice
toasted
bread
notes
and
caramel
sweetness
alcohol
fairly
well
hidden
not
very
pungnant
nice
enjoyable
sipper
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
a
thin
watery
feel
across
the
tongue
and
a
slightly
bitter
grainy
finish
that
is
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
overall
this
was
a
very
goof
scotch
alewee
heavy
that
hid
the
9
75
abv
masterfully
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
recommend
trying
it
simply
complex
dried
fruits
breads
malts
completely
hidden
abv
caramel
sweetness
such
a
clean
finish
this
is
what
i
imagine
a
great
wee
heavy
tastes
in
scotland
when
fresh
from
a
brewery
hopefully
because
the
ones
ive
had
on
this
side
of
the
pond
arent
this
good
basic
scotch
ale
decent
flavor
for
the
price
point
a
solid
pick
up
but
no
where
near
backwoods
or
wulver
not
going
to
get
into
detail
but
this
is
by
far
the
smoothest
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
apart
from
backwoods
bastard
but
thats
a
completely
different
animal
o
i
dont
really
get
anything
out
of
this
beer
that
being
said
i
did
let
it
warm
up
for
an
hour
after
i
opened
it
but
i
did
it
in
the
bottle
with
a
wine
stopper
however
i
did
have
to
pour
the
beer
back
into
the
bottle
a
big
scotch
ale
thats
a
bit
linear
i
guess
almost
boring
for
some
but
it
was
tasty
enough
for
me
still
not
a
direct
contender
with
the
traditional
heavies
o
props
to
dark
horse
i
dont
normally
like
this
style
when
its
done
traditionally
but
this
one
is
made
as
such
and
i
really
like
it
hides
the
etoh
quite
well
but
no
dominant
flavor
profile
that
is
nothing
sticks
out
as
far
as
an
amazing
flavor
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
but
certainly
not
syrupy
overall
good
but
not
great
pours
a
clouded
deep
ruddy
brown
there
is
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
almost
immediately
a
slight
hint
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
lighter
with
some
deep
roasted
malt
tones
and
caramel
the
taste
really
takes
the
malt
and
runs
with
it
there
is
a
great
big
malt
hit
followed
by
some
smoked
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
fruit
the
body
has
a
nice
thickness
and
a
little
carbonation
scotty
karate
jugs
o
very
nice
scotch
ale
and
another
strong
beer
from
dark
horse
very
smooth
and
drinkable
especially
at
9
75
abv
a
boozy
maltbomb
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
scotch
ales
in
general
others
have
said
this
is
a
relatively
low
flavor
scotch
ale
so
it
appeals
to
me
glad
to
have
tried
o
note
really
impressed
for
a
scotch
ale
sorry
dh
this
is
an
odd
one
i
homebrew
so
im
used
to
tasting
wort
before
fermentation
and
this
is
very
reminiscent
almost
as
though
they
blended
this
beer
with
raw
wort
odd
o
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
but
nothing
crazy
outstanding
about
this
one
very
flavorless
scotch
ale
not
bad
but
wheres
the
flavor
for
the
price
this
is
an
absolute
no
brainer
if
you
like
scotch
ales
dark
horse
scotty
karate
scotch
ale
45
tastes
like
double
crooked
tree
with
a
hint
of
scotch
o
great
scotch
ale
cant
believe
this
is
almost
10
dirty
bastard
is
still
my
fave
but
this
is
up
there
the
profile
nice
to
sip
but
not
overly
heavy
for
the
abv
goes
down
smoothly
would
drink
again
i
let
this
beer
age
for
6
months
and
after
the
long
wait
i
finally
had
it
worth
the
wait
so
much
better
aged
its
really
smooth
and
just
tastes
fantastic
beautiful
color
and
just
fantastic
finish
buy
a
pack
and
let
it
age
for
68
months

some
may
think
this
to
be
too
sweet
but
i
enjoy
it
o
i
am
a
little
disappointed
i
wanted
so
much
from
this
guy
but
the
nose
was
lacking
and
the
taste
hits
with
a
lot
of
booze
it
just
feels
unbalanced
i
searched
for
a
born
on
date
in
hopes
of
bailing
them
out
like
i
got
an
old
one
but
i
cant
find
it
as
it
warms
there
is
additional
sweetness
which
yanks
some
of
the
scores
up
out
of
the
basement
this
wonderful
scotch
ale
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
generous
lacing
and
thick
legs
the
nose
is
a
rich
bouquet
of
caramel
malts
woodsy
notes
smoke
and
a
hint
of
booze
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
in
the
best
opulently
rich
way
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
lots
of
sweet
toffee
malt
earthy
peat
and
gently
warming
alcohol
im
a
big
fan
of
both
dark
horse
and
scotch
ales
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
if
they
made
a
bba
version
id
be
in
heaven
d
this
was
a
nice
beer
with
decent
scent
and
fitting
taste
the
body
was
great
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
it
had
a
smooth
finish
too
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
probably
not
for
aging
and
nothing
unique
or
memorable
fresh
but
not
bad
either
o
hides
the
abv
well
and
is
perhaps
dangerously
drinkable
perhaps
also
thats
why
i
rated
it
lower
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
indicative
of
what
i
think
of
the
style
that
i
know
less
about
than
some
o
enjoyable
for
sure
not
as
flavorful
or
full
bodied
as
i
like
in
a
scotch
ale
but
it
did
the
job
on
this
cold
rainy
dreary
ohio
day
full
flavor
scotch
ale
with
smooth
waves
of
caramel
maple
and
again
toffee
simply
delicious
malty
goodness
full
of
flavor
but
not
overly
sweet
nicely
done
glad
to
get
to
try
this
one
on
draft
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
brown
color
and
a
very
light
white
head
has
a
scotch
aroma
taste
is
also
strongly
scotch
and
sweet
has
a
nice
full
body
flavor
and
goes
down
smooth
i
enjoy
scotch
ales
and
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
one
i
also
have
to
give
kudos
for
such
a
cool
and
catchy
name
the
mouthfeel
is
full
to
medium
bodied
and
sticky
with
good
levels
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
well
made
and
wonderfully
deep
very
enjoyable
to
drink
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
even
at
nearly
10
the
alcohol
is
hidden
and
its
very
drinkable
overy
flavorful
scotch
ale
nice
sipping
decent
scotch
ale
from
dark
horse
a
fuller
body
would
bump
the
score
up
significantly
o
just
ok
this
is
an
example
of
the
unevenness
of
this
style
of
beer
this
one
is
ok
but
i
would
not
purchase
again
give
me
a
backwoods
bastard
and
ill
knock
you
on
your
ass
to
beat
you
to
the
bar
oi
like
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
doesnt
try
to
rape
you
when
you
sip
this
as
i
am
drinking
this
with
a
cold
i
would
like
to
reevaluate
this
once
my
cold
is
gone
but
i
am
superimpressed
with
it
even
with
my
shnozz
on
the
fritz

its
a
good
beer
not
the
best
scotch
ale
or
wee
heavy
out
there
but
its
good
a
good
michigan
beer
this
is
a
fireside
beer
one
to
curl
up
with
on
a
cold
night
in
front
of
a
blazing
hot
fire
and
sip
on
the
nose
here
is
great
smoky
even
for
a
scotch
ale
with
some
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
as
well
as
a
pronounced
earthy
richness
its
alcohol
strength
is
only
hinted
at
in
the
smell
candied
malt
and
bonfire
smoke
greet
my
palate
warmly
woody
malt
flavor
to
this
beer
is
central
the
smoke
and
sweet
are
secondary
layers
of
grain
come
and
go
with
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
being
the
residuals
and
an
almost
lactose
milk
stout
type
of
sugar
sticking
around
too
but
these
sweets
are
tempered
by
earthy
smoke
a
robustly
flavored
and
pretty
well
balanced
brew
fuller
bodied
and
only
boozy
when
it
warms
up
a
good
beer
for
sharing
and
a
fun
winter
seasonal
from
dark
horse
the
body
is
full
moderately
carbonated
lightly
crisp
and
delightfully
creamy
all
with
just
a
hint
of
dryness
cutting
the
sweetness
on
the
palate
to
make
an
exceptionally
wellrounded
mouthfeel
its
also
one
of
the
cleanest
out
there
no
astringency
or
grainy
character
to
speak
of
feel
is
a
just
a
notch
under
stout
thick
omaybe
this
was
bottled
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
but
the
beer
lacked
the
strong
malty
notes
i
expect
from
the
style
the
feel
is
almost
absent
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
clean
touch
it
has
an
almost
water
like
smoothness
and
at
nearly
10
pct
abv
theres
not
a
hint
of
alcohol

rereviewed
on

with
a

o
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
big
smooth
drink
will
definitely
be
partaking
a
few
of
these
over
the
next
couple
of
cold
winter
months
overall
yes
please
provided
i
remember
to
let
it
warm
up
a
little
more
next
time
o
not
my
first
dark
horse
brew
but
a
very
good
one
regardless
well
deserving
of
the
first
review
from
this
brewery
im
actually
more
stoked
i
can
get
dark
horse
stuff
in
ohio
one
of
those
good
moments
discovering
dark
horse
scotty
karate
is
a
very
good
scotch
style
ale
it
has
all
the
right
juice
to
become
someones
go
to
big
beer
very
enjoyable
and
very
well
crafted
scotty
karate
is
a
must
try
and
one
to
go
back
to
every
autumn
overall
a
very
delicious
wonderful
smelling
brew
mouthfeel
seems
off
to
me
would
expect
more
lingering
sweetness
but
the
strength
could
be
working
against
the
brew
in
this
regard
now
thats
a
scotch
ale
the
9
75
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
good
stuff
on
a
positive
note
i
like
where
dark
horse
brewing
is
going
a
big
version
of
a
hearty
beer
style
i
dont
think
they
quite
have
it
with
this
batch
but
it
wont
deter
me
from
trying
any
of
there
other
offerings
i
this
case
it
seems
the
yeast
they
are
using
wasnt
able
to
tolerate
the
amount
of
malt
that
was
used
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
example
of
a
scotch
ale
but
ultimately
a
bit
rough
right
now
i
feel
like
this
would
benefit
from
some
age
o
decent
scotch
ale
toffee
heavy
if
that
is
your
thing
im
not
a
huge
fan
so
i
couldnt
give
it
big
points
still
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
if
im
honest
on
the
sweet
caramelly
side
as
well
this
is
medium
bodied
likely
due
to
the
heavy
carbonation
keeping
it
moving
it
seems
like
it
wants
to
leave
a
residue
but
doesnt
quite
get
it
in
one
go
it
takes
several
sips
to
build
this
up
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
o
glad
i
grabbed
it
need
to
keep
trying
dark
horse
may
grab
another
to
age
poured
a
brownish
body
with
one
finger
head
and
some
lace
patches
on
top
of
an
aroma
of
mostly
bready
and
sweet
dark
malts
little
bit
of
java
dark
chocolate
toffee
caramel
possibly
some
woodiness
tastemouthfeel
is
more
of
the
same
as
fuller
bodied
and
smooth
thanks
to
some
bready
oakiness
and
there
is
a
good
of
sweetness
thanks
to
caramel
chocolate
toffee
and
a
little
bit
of
dryness
from
bready
malts
and
booze
added
into
the
finish
as
well
as
some
crisp
hoppiness
a
very
enjoyable
and
hearty
sipper
worth
a
go
at
it
but
would
not
seek
outseems
pretty
rough
around
the
edges
giving
the
name
a
perfect
5
though
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
definitely
reviewed
92307
overall
this
beer
is
another
great
entry
from
dark
horse
the
bourbon
barrelaged
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
since
i
like
that
style
variant
it
was
a
good
surprise
ill
look
forward
to
having
scotty
again
and
will
definitely
want
to
have
one
when
i
drive
over
to
the
brewery
in
marshall
michigan
overall
a
nice
malt
forward
brew
sweet
and
earthy
a
nice
sipping
beer
overall
very
good
brew
but
still
not
at
the
level
of
my
favorite
scotch
ale
it
definitely
is
stronger
but
stronger
doesnt
always
mean
better
flavor
is
everything
and
a
little
tweaking
couldnt
hurt
salud
i
had
the
privilege
of
tasting
this
next
to
innis
gunn
as
well
as
founders
dirty
bastard
my
friend
prefered
this
one
over
the
3
mainly
for
the
reasons
i
liked
it
over
the
founders
one
which
was
more
mouth
to
it
and
a
little
more
bite
to
me
the
founders
was
a
little
sweeter
which
i
liked
i
prefer
innis
and
gunn
over
all
of
them
but
thats
me
this
is
probably
the
5th
or
6th
wee
heavy
i
tried
and
its
easily
number
2
i
wouldnt
skip
over
this
one
if
you
like
the
style
i
have
no
idea
how
the
label
relates
to
the
idea
of
a
scotch
ale
but
i
totally
dig
the
wiggedout
oneman
band
that
it
depicts
perhaps
that
is
how
they
anticipate
one
will
feel
after
a
bottle
of
this
beer
we
shall
see
holy
hot
batman
i
got
a
good
whiff
of
booze
in
pouring
this
one
into
my
glass
i
got
a
brief
appearance
of
maybe
a
finger
of
deeptan
head
that
quickly
fell
to
swirling
wisps
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
colabrown
nose
smelled
of
dried
dark
fruits
leather
lemon
zest
and
alkeehaul
whee
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
initial
alcohol
heat
followed
by
notes
of
toffee
leather
dried
fruit
and
brown
sugar
finish
was
semidry
with
the
alcohol
heat
accounting
for
this
in
the
face
of
all
of
the
sugary
flavors
involved
this
really
packed
a
wallop
even
for
me
i
would
recommend
that
you
at
least
try
it
once
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
which
i
am
not
you
will
be
head
over
heels
for
it
o
a
rugged
take
on
the
wee
heavy
not
as
syrupy
as
some
with
more
bite
than
others
overall
a
great
smelling
beer
that
is
very
much
let
down
by
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
not
actually
bad
its
just
that
there
isnt
too
much
there
if
the
alcohol
was
lower
maybe
that
would
be
okay
but
combined
with
the
alcohol
warming
not
to
mention
alcohol
taste
there
just
isnt
enough
flavor
there
for
me
overall
a
decent
beer
that
isnt
terrible
by
any
means
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
it
again
pours
dark
ruby
with
a
small
cream
colored

and
slick
mouthfeel
on
the
heavy
side
burnt

flavor
some
scotch
oats
hint
of
spice
bitterness
and
some
chocolate
overall
a
bit
bland
on
my
tastebuds
but
not
bad
o
a
unique
brew
that
is
quite
different
from
what
i
have
experienced
in
the
style
almost
tastes
as
if
they
mixed
a
thick
caramel
syrup
with
a
low
abv
scotch
ale
that
said
it
is
certainly
a
tasty
experience
o
the
complex
flavors
in
this
beer
make
it
a
nice
one
to
sip
but
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
o
very
nice
scotch
ale
like
how
the
toffee
and
smoke
meld
fantastic
beer
this
is
an
underrated
beer
for
its
style
big
flavor
in
a
relatively
small
price
point
o
great
example
of
the
style
o
its
pretty
good
yeah
but
its
missing
something
such
as
the
vague
stoutlike
qualities
of
old
chub
or
the
drinkable
complexity
of
dirty
bastard
as
such
its
hard
to
recommend
over
those
two
o
not
my
favorite
take
on
the
style
i
will
admit
that
it
probably
loses
points
because
i
dont
particularly
like
scoth
ales
strong
earthy
peat
notes
along
with
caramel
and
molasses
give
this
beer
a
rich
flavor
it
comes
a
bit
unglued
on
the
finish
but
some
may
enjoy
that
sweet
and
smoky
combination
not
bad
but
not
one
i
will
seek
out
overall
very
nice
scotch
ale
definitely
drinkable
and
to
be
fair
scotch
ales
arent
high
on
my
list
of
favorites
so
this
may
rate
even
higher
for
those
that
truly
enjoy
this
class
of
beer
overall
a
good
scotch
ale
you
cant
even
notice
the
booze
that
much
a
strong
pour
gets
you
enough
agitation
to
cover
the
surface
deep
brown
fades
swiftly
to
a
gathering
around
the
rims
close
to
zero
lacing
the
liquid

a
murky
orange
rust
to
reddish
brown
mud
lots
of
particulate
floating

barely
lightens
to

at
the

the
nose

a
bakery
full
of
german
chocolate
cake
caramel
covered
pastries
and
butterscotch
nice
for
the
amplitude
of
the
scents
without
heavy
clinging
in
the
nostrils
spreads
further
into
hazelnut
coffee
cola
and
some
poached
apricot

not
that
alcoholic
minimal
hops
presence
medium
to
fullbodied
slight
fizz
during

entry
but
the
carbonation
overall
is
lacking
smokier
here
with
tar
sauna
stone
and
scorched

fire
earth

delays
the
entrance
of
the
chocolate

honey
more
yeast

bread
dough
past
the
midpalate

out
this
before
the
apricot
peach
golden
raisin
and
orange
citrus
really
take
hold
as
in
the
nose
hides
its
abv
well
could
use
something
to
stiffen
it
and
create
more
energy
in
lieu
of
carbonation
otherwise
it
comes
across
as
a
traditional
rendition
of
the
style
d
read
my
taste
statement
pretty
much
sums
up
my
feelings
on

is

bready
some
alcohol
a
bit
sweet
some
dark

feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
different
and
solid
beer
worth
a
shot
o
tasty
scotch
ale
dangerously
drinkable
its
different
enough
from
othe
scotch
ales
that
i
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
overall
solid
beer
overall
and
for
the
price
not
a
bad
example
of
a
scotch
ale
i
wouldnt
put
it
above
the
dirty
bastard
as
far
as
mi
scotch
ales
are
considered
im
not
typically
a
scotch
ale
guy
but
i
can
dig
this
one
id
love
to
see
it
spend

of
some

this
is
very
well
balanced
and
well
made
brew
this
is
a
decent
very
malty
beer
i
thought
the
malts
were
complex
and
had
layers
of
flavor
unfortunately
the
crispness
of
the
carbonation
messed
with
my
palate
making
the
flavors
seem
fleeting
if
you
enjoy
this
style
this
is
probably
a
beer
that
is
worth
checking
out
oh
boy
an
outstanding
scotch
ale
save
it
for
a
closer
this
is
a
good
brew
tasted
more
smokey
flavor
this
time
around
this
was
solid
once
again
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
overall
this
is
good
scotch
ale
featuring
a
wide
variety
of
nicely
nuanced
flavors
the
sugars
and
breads
are
very
nice
in
here
though
the
woody
notes
do
take
over
a
bit
too
much
in
the
end
and
somewhat
spoil
the
aftertaste
still
its
a
decent
addition
to
the
style
and
worth
trying
oi
really
like
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
this
beer
especially
to
malty
beer
lovers
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
thanks
to
my
friend
in
minnasota
you
are
awesome
sarahjane
very
low
carbonation
needs
lots
more
o
overall
probably
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
had
to
date
the
flavors
open
up
and
meld
together
perfectly
forget
loch
down
forget
dirty
bastard
forget
skull
splitter
this
is
as
fucking
wonderful
scotch
ale
far
beyond
the
others
i
have
mentioned
an
intimidating
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
leaves
almost
no
lacing
smells
like
loads
of
sweet
caramel
dry
fruit
booze
taste
is
similar
bittersweet
very
rich
caramel
dry
and
dark
fruit
bready
malts
spices
very
candy
esque
mmm
medium
rich
mouthfeel
boozy
butter
i
love
it
this
beer
is
a
sleeper
pick
of
mine
dark
horse
doesnt
disappoint
they
should
age
this
stuff
in
wine
or
bourbon
barrels
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
would
buy
it
again
a
welldone
and
highly
bitter
strong
scotch
ale
with
good
alcohol
content
and
warmth
and
a
great
balance
and
sweet
dry
finish
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
call
it
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
on
the
planet
also
in
contention
are
old
chub
and
dirty
bastard
scotty
has
a
bit
more
balls
than
the
others
for
a
9
75
percent
beer
it
is
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
will
still
packing
a
punch
the
alcohol
is
evident
from
the
smell
and
finish
of
the
tasting
but
it
is
a
delicious
scotch
ale
and
has
become
a
regular
purchase
for
me
overall
to
me
this
drinks
a
lot
like
a
nut
brown
with
some
smoke
and
an
alcohol
finish
not
bad
just
not
a
super
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
pours
a
rich
deep
brown
topped
by
a
fluffy
two
finger
light
beige
head
little
to
no
lacing
huge
caramel
malt
fresh
moist
bran
muffins
some
grain
and
just
a
whiff
of
clean
alcohol
on
the
nose
an
absolute
malt
bomb
bread
crust
freshly
baked
lightly
sweet
dark
bread
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
moderate
carbonation
fights
through
the
creamy
full
body
and
shows
up
here
and
there
a
bit
of
syrupy
accents
on
the
edges
heavy
but
creamy
and
ridiculously
smooth
this
is
just
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
one
that
tops
it
overall
for
the
scotch
ale
enthusiasts
its
a
must
try
the
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
brings
out
the
the
rich
malt
and
molasses
its
a
meaty
ale
that
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
but
embraces
it
so
be
ready
for
a
headthumper
pours
a
burnt
copper
hue
with
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
burnt
carameltoffeenutcakeboozedried
fruit
and
molassesthe
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
toffeefruitcakeburnt
caramelcandi
sugarbutterscotch
and
finished
with
a
boozy
dryness
and
overall
its
a
nice
scotch
ale
and
would
buy
again
cheers
big
fullbodied
and
complex
yet
without
any
harshness
whatsoever
one
would
not
expect
this
beer
to
be
as
strong
as
it
is
incredibly
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
solid
beer
for
cold
winter
nights
im
really
digging
it
pours
medium
brown
with
a
hint
of
amber
color
slight
off
white
head
healthy
at
pour
with
minimal
lacing
finer
carbonation
that
excites
easily
with
a
swirl
smell
is
caramel
scented
and
sweet
flavor
is
also
sweet
but
detect
caramel
chocolate
and
maybe
some
plum
or
other
similar
fruit
it
masks
its
high
abv
well
not
noticeable
could
be
compared
to
a
barley
wine
but
without
the
alcohol
presence
really
enjoyable
brew
o
quite
good
but
ill
likely
stick
with
old
chub
i
will
say
for
9
75
it
drinks
like
a
much
lower
abv
brew
i
really
like
this
a
very
good
scotch
ale
and
really
good
without
aging
a
dark
black
brown
mahogany
color
with
a
full
tan
frothy
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
somewhat
sherry
prune
malt
solid
and
barley
winelike
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
mellow
prune
malt
and
vague
chocolate
caramel
theres
a
tart
herbalgrass
hop
that
blends
smoothly
with
the
dark
fruit
this
is
near
full
bodied
with
a
satiny
feel
and
very
quiet
carbonation
very
tasty
stuff
and
fairly
drinkable
though
not
a
session
brew
needless
to
say
o
second
offering
from
dark
horse
this
is
one
of
the
better
wee
heavies
out
there
well
done
brownish
color
with
minimal
head
smells
a
bit
hoppy
and
taste
wonderful
recommend
beer
for
a
good
time
buzzz
well
wortth
trying
this
beer
5
stars
hip
hip
hooray
also
i
poured
this
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
get
it
today
and
experience
greatness
solid
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
flavors
with
some
complimenting
sherry
and
rum
highlights
a
good
example
of
a
scotch
ale
ive
seen
this
beer
on
the
shelves
before
but
dont
know
why
i
never
though
to
buy
one
its
too
bad
cuz
it
really
is
a
decent
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
im
curious
how
this
beer
would
age
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
so
im
thinking
rather
well
and
will
try
overall
disappointing
especially
for
the
price
i
like
many
of
their
other
beers
but
this
one
doesnt
make
the
cut
o
this
beer
drinks
really
easy
for
a
beer
of
almost
10
abv
however
it
does
lack
in
the
mouth
and
the
taste
does
not
impress
like
an
excellent
scotch
ale
should
it
reminds
me
of
an
old
ale
by
the
smell
and
taste
so
it
does
not
follow
the
style
in
my
eyes
a
disappointment
for
sure
in
my
opinion
better
luck
next
time
cheers
overall
a
solid
scotch
ale
one
of
the
better
domestic
ones
ive
had
a
bourbon
barrelaged
version
of
this
would
be
divine
o
quite
possibly
my
new
favorite
scotch
ale
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
i
however
liked
it
and
i
could
see
me
sat
by
an
open
fire
at
christmas
really
enjoying
this
as
a
night
cap
before
bed
instead
of
a
scotch
i
usually
like
dark
horse
but
ill
mark
this
one
as
not
recommended
my
first
and
maybe
last
of
the
style
this
one
pours
a
dark
rust
brown
smells
sweetish
and
of
caramel
and
alcohol
and
malt
tastes
sweet
and
malt
and
malt
and
malt
it
punches
weirdly
i
think
and
is
not
bitter
in
the
least
i
should
have
known
better
mouthfeel
is
finely
carbonated
and
not
too
much
on
the
syrup
side
not
my
style
i
guess
o
a
great
example
of
a
scotch
ale
lots
of
depth
and
good
flavors
this
is
the
perfect
ale
to
drink
as
fall
starts
to
roll
in
its
hard
to
find
anything
to
fault
in
this
ale
its
a
beer
that
stays
true
to
the
style
which
is
nice
to
see
in
this
age
where
a
lot
of
beers
try
to
constantly
push
the
envelope
i
dont
really
care
for
this
one
too
much
o
like
i
said
this
is
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
tried
if
you
are
a
fan
of
malty
and
complex
sippers
you
wont
be
disappointed
by
this
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
brown
that
was
slightly
hazy
very
thin
trace
of
an
off
white
head
clung
to
the
sides
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
kinda
of
like
a
caramel
candy
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
was
hidden
underneath
the
sweet
kind
of
a
sugary
roasted
date
taste
as
well
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
pleasant
well
balanced
beer
the
abv
hit
a
little
fast
but
wasnt
noticeable
in
the
beer
dirty
almost
muddy
brown
with
a
beige
head
light
film
and
a
collar
of
retention
nose
holds
dark
fruits
sweet
caramels
toffee
and
some
marshmallow
taste
has
dark
bready
notes
a
bit
earthy
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
some
fruitiness
again
quite
big
in
terms
of
bodyviscosity
bit
theres
no
alcohol
to
be
found
at
all
which
is
magnificent
for
a
beer
of
this
size
low
carbonation
a
really
good
scotch
alewee
heavy
o
this
beer
has
some
serious
clout
big
rich
warming
great
for
when
youre
really
jonesing
for
something
malty
a
relaxing
sipper
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
i
have
had
hands
down
it
has
a
ton
of
flavor
lots
of
caramel
flavors
tons
of
roasted
malts
and
a
subtle
but
nice
dark
fruit
quality
it
has
a
full
feel
and
body
but
drinks
surprisingly
easy
it
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
you
with
a
nice
dark
fruit
and
roasty
dry
mouth
feel
a
fantastic
scotch
ale
that
i
wish
i
could
get
more

that
it

scotch

have
always

one

out

came
through

that
explains
my
happiness
despite
my
bracket
being
busted
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
big
malt
and
caramel
full
body
and
great
aroma
i
will
look
for
this
again
o
i
had
an
odd
yet
pleasant
experience
with
this
beer
at
least
it
left
with
something
to
remember
it
by
at
least
and
even
apart
from
that
it
certainly
was
a
good
beer
give
me
a
month
and
a
second
bottle
to
see
if
i
get
some
more
tastes
of
japanese
food
o
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
very
drinkable
nice
combination
of
initial
sweetness
eventually
yielding
to
an

recommended
thebeeralmanac
com
the
feel
is
by
far
the
biggest
problem
with
scotty
karate
just
not
full
enough
and
it
lacks
the
coating
that
could
let
you
really
savor
the
beer
overall
a
big
tasty
scotch
ale
good
character
hides
the
strength
well
enough
and
i
can
dig
it
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
deep
coppery
brown
body
with
a
small
shortlived
white
head
aroma
is
deep
malty
tones
with
burnt
caramel

and
hints
of

taste
is
more
caramel
dark
toffee
roasty
malt
tones
and
hints
of
walnut
smooth
mouthfeel
well
hidden
alcohol
pretty
nice
maybe
lacking
a
bit
in
complexity
but
overall
a
decent
scotch
ale
from
dark
horse
do
this
americanbrewed
wee
heavy
has
the
feel
of
a
beer
that
wants
very
badly
to
be
taken
seriously
it
tries
hard
and
occasionally
delivers
but
is
simultaneously
constrained
by
some
typical
strongale
problems
the
smell
is
excellent
and
enticing
providing
a
bookend
that
is
complemented
by
the
far
finish
of
pungent
and
dry
umami
along
the
way
acidity
plays
too
large
a
role
and
flavors
take
too
long
of
a
break
in
the
third
quarter
in
the
final
tally
it
is
worth
drinking
for
the
volatile
dried
mushroom
aftertaste
alone
awesome
just
a
little
sweetness
and
a
full
body
great
scotch
ale
oreally
great
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
another
day
i
really
look
forward
to
making
the
1
5
hr
trip
to
darkhorse
and
hopefully
soon
i
might
hold
on
to
one
to
see
what
happens
in
6
months
overall
one
of
my
favorite
wee
heavy
ales
this
doesnt
suffer
from
the
onenote
character
of
many
in
this
style
it
has
those
classic
malty
notes
with
some
modern
citruscy
hop
notes
remarkable
and
unique
experience
o
quite
a
beer
a
lot
like
an
old
ale
but
with
more
body
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
in
my
opinion
still
a
sipper
great
example
of
the
style
i
like
it
its
cloudy
and
interesting
looking
there
is
a
malty
aroma
overpowering
the
hops
appropriately
for
the
style
the
aftertaste
is
very
boozy
it
is
going
very
nicely
with
an
excessively
spicy
gumbo
they
are
going
toe
to
toe
i
would
buy
this
again
when
i
wanted
a
strong
scotch
ale
first
off
i
have
to
say
that
backwoods
bastard
is
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
been
able
to
try
that
being
said
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
while
poured
into
a
boulevard
tulip
color
is
a
reddish
brown
with
a
14
inch
head
that
stayed
throughout
smell
was
boozy
with
the
typical
bourbon
nose
of
this
type
taste
was
not
overly
hot
with
great
hints
of
caramel
and
oak
the
finish
lingered
although
not
as
long
as
bb
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thinker
side
which
is
what
i
want
from
scotch
ale
overall
this
is
very
nice
balanced
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
its
very
clean
and
does
not
have
the
twinge
that
you
get
from
bb
at
the
end
a
pretty
good
substitute
for
backwoods
bastard
which
is
not
easy
to
achieve
but
is
lacking
in
the
overall
mix
of
flavors
that
founders
provides
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
this
again
great
beer
dark
horse
wonder
a
wonderful
beer
i
gotta
be
careful
or
the
wife
is
going
to
drink
it
all
oflavor
notes
not
robust
enough
and
i
am
seeking
the
barrel
version
of
this
brew
as
it
could
make
it
perfect
as
with
my
other
2011
brews
will
cellar
and
check
back
at
5
and
10
years
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
scotch
ale
nice
flavors
and
great
balance
even
a
little
complexity
no
punches
here
at
all
just
a
smooth
creamy
flavorful
scotch
ale
a
great
way
to
end
a
cool
evening
i
recommend
this
one
overall
its
a
nice
beer
for
me
nothing
stands
out
as
amazing
but
nothing
stands
out
as
bad
a
bit
above
average
for
me
but
thats
it
this
is
a
great
sweetish
sipper
with
a
nice
roasty
balance
o
this
is
an
aboveaverage
scotch
ale
maybe
falling
just
short
of
a
few
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
ccb
alesmith
id
love
to
see
what
a
barrel
would
do
to
this
its
definitely
got
some
aspects
that
would
be
complimented
o
excellent
this
could
easily
be
the
base
for
dfhs
wws
before
all
of
the
supplemental
sugar
feedings
i
think
a
me
from
the
future
traveled
back
in
time
to
start
dark
horse
i
thoroughly
enjoy
every
beer
ive
had
from
them
its
as
if
they
were
brewed
specifically
for
my
palate
an
excellent
scotch
with
awesome
heft
and
character
i
love
dark
horse
and
this
has
me
positively
twitchy
to
get
back
to
visit
them
cheers
i
am
enjoying
this
scotch
ale
it
is
slightly
boozy
but
the
warmth
it
provides
works
well
in
these
colder
months
i
would
certainly
drink
this
one
again
and
recommend
fans
of
the
style
seek
it
out
o
this
is
a
big
beer
that
youll
need
to
take
your
time
with
has
to
be
the
most
extreme
take
on
the
style
ive
had
id
drink
it
again
for
certain
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
i
can
remember
having
another
quality
brew
from
dark
horse
pretty
good
scotch
ale
but
the
high
carbonation
kind
of
hurts
this
from
being
better
overall
impression
very
rich
malty
and
great
for
the
style
the
abvs
werent
very
noticeable
except
for
some
alcohol
warmth
at
the
finish
this
brew
is
keeping
my
interest
in
scotch
ales
very
high
would
recommend
you
trying
this
brew
and
not
just
bc
of
the
awesome
gremlin
on
the
front
of
the
label
o
this
is
easily
my
favorite
scotch
ale
ive
tried
im
usually
not
too
big
of
a
fan
due
to
the
overt
smokiness
ive
encountered
before
but
this
is
just
a
damn
fine
beer
period
o
not
an
overly
done
scotch
ale
it
has
a
good
malty
character
with
a
nice
mellow
scotch
quality
mouthfeel
is
perfect
cost
7
99
for
a
four
pack
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
wish
this
wasnt
so
medicinal
tasting
if
that
sensation
wasnt
there
i
probably
would
have
enjoyed
this
even
more
the
flavor
has
a
good
amount
of
malt
depth
with
slight
toasted
grain
up
front
and
subtle
caramel
w
mild
woody
hop
accents
and
light
toasted
toffee
essence
that
carries
a
hint
of
earthy
elements
with
thte
mild
grasspine
and
slight
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
dried
fruit
from
the
yeast
this
ale
is
overall
pretty
high
in
drinkability
with
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
the
heft
of
alcohol
it
packs
the
scottish
ale
is
not
mild
in
flavor
yet
still
is
able
to
hide
some
of
the
brawn
i
went
back
for
several
tastes
from
this
growler
o
this
is
a
great
value
from
dark
horse
great
flavor
and
nice
balance
great
representation
of
the
style
o
wonderful
if
not
for
the
lack
of
body
the
way
this
tastes
coupled
with
the
aroma
leads
me
to
anticipate
a
thick
whiskeylike
body
all
that
aside
this
is
still
a
great
beer
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
better
out
there
deep
malty
backbone
was
starting
to
push
through
lots
of
sweet
notes
taking
over
on
this
one
with
hints
of
caramel
vanilla
and
nice
earthy
grains
starting
to
come
to
the
front
definitely
some
wood
somewhere
in
its
history
as
the
aroma
of
oak
was
huge
on
this
one
lots
of
caramel
and
vanilla
starting
to
take
shape
here
really
lightning
it
up
and
make
it
that
much
sweeter
next
up
in
the
lineup
was
a
full
on
assault
of
the
oak
and
wood
flavors
that
were
coming
through
earlier
strong
hints
of
oak
and
bourbon
dominating
it
here
really
giving
it
a
deep
flavor
and
pronounced
presence
ever
so
slightly
dry
hop
finish
really
quite
complex
and
very
nice
indeed
overall
im
quite
pleased
with
scotty
karate
and
dark
horse
for
that
matter
ive
only
had
three
of
their
offerings
but
theyve
all
been
solid
2
5
d
i
expect
a
lot
more
from
dark
horse
somehow
they
managed
to
make
an
almost
10
beer
with
almost
no
intensity
i
was
pleasently
surprised
with
this
one
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
toffee
color
that
is
hazy
to
the
point
of
opaque
about
two
centimeters
of
fluffy
bubbly
creamcolored
head
develops
and
lingers
briefly
minimal
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
as
scattered
patches
of
bubbles
the
nose
is
a
bit
subdued
but
scotch
a
bit
of
grain
some
lighter
english
malt
and
earthen
notes
are
present
the
aroma
is
pleasant
just
hard
to
detect
it
tastes
of
earthen
grass
faint
malt
peaty
scotch
some
odd
citrusy
fruits
and
a
rush
of
smoky
grain
at
the
end
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
is
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
finishes
clean
adding
to
the
drinkability
greatly
overall
a
highly
drinkable
scotch
ale
that
i
could
happily
return
to
just
like
any
good
scotch
ale
this
beer
starts
and
finishes
with
an
exceptional
carmerlized
carmelly
taste
with
slight
smoke
and
roast
at
9
75
it
hides
its
alcohol
very
very
well
always
looking
forward
to
this
one
come
fall
in
hopes
of
drinking
these
at
dark
horse
while
watching
scotty
perform
too
the
flavors
come
across
so
smooth
rich
and
creamy
and
integrated
i
swear
the
last
2
bottles
of
this
i
drank
were
not
this
integrated
or
smooth
this
one
is
prime
once
again
smoked
malts
caramel
malts
peaty
earthy
notes
reminds
me
of
moss
covered
rocks
the
dark
fruits
are
lesser
here
then
the
earthy
notes
but
show
s
glimpse
and
the
smokey
notes
really
add
a
deep
complexity
here
compared
to
other
in
the
genre
overall
one
of
the
best
non
barrelaged
scotch
ales
i
have
had
very
nice
flavors
and
texture
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
so
far
great
offering
from
dark
horse
that
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
i
will
however
be
wary
of
the
9
75
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
the
flavor
has
a
richness
to
it
that
is
refreshing
a
satisfying
not
as
complex
or
resonant
as
most
quads
and
this
is
not
a
quad
but
it
has
many
aspects
that
remind
of
that
style
which
is
a
favorite
of
mine
overall
a
great
week
heavy
admittedly
im
a
huge
wee
heavy
fan
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
medium
body
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
solid
wee
heavy
but
not
quite
one
of
my
favorites
o
next
to
backwoods
bastard
and
shaggin
in
the
wood
which
is
almost
doesnt
count
as
a
scotch
ale
due
to
the
inclusion
of
stout
characteristics
this
is
one
of
my
new
top
3
scotch
ales
not
as
sweet
and
powerful
as
something
like
skull
splitter
scotty
karate
errs
on
the
side
of
session
ale
though
at
9
75
it
ought
to
be
a
short
session
in
its
ability
to
hide
its
alcohol
and
leave
the
palate
unburdened
by
thickness
or
sugar
o
pretty
good
stuff
not
something
im
going
to
seek
out
a
ton
of
but
i
would
buy
again
this
seems
more
complex
as
you
sip
a
very
good
example
that
shows
restraint
with
sugar
and
smoke
but
then
goes
wild
with
the
alcohol
a
great
sipping
beer
o
a
very
good
scotch
ale
im
kind
of
dissapointed
that
the
flavors
of
the
beer
are
not
more
noticable
but
stil
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
nice
and
complex
i
liked
the
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
notes
would
have
again
poured
into
a
pint
grass
from
the
bottle
i
was
immediately
impressed
by
the
aroma
the
sweet
maltiness
coupled
with
a
degree
of
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
brought
to
mind
childrens
breakfast
cereals
the
color
was
a
murky
brown
with
a
touch
of
reddish
hue
the
taste
was
a
robust
maltiness
with
a
sweet
banana
candy
flavor
this
is
not
a
scotch
ale
that
one
forgets
a
few
minutes
after
it
fits
your
tongue
very
smooth
going
down
and
easy
to
drink
scotty
karate
ends
with
a
mildly
sweet
yet
tart
aftertaste
as
a
fan
of
the
style
this
may
be
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
had
received
in
trade
from
gpharris
thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
chunky
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
thinnish
khaki
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
top
smell
is
sweet
malty
fruity
ethanoly
wow
thats
not
what
i
expected
on
the
nose
quite
complex
and
different
caramel
toffee
juicy
dark
fruit
toffee
hints
of
smoke
and
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
juicy
fruits
mixed
with
caramel
midway
through
long
lingering
sweet
fruit
and
alcohol
heat
in
a
fairly
dry
finish
body
is
a
bit
lighter
than
medium
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
sugary
watery
mouthfeel
this
smells
fantastic
looks
horrible
and
tastes
pretty
good
i
bit
more
body
and
clarity
would
send
this
one
out
the
stratosphere
for
me
pours
a
murky
brown
swampy
a
new
word
for
murky
and
hazy
brown
appearance
with
a
light
head
nice
reddish
hue
to
it
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
spice
heavy
sugars
creamy
and
caramel
flavor
was
sweet
dark
fruit
raisin
and
alcohol
on
the
finish
average
palate
another
gem
from
this
brewery
i
love
dark
horse
taste
is
ok
but
i
miss
the
carbonation
reasonable
beer
ordered
this
beer
on
tap
a
while
ago
at
the
tap
table
when
it
was
still
open
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
looking
deep
brown
color
to
it
with
a
creamy
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
wasnt
too
sticky
but
left
a
few
lines
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
and
malty
like
it
should
smell
for
this
style
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
sweetness
throughout
its
a
very
malty
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
feeling
with
some
light
carbonation
overall
i
would
enjoy
having
this
one
again
one
day
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
but
doesnt
bother
at
all
to
hide
its
strength
can
feel
a
bit
oppressive
as
a
result
but
in
spite
of
that
i
like
it
a
lot
and
would
have
it
again
very
enjoyable
scotch
ale
a
big
peatearthy
profile
which
i
liked
alot
definitely
digging
dark
horse
so
far
o
this
a
good
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
gotten
the
opportunity
to
try
that
being
said
there
are
others
of
the
style
that
i
prefer
this
brew
is
smooth
and
very
nice
on
the
palate
but
i
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
kick
im
pretty
sure
that
im
drinking
the
34
year
old
version
right
now
so
ill
hopefully
catch
it
this
fall
and
try
it
fresh
regardless
another
solid
beer
from
dark
horse
do
a
good
scotch
ale
but
not
outstanding
in
the
upper
tier
as
far
as
abv
for
the
style
a
nice
sipper
during
an
evening
of
any
season
thanks
for
the
bottle
mammothbrew
good
stuff
ive
only
been
able
to
find
dark
horses
ipas
and
sapient
on
tap
but
would
love
to
park
next
a
keg
of
this
one
o
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
really
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
pack
but
its
not
bad
by
any
means
overall
an
extremely
tasty
scotch
ale
definitely
has
the
exact
flavor
that
one
would
expect
from
a
scotch
ale
carmelly
sweetness
balanced
by
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
very
rich
fullbodied
style
and
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
several
of
even
the
best
examples
of
the
style
in
one
sitting
that
said
its
a
delicious
satisfying
style
to
be
sure
and
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
the
scotty
karate
rendition
many
times
in
the
future
wonderful
beer
hidden
booze
flavor
complexity
easy
to
drink
loved
this
another
winner
from
what
is
becoming
a
real
favorite
brewery
skål
deep
amber
body
with
a
thin
creamy
head
loads
of
sweet
caramel
in
the
nose
some
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
the
flavor
is
not
as
cloying
as
most
scotch
ales
so
thats
a
good
thing
caramel
and
chocolate
initially
with
some
cinnamon
a
bit
of
oak
and
a
short
and
rather
sweet
finish
in
a
word
this
scotch
ale
is
delicious
one
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
that
ive
had
to
date
absolutely
one
that
will
be
making
a
return
to
my
fridge
overall
this
was
enjoyable
enough
for
a
style
that
im
often
indifferent
about
full
of
flavor
mouthefeel
is
just
ok
but
thats
often
the
case
for
me
with
this
style
still
recommended
and
i
would
drink
it
again
big
thanks
goes
out
to
a74gent
for
this
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
delirium
tremens
snifter
poured
a
chocolatey
brown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
slight
peat
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
it
had
a
definite
peat
presence
going
on
here
but
was
not
overly
invasive
to
the
palate
im
not
a
big
peat
fan
so
this
was
a
nice
compromise
for
me
the
flavor
and
aroma
were
very
nicely
balanced
if
both
would
have
been
a
little
more
complex
this
could
have
been
a
great
brew
definitely
worth
trying
or
ticking
either
way
o
overall
a
very
thick
scotch
ale
but
nicely
balanced
and
pleasant
tasting
really
smooth
but
so
much
so
that
it
didnt
really
resemble
a
scotch
ale
at
all
still
good
though
brown
body
with
a
tan
head
and
slightly
carbonated

and

westborough
ma
overall
another
great
beer
from
dark
horse
thanks
to
randalld
for
the
opportunity
o
drinkability
isnt
the
greatest
one
is
enough
it
is
pretty
high
in
abv
but
it
doesnt
seem
quite
that
high
though
it
still
a
big
bruiser
of
a
scotch
ale
with
in
your
face
flavors
an
imperial
scotch
ale
purchased
at
stoneys
4
pack
8
99
overall
i
like
it
nice
complexities
and
smoothness
overall
drinkability
not
a
bad
drinking
scotch
ale
pretty
much
what
i
expected
though
not
a
style
im
a
huge
fan
of
its
a
tasty
brew
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
o
wow
what
a
special
brew
i
really
think
i
am
developing
an
affinity
for
scotch
ales
this
is
delicious
borderline
refreshing
even
and
doesnt
have
an
overbearing
warming
effect
as
one
might
expect
perfect
balance
from
start
to
finish
really
enjoyed
this
one
md
slightly
bigger
than
medium
bodied
with
very
nice
carbonation
has
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
a
flavorful
beer
that
is
a
nice
treat
solid
for
the
style
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
more
thin
than
you
might
expect
from
a
beer
this
big
but
again
not
detracting
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
d
great
malty
brew
without
being
syrupy
or
overly
sweet
thanks
again
jay
well
done
dark
horse
slightly
sweet
just
like
i
remember
plead
the
5th
ris
good
carbonation
and
a
healthy
thick
body
for
a
9
7
pours
a
near
black
deep
brown
with
amber
hues
great
lacing
as
i
swirl
it
around
the
glass
aroma
is
of
caramel
bready
malts
and
some
diacetyl
alcohol
is
very
barely
present
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
a
big
toffee
caramel
malt
sweetness
diacetyl
again
but
not
overbearing
little
to
no
hop
presence
in
the
finish
leaves
a
sticky
sweet
coating
on
the
palate
creamy
velvety
body
with
moderate
bubbly
carbonation
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
bit
disappointed
with
the
diacetyl
characteristics
but
still
above
average
this
is
a
must
try
and
another
winner
from
dark
horse
brewing
company
d
off
the
charts
drinkability
my
wife
had
a
sip
and
then
wanted
to
switch
beers
with
me
she
usually
stays
away
from
stronger
ales
but
not
this
i
could
have
easily
had
2
or
3
pints
of
this
had
i
not
been
driving
well
done
it
is
complex
but
perhaps
not
the
flavors
that
i
really
look
for
in
a
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
unique
scotch
ale
i
like
the
fact
that
this
beer
incorporated
some
smokey
peat
flavors
you
would
think
more
scotch
ales
would
have
smoked
peat
flavors
like
this
one
but
i
find
this
one
in
the
minority
i
am
glad
dark
horse
took
a
typical
scotch
ale
and
transformed
it
into
a
one
of
a
kind
brew
good
job
guys
this
is
not
a
brew
to
pass
up
its
pretty
damn
good
id
go
for
this
one
again
quite
drinkable
not
sure
i
could
have
too
many
as
it
is
heavy
and
pretty
high
alcohol
but
definitely
tasty
the
taste
is
crazy
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
the
more
complex
beers
i
have
had
i
have
a
little
trouble
describing
the
taste
its
definitely
got
a
sweetness
and
malt
to
it
it
tastes
similar
to
other
scotch
ales
but
i
somehow
like
it
better
for
the
abv
the
absence
of
the
alcohol
taste
is
surprising
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
which
means
trouble
at
this
alcohol
content
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
and
another
winner
from
dark
horse
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
crimson
hue
offwhite
head
starts
out
fairly
high
and
falls
somewhat
quickly
into
a
nice
cap
and
collar
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
sweet
with
quite
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
a
smoked
character
there
as
well
the
peated
malt
really
comes
through
quite
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
overwhelming
some
of
the
other
characteristics
some
dryness
in
the
finish
almost
woody
slight
bitterness
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
this
is
a
bit
too
far
toward
the
peaty
end
of
the
spectrum
for
me
get
this
this
is
another
outstanding
beer
by
dark
horse
brewing
company
good
stuff
best
aged
until
the
bottles
appear
somewhat
bright
the
freshly
bottled
stuff
holds
its
haze
for
a
while
and
it
can
be
a
bit
hot
d
the
light
body
especially
considering
the
high
abv
makes
this
easy
to
drink
but
it
could
have
been
a
little
less
waterythin
also
im
not
sure
why
there
isnt
more
of
a
peat
flavor
i
certainly
would
have
enjoyed
this
much
more
with
more
pronounced
smokiness
i
guess
id
say
this
leans
more
towards
a
wee
heavy
than
a
scotch
ale
by
its
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
very
nice
flavors
going
on
i
really
liked
the
addition
of
the
smoke
flavors
in
the
finish
it
really
made
it
a
little
more
complex
and
delicious
for
me
very
nice
beer
overall
and
a
cool
and
different
take
on
the
style
compared
to
others
ive
had
served
to
me
in
an
absinthestyle
stemmed
glass
dug
it
wanted
but
didnt
expect
a
lil
head
i
am
versed
in
the
style
lightly
purpleish
reddish
brown
thin
haze
whoa
9
75
it
drank
a
little
weighty
maltwise
on
the
tongue
counterbalancedsmothered
that
alc
i
guess
wellmade
allaround
doesnt
remind
me
of
scotland
per
se
but
it
doesnt
identify
itself
really
as
anything
other
than
a
wee
heavy
ill
go
with
that
id
choose
it
again
d
3
found
myself
really
wanting
this
to
be
thicker
and
richer
the
uncloaked
sensation
of
alcohol
a
related
feature
was
too
much
imo
drinkability
here
is
good
as
well
a
sipper
for
sure
but
what
do
you
expect
from
a
big
beer
like
this
nice
and
warming
on
a
cold
winters
night
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thicker
than
i
would
like
to
see
out
of
any
beer
and
paired
with
the
high
abv
made
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
one
of
my
favorite
rhyming
beer
names
it
pours
a
murky
blacksienna
topped
by
around
a
finger
or
so
of
dirty
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
toffee
mandarin
oranges
a
touch
of
peatsmoked
malt
and
red
apples
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cinnamon
cherrywoodsmoked
honeybaked
ham
cocoa
caramel
and
a
hint
of
oak
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
somewhat
light
moderate
carbonation
a
slightly
chewy
feel
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
all
the
nicer
thanks
to
the
understated
smokiness
drinkability
definitely
easy
to
take
down
but
hits
you
a
bit
later
not
too
overwhelming
but
overall
very
complex
and
pleasing
to
the
tongue
and
stomach
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
forming
on
top
then
slowly
dissolving
away
to
a
ring
on
top
the
malt
is
very
malty
giving
off
a
strong
malty
fragrance
with
a
malty
aroma
lingering
on
the
nose
there
are
touches
of
smoke
and
dried
did
i
mention
there
was
some
malt
the
malty
dominates
the
taste
surprise
from
front
to
back
with
a
dried
fruit
and
caramel
sweetness
blending
in
at
the
end
a
hearty
feel
with
a
chewy
texture
and
clings
to
the
palate
it
finishes
with
a
mild
warmth
from
alcohol
this
is
a
beer
for
a
bitter
cold
night
the
malt
makes
this
a
comfy
beer
i
know
i
know
dont
judge
a
beer
by
its
label
yet
as
i
reached
for
this
on
the
shelf
at
the
store
i
thought
this
thing
is
definitely
going
to
be
overhopped
look
at
the
label
sure
enough
for
a
scotch
ale
this
thing
is
overhopped
the
hops
arent
very
apparent
in
the
aroma
and
the
slightly
smoky
malt
is
the
dominant
force
but
the
taste
tilts
toward
citrus
and
even
seaweed
i
like
nori
as
much
as
the
next
sushi
lover
but
not
in
my
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
american
scotch
ale
youll
do
far
better
with
those
from
geary
or
founders
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
d
nothing
really
wows
me
about
this
beer
the
flavors
are
a
little
subdued
and
it
is
kind
of
harsh
going
down
probably
a
good
thing
considering
the
very
well
hidden
abv
bottle
from
hopscotch
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
a
red
hue
and
a
small
beige
head
nose
of
rich
gooey
chocolate
and
caramel
fudge
amazing
likeness
there
a
touch
smoky
mouth
is
creamy
rich
full
of
that
slightly
smoky
somewhat
bitter
chocolate
fudge
and
caramel
much
like
eating
a
cake
some
hop
bitterness
brings
up
the
back
end
a
tad
watery
this
is
nice
and
im
pleasantly
surprised
thanks
man
i
got
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
with
ljkeats
a
while
back
thanks
again
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
somewhat
dark
toffee
brown
color
with
zero
head
on
this
pretty
color
but
overall
this
looks
kind
of
dull
i
dont
know
if
i
really
smell
this
or
i
think
i
smell
this
because
this
is
a
scotch
ale
but
there
seems
to
be
a
big
scotch
aroma
that
im
really
into
with
this
one
the
aroma
is
coated
with
scotch
boozy
toffee
thick
malts
and
a
slight
fruity
presence
solid
flavors
on
this
one
to
again
scotch
with
a
big
malt
backbone
and
a
slight
spiciness
to
it
a
toffee
sweetness
this
is
kickin
kind
of
a
light
body
and
low
carbonation
this
is
solid
but
i
think
id
like
it
more
if
it
were
a
bit
heavier
this
drinks
real
nice
for
a
near
ten
percent
beer
definitely
want
more
of
these
for
the
winter
pours
a
deep
amber
too
brownish
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
caramel
and
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
smokiness
in
the
taste
caramel
and
small
roastiness
small
smokiness
and
ends
with
a
small
alcohol
dryness
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
and
hints
of
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
hides
the
alcohol
and
quite
nice
i
got
to
say
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
pours
a
dark
amber
sort
of
hazy
but
not
as
dark
as
a
porter
just
slightly
dark
had
a
half
inch
of
head
smells
of
slight
bourbon
caramel
malts
and
faint
hops
taste
was
amazing
for
almost
10
percent
you
get
faint
alcohol
then
a
bite
of
hops
to
mellow
then
the
sweet
caramel
finish
mouthfeel
didnt
seem
that
heavy
at
all
with
a
medium
kind
of
body
i
was
assuming
the
entire
time
it
was
around
8
percent
drink
ability
is
kind
of
good
if
i
were
to
find
it
again
but
this
one
was
on
tap
at
a
place
in
south
side
so
i
may
find
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
floating
around
somewhere
the
best
part
was
the
tap
handle
was
a
shotgun
shaped
and
they
said
everyone
always
asked
whats
on
the
shotgun
smooth
beer
d
could
drink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
d
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
in
this
beer
despite
the
high
abv
i
could
enjoy
several
in
a
sitting
especially
on
a
cold
winter
night
the
folks
over
at
dark
horse
have
a
world
class
beer
on
their
hands
nice
offering
from
dark
horse
of
the
scotch
ales
ive
had
this
one
is
near
the
top
good
stuff
excellent
deep
dark
body
nice
head
taste
is
smoke
and
molasses
but
what
else
would
you
want
from
this
style
ill
continue
to
buy
this
one
nice
beer
this
strong
beer
does
not
keep
you
guessing
it
is
straight
forward
and
the
scottish
style
yeast
resembles
a
belgian
that
is
balanced
and
creamy
this
beer
is
great
from
start
to
finish
preferred
warm
about
5052f
vs
coolerrefrigerator
42f
based
on
the
12
oz
bottles
and
great
for
an
evening
dinner
pair
besides
for
spicy
dish
910
or
a
overall
d
i
dont
have
access
to
this
so
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
these
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
amazing
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
one
i
think
gets
better
with
food
versus
by
itself
overall
some
of
the
main
reasons
i
dont
enjoy
some
scotch
ales
is
the
accumulating
sweetness
and
cloying
nature
of
their
bodies
however
this
one
packs
a
balance
flavor
full
body
but
manages
to
avoid
my
personal
pitfalls
of
the
style
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
pretty
easy
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
refreshing
with
a
small
aftertaste
that
gives
back
a
caramel
flavor
db
a
scotch
ale
that
shows
its
size
the
malt
profile
is
huge
and
not
as
sweet
as
most
other
examples
of
the
style
sort
of
has
a
brown
ale
feeling
alcohol
gives
this
one
a
rough
edge
but
there
are
certainly
times
when
i
look
for
that
definitely
worth
a
shot
especially
if
you
enjoy
the
style
i
like
it
and
id
drink
it
again
and
it
has
the
markings
of
a
scotch
ale
but
think
of
it
like
a
bitter
brown
that
someone
added
a
dash
of
scotch
ale
flavor
syrup
to
drinkability
very
dangerous
scotch
ale
as
it
does
not
seem
to
be
close
to
10
at
all
complex
and
blessedly
not
too
sweet
just
a
great
scotch
ale
overall
scotty
karate
is
a
bit
different
than
many
scotch
ales
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
held
in
check
very
well
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
great
beer
for
a
cool
fall
night
d
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
i
dont
want
to
run
to
the
fridge
for
another
but
it
taste
great
and
every
sip
is
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
this
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
with
appropriate
carbonation
wouldnt
object
to
a
revisit
but
im
set
with
a
bottle
per
sitting
a
nice
beer
overall
wabout
average
drinkability
for
the
style
recommend
drinking
at
a
higher
temp
than
i
did
fridge
temp
approx
35
f
because
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
became
more
decipherable
and
more
palatable
a
decent
take
on
the
style
but
just
not
doing
a
whole
lot
for
me
the
taste
is
a
bit
confusing
and
the
alcohol
is
up
there
which
brings
the
drinkability
down
considering
its
9
75
i
didnt
think
it
was
overpowering
in
terms
of
the
alcohol
content
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
surprised
and
happy
that
it
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
bottle
was
about
a
year
or
so
old
d
good
but
sweet
and
slick
kinda
thick
but
finishes
pretty
clean
one
glass
was
great
but
i
probably
wont
have
two
in
a
row
d
i
could
session
this
brew
being
that
it
is
high
in
abv
and
price
i
dont
feel
that
this
would
be
the
case
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
in
regards
to
overall
tastes
drinkability
is
what
id
expect
for
a
wee
heavy
ill
be
following
this
with
something
lighterbodied
and
more
bitter
mouthfeel
is
regrettably
thin
this
beer
deserves
better
note
in
my
original
notes
i
missed
the
abv
i
didnt
notice
the
heatweight
of
a
9
in
there
thanks
megan
for
bringing
this
one
over
the
other
night
poured
a
nice
medium
mahogany
color
with
a
smallish
light
brown
head
aromas
of
whisky
caramel
dark
brown
sugar
smooth
and
warming
on
the
palate
with
dark
fruit
caramel
and
brown
sugar
a
very
delicious
and
drinkable
scotch
ale
not
too
strong
to
affect
drinkability
i
would
definitley
drink
again
d
a
very
good
scotch
ale
very
similar
to
old
chub
by
oscar
blues
nice
beer
nice
i
like
it
rather
sweet
and
strong
to
be
an
easy
drinker
try
it
o
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
dissuade
others
maybe
the
taste
will
grow
on
me
some
day
d
although
im
not
too
high
on
the
look
of
this
beer
everything
else
about
it
is
very
appropriate
nice
and
malty
and
rich
with
a
great
boozy
kick
complex
appropriate
feel
that
makes
it
go
down
easy
drinks
much
easier
than
an
almost
10
brew
if
this
one
is
found
near
you
definitely
give
it
a
shot
great
beer
typical
of
its
style
coming
from
someone
who
loves
malt
heavy
beer
this
goes
down
pretty
easily
could
i
drink
this
all
the
time
given
the
abv
probably
not
but
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
delicious
d
one
of
the
few
beers
i
like
from
dark
horse
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
scotch
ale
and
recommended
to
all
you
like
the
style
o
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
it
did
not
disappoint
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
the
drinkability
suffers
a
little
due
to
the
boozy
finishaftertaste
will
buy
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
thats
worth
seeking
out
d
no
booziness
thats
a
big
plus
indulgent
malts
thats
a
plus
plenty
of
peat
smoke
thats
a
plus
im
not
seeing
any
downside
an
excellent
wee
heavy
overall
a
nice
beer
closer
to
a
heavy
rauchbier
than
scotch
ale
but
has
its
heavy
sweetness
perhaps
this
is
more
what
a
scotch
ale
should
be
i
really
enjoyed
it
d
a
great
sipper
i
enjoyed
this
one
while
relaxing
on
my
porch
d
its
a
good
beer
but
due
to
the
sweetness
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
to
many
of
these
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
thick
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dark
horse
brews
it
has
a
lot
of
character
low
hop
flavor
and
rich
malt
present
the
malt
isnt
over
powering
but
rather
balanced
i
love
this
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
well
done
wee
heavy
worth
a
shot
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
browncopper
color
with
about
an
inch
beige
head
that
went
away
quickly
theres
also
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
the
beer
smells
like
caramel
malt
peatsmoke
toffee
and
nuts
it
tastes
like
smokepeat
toffee
nuts
raisins
molasses
and
also
a
bit
of
an
earthy
flavor
the
smoke
flavor
lingers
around
in
the
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
rich
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
almost
10
abv
isnt
very
noticable
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
id
definitely
buy
this
again
this
seems
to
be
drinking
really
well
maybe
im
just
thirsty
but
making
in
through
this
glass
is
no
problem
d
nice
scotch
style
ale
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
and
again
dark
horse
makes
a
fine
scotch
ale
and
i
hate
to
share
it
absolutely
superb
flavor
theres
a
great
blend
of
darker
malts
without
any
burnt
notes
more
hoppy
than
most
scotch
ales
but
i
think
this
adds
to
the
flavor
at
nearly
10
abv
it
is
stunning
how
little
alcohol
shows
up
on
the
tongue
some
comes
through
on
the
swallow
this
is
a
deceptively
strong
beer
dark
horse
continues
to
impress
scotty
karate
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
im
really
tempted
to
award
the
next
highest
flavor
score
but
just
cant
get
there
it
seems
to
lack
just
a
little
something
extra
to
get
it
there
nonetheless
its
very
good
the
nose
could
use
some
work
but
its
a
solid
performer
otherwise
easily
recommended
i
will
have
a
couple
of
these
while
i
read
a
book
solid
evening
the
taste
of
scotty
karate
struck
me
as
bacon
soaked
in
hopflavored
coffee
unique
sure
creative
perhaps
but
tasty
not
a
chance
charred
beefy
malts
fight
with
medicinal
phenolics
in
the
finish
flooding
an
otherwise
pleasant
chocolatey
scotch
malt
profile
pine
sap
bitterness
on
the
end
tastes
out
of
place
and
overlycomplex
at
least
the
near
10
abv
is
wellhidden
mouthfeel
is
muddled
and
overcarbonated
giving
it
a
thinner
body
than
it
should
have
juicy
at
times
crisp
and
dry
at
others
im
normally
a
big
fan
of
dark
horse
but
this
beer
is
a
hot
mess
avoid
bottle
poured
into
a
large
snifter
dark
purplebrown
color
fizzy
with
medium
head
smell
is
floral
and
perfumelike
a
mix
of
potpourris
and
spices
this
a
really
oddsmelling
beer
unlike
any
ive
tried
taste
is
smoky
and
creamy
reminds
me
of
a
mellowedwhiskey
or
cigar
smoke
alcohol
presence
is
very
tame
and
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
md
medium
bodied
low
carb
good
drinkability
overall
interesting
beer
and
worth
a
shot
drinkablity
is
high
despite
the
high
abv
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
back
easily
drinkability
wow
what
a
great
beer
from
dark
horse
a
nice
and
complex
semifruity
rich
and
malty
masterpiece
this
hits
all
the
high
points
of
scotch
ales
i
wish
i
picked
up
a
four
pack
of
this
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
indication
to
be
found
but
with
nearly
10
abv
we
wont
have
any
issues
here
pours
a
clear
dark
amberbrown
with
a
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
head
receeds
fairly
fast
with
an
audible
crackling
of
the
bubbles
it
disperses
to
just
a
thin
film
on
top
of
the
beer
supported
by
pretty
much
constant
bubbles
of
carbonation
aroma
is
wow
this
is
the
first
time
i
can
truely
thank
myself
for
being
a
homebrewer
and
being
able
to
identify
the
unmistakeable
aroma
of
pete
smoked
barley
the
nose
also
includes
other
malt
and
an
vibrant
alcohol
presence
taste
is
inline
with
the
smell
of
the
beer
pete
smoked
barley
creastes
the
minor
illusion
of
sipping
scotch
flavors
of
heavy
malt
smoke
oak
and
alcohol
prevail
medium
to
heavy
feel
would
seem
more
full
bodied
if
it
didnt
have
such
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
to
the
point
of
being
dangerous
considering
it
flirts
with
double
digits
worth
of
alcohol
lingering
taste
of
the
peted
barley
is
left
in
the
mouth
very
nicely
done
overall
with
the
only
gripe
that
the
amount
of
the
pete
smoked
character
pretty
much
overwhelms
the
other
flavors
this
beer
could
have
shown
as
it
warms
a
little
note
of
sweet
caramel
comes
through
the
smokiness
and
the
alcohol
remains
notably
warming
purchased
a
4
pack
at
php
in
brookline
noticed
a
layer
of
sediment
at
bottom
of
bottle
was
careful
not
to
pour
into
glass
served
in
stemmed
glasses
murky
brown
color
nice
sized
head
good
amount
of
lacing
smell
was
malty
and
smoky
in
the
taste
there
was
definitely
a
peaty
flavor
but
it
was
much
more
subdued
that
other
scotch
ales
i
have
had
recently
i
think
it
prefer
it
this
way
actually
the
scent
and
flavor
of
smoke
and
peat
is
there
but
it
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
very
much
just
a
nice
background
aspect
smooth
body
could
be
a
bit
thicker
but
that
might
reduce
its
drinkability
high
abv
is
certainly
noticeable
about
halfway
through
the
glass
a
great
beer
surely
worth
a
try
from
a
brewery
that
is
just
gaining
some
presence
in
the
mass
market
pretty
drinkable
good
beer
overall
looking
forward
to
the
other
3
bottles
of
this
scotch
ale
dug
was
kind
enough
to
send
me
the
body
was
medium
full
and
was
on
the
lower
side
of
carbonation
the
huge
amount
of
smokiness
at
the
end
hampered
drinkability
and
the
10oz
snifter
was
a
perfect
size
as
i
think
it
would
start
to
be
a
bit
much
if
i
it
was
served
as
a
full
pint
na
zdravje
forgot
to
mention
that
the
label
artwork
is
priceless
kind
of
like
a
troll
on
acid
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
if
i
ever
cross
paths
again
with
this
beer
ill
rereview
it
seems
like
it
will
be
easier
now
that
dark
horse
is
available
in
ma
drinkability
is
good
i
dont
like
smoke
flavors
in
my
beer
and
havent
really
like
scotch
ales
in
the
past
though
i
have
actually
enjoyed
the
two
bottles
of
this
i
picked
up
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
nose
but
not
in
the
flavor
as
there
is
a
lot
going
on
when
you
sip
would
drink
this
again
but
not
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
from
riverhorse
would
i
buy
more
of
it
oh
hell
yes
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
this
before
its
off
the
shelves
d
a
nice
rich
malty
brew
very
warming
and
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
chilly
night
these
guys
always
come
through
for
me
drink
with
caution
as
the
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
a
definite
sipper
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
to
try
once
if
you
like
scotch
ales
wee
heavys
then
you
will
enjoy
this
brew
otherwise
this
is
not
for
you
if
you
dont
enjoy
the
boozy
flavor
a
pretty
easy
drinker
for
nearly
10
but
the
quality
of
beer
would
keep
me
from
wanting
more
not
my
favorite
scottish
or
scotch
ale
that
would
be
robert
the
bruce
but
this
was
very
good
and
certainly
worth
having
again
d
a
very
good
looking
brew
with
excellent
aroma
we
lose
a
little
bit
when
it
comes
to
flavor
and
mouthfeel
we
lose
a
little
bit
however
this
is
a
solid
brew
all
the
way
around
i
wont
have
any
trouble
working
my
way
through
the
rest
of
the
4pack
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
terms
of
taste
and
heat
but
catches
up
with
you
pretty
quickly
d
i
like
this
beer
its
not
as
smoky
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
very
drinkable
for
9
75
besides
the
initial
warmth
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
this
one
has
balls
and
certainly
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
drinkability
depends
on
ones
tolerance
for
the
heavy
character
and
smoky
attributes
for
me
its
right
up
there
with
founders
as
the
best
of
the
scots
right
here
in
the
states
in
the
end
i
just
did
not
like
how
this
came
together
it
seemed
a
bit
clouded
and
disjointed
and
i
think
the
alcohol
could
be
toned
down
i
tried
this
on
tap
to
and
it
was
not
that
much
better
pours
a
very
very
dark
color
almost
pitch
black
with
a
nice
tight
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
perfectly
head
is
creamy
and
frothy
body
full
aromas
is
musty
like
a
wet
fall
day
almost
taste
has
a
lot
going
on
dried
cherries
twigs
leafs
earthy
brewer
notes
said
hints
of
asparagus
failed
to
pick
that
up
not
sure
id
enjoy
it
in
my
beer
if
i
did
goes
down
smooth
with
a
lingering
taste
like
black
licoricecoffee
cross
a
wonderfully
enjoyable
beer
on
a
cold
winter
night
pours
a
dark
brown
color
almost
like
a
stout
it
has
a
1
finger
head
that
stays
with
the
pour
with
a
beige
clinging
ring
the
smell
is
dark
with
roasted
coffee
toast
nuts
currant
fruits
and
toffeemalts
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
with
some
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
outstanding
its
roasted
coffee
some
chocolate
nuts
and
toffee
i
taste
some
fruit
in
this
one
some
fig
some
nutmeg
and
some
hops
wow
a
lot
going
on
in
this
weeheavy
its
creamy
smooth
with
the
almost
10
abv
its
not
detectable
delicious
its
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
had
it
beats
dirty
bastard
it
beats
robert
the
bruce
this
is
the
one
trybuy
this
one
and
enjoy
it
with
a
robust
dinner
or
around
the
fireplace
d
super
smooth
and
full
bodied
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
not
too
sweet
almost
perfect
for
the
style
this
beer
has
a
good
collection
of
flavors
an
appealing
malty
sweetness
and
a
prominent
smoky
character
the
high
alcohol
level
in
this
beer
is
really
well
hidden
revealed
only
by
a
light
note
in
the
nose
and
a
subtle
warmth
on
the
palate
a
fine
example
of
the
strong
wee
heavy
style
and
if
you
like
smoky
beers
dont
miss
this
one
d
its
a
bit
murky
but
quite
drinkable
regardless
im
glad
more
dark
horse
brews
are
making
it
down
this
way
i
was
taken
by
surprise
by
this
one
i
tend
to
hate
scotch
ales
but
this
beer
might
have
caused
me
to
rethink
my
overall
opinion
of
the
style
its
that
good
might
be
the
best
dark
horse
beer
i
have
had
yet
d
one
of
the
best
dark
horse
brews
i
have
had
yet
this
is
a
great
number
and
deserves
a
try
solid
marks
all
around
d
no
thank
you
d
i
was
almost
shocked
when
i
read
this
one
is
9
a
very
solid
beer
and
will
be
back
for
more
dvery
drinkable
im
generally
a
little
cautious
with
darkhorses
stouts
but
this
was
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
but
still
had
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
the
scotty
karate
was
a
quite
pleasant
surprise
that
i
will
be
sure
to
drink
again
dits
very
smooth
and
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
the
smokiness
makes
it
less
drinkable
for
me
but
all
the
malts
seem
to
follow
the
style
usually
dark
horse
flies
beneath
the
radar
for
me
but
when
one
of
there
beers
is
included
as
an
extra
bring
it
on
color
is
dark
brown
and
slightly
lighter
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
may
have
left
this
one
in
the
freezer
for
a
bit
too
long
as
not
much
head
formed
after
a
hard
pour
the
nose
has
peat
smoke
chocolate
caramel
and
again
some
smoke
taste
has
all
the
aspects
of
a
good
strong
scotch
ale
that
i
like
such
as
the
smells
listed
above
what
i
am
amazed
by
is
how
well
balanced
this
beer
is
sometimes
scotch
ales
can
come
off
a
bit
one
sided
or
dirty
but
everything
works
really
well
here
one
can
also
really
get
the
scotch
aspect
from
a
beer
like
this
the
9
provides
a
very
nice
warming
sensation
to
accompany
all
of
the
complexities
going
on
it
definitely
feels
like
a
full
bodied
beer
while
at
the
same
time
coming
off
very
elegant
and
drinkable
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
i
have
ever
encountered
without
a
doubt
it
would
be
nice
to
have
dark
horse
around
here
cheers
to
mike
for
throwing
in
this
great
extra
d
id
stop
after
one
the
flavor
could
be
a
little
cloying
or
even
downright
undrinkable
to
some
im
sure
im
enjoying
it
for
what
it
is
though
very
scottish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
somewhat
overcarbonated
very
marginal
difference
great
sipper
easy
drinking
for
a
huge
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
scotch
ales
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
though
it
is
a
bit
heavy
all
in
all
a
great
beer
d
slightly
warming
this
beer
is
a
pretty
rich
and
malty
brew
which
is
a
good
thing
its
17
degrees
here
tonight
bottle
serving
d
a
fine
example
of
a
scotch
ale
worth
checking
out
for
anyone
that
agrees
that
it
is
a
style
that
deserves
more
attention
i
really
like
this
it
is
pretty
much
spot
on
for
the
style
a
little
more
smoky
than
most
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
highly
recommended
a
very
good
representation
of
a
scottish
ale
but
with
the
high
abv
makes
it
difficult
to
have
too
many
mouthfeel
is
light
but
filmy
very
carbonated
and
effervescent
fairly
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
would
get
to
me
after
a
while
d
very
high
and
i
wish
i
had
another
sitting
here
to
crack
open
great
offering
from
dark
horse
d
scotty
karate
is
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
i
have
tried
however
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
peat
or
smokiness
that
i
am
used
to
in
scotch
ales
that
aside
the
flavor
profile
was
very
good
and
enjoyable
throughout
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
4
pack
of
this
drinkability
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
and
a
nice
interpretation
of
a
scotch
ale
if
it
were
not
for
the
abv
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
an
evening
i
really
would
like
another
and
would
be
happy
to
do
so
very
drinkable
i
love
the
artwork
its
from
a
guest
artist
out
of
austin
tx
whats
better
to
represent
that
then
a
viking
hat
adorned
fu
manchu
wearing
one
man
band
musician
rocking
out
on
the
drums
guitar
and
banjo
with
foot
pedals
intact
for
effects
pours
a
murky
dark
cola
amber
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
toward
the
light
head
was
quickly
dwindling
highly
carbonated
fizzy
sounding
as
it
settled
kind
of
a
turn
off
at
first
with
minimal
head
left
behind
aroma
has
a
caramel
plum
fruit
and
raisin
infused
booziness
at
first
sniff
with
my
first
sip
in
addition
to
caramel
plum
raisin
and
booze
i
get
an
oak
barrel
or
tree
bark
bitterness
with
evident
smoked
malts
gathering
on
the
palate
together
a
touch
of
whiskey
and
vanilla
this
is
complex
like
some
herbal
tea
with
a
whiskey
chaser
blended
with
birch
syrup
root
beer
if
that
makes
sense
at
all
with
my
next
few
sips
the
smoke
meat
characteristic
even
jumps
into
the
party
im
sure
this
may
be
peated
malt
at
this
point
but
its
really
riding
a
wave
with
carbonation
that
is
sharp
but
not
too
lively
mouthfeel
overall
is
a
bit
cloying
for
me
at
this
point
the
carbonation
is
sharp
but
not
lively
it
kind
of
lands
flat
as
soon
as
the
initial
harshness
passes
the
palate
but
a
smoked
meat
syrup
layer
is
left
behind
with
some
charred
oak
and
minimal
vanilla
that
bring
the
heat
with
it
drinkability
overall
depends
on
what
your
into
me
im
having
carbonation
issues
but
does
that
effect
my
experience
as
a
whole
final
answer
it
has
to
because
it
effects
the
way
that
the
other
flavors
are
sensed
on
the
palate
in
this
case
i
feel
that
smoked
peated
malt
sensation
overstays
its
welcome
yet
makes
the
beer
memorable
in
an
extreme
sort
of
way
booze
ridden
for
sure
but
this
beer
is
going
for
all
of
that
i
applaud
the
effort
it
was
a
fun
experience
but
damn
how
many
of
these
can
or
do
i
want
to
drink
drinkability
is
average
nothing
really
calling
me
to
have
another
but
still
a
good
oneanddone
beer
ok
no
please
excuse
me
while
i
finish
up
this
4pack
d
maybe
my
taste
buds
are
becoming
insensitive
but
this
beer
isnt
overwhelming
to
my
palate
at
all
the
price
is
right
and
it
certainly
has
my
stomach
a
little
warmed
up
one
of
the
better
dark
horse
brews
i
reckon
having
tried
other
scotch
beers
this
gets
my
mark
as
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
genre
try
it
sometime
youll
like
it
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
brown
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
alcohol
toffee
and
hints
of
astringency
it
is
a
very
strong
aroma
with
decent
complexity
the
taste
is
full
of
caramel
more
so
than
the
aroma
some
toffee
minor
astringency
nice
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
good
but
not
great
i
would
drink
it
again
though
without
hesitation
d
i
havent
counted
myself
as
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
at
this
point
its
been
so
long
since
ive
actually
had
one
that
my
tastes
have
shifted
im
not
sure
that
i
can
determine
whether
scotty
karate
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
but
i
did
find
it
tasty
done
of
these
at
a
time
is
probably
enough
but
it
is
very
drinkable
dark
horse
rarely
disappoints
this
brew
is
no
exception
nicely
done
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
murky
amber
color
and
formed
a
small
light
tan
bubbly
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
peat
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
of
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
with
hint
of
anise
the
body
was
medium
consistency
and
the
finish
leanings
towards
bittersweet
the
alcohol
also
peaks
through
here
i
just
wish
i
could
be
at
the
brewpub
whenever
it
is
on
tap
i
always
seem
to
miss
it
i
am
curious
how
this
would
mellow
after
some
aging
time
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
a
decent
beer
but
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
this
is
the
best
scotch
ale
that
i
have
ever
had
d
good
i
might
order
another
though
i
wouldnt
buy
a
four
pack
the
beer
was
hazy
brown
with
a
creamy
head
the
aroma
was
roasty
with
a
styleappropriate
aroma
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
of
roasted
grain
and
it
finished
with
a
surprising
sweetness
there
was
no
hop
bitterness
all
the
bitter
was
created
by
the
great
roasted
malt
profile
for
drinkability
this
was
a
10
abv
and
it
was
very
drinkable
you
didnt
get
a
taste
of
that
alcohol
that
you
know
and
can
smell
is
there
overall
i
love
dark
horse
if
this
was
founders
or
dogfish
or
any
other
company
4
pack
it
would
be
10
but
its
dark
horse
and
they
hold
it
down
they
truely
think
of
the
people
this
beer
to
me
is
one
unique
scottish
ale
ive
had
so
far
arcadias
who
i
think
thats
their
best
beer
founders
dirty
bastard
and
dragonmead
from
warrens
scottish
ale
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
scottish
ale
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
the
alcohol
is
more
apparent
in
the
end
then
the
start
a
good
not
great
beer
worth
having
hard
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
great
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
unless
they
hate
amazing
beer
md
rich
thick
great
drinker
that
doesnt
seem
like
half
the
alcohol
it
does
wow
old
dld
trade
i
found
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
at
all
huge
sweet
malty
smell
with
a
burnt
caramel
quality
the
taste
is
just
wonderful
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
a
huge
cramael
taste
that
sits
briefly
on
the
tongue
and
then
is
gone
with
almost
no
aftertaste
just
slightly
boozey
but
a
fantstic
taste
a
good
one
really
on
tap
at
the
hunt
club
this
is
about
a
year
aged
as
an
old
seasonal
above
average
mouthfeel
from
a
creaminess
with
really
chocolate
coming
through
a
tad
of
roast
but
i
was
not
finding
the
smoke
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
scotch
nevertheless
pleasant
a
dark
brownpurple
beer
with
little
head
scotty
karate
is
murky
and
deep
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
good
malt
caramelization
theres
warm
spicing
and
a
lot
of
malt
the
flavor
is
strong
and
sweet
nice
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
theres
a
nice
alcoholic
estery
character
that
aids
drinkability
but
its
still
a
strong
scotch
ale
and
i
cant
consume
too
much
of
any
scotch
ale
good
beer
sweet
spicy
sipper
12oz
poured
a
deep
reddishbrown
and
a
rigorous
pour
revealed
a
decent
light
tannish
colored
head
with
good
retention
and
left
a
limited
but
sticky
spotty
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aromas
are
a
huge
malty
sweetness
containing
dark
brown
sugar
caramel
and
toffee
tastes
are
very
similar
to
the
aroma
but
more
complex
than
expected
sweet
like
candy
with
notes
of
dark
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
as
the
ale
warms
notes
of
cherry
and
plum
come
through
with
a
somewhat
masked
hint
of
citrus
at
9
75
abv
the
alcohol
is
very
well
concealed
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
rather
syrupy
yet
very
creamy
and
smooth
finishes
very
sweet
as
a
wee
heavy
should
overall
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
definitely
recommendable
for
almost
10
alcohol
this
drinks
amazingly
well
perhaps
i
was
just
craving
a
wee
heavy
today
i
dont
know
but
damn
i
am
nearly
chugging
this
and
i
cant
stop
myself
great
beer
overall
ontap
at
3
squares
in
maple
grove
mn
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
was
dark
brown
with
a
couple
fingers
of
tan
head
i
dont
like
my
scotch
ales
to
dry
or
heavy
but
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
it
was
smooth
a
just
sweet
enough
to
make
for
a
good
afterdinner
beer
the
flavor
was
a
mix
of
sweet
cherries
strawberries
and
date
mixed
with
chocolate
candy
not
very
milky
but
sweet
in
the
background
there
was
just
a
hint
of
earthy
peat
flavor
overall
very
nice
and
drinkable
seek
this
out
if
you
dig
the
style
this
is
damn
well
one
easy
drinking
brew
at
9
75abv
though
it
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
it
will
mess
you
up
bad
on
tap
at
3
squares
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
although
i
do
not
judge
the
head
on
tap
beers
a
nice
caramel
malt
aroma
and
flavor
come
through
for
the
smell
and
the
taste
the
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
nicely
balanced
some
toffee
comes
through
as
well
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
but
watch
the
alcohol
it
sneaks
up
on
you
while
i
drank
this
on
tap
i
had
no
idea
the
abv
was
as
high
as
it
is
overall
a
nice
beer
drinkability
imho
this
was
a
lame
scotch
ale
scotty
karate
proved
to
be
decent
in
every
category
but
never
anything
more
d
too
high
for
the
near
10
i
say
throw
caution
to
to
the
wind
and
drink
a
6er
at
a
time
if
your
lucky
enough
to
get
your
hands
on
em
d
great
i
love
scotch
ales
and
this
one
was
pretty
nice
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
shit
you
dont
know
who
your
fin
with
here
the
booze
is
so
well
hidden
you
could
get
in
much
trouble
with
this
beer
be
careful
its
so
damn
tastey
you
want
to
drink
it
fast
but
it
will
bite
you
in
the
ass
a
rather
nicely
sippable
wee
heavy
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
thanks
again
tyson
drinkability
pretty
high
actually
even
considering
the
higher
abv
definitely
worth
drinking
a
couple
in
a
sitting
just
to
enjoy
the
great
balance
presented
by
the
sweet
malts
and
the
nice
hop
presence
dark
horse
rocks
scotty
karate
rocks
poured
into
pint
glass
nice
dark
color
though
light
tanoffwhite
head
disappears
rather
quickly
sweet
smell
dominated
by
caramel
and
malt
taste
is
very
good
with
sweet
malt
and
dark
chocolate
flavor
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
as
it
is
a
little
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
this
is
however
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
consume
all
night
long
the
second
i
finished
i
wished
i
had
another
fairly
mainstream
for
a
wee
heavy
and
not
really
outstanding
other
than
its
a
bit
boozy
d
i
prefer
robert
the
bruce
as
its
not
as
sweet
d
although
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
i
wouldnt
call
it
boozy
at
all
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
tasted
like
a
solid
beer
a
little
sweet
malt
but
not
overly
sweet
nice
and
smooth
for
almost
10
it
went
down
fast
alcohol
may
prevent
it
but
this
beer
improved
dramatically
every
sip
at
first
i
was
satisfied
but
alittle
dissapointed
by
the
end
i
wanted
more
an
enjoyable
scotch
ale
from
dark
horse
time
for
another
notes
this
beer
is
so
good
its
unfair
to
the
majority
of
scotch
ales
out
there
even
the
well
known
ones
like
dirty
bastard
age
it
for
a
year
or
more
and
it
seems
to
get
better
just
awesome
one
of
my
favorite
beers
very
sweet
with
carmelly
notessmooth
with
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
just
the
right
amount
of
smokiness
forget
the
first
two
scores
i
dont
drink
beer
because
of
the
way
it
looks
or
smells
i
drink
beer
because
of
the
way
it
tastes
scotty
karate
scottish
ale
is
the
real
deal
and
should
be
sought
out
by
anyone
who
loves
a
good
wee
heavy
thanks
to
bakerslp
for
the
bottle
just
not
as
complex
or
not
as
deep
flavor
as
oscar
blues
or
lake
louie
versions
surprising
given
the
high
abv
good
not
great
especially
for
the
4
pack
price
comment
a
lot
of
press
on
this
wee
heavy
still
it
goes
quite
well
with
a
smoked
salmon
sandwich
and
a
cone
of
fries
with
southwest
mayo
d
a
perfect
beer
for
a
camping
trip
sitting
around
the
campfire
very
nice
not
an
everyday
beer
but
good
im
a
bit
embarrassed
that
i
couldnt
id
this
as
a
scotch
ale
but
the
strut
is
more
a
coffee
place
than
a
bar
theyve
got
about
four
beers
on
tap
i
never
figured
theyd
go
for
anything
with
any
kind
of
complexity
or
serious
abv
my
opinion
of
the
place
has
gone
way
up
based
on
realizing
what
this
beer
really
is
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
there
is
a
14
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
slight
ring
there
is
a
good
bit
of
white
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
is
mostly
fresh
bread
and
a
lot
of
malt
the
taste
is
all
malt
with
sour
cherries
and
sweeter
dark
fruits
there
is
a
slight
earthy
peat
flavor
as
well
almost
like
a
forest
floor
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
there
is
a
bite
to
this
beer
its
tangy
but
not
too
sour
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
makes
this
one
easier
to
drink
but
its
still
a
sipper
great
big
scotch
ale
im
very
impressed
an
extremely
deep
red
nearly
black
beer
about
two
fingers
of
brown
sugar
colored
head
disappears
relatively
quick
not
much
lacing
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
edge
taste
is
much
the
same
a
lot
of
flavor
to
this
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
an
alcoholic
warmth
round
out
the
taste
lightmedium
bodied
and
a
definite
drinkability
i
wish
that
i
had
another
one
of
these
right
now
any
fan
of
scotch
ales
should
enjoy
this
beer
taste
quite
a
bit
of
smokiness
to
it
earthy
is
a
good
word
to
describe
this
beer
more
complex
than
most
scotch
ales
ive
had
d
this
is
a
great
tasting
scotch
ale
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
seek
out
again
but
being
so
high
in
alc
you
really
can
only
have
so
many
of
these
drinkability
definitely
high
really
smooth
and
pleasingly
complex
representation
of
the
style
wow
dark
horse
strikes
again
this
is
my
new
fav
dark
and
malty
w
a
breadfruit
nose
tastes
like
bread
without
the
bite
of
the
9
75
alc
not
to
be
underestamated
ive
only
got
2
left
on
the
shelf
and
one
is
going
to
my
basement
for
aging
peace
d
drink
it
slow
and
enjoy
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
small
tight
tan
head
that
hangs
around
until
it
eventually
settles
to
a
thin
cap
malt
really
comes
through
in
the
aroma
has
a
smell
of
dark
bread
toffee
and
hazlenut
thick
malty
taste
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
nuts
sweet
flavor
overall
no
hint
of
the
9
75
abv
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
maltiness
makes
this
a
big
beer
one
of
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
had
and
one
of
the
better
dark
horse
beers
d
really
tasty
sipper
that
goes
down
twice
as
smooth
as
one
would
think
after
reading
this
brews
credentials
this
beer
has
opened
my
eyes
to
the
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
style
looking
forward
to
trying
some
others
good
overall
but
not
great
and
not
as
good
as
the
other
dark
offerings
from
dark
horse
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
dark
red
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
all
malt
and
ethanol
very
sweet
and
caramellike
very
good
for
the
style
the
taste
is
likewise
good
malty
and
sweet
with
an
alcohol
burn
a
thick
and
rich
meal
in
a
glass
can
dark
horse
do
anything
poorly
they
are
an
excellent
brewery
im
pretty
confident
in
each
purchase
from
their
fine
arsenal
pours
a
very
dark
amber
brown
color
with
no
head
from
a
hard
pour
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
nutty
with
loads
of
caramel
and
dark
sugar
flavor
is
loaded
with
caramel
its
sweet
but
not
cloyingly

the

in

definitely

this
is

i
like
it
i
like
it

mouthfeel
is

creamy
medium

full
bodied
if
the
alcohol
truly
is
9

im
impressed
because
i
cant
taste
or
feel
it
at
all
very
nice
brew
i
think
ill
have
another
d
ill
try
again
perhapsonly
qualm
is
the
higher
alcohol
makes
this
more
of
a
sipper
but
its
flavors
dont
necessarily
warrant
that
splendid
mouthfeel
with
the
smooth
malty
texture
carrying
the
day
but
not
without
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
very
delicious

also

a

at

it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
i
liked
it
so
much
that
i
had
a
second
one
and
convinced
another
at
the
table
to
give
it
a
try
dwow
although
not
my
typical
beer
choice
this
scotch
ale
is
pretty
darn
good
deep
flavor
though
perhaps
a
bit
more
onedimensional
than
expected
d
this
was
nice
to
try
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
i
generally
like
dark
horse
but
this
wasnt
one
of
their
best
brews
alltogether
this
was
decent
enough
notes
scotty
karate
may
not
be
the
best
scotch
ale
ever
made
but
its
nothing
to
scoff
at
for
the
price
and
the
taste
theres
no
better
option
in
michigan
i
poured
a
bit
of
the
scotty
karate
into
a
wine
glass
the
beer
is
a

robert
the

i
was
overall
fairly
impressed
for
the
style
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
i
like
robert
the
bruce
a
little
more
but
just
a
little
more
the
9
75
alcohol
is
barely
perceptible
which
can
be
dangerous
in
a
beer
that
is
this
creamy
and
delicious
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
for
such
a
potent
brew
gotta
love
it
poured
a
medium
dark
cloudy
color
taste
was
smoky
full
earthy
and
did
i
mention
smokey
ive
had
a
few
beers
that
are
oversmoked
no
real
way
to
put
it
and
this
beer
could
almost
fall
in
that
category
im
not
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
as
like
hops
if
overdone
it
can
drown
out
all
the
other
flavors
but
it
is
kept
in
check
well
with
this
beer
drinkability
a
few
pleasant
spots
but
the
bitter
lemony
sour
part
ruins
the
beer
for
me
i
had
to
discard
probably
eight
to
nine
ounces
of
the
12
d
very
drinkable
and
i
would
probably
seek
this
one
out
again
which
is
a
big
deal
considering
how
many
good
beers
there
are
left
to
try
for
the
first
time
pours
a
murkydirty
looking
brown
with
grayish
colorings
at
the
edges
almost
no
head
is
created
on
a
pretty
heavy
pourmaybe
the
smallest
head
i
have
yet
to
encounter
the
nose
smells
of
roasted
maltsheavy
wheat
bread
notesraisins
and
smoked
beef
jerky
this
is
a
nice
scottish
ale
with
some
unique
flavors
reminds
me
of
heavily
toasted
raisin
nut
bread
with
some
dry
almost
dusty
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
for
such
a
big
beer
and
helps
offset
the
warming
alcohol
that
bites
at
the
throat
a
little
on
the
finish
this
is
a
solid
wee
heavy
with
lots
of
personality
to
spare
d
its
a
nice
slow
sipper
and
a
great
cold
weather
beer
damn
good
stuff
right
there
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
not
quite
the
best
scotch
ale
that
ive
had
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
ale
smells
of
scotch
and
is
a
bit
spicy
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
and
is
very
sweet
the
big
problem
i
had
with
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
know
i
am
not
the
only
person
who
feels
this
way
so
i
do
not
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
beer
just
tastes
really
flat
to
me
still
this
beer
is
a
nice
sipper
drinkability
was
decent
considering
the
high
abv
i
could
see
myself
drinking
two
of
these
note
i
really
think
this
needs
to
be
available
year
round
whole
lotta
caramel
flavor
in
the
first
sip
with
something
like
a
dark
roast
coffee
with
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
soaking
in
it
chaser
right
on
directly
behind
it
theres
a
lot
of
fat
end
body
in
this
brew
so
it
coats
as
it
goes
down
leaving
a
coffeechocolatecherry
taste
on
the
back
of
your
mouth
and
a
very
warming
sensation
down
the
throat
and
through
the
body
woo
watch
out
though
cuz
a
bit
of
a
peppery
alcohol
bite
snaps
at
you
in
its
finish
the
sweet
and
bitter
balances
are
full
of
all
kinds
of
flavorful
complexities
d
damn
good
i
would
say
the
mixture
of
sweetness
and
smokiness
is
something
i
have
not
encoutered
very
much
in
any
beer
so
any
chance
i
get
to
experience
this
makes
me
happy
abv
on
this
is
hidden
quite
well
and
the
feel
and
body
of
this
beer
make
it
go
down
almost
too
fast
but
i
wish
it
just
looked
a
bit
nicer
to
round
out
the
whole
drinking
experience
d
so
smooth
and
extremely
well
balanced
easy
drinker
id
have
a
couple
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
almost
no
head
very
little
for
a
few
seconds
and
no
lacing
wonderfully
deep
scent
very
malty
very
peaty
and
very
smoky
an
excellent
scotch
ale
aroma
good
taste
nice
and
malty
at
first
good
smoke
and
peat
tones
but
with
an
odd
bitterhop
finish
very
strange
for
a
scotch
ale
it
goes
down
fine
but
a
little
thick
compared
to
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
it
pretty
good
but
its
just
not
all
that
interesting
i
think
im
going
to
age
the
other
two
bottle
i
have
left
from
the
four
pack
good
beer
in
general
but
could
use
more
body
and
less
heat
i
will
keep
my
remaining
bottles
in
the
cellar
for
one
extra
year
d
9
75
is
really
gonna
slow
things
down
a
tasty
sipper
nonetheless
especially
if
you
can
get
past
the
mouthfeel
maybe
the
carbo
was
from
a
bad
bottle
d
amazingly
drinkable
so
smooth
for
9
75
top
notch
in
my
book
d
dark
horse
is
great
at
hiding
any
taste
of
alcohol
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
the
smoothness
would
make
it
easy
to
finish
watch
out
though
this
one
packs
a
punch
the
bottle
i
got
was
from
last
year
the
only
way
id
give
this
one
another
chance
was
if
it
was
very
fresh
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
little
to
no
head
on
the
pour
smell
is
caramelized
malts
and
a
bit
boozy
taste
is
more
of
the
malts
a
good
amount
of
mustiness
and
a
bit
of
alcoholband
aid
showing
up
as
well
medium

good
offering

up

followed
by
a
touch
of
chocolate
then
lots
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
toffee
finishes
with
a
burst
of
citrus
like
oranges
and
pineapple
as
well
as
some
booze
medium
full
in
body
and
low
in
carbonation
chewy
with
a
good
variety
of
maltiness
and
some
fruits
to
balance
it
out
packing
some
good
flavors
but
also
not
skimping
on
the
alcohol
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
if
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
time
to
relax
d
i
love
the
dessert
like
chocolate
and
cream
notes
and
the
mouth
feel
is
outstanding
a
really
well
done
brew
but
i
dont
think
that
i
could
take
more

one

is
wellhidden
the
consistency
and
cloyingly

limits
drinkability
this
is
a
highly
regarded
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
hope
to
revisit
this
one
later
and
will
update
my
review
then
all
in
all
another
good
drinkable
beer
by
dark
horse
as
far
as
a
scottish
ale
goes
the
high
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
but
still
could
be
considered
a
scotch
ale
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
some
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
notes
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
toffee
and
caramel
malt
with
some
quite
sweet
malt
notes
with
some
light
dry
hops
body
is
quite
full
with
some
limited
filtration
and
some
good
carbonation
well
done
overall
but
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
even
more
with
some
peat
smoke
malt
notes
dark
horse
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
here
in
michigan
and
there
is
a
lot
of
strong
competition
this
is
a
very
drinkable
wee
heavy
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
of
which
i
could
drink
a
significant
amount
drinkability
certainly
at
the
top
of
the
wee
heavy
list
in
my
book
adds
some
nice
american
elements
to
the
style
that
make
it
eminently
enjoyable
drinkability
plenty
tasty
i
certainly
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
the
9
75abv
keept
under
control
but
is
not
hidden
which
is
fitting
if
youve
ever
met
scotty
that
said
this
probably
isnt
your
9am
beer
but
today
it
is
mine
suckas
d
damn
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
but
the
alcohol
is
a
beast
i
dont
foresee
myself
getting
this
harsh
mistress
again
very
impressive
the
cleanest
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
run
into
and
dangerously
drinkable
tasted
on
22508
drinkability
good
drinkability
not
warming
smooth
and
unique
another
all
day
pounding
delicious
animal
of
a
beer
as
fine
a
scottish
ale
as
ive
ever
tried
strong
and
steady
on
all
fronts
sweet
and
peaty
with
herbal
hop
character
and
a
complex
malt
meaty
character
the
texture
is
a
bit
less
syrupy
than
big
malty
scottish
ales
but
sweetened
more
and
makes
it
more
drinkable
a
little
cleaner
in
the
flavor
than
most
and
less
dirty
or
smoky
the
9
alcohol
is
hardly
noticed
hidden
well
a
stern
copper
ruby
hue
with
fair
coabonation
head
retention
spicy
and
sweet
throughout
deserving
of
better
scores
than
most
bas
have
given
overall
a
pretty
damn
good
pow
beer
except
for
the
initial
quick
flash
of
a
weird
flavor
itsa

i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
after
my
first
bottle
i
am
kind
of
hoping
it
went
bad
somewhere
down
the
line
overall
the
most
intense
scotch
ale
ive
had
good
but
only
if
youre
in
the
mood
di
wish
this
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
i
dont
mind
it
on
the
lower
side
but
this
is
pretty
flat
tasty
but
not
memorable
good
but
not
great
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
am
not
making
plans
to
seek
out
more
of
this
the
bottom
line
dark
horse
has
some
hits
and
some
misses
with
me
and
this
is
one
of
the
misses
the
beer
is
passable
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
local
options
that
i
favour
that
are
in
the
same
price
range
i
e
dirty
bastard
arcadia
scotch
ale
and
have
more
of
what
im
looking
for
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
a
ruddy
brown
with
an
orange
haze
to
it
a
thinner
off
white
head
atop
earth
and
smoke
show
thru
most
in
the
nose
along
with
some
buttery
caramela
good
mix
of
earthiness
and
peat
and
sweet
caramel
and
fruit
pretty
nicely
rounded
a
good
stab
at
a
wee
heavy
decent
complexities
but
it
wont
blow
you
mind
d
dont
know
when
this
was
retired
but
it
did
lack
a
little
in
appearance
i
guess
i
expected
a
little
more
overall
too
and
girls
d
pretty
good
lacks
some
depth
of
flavor
but
a
good
beer
d
thumbs
down
dont
buy
this
it
may
have
been
good
at
one
point
but
its
hard
to
tell
now
it
is
served
in
a
snifter
and
pours
a
deep
chocolate
hue
with
slight
ruby
highlights
and
a
minimal
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
a
combination
of
sweet
malt

the

this
is
closer
to
a

was
impressed
at
first
this
beer
is
quite
good
due
to
the
sweet
flavor
present
this
might
almost
qualify
as
a
dessert
beer
o
this
is
now
my
new
favorite
beer
a
90
minute
that
is
way
heavy
but
smooth
i
like
this
but
its
not
my
favorite
too
strong
to
session
but
too
simple
flat
to
really
savor
i
think
its
just
too
clean
for
me
still
its
a
great
execution
of
its
style
and
it
does
have
its
place
quite
a
beer
ill
have
another
3
965
its
a
dessert
beer
you
can
chug
how
can
you
not
love
that
wait
dont
answer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
ale
very
much
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
on
tap
and
may
try
my
hand
at
brewing
one
using
a
kit
glad
that
i
tried
this
style
the
name
really
doesnt
make
sense
from
an
american
point
of
view
less
than
a
fingers
worth
of
fairly
textbook
khaki
colored
audibly
fizzy
froth
that
quickly
recedes
the
lacing
that
is
left
is
slightly
splotchy
and
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
seen
bursting
through
the
surface
the
color
is
a
warm
inviting
caramel
brown
some
carbonation
bubbles
cling
to
the
glass
the
remainder
powers
through
at
a
rapid
pace
the
nose
is
rather
subdued
but
all
the
usual
suspects
are
present
caramel
toffee
peat
toasted
malts
light
brown
sugar
on
the
palate
the
peat
is
dialed
up
in
intensity
and
much
of
the
expected
malty
goodness
is
buried
deep
in
the
background
there
is
a
very
subtle
booziness
which
lingers
on
the
finish
there
is
a
greater
than
expected
hop
bite
even
though
it
is
still
relatively
minor
medium
bodied
sturdy
limited
carbonation
a
bit
chalky
throughout
some
syrupy
characteristics
as
well
overall
this
one
is
a
rather
pedestrian
scotch
ale
as
a
lover
of
the
style
i
cant
help
but
be
a
bit
let
down
by
this
offering
which
has
proved
somewhat
elusive
for
me
overall
a
great
benchmark
easy
drinking
wee
heavy
that
doesnt
go
for
the
throat
could
drink
lots
of
this
the
best
weeheavy
i
have
had
the
clear
bottle
had
me
a
bit
nervous
so
i
took
one
from
the
wayback
of
the
shelf
poured
a
deep
brown
with
some
coppery
red
hints
tall
dissipating
head
of
khaki
the
aroma
was
certainly
of
butterscotch
and
caramel
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
to
describe
the
flavor
was
a
direct
hit
from
the
aroma
really
what
you
smelled
was
what
you
tasted
really
smooth
butterscotch
and
caramel
maltiness
balanced
by
a
good
bubbly
carbonation
and
hops
so
subtle
i
cant
describe
a
profile
but
enough
to
cut
the
sweetness
and
make
it
a
very
enjoyable
brew
no
real
alcohol
on
the
finish
even
at
the
early
cold
sips
solid
offering
will
definitely
put
this
in
the
stable
for
when
in
the
mood
for
malty
brews
o
exceptional
a
great
testament
to
the
style
its
not
a
complex
drink
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
does
all
it
needs
to
do
and
does
it
well
it
maintains
that
sweet
but
light
sharpness
without
becoming
watery
overcarbonated
or
too
syrupy
sweet
its
an
easy
style
to
mess
up
but
belhaven
have
come
through
on
this
one
easily
drinkability
to
boot
overall
a
nice
offering
by
belhaven
one
i
like
as
much
as
their
regular
scottish
ale
nose
of
caramels
and
brown
sugar
with
bits
of
toffee
and
butterscotch
supported
by
moderately
toasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
abv
taste
is
rich
caramels
on
a
foundation
of
toasted
malts
that
lasts
through
the
finish
body
is
a
tad
on
the
light
side
for
a
wee
heavy
beer
is
a
solid
classic
presentation
of
the
style
i
tried
this
again
recently
after
not
having
it
for
quite
a
few
years
and
it
just
didnt
seem
to
have
the
same
wow
affect
that
it
did
then
still
a
good
beer
but
it
seemed
to
be
malt
heavy
this
time
hopefully
it
was
just
this
particular
brew
still
a
pleasure
though
chewy
creamy
medium
low
soft
carbonation
a
fine
example
of
a
good
wee
heavy
certainly
in
the
upper
tier
of
the
style
excellent
overall
very
pleased
with
this
purchse
high
recomendation
exceptionally
well
made
for
the
style
rated
highly
and
deservedly
so
absolute
must
try
as
the
name
suggests
this
beer
is
a
wee
bit
heavy
it
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
a
great
sip
of
beer
regardless
it
pours
a
deep
colour
and
smells
lovely
the
hops
are
very
slight
which
dont
over
power
the
ale
it
leaves
the
drinker
with
a
tinge
of
almond
aftertaste
the
beer
is
also
surprisingly
sweet
which
is
slightly
surprising
given
its
initial
heavy
belt
o
this
is
an
absolutely
stellar

say
this

i
was
looking

it
as
it

a
fair
brew

i
strongly
suspect
a

would
result
in

is

the

of
this

i
have
only

it
once
and
ticked
it
at

wanted
to
give

a

great

you

this
is
a
really
good
one
tasty
without
to
much
bitter
follow
up
the
only
ding
i
can
give
it
is
that
it
is
only

seems

head

not
last
long
at
all
and
there
is
no
lacing
on
the
glass
to
speak
of
the
taste
though
is
outstanding
a
rich
dense
fruitiness
like
dates
with
an
alcoholic
bite
only
a
bare
hint
of
being

definitely
a

excellent

of
the
style
recommended
o

with
some

well

i
get
this
on
tap
regularly
at
a
local
pub
here
in
chicago
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
find
a
brewery
that
consistently
puts
out
products
that
i
love
and
belhaven
is
that
brewery
i
recommend
their
brews
to
everyone
i
have
conversation
to
about
beer
and
they
deserve
the
attention
overall
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
bitterness
is
present
in
a
light
style
but
his
strength
comes
from
malt
to
repeat
oso
far
in
my
new
adventures
into
the
world
of
beers
this
is
my
favorite
i
wont
give
it
a
perfect
score
because
i
hope
to
find
beers
that
will
continue
to
amaze
me
however
this
beer
has
it
all
the
sexy
red
color
sweet
smell
complex
taste
and
moderate
body
make
this
beer
the
best
combination
i
have

beer
drinkers
of
all
backgrounds
can
appreciate
this
gem
i
know
i
will
be
appreciating
more
of
it
in
the
future

this
is
a

you
want

relatively
low
i
have
to
give
this
one
high
marks
overall
a
must
try
theres
almost
no
hops
here
and
only
the
faintest
touch
of
bitterness
in
its
finish
mediumtoheavy
body
with
a
nearly
syruplike
quality
the
beer
is
deceptively
light
clocking
in
at
a
mere
6
5
when
i
would
have
readily
accepted
something
a
few
percentages
higher
but
its
genuinely
delicious
a
pleasing
beer
that
doesnt
try
to
do
anything
extraordinary
or
gimmicky
and
rises
as
one
of
the
greats
because
of
it
do
not
relegate
it
to
something
second
tier
or
boring
this
must
be
experienced
pours
a
clear
super
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head

settles

foamy
streaks

down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
grain
and
caramel
covered
fruit
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
roasty
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
quite
mild
o
my
first
wee
heavy
and
what
a
surprise
its
more
akin
to
a
belgian
dark
ale
than
anything
ive
ever
had
in
england
tastes
to
me
exactly
like
leffe
brune
with
a
bit
of
porter
smokiness
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
great
head
thich
and
creamy
with
a
tan
color
beer
was
red
amber
in
color
and
clear
aroma
was
light
sweet
and
malty
taste
had
caramel
notes
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
cream
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
clean
aftertaste
was
malty
to
start
with
a
hop
finish
i
have
not
had
a
beer
from
the
uk
in
a
while
am
reminded
why
i
was
great
fan
when
i
first
got
into
the
beer
scene
30
years
ago
as
the
name
implies
it
is
a
bit
heavy
but
not
thick
and
dark
like
the
stouts
but
more
like
a
dark
newcastle
a
lame
comparison
indeed
as
i
abhor
newcastle
but
one
i
think
conveys
the
description
adequately
to
the
masses
i
suppose
it
may
be
difficult
to
ascertain
my
response
to
this
brew
with
my
descriptions
of
skunk
etc
but
i
absolutely
love
the
beer
at
6
5
its
a
nice
area
of
power
and
still
gives
a
hearty
beer
flavor
that
is
appreciable
and
defined
its
not
too
fruity
like
a
lot
of
the
stronger
ones
ive
been
drinking
recently
and
its
not
too
heavy
or
dark
and
bitter
i
place
this
one
high
on
my
list
of
favorites
as
its
not
overly
rich
the
feeling
of
the
beer
in
my
mouth
is
satisfying
and
full
and
while
not
extraordinary
in
looks
head
color
etc
it
is
just
a
perfect
humble
brew
defeinitely
a
brew
you
should
experience
may
be
a
straight
5
across
the
board
in
my
opinion
but
i
dont
want
to
abuse
the
ratings
and
unlike
many
of
my
higher
rated
brews
this
one
is
one
i
can
drink
over
and
over
and
over
enjoyable
if
not
sweet
but
thats
normal
for
this
style
this
was
love
at
first
sight
i
loved
the
appearance
with
its
amber
caramel
look
was
taken
back
a
bit
by
a
clear
bottle
it
poured
as
well
as
any
beer
i
have
ever
seen
and
left
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
the
taste
was
a
caramel
buttery
flavor
with
a
nice
aftertaste
that
let
me
know
it
was
an
ale
it
is
stock
in
my
refrigerator
i
treat
myself
to
at
least
one
a
week
after
all
it
is
a
bit
wee
heavy
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
a
small
but
fluffy
tan
head
smells
of
spicy
hops
caramel
brown
sugar
and
ripe
fruit
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
caramel
malts
a
woody
earthy
flavor
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
is
present
really
nice
zesty
hops
but
not
overpowering
nice
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
carbonation
is
about
right
pleasant
ive
only
been
able
to
locate
a
few
authentic
wee
heavies
but
im
really
liking
this
style
and
this
is
the
best
one
so
far
ono
problems
with
this
one
well
done
and
easy
to
drink
overall
while
the
backend
of
the
flavor
notes
resembles
a
scotch
ale
the
rest
is
just
not
there
i
am
reserving
my
full
opinion
because
the
possibility
of
a
sounded
beer
is
here
overall
very
good
beer
something
slightly
different
than
the
norm
not
every
day
you
get
to
have
wee
heavys
and
this
one
just
hit
the
nail
in
the
coffin
salud
overall
it
is
a
good
not
perfect
but
easily
approachable
scotch
ale
much
less
brash
and
much
more
traditional
than
many
american
interpretations
which
causes
me
to
prefer
this
over
overly
boozyhigher

nothing

o
probably
a

not
that
ive
had
too
many
but
it
feels
excellent
to
me
pity
about
the
clear
bottle
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
than
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
an
ale
from
my
scottish
heritage
and
belhaven
has
never
disappointed
the
color
would
lead
you
to
hink
that
it
would
be
much
heavier
than
it
actually
is
i
hadnt
tried
belhavens
ales
before
saw
this
ale
and
had
to
try
it
as
i
have
scottish
heritage
and
have
had
other
scottish
spirits
before
and
the
scots
really
know
how
to
make
their
spirits
i
was
truly
impressed
with
this
ale
it
was
smooth
and
has
a
great
aroma
and
taste
truly
a
great
ale
will
definately
imbibe
in
it
againas
well
as
try
their
other
ales
unexpected
surprise
finding
this
at
the
package
store
on
the
base
im
stationed
at
here
in
germany
beautiful
mahogany
pour
with
two
finger
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
has
an
initial
subtle
skunkiness
that
dies
off
quickly
and
yields
to
a
wonderful
toasty
and
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
dark
fruit
and
maple
syrup
the
taste
follows
suit
with
earthy
and
nutty
yet
slightly
sweet
hints
of
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
maple
and
just
a
wee
bit
of
peat
pardon
the
pun
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
but
extremely
smooth
and
everything
about
this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
havent
had
much
exposure
to
the
style
but
this
is
one
damn
fine
beer
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
how
flavorful
it
was
after
the
nose
which
was
relatively
mild
and
adjuncty
the
flavoring
came
forward
with
boldness
the
first
sips
are
sweet
intensely
drying
and
malty
with
time
however
what
develops
is
a
deeply
complex
flavoring
which
ultimately
encompasses
the
spirit
of
the
style
expertly
everything
else
seems
to
fall
into
place
and
this
beer
keeps
you
wanting
more
with
every
sip
a
very
elegant
beer
rich
in
flavor
feel
and
even
aroma
once
you
get
past
the
initial
skunkiness
excellent
beer
everything
i
expect
from
the
boys
at
belhaven
o
it
all
adds
upwith
this
brew
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
will
be
one
that
i
add
to
my
inventory
since
it
will
fit
many
different
occasions
this
beer
poured
copper
with
a
fluffy
twofinger
tan
head
the
smell
is
some
sweet
bready
malt
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
dark
fruit
that
gives
way
to
toffee
and
caramel
and
then
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
end
to
provide
a
very
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
average
carbonation
a
great
example
of
a
great
style
o
the
smell
is
offputting
but
the
taste
is
lovely
and
it
looks
phenomenal
this
is
an
outstanding
beverage
if
warm
rich
and
inviting
malt
flavors
are
what
youre
looking
for
this
should
be
somewhere
on
the
top
of
your
list
definitely
worth
getting
again
o
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
was
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
liking
i
like
scottish
ales
and
this
one
was
good
just
a
little
to
sweet

for
a

500ml

from

lots
of

character
up

just
a
touch
of
nutty
and
wood
slight
hint

hop
bitterness
towards
end
full
bodied
yet
very
soft
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
was
decent
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
just
a
bit
too
sweet
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
clear
bottle
im
not
sure
why
they
do
this
this
pours
a
reddish
dark
brown
with
a
large
off
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
of
latex
some
caramel
malts
and
toffee
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
okay
plenty
of
caramel
along
with
a
tad
bit
of
skunk
not
bad
though
been
meaning
to
try
some
o
belhavens
stuff
so
i
figured
this
night
at
the
firkin
would
be
as
good
a
night
as
any
to
do
just
that
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
sunset
tawn
topped
by
a
shortish
finger
of
dark
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
caramel
light
walnut
dank
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
maple
syrup
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
of
colaesque
sweetness
thrown
in
for
good
measure
still
things
keep
their
scottish
identities
if
you
catch
my
drift
particularly
with
a
light
vague
woodiness
pervading
the
background
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
nice
nitrogenation
and
a
subsequently
silky
feel
overall
a
very
solid
wee
heavy
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
several
of
at
some
random
pub
on
the
outskirts
of
edinburgh
or
any
other
scottish
town
really
its
probably
a
better
session
beer
than
other
wee
heavies
because
of
the
lower
abv
and
the
smooth
watery
mouthfeel
but
if
im
having
just
one
id
pick
a
different
beer
from
this
style
this
beer
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
brewer
friend
of
mine
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
the
smell
from
the
bottle
was
a
bit
skunky
but
that
left
once
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
as
with
most
english
and
scottish
ales
there
was
a
nice
roasted
barley
and
hoppy
flavor
yet
still
smooth
and
very
nice
i
noted
a
hint
of
scotch
as
an
after
taste
that
was
also
very
pleasing
great
beer
transluscent
cola
brown
with
a
viscous
head
that
lingers
lingers
lingers
and
it
lingers
lacing
plastered
to
the
glass
leaving
trails
of
sips
gone
by
in
the
nose
is
the
epitome
of
a
wee
heavy
roasted
caramel
toffee
malt
bomb
really
sweet
up
front
all
caramel
here
that
chills
on
the
tongue
even
through
to
the
afteraftertaste
smooth
brew
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
keeps
the
prickle
up
front
and
in
back
overall
solid
wee
heavy
in
the
classic
form
its
not
as
extreme
as
some
americanized
versions
but
it
hits
the
spot
a
sweet
quaff
but
surprisingly
balanced
and
nuanced
pours
dark
brown
amber
highlights
w
light
beige
head
head
stuck
around
till
the
end
smell
is
all
malt
w
some
caramel
chocolate
and
no
hops
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
not
fake
or
over
sweet
malt
ends
semi
sweet
kinda
tastes
like
a
stronger
sweeter
english
brown
a
great
wee
heavy
but
lacks
the
dried
fruit
that
i
prefer
i
wouldnt
have
any
problems
recommending
it
to
any
malt
lover
try
it
with
some
pepperjack
cheese
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
an
enjoyable
after
dinner
beer
to
have
with
cookies
and
chocolate
for
dessert
one
minor
gripe
is
the
clear
bottle
on
the
import
version
why
not
use
a
brown
bottle
and
avoid
even
the
possibility
of
off
flavors
due
to
handling
when
it
crosses
the
pond
notes
an
amazing
beer
this
is
a
heavy
wee
heavy
beer
that
is
an
evening
sipper
and
a
coolish
evening
at
that
i
am
actually
surprised
that
the
abv
is
only
6
5
because
i
almost
expected
a
beer
this
flavorful
and
rich
to
be
loaded
with
alcohol
this
could
be
a
nice
sunday
evening
beer
in
the
cooler
months
drinkability
very
drinkable
scotch
ale
overall
its
a
good
not
perfect
but
an
easily
approachable
scotch
ale
which
hit
the
spot
after
some
rather
atrocious
embarrassing
examples
like
the
wet
willy
and
bridgeport
highland
ambush
id
had
recently
d
a
nice
beer
not
too
overbearing
or
too
high
in
abv
o
this
is
indeed
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
a
tasty
ale
the
sweetness
makes
it
nice
as
a
dessert
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
easily
drinkable
at
any
time
do
yourself
a
favour
and
grab
yourself
a
bottle
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
the
head
is
creamy
and
thick
at
first
the
head
settles
and
leaves
a
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
some
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
to
it
the
taste
is
full
of
caramel
notes
and
some
grainy
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
isnt
complex
but
it
still
remains
interesting
overall
its
not
my
favorite
wee
heavy
but
i
did
find
it
to
be
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
though
very
nice
one
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
the
sweetness
resembles
a
fortified
wine
but
with
a
distinct
grainy
character
complex
yet
subtle
well
worth
sampling
at
your
leisure
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
overall
quite
good
lighter
than
other
beers
of
this
same
style
very
enjoyable
definitely
will
be
buying
this
one
again
if
you
havent
had
an
example
of
the
wee
heavy
style
this
is
the
place
to
start
medium
to
heavy
bodied
creamily
textured
stays
for
a
bit
on
the
tongue
and
prolongs
the
experience

luckily

mouthfeelbody
is

its
a

and
its

carbonated
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
i
think
its
an
ok
brew
but
for
the
style
there
are
plenty
of
other
beers
id
choose
before
this
one
ive
liked
the
belhaven
brews
ive
tried
in
the
past
but
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
i
still
think
its
worth
a
try
its
not
bad
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
stayed
until
the
whole
beer
was
gone
thats
a
great
feat
being
as
i
was
sipping
and
took
a
long
time
to
finish
it
felt
like
a
medium
bodied
beer
in
my
mouth
but
after
finishing
the
bottle
i
was
quite
full
and
not
ready
for
another
i
was
expecting
a
heavy
beer
and
it
didnt
give
my
the
full
mouthfeel
i
was
looking
for
but
in
the
end
i
was
more
than
satisfied
od
easy
to
put
down
i
lyke
wow
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
scotch
ale
very
rich
with
plenty
of
body
and
malt
character
o
okay
but
i
prefer
a
lot
of
the
american
interpretations
of
the
style
more
overall
this
beer
is
a
new
favorite
easily
enjoyed
poured
or
from
the
bottle
o
a
good

at

get
a

on

is

a

on

a
very
nice

in

but
i
suspect
its
a
much
different
beast
on
a

would
love
to
try
it
overall
a
damn
good
brew
however
the
aroma
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
from

too
faint
otherwise
one
of
the
best
weeheavies
ive
come
across
a
malt

to
be
sipped
overall
a
very
likable
beer
good
for
sipping
after
dinner
look
elsewhere
if
you
are
a
hop
head
o
for
a
clear
bottle
im
very
impressed
flavors
are
on
point
o
im
not
wellversed
in
wee
heavys
but
this
is
one
great
beer
i
am
very
happy
to
have
found
this
and
picked
it

im
hesitant
to
say
that
this
drinkable
in
quantity
a
wee
bit
too
much
of
something
overall
a
beer
id
try
again
thumbs
up
my
favorite
wee
heavy
yet
complex
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
very
easy
drinker
this
is
a
lot
better
than
expected
i
feel
like
i
havent
really
had
a
decent
example
of
a
scotch
ale
now
other
than
this
and
old
chub
could
drink
this
all
night
if
it
werent
for
the
alcohol
content
this
was
my
first
samlping
of
a
wee
heavy
and
second
scottish
ale
this
beer
was
wonderfully
flavored
and
an
easy
drinker
as
well
it
was
very
comforting
in
the
mouth
and
had
a
nice
brownish
red
appearance
with
small
1
finger
head
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
and
i
did
notice
some
skunky
scent
but
luckily
the
skunkiness
was
not
present
in
the
flavor
thank
goodness
for
lovers
of
authentic
british
isle
beers
this
is
a
fine
example
of
what
to
expect
stopping
for
a
brew
in
a
small
countryside
pub
on
the
moors
at
least
what
i
recall
from
my
uk
visit
last
year
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
wish
i
could
sample
one
from
tap
or
without
the
skunky
smell
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
its
neither
filling
nor
sticky
despite
all
of
the
maltiness
and
sweetness
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
o
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
a
good
stand
alone
beverage
for
the
end
of
an
evening
i
hate
to
pan
this
beer
but
they
make
it
too
easy
ive
had
much
better
d
considering
the
lower
abv
ive
had
better
but
this
is
not
the
worst
by
a
long
shot
worth
a
try
drinkability
really
a
tasty
drink
with
a
comforting
feel
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
very
drinkable
beer
no
room
for
improvement
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
more
than
the
one
pint
very
solid
beer
overall
flavor
wise
its
alot
more
of
the
same
but
there
is
a
note
of
dark
fruit
that
is
not
prevalent
on
the
nose
the
butterscotch
takes
control
of
most
of
the
flavor
but
its
not
overpowering
it
has
very
low
carbonation
and
is
extremely
smooth
on
the
medium
bodied
side
and
easy
to
down
d
very
very
drinkable
as
in
dangerously
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
will
likely
moderate
the
overall
quantity
abv
imperceptible
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
random
beer
picks
that
i
have
made
the
flavors
are
complex
and
have
a
deep
malty
character
that
is
rounded
out
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
this
is
my
first
belhaven
beer
and
no
where
near
my
last
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
the
scotch
ale
drinkers
out
there
drinkability
very
drinkable
at
3
99
a
pint
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
a
few
more
wee
heavy
is
not
a
session
beer
but
i
could
definitely
put
down
more
than
one
i
am
not
going
to
indulge
in
it
but
it
is
definitely
high
quality
for
the
area
d
very
drinkable
only
the
carbonation
holds
this
one
up
slightly
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
dark
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
seemed
to
fade
fairly
quickly
on
me
smells
rich
dessert
like
sweetness
full
of
malts
with
definite
molasses
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
amazing
sweet
malty
touch
of
smoked
ham
minor
hop
presence
that
makes
its
way
through
along
with
some
fruit
accents
as
well
plumsraisinsdates
mingle
nicely
with
the
sweet
malty
backbone
of
this
beer
alcohol
is
mildly
noticeable
both
in
aroma
and
taste
while
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
perfect
carbonation
a
rich
creamy
and
sweet
beer
that
brings
about
the
characteristics
of
a
wee
heavy
very
nicely
d
i
could
probably
have
23
imp
pints
of
this
belhaven
wee
heavy
has
a
really
red
colour
and
excellent
1cm
head
it
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
yeast
quite
nice
the
initial
taste
is
of
honey
with
some
pine
hops
toward
the
end
and
some
slight
bitterness
it
feels
quite
watery
with
some
of
foaminess
its
good
but
not
great
i
dont
love
it
no
doubt
one
of
the
finest
brews
on
the
planet
in
my
opinion
if
you
find
a
wee
heavy
stock
up
and
share
500
ml
bottle
pours
dark
red
hue
with
a
large
foamy
long
lasting
head
aroma
is
of
fruit
and
juicy
malt
medium
sweet
smooth
body
flavor
are
of
cherry
alcohol
and
juicy
malt
short
lasting
sweet
finish
good
drinkable
dessert
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
warming
this
is
quite
a
sweet
beer
with
little
hops
to
balance
it
in
the
right
situation
this
is
a
very
soothing
drink
if
youve
had
a
few
before
this
or
have
low
sweetnesstolerance
this
might
seem
cloying
notes
love
this
beer
ive
had
it
once
before
about
3
years
ago
and
hadnt
seen
it
since
just
recently
my
local
market
place
started
carrying
it
i
will
buy
more
of
this
stuff
for
sure
poured
from
a
clear
why
did
they
change
from
brown
500ml
bottle
into
my
chimay
goblet
got
about
2
fingers
of
offwhite
head
and
a
nice
dark
brownruby
color
there
are
some
seriously
agitated
bubbles
in
the
glass
as
well
smells
insanely
brown
sugary
light
germanish
hop
smell
perhaps
a
bit
of
light
affectation
and
just
a
massive
wallop
of
caramel
tastes
rich
caramelized
sweet
every
so
lightly
bitter
and
tart
just
a
mass
of
rich
dessert
beer
flavors
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
warmth
but
a
little
bit
of
overpowering
alcohol
given
its
under
7
percent
drinkability
is
good
only
hurt
by
maltiness
and
alcohol
this
brew
pours
a
deep
garnet
with
a
creamy
biege
head
the
head
is
slow
to
fade
and
sticks
firmly
to
the
glass
nutty
dark
malts
and
has
hints
of
earthy
wood
tones
the
taste
is
of
dark
fruit
like
raisins
and
prune
the
other
flavors
present
are
brown
sugar
some
spicynes
that
is
overtaken
from
a
large
smokey
after
taste
overall
a
good
beer
medium
bodied
brew
overall
pretty
solid
scotch
ale
a
bit
pricey
though
drinkability
rocksolid
scotch
ale
perhaps
even
a
textbook
case
rich
and
malty
not
cloying
however
i
guess
im
not
finding
the
depth
of
flavor
that
i
was
looking
for
certainly
a
musttry
for
the
style
all
4s
this
brew
is
very
delicious
and
quite
quaffable
di
could
drink
a
couple
of
pints
will
by
agian
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
its
just
plain
good
a
beautiful
beer
for
drinking
on
a
chilly
fall
day
bottom
line
this
is
a
great
beer
the
only
problem
with
it
is
that
it
is
too
expensive
to
drink
all
the
time
but
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
d
all
in
all
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
could
enjoy
another
of
these
right
now
positive
recomendation
d
excellent
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
although
not
my
favorite
wee
heavy
it
was
easy
to
sip
my
way
through
it
i
regretted
seeing
the
end
of
the
beer
and
id
certainly
be
happy
to
have
it
again
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
is
a
maltfest
with
a
lot
of
complexity
from
very
simple
elements
i
was
surprised
at
the
relatively
low
alcohol
level
but
this
beer
is
filling
and
satisfying
it
is
great
for
sipping
as
a
nightcap
pours
a
beautifully
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
whit
head
smell
is
nothing
too
spectacular
not
getting
too
much
of
anything
maybe
the
beer
is
still
too
cold
only
thing
im
picking
up
is
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
but
nothing
more
than
id
expect
from
an
amber
ale
or
something
taste
is
way
better
than
it
smells
full
of
flavor
with
some
great
sugary
dark
fruit
flavors
a
little
bit
of
hops
but
nothing
bittering
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
pleasant
with
a
nice
amount
of
syrupy
thickness
but
not
too
much
this
beer
is
not
very
high
abv
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
drinkability
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
for
a
6
5
beer
a
little
pricey
but
quite
a
good
wee
heavy
d
the
sweetness
is
nice
but
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
too
much
after
a
while
decent
beer
but
i
would
be
good
with
just
one
beer
is
malty
big
bodied
a
little
sulfur
it
has
a
bitterness
to
the
whole
thing
its
ok
drink
is
fine
no
carb
in
mouth
i
think
i
want
to
find
this
on
cask
i
could
probably
session
a
couple
of
these
500ml
bottles
good
drinkability
notes
from
october
2009
when
i
took
my
first
drink
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
disappointed
i
really
wanted
this
to
be
more
there
was
a
nice
roasted
malt
that
produced
a
bourbon
taste
but
it
just
did
not
stand
up
to
my
five
guys
burger
the
burger
completely
overpowered
the
beer
the
taste
was
good
just
a
bit
light
for
a
beer
named
wee
heavy
drinkability
is
excellent
full
flavored
yet
easy
to
drink
top
notch
wee
heavy
jd
d
just
got
too
sweet
its
a
good
beer
enjoyed
it
but
was
fine
with
one
50cl
bottle
served
in
my
dt
tulip
poured
a
hazy
garnet
with
a
loose
frothy
offwhite
1
5
inch
cap
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
broken
slick
that
gathers
around
the
edges
some
swaths
and
spots
of
lacing
exposed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
somewhat
muted
some
malt
grapes
and
currants
and
something
of
a
skunky
quality
taste
follows
nose
malty
quality
comes
out
a
bit
earthy
in
the
flavor
profile
grapes
and
currants
carry
over
but
not
expressed
as
sweet
there
is
also
a
slightly
herbalmedicinal
quality
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
falls
just
shy
of
medium
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
its
a
decent
brew
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
drink
its
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
but
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
md
the
mouthfeel
might
be
the
best
part
of
the
beer
creamy
and
medium
bodied
but
also
quenching
not
too
heavy
for
a
scotch
ale
but
enjoyable
d
a
nice
beer
thats
got
a
little
of
lots
of
things
this
one
ill
have
again
a
very
good
and
complex
brew
something
too
enjoy
extendedly
and
with
a
ripe
cheese
a
very
good
scotch
ale
from
the
500
ml
bottle
with
a
lot
code
of
l9201a
sampled
on
march
29
2010
it
pours
a
handsome
dark
amber
with
a
couple
inches
of
frothy
creamy
beige
head
and
a
substantial
amount
of
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
the
head
diminishes
some
but
remains
pretty
durable
throughout
caramel
malts
sweetness
and
modest
hops
flutter
across
the
aromas
spectrum
with
a
pleasing
and
enticing
balance
the
taste
begins
with
an
unobtrusive
bitterness
reminding
me
at
the
end
that
there
is
an
undertone
of
sweet
malts
and
subtle
hops
still
beckoning
the
palate
this
is
the
pasteurized
bottled
one
and
i
liked
it
i
cant
help
but
to
wonder
what
it
might
taste
in
a
pint
glass
fresh
from
the
barrel
at
the
belhaven
brewery
this
is
a
big
beer
as
expected
but
wonderfully
wellbuilt
exceptionally
balanced
and
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
after
a
nice
meal
or
three
in
place
of
one
edit
just
read
that
the
wee
heavy
we
get
here
in
sweden
in
stores
is
a
pasteurised
one
thats
really
complete
bullshit
explains
why
the
beer
felt
dead
and
soulless
i
guess
maybe
i
should
have
gotten
worried
when
i
saw
that
it
was
in
355
ml
clear
bottles
just
like
that
appaling
innis
gunn
but
now
i
know
value
not
sure
it
was
a
gift
id
go
3
99
per
bottle
though
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
overall
this
was
much
more
than
a
malt
bomb
which
was
what
i
expected
im
glad
i
got
to
find
out
for
myself
i
liked
the
all
around
creaminess
and
fruity
sweetness
in
this
one
and
the
presence
of
some
hops
drinkability
this
beer
is
exceedingly
drinkable
to
me
it
is
smooth
richly
flavored
but
with
restraint
and
provides
a
very
pleasing
overall
drinking
experience
ddefinately
a
sipper
this
beer
has
a
huge
malt
bill
that
may
be
hard
to
put
away
bottle
after
bottle
throughout
the
night
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
can
certanly
be
enjoyed
for
its
complex
taste
and
as
an
excellent
representative
of
the
wee

style

i
wish
i
had
better
access
to
the
brewer
because
the
few
ive
had
have
been
quite
good
d
this
is
quite
a
nice
wee
heavy
and
welldeserving
of
the
classic

style
it
commonly
is
considered
as
it
is
on
the
mild
side
though
of
what
the
style
has
become
these
days
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
because
of
that
fact
if
i
were
from
the
uk
the
word
lovely
would
have
been
used
in
excess
in
explaining
this
ale
o
delicious
and
classic
british
ale
strongly
recommended
drinkability
um
not
sure
plenty
to
work
with
here
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
to
be
honest
the
sweetness
kind
of
plays
big
here
im
not
sure
id
run
right
into
another
one
of
these
a
little
disappointed
given
my
very
fond
memories
of
this
one
but
the
last
one
of
these
id
had
was
probably
3
years
ago
or
more
just
goes
to
show
my
palate
is
evolving
i
guess
another
classic
and
one
of
the
beers
i
had
lots
of
back
when
i
started
nice
dark
crimson
body
with
a
darker
tan
head
nose
is
sweet
caramel
and
vanilla
spice
with
toffee
and
walnut
nutty
character
to
this
beer
but
not
overtly
so
very
well
done
with
just
the
right
amount
very
drinkable
and
tasty
with
a
medium
body
and
creamy
mouthfeel
slightly
light
abv
for
the
style
and
a
little
dry
in
the
finish
overall
great
bang
for
the
buck
and
a
widely
available
old
school
classic
if
you
like
malty
beers
this
beer
and
others
of
its
style
are
a
must
try
decently
big
and
quite
tastey
drinkability
forget
the
bud
light
this
is
drinkability
a
pleasing
flavour
and
ultra
smooth
and
satisfying
texture
head
is
creamy
and
flavourful
simply
wonderful
to
drink
from
the
tap
d
tastes
amazing
with
an
almost
overwhelming
depth
of
complexity
the
thickness
and
richness
of
this
beer
brings
down
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
as
it
truly
is
an
exercise
to
sip
this
beer
down
to
the
end

a
solid
and
quite
worthy
example
of
this
old
school
style
a
big
strong
and
very
rich
beer
i
swear
i
can
feel
it
going
straight
to
my
arse
but
it
was
worth
it
an
excellent
scotch
ale
disappointing
wonder
if
this
would
be
any
different
out
of
the
bottle
overall
a
beer
i
would
pick
up
any
time
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
scotch
ale
pours
chestnut
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
is
rather
rocky
smells
firm
and
very
malty
but
not
like
sticky
sweet
toffee
this
is
deep
but
dry
buttery
slightly
salty
on
the
end
the
taste
as
well
is
very
firm
malt
that
is
almost
woody
or
peaty
some
toffeelike
flavors
but
still
very
dry
firm
in
the
mouth
as
well
this
is
a
nice
fall
weather
beer
for
the
porch
quite
satisfying
if
relatively
uncomplicated
drinkability
very
smooth
easily
sneaks
up
on
you
and
youve
downed
one
before
you
realize
it
quite
enjoyable
unless
youre
a
hophead
good
drinkability
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
and
good
flavor
throughout
looking
forward
to
another
a
pretty
good
wee
heavy
but
there
are
a
few
i
can
think
of
that
i
would
prefer
over
it
still
worth
a
try
if
you
like
scottish
beers
wow
this
brew
is
excellent
tastes
great
and
is
very
drinkable
would
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
any
beer
lover
one
of
the
better
beers
i
had
for
a
long
time
d
better
drank
as
a
sipper
more
flavors
jump
out
as
it
warms
up
rich
and
smooth
sweet
but
not
cloying
this
one
is
a
winner
pours
a
ruddy
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
twofinger
head
that
deflates
to
a
thin
skein
of
foam
on
the
top
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
sublime
rich
caramely
malts
with
some
tangy
mineral
notes
the
taste
comes
on
with
a
sharp
tang
then
some
very
simple
sweetness
moving
through
some
almost
chalky
notes
into
a
heavy
hit
of
malt
then
finishing
with
some
dull
bitterness
its
much
more
pleasant
and
complex
than
it
sounds
and
really
wakes
up
the
taste
buds
its
perhaps
overly
carbonated
but
thin
enough
that
its
easy
to
take
a
mouthful
not
an
easy
drinker
but
a
good
one
this
is
an
excellent
scottish
ale
a
delightful
combination
of
scents
and
flavors
that
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
6
5
abv
isnt
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
one
should
be
aware
of
it
i
could
see
myself
sitting
down
with
friends
on
a
cool
summer
night
and
drinking
a

or
two

if
there
more

appear
more
as
it
warms

never

nor

the
final
sip
as
fresh
as
the
first
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
a
bottle
not
on
nitrotap
however
the
subtle
flavors
of
smoke
and
dried
dark
fruits
are
almost
gone
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
out
of
a
bottle
not
like
this
though
d
again
a
sippingbeer
any
more
than
one
wee
heavy
per
serving
is
overdoing
it
the
velvety
feel
of
this
ale
helps
the
drinker
appreciate
the
craft
that
went
into
the
brewing
process
easily
an
afterdinner
beer
absolutely
incredible
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
well
worth
seeking
out
its
a
nice
sipper
this
honestly
has
been
one
of
the
best
ales
ive
ever
tasted
brings
back
so
many
memories
of
my
first
trip
to
oxford
and
london
where
ales
are
king
for
my
barometer
its
malts
all
the
way
and
this
my
first
scotch
ale
is
highly
recommended
a
superior
european
ale
cheers
medium
body
just
ok
needs
a
bit
more
heft
but
well
made
nice
lace
and
carbonation
makes
this
a
winner
good
with
dinner
too
d
very
drinkable
it
is
fairly
light
on
the
stomach
and
tastes
great
though
it
is
a
wee
bit
sweet
which
may
stop
me
from
consuming
more
than
a
few
overall
very
decent

a

overall
a

beer
all
in

a
good
introduction
to
the
style
overall
not
something
i
would
session
but
very
good
once
in
a
while
probably
would
drink
this
more
in
the
cold
weather
but
only
as
a
oneanddone
poured
up
a
crystal
clear
medium
brown
looked
like
tea
actually
with
a
beige
coloured
head
that
faded
away
in
about
40
seconds
smell
was
dominated
by
sweet
malts
as
it
should
have
been
but
i
really
couldnt
pick
out
anything
specific
it
was
all
rather
muted
it
seemed
flavour
was
very
mild
with
again
dampened
sweet
malty
flavours
and
that
lovely
modest
earthy
hop
bitterness
one
finds
in
so
many
ales
from
the
u
k
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
honestly
i
could
find
nothing
really
special
about
it
save
for
its
modesty
made
for
a
highly
drinkable
wee
heavy
if
malty
beers
are
your
thing
than
check
this
out
d
while
not
a
real
refreshing
beer
this
has
lots
of
flavor
and
is
definitely
worth
purchasing
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
good
conversation
over
or
to
watch
a
movie
with
a
real
comforting
beer
to
drink
also
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
dont
think
this
would
be
a
beer
to
have
more
than
2
of
in
an
evening
though
a
bit
too
rich
for
that
i
recommend
this
to
everyone
pours
a
strong
brown
body
clear
good
sized
head
offwhite
creamy
okay
lacing
flowery
aroma
but
not
like
the
sweetness
of
a
belgian
almost
dustylike
with
some
kind
of
spice
some
nuttiness
that
same
dusty
spice
some
clove
maybe
almost
banana
enjoyable
very
drinkable
the
flavor
makes
me
want
more
banana
spice
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
a
very
expensive
session
beer
but
worth
it
for
those
cooler
crisp
nights
d
this
was
nice
shift
from
the
beers
ive
been
drinking
lately
its
a
very
drinkable
creation
that
has
quite
a
bit
of
underlying
complexity
im
really
glad
i
picked
it
up
d
good
flavor
although
a
bit
too
sweet
its
almost
a
onedimensional
flavor
and
that
makes
it
hard
to
want
another
d
goes
down
super
smooth
good
depth
to
this
beer
i
could
easily
drink
2
or
3
of
them

a
real
winner
in
this
style
appears
a
clear
dark
amber
colour
with
lots
of
wispy
white
head
the
smell
is
bitter
and
floral
with
some
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
biscuity
malt
sweet
balanced
with
floral
hops
carbonation
is
average
and
the
finish
is
offdry
with
a
lingering
maltiness
any
extra
alcohol
is
perceptible
as
a
slight
warming
this
is
a
very
good
cure
for
the
bitter
cold
outside
at
this
time
of
year
and
makes
the
haggis
a
little
more
palatable
what
a
wee
heavy
should
be
focus
on
strong
malt
flavours
warming
and
deeply
satisfying
deep
dark

malty

like
caramelized

in

and

are
very
bready
with
some

leafy

texture
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
an

sipping
beverage
this
is
a
creamy
smooth
scottish
ale
goes
down
very
smooth
my
first
actually
from
scotland
glad
to
have
covered
my
bases
and
tried
an
authentic
very
enjoyable
beer
the
taste
is
a
layered
one
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
caramel
malt
along
with
some
toffee
nodes
there
is
also
some
smoked
earthy
flavor
up
front
which
is
somewhat
surprising
for
a
scotch
ale
this
beer
has
a
small
amount
of
sweetness
possibly
from
brown
sugar
as
well
great
scotch
ale
beautiful
malt
character
definitely
wee
heavy
perfect
with
something
sweet
drinkability
i
overly
enjoyed
this
one
probably
because
its
not
overexemplified
like
alot
of
other
wee
heavys
out
there
its
light
almost
refreshing
in
a
way
and
uses
its
ingredients
to
create
a
perfect
landscape
of
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
a
nice
brew
to
have
to
start
your
night
with
although
it
has
a
6
5
rate
on
abv
i
can
enjoy
a
nice
cool
glass
of
this
beer
on
the
hottest
of
days
it
doesnt
have
the
super
sweet
and
heat
that
others
that
make
this
style
steer
the
beer
toward
this
was
my
first
wee
heavy
mozart

this
has
a
low
abv
so
i
would
say
it
has
good
drinkability
but
when
i
popped
in
to
say
hello
a
week
laterit
was
gone
whether
it
was
a
temporary
outage
or
tragedy
of
longterm
distribution
schemes
buoyed
by
a
mild
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
remains
good
because
the
sweetness
is
always
kept
in
check
by
the
bready
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
moderate
in
strength
and
body
so
as
to
allow
for
several
in
one
sitting
that
said
it
did
lack
the
chewy
sweetness
and
dominant
malt
character
so
common
in
many
wee
heavy
nonetheless
a
solid
beer
taste
smooth
feel
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
but
the
yeast
seems
to
have
taken
this
beer
over
a
little
too
much
aftertaste
is
caramel
sweetbut
with
a
bitter
side
that
was
more
yeasty
than
hoppy
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
but
fascinating
nonetheless
i
dont
come
back
to
beers
very
often
but
everytime
i
come
back
to
this
i
never
regret
it
it
almost
seems
to
get
better
they
should
call
this
one
belhavens
best
not
that
other
one
a
highly
drinkable
beer
medium
to
full
body
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
sticky
and
sweet
finish
is
actually
crisp
i
think
founderss
dirty
bastard
is
a
better
tasting
scotch
alebut
this
was
a
pretty
good
offering
cheers
drinkability
this
tastes
very
off
for
the
scottish
style
there
were
metallic
sour
hints
and
they
detracted
from
the
general
enjoyability
of
this
beer
i
will
not
seek
this
out
again
this
was
on
tap
at
the
scottish
arms
it
poured
a
deep
ruby
color

thin

drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
really
reminded
me
of
and
esb
on
steroids
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
just
was
expecting
more
depth
from
a
wee
heavy
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
in
fact
i
think
id
order
it
again
and
again
wow
there
may
be
something
to
this
style
dropped
the
drinkability
a
bit
because
i
find
this
beer
is
very
heavy
even
for
the
6
5
abv
still
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
although
id
probably
pick
mcewans
over
this
from
what
i
can
remember
when
i
first
poured
this
beer
i
poured
it
in
a
poorly
lit
room
looking
at
it
i
thought
immediately
of
coca
cola
was
rather
upset
however
in
decent
light
the
colour
is
a
more

very
little

and
what
was
there
disipated
fast
smells
great

despite
having
an
earthy
feel
is
also
rather

dark

like
raisins
and

mouthfeel
is
thick
and
juicy
juicy
ya
know
i
think
that
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
used
that
word
in
describing
a
beer
who
knew
it
would
have
been
positive
drinkable
oh
yes
very
this
is
an
attractive
well
made
beer
that
is
surpisingly
tasty
for
how
smoky
it
is
and
how
high
the
abv
is
this
doesnt
have
session
beer
drinkability
but
i
can
highly
recommend
trying
at
least
one
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
was
most
definately
a
treat
to
drink
just
when
i
was
sure
i
was
lost

impressive
this
being
only
my
second
beer
of
the
scotch
ale
style
has
made
me
want
to
branch
out
to
all
others
of
its
kind
ill
definatly
have
another
d
this
is
one
seriously
delicious
beer
that
fits

this

brew
one
that
i
can
imagine
craving
in
the
depth
of
winter
its
not
an
easygoing
or
wellbalanced
beerit
hits
you
hard
even
suckerpunches
you
still
its
good
and
has
its
place
rich

indeed
heavy
at

a
wee

rock

em
robots
brother
this
is
a
serious
beer
for
serious
drinkers
give
it
a
shot
especially
if
youre
reading
this
when
the
outside
thermometer
is
dipping
low
this
is
a
bit
lacking
in
body
for
a
scotch
ale
maybe
this
could
be
a
session
scotch
ale
its
very
tasty
though
i
could
enjoy
a
few
more
i
think
it
would
be
better
fresher
though
ill
get
another
bottle
at
a
different
store
to
see
if
i
notice
any
difference
and
ill
rereview
it
then
taste
is
semi
sweet
bitter
and
fresh
a
great
mouth
feel
and
a
very
smooth
finish
this
is
a
beer
i
can
see
myself
drinking
again
for
sure
great
lacing
on
this
beer
i
can
see
a
line
from
every
sip
a
great
balance
of
everything
involved
ack
this
is
terrible
try
drinking
liquid
smoke
like
you
would
make
sausage
with
thats
this
beer
overwhelming
smoke
flavour
i
might
as
well
be
smoking
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
tried
a
pretty
good
brew
i
expect
more
out
of
a
scottish
ale
the
offfromclear
rust
colored
pour
gives
me
hope
the
aromas
of
dark
fruit
caramel
bread
and
yeast
jump
out
at
me
taste
the
obvious
caramels
barley
malt
and
maple
syrup
provides
a
very
sweet
base
that
is
never
rounded
out
with
english
hops
other
flavors
of
overripened
fruit
prunes
figs
raisons
dates
nuts
and
cherries
swirl
around
in
my
mouth
body
is
full
and
round
alcohol
rumlike
is
revealed
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
also
sweet
and
cloying
no
spices
or
hops
to
balance
out
slight
smokiness
helps
but
not
enough
sticks
to
your
teeth
a
little
a
quality
beer
but
the
flavors
dont
meld
together
or
balance
out
properly
has
a
lot
of
flavors
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
belhaven
wee
heavy
is
brewed
very
close
to
scotch
ale
style
tasty
with
alcohol
well
hidden
but
a
little
wanting
in
body
and
mouthfeel
has
some
stout
characteristics
a
coffe
taste
comes
through
albeit
faint
but
enough
to
let
you
know
there
is
some
serious
roastedtoasted
malt
i
think
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
nicely
pretty
easy

it

a

make
this
a
very

beer
my

and
this
was
a

indeed

the

slight

notes

i
wish
the

wasnt
there

i
love
this
beer
it
is
easy
for
me
to
put
down
3
pints
like
they
were
nothing
highly
recommended
this
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown

clear

had

left

you
have

in
the
bottle

well
worth
the
trouble
on
cask
a
very
fine
beer
peaty
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
nicely
balanced
but
with
vivid
bold
flavors
is
this
beer
sold
in
scotland
none
of
the
belhavens
ive
tried
there
had
a
significant
element
of
smoke
this
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
medium
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
and
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
the
aroma
was
of
fruits
and
sweetness
dark
malts
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavor
is
really
sweet
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
some
dark
fruit
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
enjoyable
but
a
little
too
sweet
i
did
like
this
ale
just
not
as
much
as
some
others
ive
had
in
the
category
taste
of
rich
toasted
caramel
fruit
a
mild
bitterness
in
the

wonderful

its

notes
on

its
well
done
for
a
beer
that
is
mostly
about
caramel
malt
interplays
just
lighter
than
i
expected
and
the

bitter
with
a
touch
of
roasted

this
tasted
not
so
unlike

which
is
no

thing
this
beer
looks
amazing
it
pours
a
glowing
dark
red
with
an

rocky
head
that
leaves
gobs
of
lace
on

the
aroma
is
of

cumquot
really
some
toasty
malts
and
a

the
taste
is

some
candy
sweetness
plums
and
jammyness
become
apparent
the
alcohol
builds

but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
smokyness
returns
this
beer
must
be
brewed
with
smoked
malts
its
an
interesting
flavor
but
could
have
some
more
substantial
and
complex
malts
and
some
more
hop
flavor
too
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
buttery
with
uneven
carbonation

this
is

feel
like
i
have
a
beer
halo
hops
be
damned
here
this
is
about
roasting
the
fruits
of
the
earth
sure
its
sweet
with
malt
but
the
alcohol
cuts
the
sweetness
and
a
little
hops
help
to
funnel
this
malty
god
down
with
their
bittering
influence
im
left
with
a
palate
hung
with
dried
grapes
shall
i
say
fresh
raisins
i
like
the
spirited
maltiness
its
nicely
lightlycarbonated
for
the
style
a
wee
heavy
afterwardsas
it
should
be
theres
a
smokiness
like
a
dessert
cigar
earthy
beer
good
for
a
pub
session
with
your
friends
although
ill
cut
your
hand
off
if
you
try
to
take
some
of
the
first
bottle
but
after
that
we
can
share
after
a
couple
ill
sing
in
public
a
full
light
tan
head
over
clear
deep
brown
liquid
slight
smoky
nose
with
a
malty
sweet
backbone
the
smokypeaty
overtones
carry
thru
on
the
taste
along
with
light
phenolic
plasticband
aid
notes
and
an
adequate
hoppiness
finishes
with
a
little
chocolatey
touch
drying
slightly
two
and
a
half
years
later
and
a
new
bottle
is
still
great
one
of
my
favourites
in
this
style
biscuit
like
medium
top
full
mouthfeel
appearance
is
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
head
is
medium
sized
and
light
brown
this
beer
seems
highly
carbonated
at
first
but
the
bubbles
die
down
quickly
aroma
is
clean
not
very
strong
but
consists
of
a
mild
nutty
malt
smell
taste
is
in
the
midrange
of
nuttiness
maybe
just
a
slight
buttery
taste
hops
are
present
mostly
for
stability
sweetness
finishes
a
sip
nicely
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
down
and
the
6
5
abv
is
never
apparent
i
ended
up
giving
this
beer
a
very
good
score
but
belhaven
wee
heavy
never
quite
knocked
the
ball
out
of
the
park
this
is
a
nice
wee
heavy
a
very
good
scotch
ale
great
milkshakey
frothy
eggshell
of
a
head
nice
cola
color
with
carbination
rising
up
very
vineous
and
grapey
scents
taste
is
dry
but
yet
it
leaves
your
mouth
moist
nice
and
malty
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
nice
flavoring
carbination
is
medium
just
right
medium
bodied
slight
chardonnay
tastes
maybe
a
bit
more
towards
apple
juice
tiny
bit
of
molasses
some
darkness
everything
is
so
nicely
blended
in
this
one
good
drinkability
here
too
theres
no
such
thing
as
scotchtoberfest
you
used
me
skinner
you
used
me
why
does
belhaven
blitz
stores
with
the
scottish
ale
when
this
is
so
clearly
superior
i
like
this
beer
because
it
works
in
three
stages
the
first
is
the
nose
which
is
chocolatey
and
smokey
like
you
would
expect
in
a
scotch
ale
then
comes
the
taste
which
is
suprisingly
nutty
and
malty
finally
the
aftertaste
where
peat
and
smoke
come
back
for
a
final
hurrah
forget
about
the
other
belhaven
bews
this
is
the
way
to
go
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
poured
out
a
dark
mahogany
color
almost
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
that
was
slow
to
form
but
got
up
to
a
good
size
rings
of
lace
were
left
around
the
glass
as
this
was
consumed
and
tiny
bubbles
that
kept
the
head
fed
and
alive
for
a
good
while
the
aroma
smelled
of
dark
ripe
fruits
and
a
rich
maltiness
the
taste
was
similar
as
sweet
dark
fruits
came
first
before
a
more
subtle
chocolate
toffee
malt
flavor
that
lingered
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
there
was
a
slight
bit
of
hop
detected
but
not
much
there
was
enough
their
to
keep
the
sweetness
balanced
nicely
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
mediumfull
body
added
greatly
to
the
overall
experience
very
drinkable
stuff
here
as
the
alcohol
was
not
detectable
or
too
high
to
keep
a
few
of
these
from
going
down
great
example
of
the
style
that
i
recommend
to
all
boot
polish
brown
with
a
decent
head
this
is
a
big
beer
in
all
respects
malt
is
the
order
of
the
day
and
this
brew
delivers
front
to
back
this
may
be
one
of
the
greatest
scottish
ales
i
have
consumed
and
part
of
the
reason
is
that
it
has
the
malt
equivalent
of
a
double
ipa
balanced
bold
and
beautiful
try
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
light
effervescence
all
over
the
tongue
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
but
honestly
nothing
special
i
expected
more
but
was
let
down
you
can
argue
that
this
isnt
the
most
sophisticated
brew
out
there
but
it
works
so
wonderfully
together
gotta
love
it
if
only
i
could
get
this
in
a
12
pack
my
oregon
winters
would
be
so
much
brighter
my
beer
favorites
have
been
broadened
this
beer
like
the
other
scotch
ale
i
tried
has
truly
hit
a
home
run
with
me
the
color
is
that
of
a
dark
cola
with
aromatic
hints
of
smoky
sweet
maple
it
drinks
smooth
with
a
heavy
mouthfeel
thats
almost
syrupy
the
carbonation
is
perfect
could
scotch
ales
be
my
new
favorite
i
think
i
need
to
drink
more
to
be
absolutely
sure
ahhh
the
things
i
do
for
science
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
fine
scottish
ale
recommended
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
i
will
buy
this
again
maybe
next
time
i
make
shepards
pie
excellent
drinkability
a
great
sipping
brew
drinkability
is
sublime
this
is
a
thinking
manor
womans
beer
sip
this
while
dressed
comfortbly
curled
up
with
a
book
of
robert
burns
poetry
and
be
sure
to
listen
to
some
old
gaelic
music
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
scottish
pub
in
nyc
and
have
been
seeking
it
out
in
bottle
form
ever
since
it
pours
nicely
dark
brown
with
a
tinge
of
amber
and
a
mediumsized
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
roasty
and
smoky
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
underlying
it
very
full
in
the
mouth
with
a
strong
but
not
at
all
overwhelming
peated
malt
character
this
mellows
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
developing
an
almost
chocolatey
sweetness
in
the
middle
along
with
some
dark
fruit
flavors
finishes
with
a
nice
light
smoke
flavor
all
in
all
quite
good
but
nothing
like
drinking
it
with
a
kiltwearing
bagpipeplaying
band
10
feet
away
ambiance
counts
overall
a
very
pleasing
experiance
and
one
that
i
will
likely
repeat
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
with
a
dry
creamy
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
an
intense
malty
core
with
a
dry
creamy
finish
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
bit
of
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
good
scottish
ale
i
love
the
malty
flavor
and
aroma
very
nice
this
drinks
quite
well
rich
and
complex
brew
cellar
temps
allow
the
full
scope
of
flavor
to
come
thru
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
burnt
amber
color
with
nice
creamy
two
finger
head
which
dissapates
fast
leaving
minimal
lace
a
strong
aroma
of
what
i
somehow
connected
with
plain
yogurt
could
be
smelled
from
a
few
feet
away
tastes
of
toasted
malt
dominated
along
with
a
hint
of
syrup
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
as
for
drinkability
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
more
than
just
one
the
wee
heavy
poured
out
a
slightly
cloudy
brown
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
that
quickly
became
a
lace
it
had
an
aroma
of
toasted
malt
with
some
hints
of
fruit
and
spice
the
taste
was
purely
a
sharp
toasty
malt
with
a
nice
sort
of
musty
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
oily
in
the
mouth
this
was
a
mellow
malt
drink
and
i
found
it
to
be
much
more
drinkable
than
others
of
this
type
poured
out
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
smell
consists
of
some
malt
a
little
smoky
smell
taste
is
pretty
nice
it
has
a
nice
thick
and
rich
body
to
it
finishes
kinda
dry
and
a
little
bitter
very
nice
good
solid
malt
backbone
to
this
beer
as
well
theres
also
some
earthiness
to
the
taste
it
comes
out
more
when
you
start
sipping
it
every
now
and
then
overall
a
nice
beer
i
would
recommend
it
a
beer
to
be
sipped
savoured
and
fully
respected
amen
this
one
is
a
nice
bigbodied
scotch
ale
that
really
is
a
poster
beer
for
what
i
think
the
style
is
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
malts
are
huge
from
start
to
finish
the
smoky
flavor
is
a
bit
underneath
what
i
would
like
i
like
to
have
big
hints
of
single
malt
with
lots
of
smoke
and
lots
of
woody
flavors
in
there
it
had
both
of
them
but
it
wasnt
loaded
it
is
very
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
also
good
very
well
done
poured
aggresively
this
has
a
huge
firm
white
head
it
is
a
dark
ruby
color
with
rising
bubbles
throughout
aroma
is
sort
of
creamy
with
a
good
malty
whiff
and
a
fair
dose
of
hops
suprisingly
this
beer
actually
starts
off
with
a
smoked
taste
to
it
then
settles
into
a
sweet
maltiness
and
a
somewhat
overwhelming
buttery
flavor
that
lasts
well
into
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
good
amount
of
taste
going
on
here
not
just
a
malt
monster
i
think
this
beer
may
be
a
good
example
of
diacetyl
it
just
seems
too
buttery
with
some
off
flavors
the
smoked
taste
is
unwelcome
here
mouthfeel
is
decent
nothing
special
the
odd
taste
makes
this
beer
not
too
drinkable
interesting
for
sure
but
not
great
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
not
far
off
from
greatness
the
sweet
buttery
maltiness
in
the
taste
just
needs
a
little
more
of
a
counterbalance
i
love
malt
and
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
great
it
just
gets
to
be
a
little
too
much
after
a
while
overall
though
the
taste
is
superb
which
is
why
i
think
a
bit
more
balance
would
be
effective
and
not
a
toning
down
of
the
maltiness
drinkability
ive
heard
that
scots
classify
things
as
wee
not
so
wee
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
scotch
ale
or
wee
heavy
for
that
matter
but
a
nice
smokymalty
beer
to
sip
during
a
card
game
or
to
have
a
smoke
with
on
the
back
label
it
is
written
that
this
is
a
beer
to
be
sipped
savoured
and
fully
respected
sic
that
in
short
about
sums
it
up
i
think
ill
have
another
translucent
copper
colored
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
earthy
bready
aromas
and
sweet
malt
dominate
the
nose
biscuity
and
sweet
malt
taste
accompanied
with
a
nuttylike
finish
that
is
earthy
too
ive
tried
bigger
wee
heavies
but
this
ones
enjoyable
in
regards
to
its
simplicity
excellent
accompaniment
to
a
fine
cigar
drinkability
i
usually
find
this
style
overwhelming
in
sweetness
and
alcohol
this
is
quite
drinkable
at
least
until
the
inevitable
ambush
update

i
first
rated
this
in
2003
so
thought
id
do
a
rereview
with
an
04
bottle
it
just
looks
magnificent
on
an
easy
pour
its
definitely
wee
heavy
with
a
big
belt
of
scotch
flavor
a
beer
style
that
i
truly
enjoy
but
unfortunately
this
particular
scottish
ale
missed
the
mark
with
me
it
poured
a
large
sized
creamy
ivory
head
with
finemedium
sized
bubbles
that
was
mostly
lasting
the
body
was
uncarbonated
with
a
reddishbrown
hue
the
nose
was
malty
notes
of
caramel
and
butter
the
flavor
was
slightly
bitter
and
sour
with
a
fore
and
aftertaste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
beer
left
a
spider
web
like
lacing
the
aroma
is
the
first
this
that
is
noticeable
upon
the
pour
very
little
almost
no
head
what
little
head
there
is
dissipates
quickly
to
a
very
small
lace
the
color
is
a
deep
clear
rubycopper
lots
of
malt
on
the
nose
with
some
slight
alcohol
quite
smooth
and
slick
in
the
mouthfeel
with
only
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
malt
is
of
caramel
with
some
slight
dark
fruit
notes
small
amount
of
hop
bite
on
the
finish
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
with
some
remaining
maltiness
theres
also
a
hint
of
roasted
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
rich
flavor
but
not
very
full
bodied
i
thought
that
the
alcohol
would
be
noticeable
but
it
was
very
well
hidden
this
was
a
good
brew
but
id
probably
only
want
to
drink
one
or
two
at
the
very
most
of
these
at
a
time
imho
i
was
really
excited
about
trying
this
beer
and
a
little
disappointed
this
is
one
beautiful
ale
it
pours
a
rubytinged
teak
a
solid
beige
head
sits
on
top
and
takes
its
sweet
time
fading
lots
of
webs
of
lace
mark
your
progress
as
you
drink
the
sweet
malty
aroma
is
fairly
potent
a
mild
hop
aroma
enters
after
some
coaxing
but
disappears
the
doughy
malt
is
full
rich
and
creamy
flavors
of
honey
and
toffee
stay
throughout
tealike
and
mild
citrus
bitterness
advance
forward
and
a
light
metallic
edge
keep
things
sharp
despite
the
rounded
and
almost
oily
malt
body
as
with
most
scottish
ales
the
word
peaty
smoky
and
scotchlike
needs
to
be
mentioned
a
true
maltlovers
ale
whoa
maybe
the
perfect
rich
strong
malty
scottish
ale
i
love
this
one
very
carmelly
malt
flavor
dominates
slight
yeastiness
doesnt
get
in
the
way
nice
carbonation
with
big
head
and
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
an
awesome
beer
a
damn
chuggable
big
beer
a
big
and
hearty
thanks
to
marc77
for
this
sample
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
may
be
my
favorite
scotch
ale
although
the
regular
belhaven
ale
is
probably
a
bit
mild
for
my
tastes
the
wee
heavy
is
a
great
brew
thank
you
much
to
wvbeergeek
for
the
suggestion
as
well
as
the
company
half
a
liter
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
good
head
retention
and
fair
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
pleasant
lots
of
caramel
toffee
and
spice
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
molasses
and
caramel
coming
through
there
is
just
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
a
lot
smoother
than
i
thought
it
would
be
at
6
5
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
very
nice
for
my
first
scotch
ale
this
is
definitely
more
sessionable
than
orkney
skullsplitter
lower
abv
yet
the
taste
is
every
bit
as
developed
and
complex
as
orkney
in
fact
it
may
surpass
ill
have
to
try
the
orkney
again
to
compare
and
review
a
very
nice
scottish
ale
ng
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
healthy
sized
tan
head
forming
a
collar
of
lace
and
with
each
sip
leaves
uneven
rings
of
lacing
very
full
slightly
musty
or
smokey
fruit
tones
which
include
pear
and
plum
in
there
loads
of
malt
sweetness
nothing
too
much
great
session
balance
is
here
taste
cream
covered
ripened
fruit
palate
leaving
only
faint
trails
of
bitterness
hops
are
almost
unnoticeable
here
roasted
malt
very
nice
not
overbearing
at
all
works
well
with
all
of
the
flavors
mouthfeel
slightly
sharp
carbonation
leaves
a
coating
on
the
tongue
medium
body
almost
milky
texture
drinkability
not
exactly
a
summer
sipper
more
towards
a
winter
warmer
but
i
could
find
myself
enjoying
this
one
in
a
big
comfy
chair
in
front
of
the
fireplace
wonderful
beer
the
best
belhaven
ive
had
to
date
dark
copper
color
with
a
beige
frothy
head
that
lingers
long
very
low
aroma
of
light
malt
and
hop
flavor
is
rich
thick
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
fig
and
raisin
also
some
cocoa
and
caramel
a
bit
of
an
alcoholic
finish
no
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
lovely
thick
lace
and
rings
of
foam
encircle
the
inside
of
the
glass
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
perhaps
a
bit
low
carbonation
very
enjoyable
dark

color
with

both

i
would

buy
this
again
how
about
wee
malty
nice
scottish
ale
better
than
mcewans
imo
nice
carmelmalt
flavor
sweet
but
not
overly
so
seems
to
be
ideally
balanced
for
the
style
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
as
nice
of
a
malt
profile
as
ive
tasted
reminds
me
in
a
way
of
a
good
doppelbock
like
salvator
or
moretti
fans
of
either
of
those
beers
or
mcewans
should
try
this
one
ruby
red
in
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
toasty
nutty
and
it
has
a
sweet
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
again
toasty
and
nutty
almost
a
smoky
flavor
to
it
there
is
also
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
it
is
mediumfull
in
body
with
an
oily
texture
it
finishes
dry
this
is
a
very
good
brew
i
will
definitely
sample
again
this
was
actually
my
second
time
with
this
beer
the
first
was
at
the
mn
ba
gathering
it
was
my
last
beer
in
the
daylong
session
that
ended
at
feloniousmonks
blue
nile
aroma
had
a
nice
alcohol
spiciness
and
some
fruit
sweetness
dark
fruit
really
starts
to
come
through
as
the
beer
warms
up
ruby
almost
cherry
wood
in
color
head
was
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
some
nice
laciness
raisins
plums
and
other
dark
fruits
were
really
noticeable
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
alcohol
zestiness
came
across
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
in
the
finish
earthy
graininess
comes
out
as
it
warms
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
with
a
slight
oily
sensation
in
the
finish
very
nice
malt
character
poured
a
nice
auburnbrown
color
with
creamy
headmaltysweetalcohol
smell
to
it
taste
was
sweet
and
caramelly
with
some
earthiness
coming
in
at
the
end
something
to
have
before
goin
to
bed
on
a
chilly
early
spring
night
the
alcohol
content
will
help
turn
the
lights
out
for
bed
very
soft
on
the
tongue
this
beer
wraps
you
up
as
it
was
lightly
dry
on
my
mouthroof
and
had
a
moderate
length
finish
simple
but
very
effective
it
felt
rustic
especially
the
nose
a
very
attractive
beer
for
the
style
and
a
perfect
example
of
an
underappreciated
style
but
its
so
potent
in
scent
and
flavor
that
it
needs
to
be
drunk
only
one
or
two
at
a
time
great
in
a
duvel
glass
pours
with
a
deep

with
a

w
notes
of

has
a

notes
typical
for
the
scots
hits
of
peat
malt
in
the
mash
lingering
brandy
malt
flavor
and
raisen
like
esters
all
in
all
a
great
wee
heavy
ale
overall
i
really
like
this
wee
heavy
i
think
mcewens
is
thicker
and
richer
but
this
is
definitely
a
tasty
treat
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
malt
and
thickness
still
a
very
good
beer
magicin
a
glass
recommendation
on
this
belhaven
treat
is
very
high
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
large
slightly
creamy
light
tan
head
the
mouthfeel
is
firm
to
oily
the
smell
is
butterscotch
with
faint
hops
the
taste
is
smoky
maltpeat
perhapswith
a
mild
hoppy
finish
a
very
good
smoky
tasting
full
bodied
strong
scottish
ale
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
amber
when
held
next
to
the
light
bulb
i
could
see
that
it
was
indeed
clear
the
head
was
a
a
fairly
dark
tan
which
lasted
a
long
time
and
clung
to
the
glass
leaving
a
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
very
subtle
primarily
malt
the
taste
is
of
malt
and
whatever
hops
is
there
to
offset
the
malty
sweetness
it
finishes
a
caramel
chocolate
it
is
creamy
and
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
always
look
forward
to
drinking
i
would
recommend
it
highly
for
someone
trying
to
learn
the
style

a

the

the

scottish
ales
ive

behind

ale
this
is
probably
one
of
my
top
scotch
ales
i
really
like
mcewans
but
i
think
this
edged
it
out
it
had
a
very
nice
dark
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
lasted
a
little
while
the
taste
was
a
nice
bold
taste
with
some
roasted
maltiness
to
it
it
had
a
semisweet
after
taste
but
not
too
sweet
it
coated
my
mouth
and
had
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
finish
it
also
had
a
bit
of
a

tinge
to

coming
on

the

a
thick
mouthfeel
but
not
cloying
a

this

the

the

in

but
is
a

i
think
this
scotch
runs
neck
and
neck
with
mcewans
version
perhaps
the
this
beers
cool
name
provides
the
tiebreaker
i
always
thought
of
this

as
something

the

overall
good
worth
a
try
o
overall
it
was
a
good
malty
beer
but
i
felt
a
bit
cheated
on
the
rye
i
would
probably
not
get
it
again
because
it
is
overwhelmed
by
alcohol
esters
above
all
else
i
would
try
it
again
if
i
could
get
it
from
a
cask
or
keg
but
it
just
seems
fairly
bland
overall
this
is
more
of
the
actual
wee
heavy
foriegn
style
rather
then
the
scotch
ale
american
style
that
i
prefer
void
of
the
carmel
and
peat
flavors
that
ive
come
acustom
to
o
delicious
i
like
this
caramelbutterscotch
and
toasted
malt
bomb
one
bottle
is
enough
to
be
sure
but
its
quite
enjoyable
like
a
decadent
dessert
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
it
leans
decisively
toward
the
sugar
end
of
this
styles
spectrum
and
lacks
the
peaty
smokiness
and
maltdominant
expressions
most
try
to
achieve
keeping
that
in
mind
i
definitely
recommend
this
as
a
nitecap
to
be
savored
overall
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
about
this
beer
and
i
must
admit
that
i
was
confused
too
then
i
realized
that
this
is
not
a
classic
wee
heavy
but
a
wee
heavy
scotch
style
red
ale
so
maybe
this
is
a
scottish
twist
on
an
irish
red
but
even
so
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
something
i
would
return
to
anytime
soon
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
and
similar
lacing
its
a
bit
hazy
with
particulate
the
aroma
is
full
of
cinnamon
apple
and
mild
cherry
malt
alcohol
very
odd
and
not
exactly
thrilling
me
certainly
not
what
i
expected
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
cherryapple
sweetness
along
with
wheat
wine
ideas
some
grassy
rhubarb
bitterness
hidden
in
there
its
medium
bodied
but
with
a
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
that
tempers
a
bit
of
a
winelike
feel
this
is
good
enough
but
not
as
good
as
most
of
my
previous
hoppin
frog
experiences
and
certainly
nothing
approaching
the
labels
promising
descriptions
but
still
worth
a
try
especially
if
your
a
fan
of
wheat
wines
enough
saccharine
to
be
called
pop
love
song
in
a
bottle
doesnt
really
hew
to
the
scotch
ale
line
but
ill
take
it
good
beer
o
not
bad
at
all
but
the
boozy
qualities
kind
of
dominate
the
other
flavors
i
was
looking
forward
to
in
the
nose
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
nice
tasting
beer
but
not
very
complex
and
not
as
good
as
the
best
wee
heavys
but
worth
trying
and
worth
having
again
overall
not
so
good
for
a
scotch
ale
the
color
is
too
light
but
i
could
get
past
that
of
the
other
elements
were
better
the
flavor
is
slightly
watered
down
and
winey
the
body
is
too
thin
the
sweetness
is
good
and
the
peat
flavor
but
it
needs
some
roasted
malt
which
would
add
some
thickness
to
the
body
complexity
to
the
flavor
and
a
darker
color
overall
an
enjoyable
complex
rich
delicious
sipper
but
not
the
most
outstanding
example
of
this
style
overall
this
is
not
your
typical
scotch
style
ale
it
is
a
good
but
not
great
example
trying
my
first
hoppin
frog
the
wee
heavy
scotch
is
a
big
beer
that
is
amazing
the
beer
initially
pours
22oz
bottle
clear
amber
with
very
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
includes
a
dark
cherry
with
slight
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
very
sweet
malt
with
great
scotch
support
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
good
carbontation
overall
nice
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
huge
tan
colored
head
a
great
amount
of
lace
was
left
down
the
glass
and
the
settling
of
the
beer
was
a
fantastic
site
grat
pour
looked
perfect
smell
was
sweet
right
away
lots
of
sugar
and
caramel
smells
hints
of
grains
and
breads
and
even
a
light
hop
presence
rounded
this
put
nicely
the
taste
followed
right
away
but
was
alot
more
hoppy
then
i
had
envisioned
lots
of
caramel
and
sugar
flavors
and
more
then
a
hint
of
alcohol
made
up
the
bulk
of
it
big
hoppy
finish
which
suprised
me
in
a
good
way
the
taste
and
feel
were
both
very
full
smooth
and
creamy
im
a
huge
fan
of
sweet
dessertstyle
beers
but
this
is
a
bit
much
even
for
me
overall
an
ok
beer
not
as
rich
as
i
would
like
a
little
too
syrupy
as
well
overall
hoppin
frog
is
new
round
these
parts
and
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
really
like
what
hoppin
frog
has
done
here
big
flavors
true
to
the
style
a
very
high
quality
beer
i
have
had
four
beers
from
hoppin
frog
and
all
have
been
very
good
to
great
o
not
half
bad
but
nothing
mind
blowing
i
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again
but
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
overall
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
one
im
likely
to
get
again
cheers
overall
what
the
heck
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
so
i
can
not
rate
it
very
high
for
a
scotch
ale
a
wild
hybrid
it
seems
thats
for
sure
taste
the
first
sip
is
nice
i
do
detect
the
hint
of
rye
that
is
stated
on
the
bottle
they
claim
it
is
scotchlike
but
i
get
little
to
no
smokiness
or
peatiness
the
second
sip
invokes
a
pleasant
raisony
caramel
taste
this
is
very
drinkable
for
its
high
alcohol
content
as
i
continue
to
imbibe
the
bite
of
the
rye
and
the
caramel
malts
dominate
nice
nutty
malts
with
a
light
buttery
aspect
cleaner
than
it
smells
and
is
surprisingly
smooth
abv
is
well
hidden
little
bit
of
earthiness
but
the
typical
peat
and
smoke
is
missing
from
this
one
that
said
i
am
astonished
by
how
much
i
like
this
beer
the
whole
is
much
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
on
this
one
it
really
comes
together
nicely
just
a
fun
smooth
and
easy
beer
to
drink
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
reddishamberish
in
color
with
only
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
rim
of
my
snifter
it
smells
very
sweet
the
aromas
consist
of
grains
caramel
malts
pale
malts
caramel
candied
fruit
and
brown
sugar
the
flavors
are
a
mix
of
grains
caramel
malts
candied
fruit
and
soda
syrup
its
heavy
on
the
grains
and
its
a
little
sweet
id
almost
say
it
has
cherry
influences
as
well
it
drinks
very
smoothly
especially
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
just
not
exceptional
i
got
this
one
for
4
99
so
it
was
well
worth
the
price
overall
its
tasty
and
really
represents
the
wee
heavy
scotttish
ales
quite
well
its
a
real
flavor
bomb
and
might
be
a
little
over
the
top
for
most
but
this
is
what
i
expected
from
hoppin
frog
beers
not
bad
and
i
hope
this
bodes
well
for
the
manalishi
and
their
b
o
r
i
s
if
i
can
find
it
this
one
is
a
lumbering
bear
of
a
hot
sweet
drink
im
a
big
malt
fan
but
maybe
this
needs
some
crazy
oriental
flavors
to
go
with
it
or
some
seriously
hot
spice
to
cool
down
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
reddish
hue
short
white
head
sits
for
a
moment
before
fading
into
a
thin
collar
the
nose
provides
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
and
some
slight
breadiness
a
bit
of
alcohol
there
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
plain
theres
a
slight
burn
from
the
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
bread
none
of
the
deep
sugary
notes
i
would
expect
from
a
scotch
ale
completely
off
for
the
style
medium
body
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
just
okay
d
if
it
were
up
to
the
nose
id
drink
a
bunch
the
high
abv
is
tough
and
just
above
average
taste
its
meh
at
8
20abv
this
one
is
pretty
big
its
tasty
enough
but
you
wouldnt
be
advised
to
down
more
than
a
couple
in
a
session
drinks
very
easy
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
over
priced
imo
fairly
drinkable
if
not
slightly
weak
in
flavor
still
id
gladly
have
this
beer
again
d
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
one
is
certainly
worth
picking
up
drinkability
delicious
and
smooth
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
the
style
doesnt
have
tremendous
drinkability
due
to
the
strength
but
this
is
too
good
an
example
not
to
have
a
few
d
goes
down
quite
nicely
and
the
bomber
was
not
too
difficult
to
finish
not
bad
not
especially
great
but
not
bad
poured
with
a
small
to
medium
ligh
tan
head
that
shortly
disappeared
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
orange
copper
amber
aroma
is
malt
bananas
circus
peanuts
caramel
flavors
pretty
much
the
same
with
some
malty
sweetness
coming
to
the
fore
bodys
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
about
medium
length
meh
d
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
full
body
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
caramel
with
some
hop
in
the
back
poured
into
a
tulip
glass

lighter
than
expected
copperbronze
with
a
thinner
but
nice
creamylike
12
finger
off
white
head
big
juicy
fruitiness
in
the
noseit
really
stands
out
nicely
with
a
mix
of
caramel
and
sweetish
alcohol
the
big
fruitiness
is
not
quite
as
big
on
the
palateits
quite
sweet
the
caramel
and
that
fruitiness
being
predominanatnot
enough
balance
to
keep
it
real
drinkable
its
good
but
not
greatto
one
sided
in
its
sweetness
in
my
opinion
yay
another
occasion
for
my
seldomused
thistle
goblet
this
guy
pours
a
clear
burnt
amber
with
a
halffinger
of
white
minifoam
on
top
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
nose
comprises
caramel
cinnamon
cashews
and
that
awesomely
vague
sense
of
wheat
that
pervades
many
a
beer
the
taste
holds
notes
of
molasses
cloves
maple
syrup
red
apple
skin
lemongrass
and
that
hot
cinnamon
youd
find
in
tasty
breathfreshening
gums
yknow
the
kind
with
flavor
crystals
and
whatnot
the
body
is
medium
with
a
semiactive
carbonation
and
a
light
oral
coating
overall
a
decently
solid
brew
but
nothing
all
that
impressive
a
good
introduction
to
the
brewery
for
me
though
d
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
scotch
ale
lots
of
smooth
malts
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
would
try
again
this
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
caramel
malt
and
bready
yeast
with
nutty
malt
and
biscuit
and
a
bit
of
orange
zest
it
tasted
like
caramel
and
orange
and
milk
chocolate
with
some
dark
fruit
and
honey
wheat
it
was
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
good
scent
and
a
great
taste
and
body
it
was
very
sweet
and
malty
from
the
scotch
ale
style
but
it
was
also
very
juicy
from
the
red
ale
style
which
was
a
great
blend
the
alcohol
was
undetectable
and
the
beer
had
a
super
smooth
finish
so
this
was
dangerously
easy
to
drink
it
wasnt
the
most
bold
scotch
ale
ever
but
it
was
unique
and
very
rewarding
and
crazy
drinkable
definitely
recommended
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
nice
warm
clear
cinnamon
brown
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
does
not
stick
around
too
long
aroma
is
mainly
malty
with
a
sweet
fruity
overtone
flavor
is
mainly
fruity
apple
and
banana
rather
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
a
nice
malty
undertone
and
just
a
whisper
of
hops
texture
is
pleasantly
smooth
and
has
a
little
fizz
to
it
oh
well
you
cant
win

very

really
impressed
a
great
beer
d
this
was
a
really
disappointing
effort
i
enjoy
a
good
wee
heavy
once
in
awhile
but
this
wasnt
it
drinkability
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
the
style
a
touch
sweet
but
i
aint
complaining
d
drinkability
was
decent
fairing
much
better
as
it
warmed
to
near
room
temperature
boozy
even
at
8

it
came
off
dry
and
toasty
with
an
alcohol
warming
making
this
a
moderate
sipper
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
glad
that
i
finally
tried
it
great
flavors
dig
the
smell
its
pretty
filling
but
to
polish
off
a
22
oz
bottle
wasnt
too
much
of
a
problem
d
nice
beer
for
the
cold
nights
its
says
keep
cool
but
drink
it
at
room
tempreture
not
sure
that
i
would
have
nailed
this
as
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
it
does
however
have
a
malty
character
albeit
on
the
lighter
side
and
a
touch
of
minty
rye
out
of
style
pretty
good
nice
enough
taste
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
abv
drinkability
above
average
for
a
weeheavy
but
not
as
drinkable
as
my
favorite
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
drinkability
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
i
did
not
find
it
very
enjoyable
slow
sipping
beer
here
d
an
interesting
and
solid
take
on
my
favorite
style
its
sweet
as
expected
but
in
a
slightly
non
traditional
way
with
less
caramel
and
more
sweet
fruit
a
sipper
that
i
would
gladly
revisit
again
time
and
time
again

its
similar
to
the

it

toasted

a

from
the

its

drinkability
is
ok
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
but
this
isnt
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
with
that
being
said
its
worth
a
try
i
love
rye
malt
in
beers
but
it
seems
out
of
place
in
such
a
malt
driven
style
as
this
still
a
very
tasty
scotch
ale
that
is
pleasantly
drinakble
poured

nice

malty
flavor
as
well
with
a
little
caramel
in
the
taste
and
a
huge
warming
hit
of
alcohol
in
it
great
winter
beer
but
i
wouldve
liked
a
little
less
alcohol
and
a
lot
more
malted
peat
of
which
i
got
no
notice
of
still
a
nice
deep
malty
brew
d
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
scotch

definitely
a
sipper
recommended

drinkable
this
is
a
nice
one
recommended
forget
the
smell
score
because
it
pulls
the
total
score
down
too
far
outta
kilter
is
a
solid
effort
if
you
like
them
sweet
and
malty
and
even
if
youre
a
hophead
this
hoppin
frog
brew
is
a
pleasant
surprise
that
ill
be
sure
to
look
for
on
my
next
trip
to
the
buckeye
state
22
oz

not

nearly
no

of

malt
raisin
peat
taste
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
some

but
some
sourbittersweet
fruit
like
green
apple
gets
slightly
better
as
it
warms
with
some
peat
and
char
adding
to
more
malt
sweetness
lack
of
carbonation
hurt
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
but
it
was
not
nonexistent
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
overall
a
bit
disappointed
not
as
good
as
their
darker
brews
ive
had
nearly
makes
me
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
flips
my
kilt
na
zdravje
d
it
was
ok
not
the
best
american
attempt
at
this
style
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
i
guess
i
didnt
really
lke
it
overall
pours
a
coppery
amber
with
no
head
and
almost
no
bubbling
the
aroma
is
a
candy
caramel
toasted
malt
with
a
litte
nutty
liquer
mixed
in
the
taste
is
super
malty
from
start
to
finish
but
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
more
candy
like
note
into
the
middle
of
the
palate
the
finish
stays
pretty
sweet
throughout
and
no
noticeable
hops
or
rye
as
the
label
states
the
abv
adds
a
frangelica
like
taste
and
warm
feel
as
well
pretty
smooth
but
also
syrupy
palate
took
me
bout
an

another

offering
from

eric
hv
d

and
lacking
the
pronounced

this

of

smoke
and
banana

more
on

worth

maybe
youll
choose
to
pass
if
youve
got
a
number
of
wee
heavies
under
your
belt
already
but
i
think
this
is
a
solid
first
for
me
i
like
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
running
back
to
the
liquor
store
to
pick
up
a

the
perfect
good
mostly
inoffensive
deceptively
strong
not
my
cup
of
tea
my
review
of
this
beer
disappeared
so
here
it
is
again
this
beer
looks
great
and
tastes
awful
i
love
the
deep
amber
nearly
but
not
quite
ruby
color
that
reminds
me
of
glowing
embers
in
a
fire
place
this
was
my
first
experience
with
peated
malt
and
i
absolutely
hate
it
like
licking
a
bandaid
soaked
in
medicine
as
with
the
flavor
the
feel
is
too
light
and
thin
for
a
wee
heavy
its
a
bit
thin
regardless
and
only
the
carbonation
gives
it
crispness
this
causes
a
lack
of
real
flow
or
depth
while
fairly
smooth
it
goes
flat
at
the
end
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
fact
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
several
of
the
more
highly
regarded
scotch
ales
ive
tried
glad
to
recommend
o
its
not
a
favorite
and
i
will
probably
not
get
it
again
i
like
the
brewer
just
not
this
beer
o
not
a
bad
offering
but
not
really
notable
within
the
style
final
thoughts
as
i
mull
over
the
last
few
sips
of
brau
brothers
bancreagie
im
torn
on
a
rating
though
it
has
grown
on
me
the
lack
of
any
real
complexity
leaves
me
a
little
underwhelmed
i
think
as
a
oneoff
or
seasonal
release
it
would
be
worth
having
a
bottle
or
two
but
i
dont
understand
its
yearround
status
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
an
oakaged
version
o
not
my
typical
style
but
i
found
it
good
with
the
bbq
tritip
for
dinner
the
smoke
really
comes
on
in
the
middle
but
finishes
nice
decent
beer
imo
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
a
nice
smoky
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
works
well
but
its
not
the
beast
scotch
ale
ive
had
overall
decent
enough
packs
a
malty
punch
but
average
scotch
ale
very
nice
beer
and
fairly
easy
drinking
there
are
better
scotch
ales
out
there
but
this
is
worth
trying
generally
this
beer
was
a
good
malty
scotch
ale
except
for
the
peat
flavor
having
drunk
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
oaked
and
smoked
beers
and
islay
single
malt
whiskeys
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
didnt
taste
earthy
as
should
be
expected
what
i
had
hoped
to
be
a
malty
much
like
those

i
think
and
a
hint
of
earthy
peat
the
taste
is
considerably
more
peaty
than
the
aroma
with
some
nice
smokiness
too
there
is
still
a
solid
caramel
backbone
not
your
typical
wee
heavy
but
sort
of
a
hybrid
stoutwee
heavy
lots
of
roasty
notes
and
smoke
not
as
much
caramel
or
vanilla
still
very
solid
beer
and
enjoyable
good
scotch
ale
for
the
price
nice
flavors
including
a
good
deal
of
smokiness
dark
horse
brewing
scotty
karate
is
definitely
the
best
of
this
style
though
overall
this
looks
and
smells
like
a
winner
but
the
subdued
flavors
and
thin
mouthfeel
definitely
degraded
my
overall
thought
on
this
still
good
but
its
no
dirty
bastard
this
is
a
very
acceptable
scotch
ale
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
sweetly
malty
and
roasted
taste
theres
a
hint
of
an
alcohol
aftertaste
but
not
unpleasant
this
is
a
smooth
scotch
ale
not
great
but
good
indeed
this
was
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
overall
wow
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
nice
and
malty
and
slightly
sweet
delicious
im
definitely
getting
this
again
a
pretty
good
wee
heavy
but
not
quite
what
would
be
needed
to
vault
this
to
the
level
of
silver
citys
fat
my
personal
favorite
of
the
style
still
its
a
quality
beer
much
as
i
expect
from
great
divide
thanks
bro
overall
this
is
a
simplistic
scotch
ale
that
lacks
the
beef
to
assert
itself
like
a
scotch
ale
should
its
not
light
on
flavor
but
the
flavor
is
unrefined
and
the
body
is
sorely
lacking
great
company
great
style
super
average
beer
a
good
entry
level
for
a
scotch
ale
but
falls
short
overall
o
vague
sweetness
thats
hard
to
pin
down
when
one
actually
tries
to
locate
it
though
a
sweet
aftertaste
thats
easily
found
a
good
wee
heavy
a
little
overly
sweet
but
its
got
a
warm
feel
to
it
i
enjoyed
the
heavy
taste
of
a
traditional
wee
heavy
but
it
does
flow
good
its
a
solid
introduction
in
the
style
and
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
two
feel
rolls
around
the
tongue
like
a
liquid
marble
carbonation
pairs
with
hops
at
finish
for
a
bite
o
a
tasty
scotch
ale
with
flavor
and
punch
only
drawback
is
the
weak
carbonation
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
brown
foam
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
tiny
bit
of
lacing
around
the
edges
aroma
leads
with
sweet
roasted
malts
and
alcohol
a
good
amount
of
nuttiness
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
is
wonderfully
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
roasted
nuts
coffee
and
cocoa
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
although
it
does
come
through
a
bit
more
as
it
warms
this
one
is
medium
bodied
a
bit
thick
but
still
very
smooth
goes
down
with
relative
ease
as
a
relative
newcomer
to
wee
heavies
this
is
my
favorite
that
ive
had
so
far
weee
heavy
like
a
claymore
duh
o
this
is
a
very
good
substitute
for
you
know
what
rich
flavours

slightly

dark

almost
full

with
a

almost

texture
slightly
below

carbonation
with
a

on

the
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
and
well
balanced
but
lacks
the
intensity
and
complexity
of
the
world
class
wee
heavies
such
as
traquair
and
thirsty

wulver
it
begins
as
the
nose
mostly
caramel
with
hints
of
dark

roast
and

as
the
sweetness
fades
in
the
middle
hops
and
associated
mild
bitterness
are
noted
the
finish
leaves
you
with
a
touch
of
smoke
and
a
very
light
alcohol
burn
this
beer
is
a
slightly
heavier
version
of
a
traditional
scotch
ale
and
its
got
some
punch
very
malty
but
not
smoky
at
all
and
not
bitter
either
good
take
on
the
usual
scotches
overall
solid
and
hearty
if
you
like
caramel
try
it
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
has
a
caramel
and
peat
aftertaste
very
nicely
made
and
well
worth
trying
again
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
is
mostly
malt
with
maybe
a
little
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
all
malt
in
a
wonderful
way
caramel
and
coffee
are
present
maybe
some
dried
fruit
prunes
or
raisins
perhaps
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
thick
as
youd
expect
with
some
nice
warming
from
the
alcohol
this
is
a
great
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
o
got
a
wild
hair
on
an
hot
summer
day
and
wanted
something
new
that
i
knew
from
reading
id
prefer
for
the
cold
months
evidently
i
like
wee
heavy
what
can
i
say
ive
never
encountered
a
beer
that
i
thought
was
too
maltforward
needs
a
nose
why
cant
i
smell
this
ale
flavour
really
needs
a
bit
more
complexity
just
seems
like
something
with
so
much
crystals
should
also
have
a
bit
more
specials
a
little
more
peat
was
it
and
a
dram
of
smoke
wouldve
been
nice
all
in
all
ill
be
looking
for
more
scotch
ales
when
autumn
is
waning
and
cold
extremities
need
quickness
after
a
morning
of
waterfowling
notes
poured
into
a
usstyle
pint
glass
bod
bottled
on
date
09
april
2014
served
chilled
overall
yep
very
solid
stuff
and
unusual
to
boot
i
like
it
when
a
beer
manages
to
be
both
interesting
and
tastyand
i
think
its
fair
to
say
i
trust
a
brewery
like
great
divide
to
pull
it
off
overall
i
think
this
is
an
underrated
beer
ive
had
oskar
bluess
old
chub
scotch
alea
very
popular
wee
heavynumerous
times
and
i
found
this
to
be
a
superior
beer
the
taste
is
similar
but
a
little
richer
and
not
quite
as
sweet
this
beer
is
darker
and
has
a
sort
of
weightiness
about
it
as
well
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
scotch
ale
style
nothing
makes
it
stand
out
good
or
bad
o
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
beer
i
wish
the
nose
offered
a
bit
more
but
the
melding
of
flavors
makes
up
for
it
there
is
no
bitterness
and
no
off
tastes
to
ruin
the
palate
this
is
so
smooth
that
it
is
almost
sessionable
the
body
is
about
full
but
not
heavy
rich
enough
but
not
chewy
per
se
it
balances
crispness
with
smoothness
and
is
semidry
for
the
duration
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
balance
is
what
ill
remember
most
no
flavor
stood
above
the
others
and
all
worked
together
very
well
a
nice
enjoyable
malt
bomb
as
much
as
i
love
american
ipas
i
really
do
like
to
have
a
good
malty
treat
every
now
and
then
and
this
beer
is
certainly
a
good
malty
treat
great
as
an
afterdinner
drink
too
dark
red
pour
mild
head
smell
of
malts
and
alcohol
very
typical
for
the
style
taste
is
on
point
but
a
tad
boring
caramel
sweet
very
malty
medium
bodied
mild
carbonation
just
true
to
style
but
not
that
exciting
worth
a
try
overall
certainly
not
the
most
complex
scotch
out
there
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
caramel
bomb
this
onell
do
you
no
wrong
i
give
it
a
three
and
a
half
with
the
caveat
being
that
i
need
to
revisit
and
figure
out
if
this
is
the
true
representation
or
an
anomaly
picked
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
as
i
am
a
fan
of
the
wee
heavy
excellent
color
that
is
dark
and
rich
but
not
a
lot
of
head
good
scotch
smell
but
not
real
strong
taste
is
very
good
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
wee
heavy
which
isnt
all
good
also
a
little
thin
overall
a
very
tasty
scotch
ale
but
not
the
top
of
wee
heavy
not
sure
the
cost
but
it
would
have
to
be
priced
well
to
get
again
o
3
5
the
thing
that
really
brings
this
down
is
the
lack
of
complexity
in
the
taste
solid
wee
heavy
from
great
divide
didnt
know
what
i
was
getting
in
this
i
picked
up
in
a
mix
a
six
its
a
nice
mellow
and
sweet
beer
was
more
viscous
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
turns
out
to
be
pretty
good
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
its
tasty
couldnt
see
having
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
though
but
nice
to
cap
off
a
long
cold
weekend
on
a
sunday
night
overall
another
solid
brew
from
great
divide
and
a
nice
full
bodied
scottish
ale
o
at
first
wasnt
warming
to
it
as
it
warmed
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
example
of
the
style
without
any
particularly
unusual
stylings
maltforward
and
lipsmacking
good
o
a
nice
dark
brew
for
a
cold
day
not
my
favorite
great
divide
beer
but
it
definitely
stands
out
as
unique
give
it
a
try
overall
mild
balanced
and
drinkable
betrays
the
style
and
abv
i
like
it
usually
find
scotch
ales
to
be
too
strong
with
peat
malt
very
smooth
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
lightly
warming
feel
with
an
alcohol
note
behind
layers
of
nut
brittle
burnt
sugars
herbal
bitterness
phenols
mocha
caramel
earthiness
leather
and
dried
fruit
maltheavy
and
whispering
with
booze
hops
are
overcast
by
the
prominent
grain
flavors
however
theyre
not
thickened
with
sweetness
or
bolstered
by
much
meatiness
disappointing
is
the
lack
of
a
good
sturdy
carbonation
body
is
flaccid
and
wet
without
it
questionable
intensity
steers
me
away
from
calling
this
a
wee
heavy
but
it
makes
for
a
tasty
strong
scottish
ale
this
is
my
fifth
great
divide
beer
reviewed
had
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
one
of
the
better
offerings
of
its
kind
that
ive
had
if
not
the
best
strong
boozy
flavor
with
a
dark
fruit
aftertaste
and
a
bit
of
malty
smokiness
as
one
would
hope
not
of
ton
and
a
relatively
thin
mouthfeel
but
i
didnt
mind
here
pick
it
up
on
a
cold
night
or
when
you
just
want
to
get
pretty
loaded
overall
i
enjoyed
it
i
got
6
pack
and
feel
good
about
that
but
probably
wont
get
more
its
solid
and
worth
a
try
for
wee
heavy
fans
overall
above
average
worth
a
try
but
if
youve
had
a
fair
amount
of
great
divides
beers
it
might
be
the
letdown
it
was
for
me
a
little
odd
for
the
style
a
tasty
example
of
what
scotland
has
traditionally
had
to
offer
the
beer
world
big
malts
peat
smoke
and
alcohol
this
offering
displays
all
of
these
in
spades
except
gratifyingly
the
latter
the
north
of
15proof
booze
nowhere
near
the
radar
scope
maybe
not
a
repeat
choice
for
an
evenings
goings
on
but
nice
as
a
steeling
force
against
the
increasingly
inevitable
winter
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
actually
like
the
roasted
smokiness
of
this
but
you
know
the
rest
o
ive
come
to
the
realization
i
enjoy
this
style
a
lot
and
this
satiates
my
enjoyment
of
said
style
quite
well
really
good
dessert
beer
this
one
overall
this
is
a
great
value
for
a
darker
beer
that
is
sold
in
six
packs
nice
full
dark
flavors
in
a
semidrinkable
weight
for
a
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
touch
of
red
and
a
small
off
white
head
smell
is
roasty
with
biscuit
like
maltiness
there
is
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
is
caramel
and
roasted
barley
right
up
front
fades
to
a
very
sweet
finish
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
note
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
viscous
moderately
low
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
heavy
overall
this
is
a
nice
heavy
malt
forward
beer
definitely
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
rich
malty
beer
with
just
the
right
touch
of
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
presence
easy
enough
drinking
for
a
big
beer
even
with
the
fairly
high
abv
yes
its
noticeable
yet
the
malt
and
hops
do
an
excellent
job
of
keeping
things
balanced
and
enjoyable
pours
just
like
a
bourbon
and
cola
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissapates
to
a
wispy
swirl
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
ripe
dark
plumssweet
caramelcandied
figs
and
sweet
maltsthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
which
suits
and
has
tastes
of
ripe
dark
fruitsa
touch
of
smokey
peata
hit
of
boozy
heata
nice
reserved
touch
of
hops
and
finished
with
a
bittersweet
malty
finish
and
overall
yeah
its
nice
and
warming
for
a
cold
night
like
tonight
but
i
def
prefer
old
chub
cheers
overall
this
was
typical
of
a
wee
heavy
with
a
lot
of
malt
caramel
and
roasted
notes
this
was
earthy
sweet
and
full
of
malty
caramel
flavors
not
something
id
go
for
if
i
wanted
to
relax
or
session
but
its
still
a
pretty
good
beer
and
accomplishment
for
this
style
of
beer
one
id
purchase
again
would
make
for
pleasant
late
night
sipping
near
a
cozy
fireplace
overall
a
very
solid
scotch
ale
good
toasty
malt
taste
with
some
nice
undertones
of
spice
and
hops
o
well
balanced
malty
brew
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a

cellared
for
about
a
year
had
a
wee
little
amount
of

and
left
a
wee
little
bit
of

aroma
is
sweet
and
has
notes
of
cocoa
and
some
boozy
esters
taste
is
similar
with
some
additional
notes
of
coffee
and
tofee
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
just
a
slight
oil
slickness

coffee

taste
includes
all
of
the
above
with
a
touch
of
leather
and
bacon
very
tasty
and
quite
enjoyable
aged
very
gracefully
overall
this
is
very
nice
scotch
ale
offering
a
rounded
nuanced
potent
series
of
flavors
and
the
smoky
peats
are
excellently
integrated
into
the
breads
and
darker
fruits
worth
trying
overall
really
like
scotch
ales
and
this
is
no
exception
the
only
thing
that
would
make
this
better
is
if
it
had
smoked
peat
o
nice
for
the
style
the
malt
profile
is
spot
on
and
not
overdone
the
added
hop
character
in
this
particular
brew
brings
about
a
very
nice
balance
not
found
in
some
others
overall
this
is
pretty
good
definitely
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
which
i
generally
love
but
still
worth
a
single
bottle
purchase
for
a
try
poured
on
tap
at
the

is
very
mild
light

a

with

a
nice

scotch
ale
without
too
much
character
oappearance
lacked
slightly
but
still
pretty
solid
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
on
occasion
o
this
is
the
kind
of
scotch
ale
you
give
a
porter
fan
to
make
the
bridge
between
the
two
styles
the
roasted
malts
in
this
beer
for
me
distract
from
their
mission
to
transport
caramelbutterscotchtoffee
flavors
and
the
chocolate
notes
are
simply
outofplace
that
being
said
its
a
pretty
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
really
pretty
tasty
forget
what
its
supposed
to
be
and
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
a
robust
porter
dressing
up
as
a
scotch
ale
overall
a
good
sipper
slightly
more
booziness

i

come

its
still

good

and
i
never
had
great
divide
before
i
was
given
this
12
pack
for
christmas
overall
a
pleasant
venture
into
another
untried
brew
for
me
two
scotch
ales
in
a
row
i
do
like
the
style
partial
to
the
dopplebocks
and
looking
for
others
and
i
really
like
this
style
just
not
as
much
as
the
sweet
malty
dopples
but
i
imagine
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
and
they
would
be
awesome
with
a
shot
of
some
good
bourbon
or
really
good
whiskey
in
fact
a
good
evening
would
be
these
two
in
moderate
amounts
claymore
pours
out
a
redtinged
brown
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
muted
what
i
can
detect
is
some
maltiness
the
taste
brings
through
a
robust
slightly
prickly
maltiness
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
on
the
finish
its
pretty
relaxed
for
a
scotch
ale
but
its
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
hides
the
abv
very
well
overall
its
a
tasty
scotch
ale
i
like
the
style
with
more
aggression
personally
but
this
is
still
a
wellcomposed
beer
i
prefer
a
strong
overbearing
presentation
of
the
style
such
as
bannatyne
scotch
ale
from
cambridge
brewing
its
malty
and
smooth
without
being
overly
sweet
sometimes
scotch
ales
can
be
a
little
overthetop
but
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
yet
big
beer
this
beer
pours
up
a
beautiful
deep
mahogany
with
a
small
caramel
colored
head
a
small
ring
of
retention
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
was
minimal
but
i
mainly
picked
up
some
alcohol
and
soy
sauce
the
taste
was
very
salty
upfront
followed
by
notes
of
cola
coffee
toffee
caramel
and
a
minimal
amount
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
full
but
i
didnt
like
the
weak
aftertaste
though
weak
it
was
not
very
pleasant
overall
okay
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
o
my
first
beer
for
the
style
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
not
sure
where
this
one
ranks
for
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
bottle
from
gainesville
house
of
beer
pours
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
little
head
smells
like
chlorine
and
slight
scotch
to
me
but
my
nose
may
be
wrecked
from
gaving
an
oak
aged
yeti
right
before
nice
sweet
toffee
and
a
bit
of
scotch
some
light
peat
good
mouthfeel
slick
but
not
too
heavyperhaps
even
on
the
light
side
for
the
style
solid
scotch
ale
that
is
pretty
mellow
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
could
be
enjoyed
in
larger
quantities
than
others
in
the
style
otherwise
somewhat
unexciting
o
besides
a
weak
nose
this
provides
a
nice
malty
sweety
flavor
and
mouthful
per
style
that
is
surely
worth
a
taste
o
i
didnt
like
it
it
looked
great
sitting
there
in
my
glass
but
the
flavor
seemed
confused
othis
was
a
great
true
to
style
wee
heavy
i
have
to
admit
even
though
this
was
quite
to
style
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
sweeter
scotch
ale
the
color
is
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
scotch
and
the
smell
is
spectacular
i
am
slightly
let
down
with
the
taste
for
the
background
of
smoked
plums
and
raisins
it
begs
to
be
a
little
sweeter
great
smoked
character
in
smell
and
taste
which
might
not
be
expected
in
a
wee
heavy
but
was
certainly
appreciated
the
carbonation
might
have
been
just
a
little
high
for
my
taste
which
is
the
only
reason
this
beer
did
not
receive
a
5
for
all
categories
will
definitely
be
having
this
beer
again
in
the
future
thanks
again
to
the
guys
at
great
divide
o
very
good
beer
not
my
favourite
scotch
ale
but
then
again
i
live
in
colorado
and
this
has
to
compete
with
the
likes
of
oskar
blues
old
chub
and
grand
lake
brewerys
plaid
bastard
does
not
disappoint
given
the
high
standards
placed
upon
it
and
the
buzz
is
very
soothing

o
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
scotch
ale
it
is
extremely
complex
without
being
overly
boozie
o
this
is
a
damn
good
scotch
ale
its
pretty
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
doesnt
lose
out
on
feel
or
taste
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
poured
dark
ruby
red
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
foam
caramel
and
roasted
malt
dominates
the
nose
taste
is
toasted
toffee
malt
dark
fruits
subtle
chocolate
light
caramel
sweetness
medium
body
mildly
carbonated
slightly
warming
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
tasty
scotch
ale
ono
coffee
or
chocolate
notes
could
have
used
more
smokepeat
as
well
another
minus
was
the
lack
of
bitterness
overall
not
my
favorite
from
these
brewers
disappointing
after
tasting
what
immediately
became
my
favorite
beer
about
a
year
ago
titan
ipa
but
not
a
bad
beer
its
well
balanced
but
in
general
isnt
super
exciting
in
my
opinion
unfortunately
i
did
not
have
any
of
the
food
they
suggested
i
pair
it
with
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
alongside
my
cajun
fudge
brownie
a
must
have
reminds
me
of
an
russian
imperial
stout
very
well
built
by
a
respected
company
o
overall
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
nose
was
what
i
was
expecting
while
the
taste
had
some
nice
sweet
dark
fruit
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
not
sure
how
much
2
years
did
to
this
but
i
liked
it
would
have
it
again
o
this
had
a
brewed
on
label
of
may
3
2012
so
its
about
three
months
old
that
could
have
affected
carbonation
but
overall
i
enjoyed
it
its
not
the
first
scotch
ale
id
reach
for
but
id
have
zero
qualms
drinking
this
daily
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
i
think
it
would
shine

with

and
a

of
smoked

a
somewhat
drier
finish
than
i
expected
nicely
done
but
i
lean
towards
hibernation
for
a
malt
bomb
o
i
wasnt
impressed
the
head
was
nothing
much
to
speak
of
there
could
have
been
more
dark
fruit
and
caramel
malt
flavor
and
the
feel
could
have
been
a
bit
more
smooth
and
a
bit
more
warm
going
down
this
is
a
bit
different
than
i
would
expect
from
the
style
its
darker
and
has
more
roasted
malt
character
than
i
would
expect
missing
is
the
peat
and
butterscotch
notes
as
well
as
the
dark
amber
body
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
overall
a
bit
sweet
and
lacking
in
complexity
for
a
wee
heavy
its
got
a
good
malt
profile
but
the
dark
fruit
flavors
and
peaty
smoke
flavors
are
too
subtle
this
poured
a
thick
dark
roast
caramel
color
with
thin
lacing
i
thought
it
looked
ok
it
had
a
tart
sour
aroma
strongly
offputting
its
not
what
i
expected
i
thought
at
first
as
it
lacked
any
sort
of
malty
sweetness
or
an
expected
toasted
caramel
which
i
look
forward
to
in
my
scotch
ales
flavor
was
more
of
the
samebad
off
and
just
wrong
as
it
warmed
it
developed
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
vomitty
flavor
its
hard
to
tell
if
its
just
old
beer
or
a
quality
control
issue
unfortunately
drainpour
notes
even
though
its
a
wee
heavy
its
rather
drinkable
and
very
tasty
cheers
o
i
was
disappointed
with
the
other
3
brews
in
my
great
divide
brewers
pack
but
this
one
made
up
for
it
i
feel
i
have
found
a
diamond
in
the
rough
a
fine
scotch
ale
and
one
i
will
return
to
typically
the
only
scotch
ales
that
i
really
enjoy
are
peated
but
this
is
a
definite
exception
pretty
damn
good
o
this
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
not
a
personal
favorite
style
of
mine
but
the
aroma
is
great
very
drinkable
for
a
scotch
ale
nicely
drinkable
but
not
quite
as
good
as
id
hoped
ill
revisit
another
bottle
in
the
future
and
see
how
it
goes
o
enjoyable
to
drink
and
well
made
it
would
be
even
better
with
a
fuller
head
really
enjoyed
this
one
starting
to
really
get
into
this
style
o
not
fantastic
but
definitely
good
qualities
to
this
beer
warm
caramel
malts
are
tasty
it
might
be
my
glassware
but
the
appearance
was
very
disappointing
o
while
this
beer
may
be
entering
stout
catagory
it
is
bold
yet
balanced
with
a
brilliant
nose
and
good
flavors
its
malty
and
hoppy
and
very
roasty
it
is
a
very
robust
but
not
nearly
as
bitter
taste
as
others
of
the
style
it
is
unique
and
very
drinkable
this
goes
high
on
my
weeheavy
list
and
is
one
i
want
to
repeat
o
decent
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
it
was
a
little
underwhelming
for
me
in
comparison
to
other
wee
heavys
ive
enjoyed
not
bad
though
very
drinkable
for
sure
not
a
bad
beer
for
my
firstever
scotch
overall
it
was
decent
i
may
come
back
to
this
after
a
few
others
to
compare
d
i
like
this
beer
though
i
think
it
may
disappoint
fans
of
the
wee
heavy
style
another
solid
beer
from
great
divide
though
its
really
not
remarkable
or
special
very
dark
ruby
red
practically
black
in
appearance
short
tan
head
with
really
nice
lacing
oatmeal
rye
bread
watery
scotch
dark
chocolate
and
hints
of
coffee
beans
and
caramel
malt
smooth
rich
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
oats
on
the
initial
sip
flattened
oak
and
roasted
coffee
beans
with
a
nutty
rich
mouthfeel
dry
lightly
scotched
aftertaste
pours
a
deep
opaque
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
but
it
goes
away
pretty
soon
bit
of
caramelly
malt
on
the
nose
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
definitely
looking
for
more
here
must
say
that
the
beer
is
totally
tasty
and
drinkable
but
wanted
a
whole
lot
more
complexity
out
of
something
like
this
no
alcohol
burn
no
roast
no
toast
no
smoke
just
a
big
malty
beer
a
bit
of
hoppiness
for
balance
but
only
noticible
as
keeping
the
malt
from
becoming
cloying
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
isnt
as
flavorful
as
it
might
be
good
through
the
mouth
can
kick
it
back
easier
than
you
might
want
to
all
in
all
a
slightly
above
average
beer
nothing
is
bad
or
wrong
about
it
so
much
as
it
just
fails
to
stand
out
especially
for
a
style
with
some
room
to
play
with
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
overall
another
tasty
beer
from
gd
nothing
too
crazy
for
a
wee
heavy
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
and
wee
heavys
but
this
wasnt
my
favorite
by
any
means
i
might
have
had
high
expectations
but
this
wasnt
what
i
expected
just
not
my
favorite
brew
from
great
divide
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
has
nice
depth
of
flavor
and
is
easy
to
drink
at
the
same
time
i
would
have
this
one
again
for
sure
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
12
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
malty
with
some
roasty
notes
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
of
roastytoasty
malt
up
front
with
a
mild
burnt
caramel
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
with
a
tasty
malt
presence
in
both
smell
and
taste
poured
a
2
beige
head
with
an
unusual
extra
hue
id
liken
to
malted
chocolate
milk
the
body
is
a
dark
raw
umber
brown
almost
coffee
it
smells
very
rich
and
complex
in
the
malt
department
as
well
as
reminiscence
of
breakfast
cereal
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
and
theres
kind
of
a
chalky
cocoa
texture
which
personally
i
loved
average
length
finish
but
with
chocolate
malt
satisfaction
both
i
and
the
lady
of
the
house
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
overall
its
cool
that
they
did
something
new
in
the
scotch
ale
style
but
im
just
not
feeling
it
it
didnt
really
bring
the
richness
of
flavor
that
i
was
expecting
even
though
it
wasnt
lacking
flavor
by
any
means
review
from
notes
my
1st
great
divide
and
im
always
up
for
scotch
ale
so
i
took
a
flyer
on
this
six
pours
dark
almost
black
in
color
with
zero
head
into
dimpled
mug
smells
of
alcohol
malt
and
a
smokiness
with
a
bit
of
peat
as
well
as
dull
sweet
bread
full
malt
flavor
in
the
front
with
the
aforementioned
peat
like
smokiness
and
mellows
rather
quickly
without
any
real
mix
of
sweet
bread
or
dark
fruit
i
found
this
overall
to
be
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
style
not
very
complex
rather
average
though
im
willing
to
give
it
a
second
try
in
the
future
overallnot
a
bad
scotch
ale
in
the
least
very
drinkable
complex
and
not
too
much
of
a
bite
not
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
damn
good
i
have
yet
to
be
let
down
by
great
divide
poured
into
a
footed
stange
or
whatever
those
glasses
are
called
a
dark
muddy
rusty
brown
somewhat
translucent
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
within
a
minute
or
two
aroma
of
sweet
malts
roasty
dark
fruits
and
caramel
not
too
pronounced
taste
of
rich
caramel
malts
roasted
grains
and
nuts
brown
sugar
hints
of
earth
and
figs
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
and
i
dont
just
say
that
because
it
was
my
third
drink
of
the
night
i
really
loved
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
very
nice
overall
and
i
could
honestly
probably
sip
on
this
all
night
i
always
start
scotch
ales
with
a
bit
of
apprehension
that
theyre
going
to
be
too
hopped
thankfully
great
divide
has
used
restraint
in
the
right
way
here
smoked
peat
toasted
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
but
its
far
from
cloying
chocolate
raisins
and
some
wood
in
the
finish
hops
do
add
some
bitterness
but
they
are
kept
in
check
just
like
they
should
be
in
this
style
a
decent
beer
but
feels
kinda
bland
not
really
a
good
representation
of
a
scotch
ale
either
solid
not
must
try
clearly
an
american
take
on
the
style
but
respectful
enough
of
tradition
for
a
7
7
darker
ale
yeah
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
overall
a
great
brew
but
not
what
i
would
typically
expect
in
a
wee
heavy
i
e
no
dark
fruits
or
peat
o
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
goes
down
smoothly
o
little
heavy
in
flavorsrichness
for
drinking
multiples
but
i
will
certainly
be
enjoying
the
rest
of
the
6pack
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
this
would
pair
very
nicely
with
game
meats
o
this
was
my
first
wee
heavy
to
ever
try
it
wont
be
my
last
because
im
curious
to
see
what
other
recipes
deliver
in
this
style
i
was
somewhat
bored
with
this
particular
brew
however
it
was
for
sure
a
good
drinkable
beer
with
the
price
of
10
for
a
six
pack
i
will
look
else
where
for
a
better
example
not
as
aggressively
flavored
as
other
scotch
ales
but
the
flavors
are
classic
yet
modern
another
goodie
by
great
divide
no
peat
and
not
that
malty
milk
ballish
otherwise
a
pretty
solid
scotch
ale
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
aroma
the
sugars
and
malts
were
warm
and
inviting
while
the
smokiness
added
a
whole
other
dimension
to
the
aromatic
profile
that
said
we
wish
that
the
flavors
came
through
more
strongly
as
they
do
in
the
nose
additionally
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
a
thicker
less
watery
brew
in
the
end
the
beer
represents
the
style
and
is
a
nice
effort
comparatively
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
considering
this
is
only
the
second
scotch
ale
ive
liked
at
all
the
other
being
oskar
blues
old
chub
i
should
just
learn
to
never
question
great
divide
i
dig
great
divide
even
when
ive
sipped
on
styles
i
dont
like
i
recognize
that
theyve
done
an
above
average
job
i
love
a
malt
bomb
but
this
is
the
only
beer
of
theirs
i
dont
like
at
14six
pack
i
feel
ripped
off
this
poured
out
as
a
much
darker
color
than
i
expected
the
beer
is
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
good
with
a
strong
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
some
nice
earthy
amromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
good
caramel
base
with
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
some
earthy
peat
notes
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
on
the
thinker
side
it
was
very
smooth
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
would
drink
this
one
again
great
divide
claymore
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
i
have
finished
a
long
cycle
of
tasting
ipas
which
was
great
fun
switching
gears
i
am
now
sampling
darker
fare
porters
and
stouts
the
great
divide
claymore
scotch
ale
is
a
great
find
the
body
is
black
and
the
tan
head
fades
quickly
no
matter
the
aroma
is
wonderful
you
cannot
miss
the
roasted
malt
and
wisps
of
smoke
that
linger
above
the
glass
the
scotch
ale
is
very
smooth
on
the
palate
with
an
even
malt
flavor
throughout
and
the
long
pleasing
aftertaste
make
for
a
great
sipping
experience
nothing
bitter
acidic
or
unpleasant
here
highly
recommended
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
going
dark
ale
great
divide
has
a
number
of
off
the
beaten
path
offerings
that
are
really
good
and
the
claymore
scotch
ale
is
another
i
really
dont
have
much
more
to
say
on
this
one
at
106pack
its
a
weak
offering
among
alot
of
fantastic
beers
in
this
style
overall
while
it
may
look
like
your
average
stoutporter
theres
an
excellent
beer
waiting
underneath
that
seemingly
ordinary
appearance
this
is
my
first
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
and
i
loved
it
i
would
highly
recommend
checking
this
out
i
found
this
beer
lacking
in
many
areas
just
sitting
in
my
glass
it
looks
boring
and
dull
no
bubbles
no
life
some
beers
lack
carbonation
in
the
glass
and
then
liven
up
after
entering
the
mouth
not
this
one
dead
it
also
seems
watery
and
lacking
any
unique
flavor
punch
the
label
is
cool
moreys
bottom
line
i
found
this
to
be
rather
unique
and
more
flavorful
that
others
within
its
style
this
one
is
a
year
and
a
half
old
and
tasting
really
nice
consumed
withfor
breakfast
a
perfect
brew
for
such
an
occasion
the
beer
pours
a
very
deep
mahogany
hue
bordering
on
coffeeblack
and
is
capped
with
a
smattering
of
sudsy
offwhite
froth
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
lightly
sweet
and
plenty
roasty
offering
breakfasty
notes
including
maple
toast
chicory
and
even
a
hint
of
smokiness
to
approximate
bacon
refreshing
and
fuller
of
body
without
a
trace
of
alcohol
discernible
i
am
digging
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
thanks
to
brown
for
bringing
it
over
before
work
o
i
still
prefer
the
finesse
from
the
scottish
originals
this
strikes
me
more
as
overkill
of
a
good
thing
thanks
to
xraided81
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
bottled
on
jul
13
2010
pours
out
lookin
like
a
cola
real
dark
with
a
slight
fizzy
head
that
diapppears
quickly
smell
and
taste
go
hand
in
hand
with
this
beer
both
are
heavy
on
the
roasted
malt
some
chocolate
and
a
dark
fruit
sweetness
to
it
has
a
full
body
mouthfeel
with
a
good
balance
between
bitterness
and
carbonation
to
create
a
very
good
and
mellow
beer
this
is
only
my
second
wee
heavy
and
will
definatly
seek
out
more
overall
a
nicely
done
scotch
type
all
that
has
sold
malt
and
mild
fruit
flavors
that
hide
the
strength
o
wow
great
wee
heavy
brew
1st
time
with
this
style
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
brewery
never
dissapoints
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
cheers
overall
a
case
study
in
the
virtues
of
malt
in
a
world
ly
dominated
by
hop
monsters
this
beer
reminds
us
of
the
importance
of
the
subtleties
of
malted
grain
delicious
buy
it
overall
very
smooth
and
drinkable
great
divide
does
it
again
i
really
like
this
scotch
ale
this
is
possibly
my
new
favorite
scotch
ale
big
and
balanced
with
all
the
richness
youd
expect
not
sweet
like
some
can
be
super
drinkable
caramel
color
throws
me
off
a
little
because
this
tastes
a
lot
fuller
and
richer
than
it
looks
a
testament
to
visual
and
sensual
deception
in
a
positive
light
full
bodied
with
a
savory
aftertaste
of
burnt
sugars
and
tobacco
possibly
sensational
offering
from
great
divide
its
a
pretty
good
beer
much
closer
to
style
than
some
that
are
in
my
area
for
being
a
famous
scotch
ale
this
is
not
a
dark
hearty
thick
stout
but
its
not
a
bitch
beer
drink
it
play
a
round
of
golf
on
a
scottish
isle
and
shut
the
fuck
up
overall
this
wee
heavy
packs
a
taste
as
big
the
size
of
its
namesake
sword
the
malts
balance
well
with
the
peat
and
grassy
hops
it
is
a
good
example
for
anyone
looking
to
try
a
wee
heavy
that
is
worth
it
o
although
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
would
enjoy
drinking
this
any
time
for
the
abv
this
is
immensely
drinkable
dark
tan
head
that
fell
quickly
over
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlighted
beer
strong
malt
with
light
peat
and
smoke
in
the
nose
light
and
pleasant
some
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
as
well
all
of
the
nose
continues
cleanly
in
the
taste
with
the
fruit
increasing
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
for
the
style
overall
the
beer
is
well
done
and
perfectly
adequate
however
its
not
a
stellar
beer
thats
going
to
get
me
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
pours
dark
with
a
couple
finger
breadths
of
foam
that
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
malty
and
sweet
very
bold
tasting
robust
malted
beer
very
clean
mouthfeel
a
good
change
of
pace
i
have
enjoyed
all
the
offerings
from
gdbc
would
buy
again
overall
nice
and
tasty
and
bold
not
as
smooth
and
balanced
as
other
wees
this
one
is
more
booze
up
front
and
sweetness
later
good
beer
enjoyable
for
sure
o
pretty
drinkable
a
tad
sweet
but
overall
pretty
decent
overall
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
and
i
really
enjoy
this
one
great
balanced
drink
in
taste
i
must
say
jd
12
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
bottled
021011
pours
clear
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fairly
dense
1
finger
light
tan
head
with
decent
retention
that
reduces
to
a
lacing
ring
some
decent
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aromas
of
dark
fruits
molasses
caramel
spices
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
coffee
and
smoke
in
the
background
nice
complex
aromas
here
with
great
balance
taste
of
big
caramel
chocolate
molasses
and
roasted
flavor
in
the
front
that
leads
to
smokiness
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
booziness
in
the
back
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
is
noticed
in
the
back
on
the
finish
as
well
notes
of
caramel
molasses
and
roasted
flavors
linger
for
a
short
period
after
the
finish
surprisingly
smooth
and
creamy
body
that
drinks
easily
for
the
alcohol
level
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
body
fairly
strong
alcohol
warming
after
the
finish
with
very
little
noticed
in
the
taste
overall
a
great
wee
heavy
ale
probably
the
best
one
i
have
had
yet
o
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
great
divide
does
it
again
i
enjoyed
this
wee
heavy
and
would
recommend
it
even
if
its
not
on
the
top
of
my
to
have
again
soon
list
mouthfeel
very
smooth
very
drinkable
at
almost
8
percent
its
a
strong
one
for
a
6
pack
i
enjoyed
it
and
could
see
myself
getting
some
more
of
these
bought
this
one
in
mixed
6pack
12
claymore
12
colette
for
12
definitely
worth
a
try
great
divide
never
fails
to
put
out
solid
brews
overall
a
semi
mild
scotch
ale
with
the
right
flavors
creamy
and
easy
down
not
bad
decently
priced
at
10
bones
a
sixer
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
one
of
my
top
favorite
scotch
ales
for
interest
as
well
as
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
good
for
the
style
d
very
drinkable
rich
and
balanced
flavors
really
like
the
semiclean
finish
the
slightly
higher
than
average
7
7
abv
is
pretty
much
undetectable
super
smooth
beer
for
how
rich
the
flavors
are
d
not
a
bad
brew
is
fairly
rich
in
taste
o
this
being
only
my
second
in
this
style
probably
fell
slightly
short
to
founders
backwoods
bastard
good
brew
though
and
definitely
another
solid
offering
from
great
divide
i
dont
think
they
can
brew
wrong
o
although
not
my
favorite
category
i
would
gladly
have
another
one
of
these
d
a
sipper
for
me
but
certainly
a
good
one
gets
better
when
its
warmer
definitely
a
sipper
and
although
the
abv
is
relatively
modest
7
7
this
one
seems
stronger
somehow
solid
and
a
good
choice
for
the
style
smells
of
creamy
chocolate
i
have
to
say
the
look
of
this
beer
is
fierce
it
pours
near
black
with
almost
no
head
it
looks
like
a
beast
the
taste
however
is
shockingly
smooth
the
taste
is
very
creamy
smooth
and
has
a
rich
sweetness
i
was
very
surprised
i
have
really
started
to
like
the
beers
from
great
divide
o
i
like
scotch
ales
and
i
like
great
divide
somehow
this
one
doesnt
work
out
as
well
as
i
thought
it
would
try
founders
or
oskar
blues
or
dark
horse
for
a
better
scotch
ale
feels
very
full
in
body
moderately
carbonated
a
tad
creamy
and
barely
warm
in
the
end
this
is
about
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
as
of
yet
it
reminds
me
of
a
less
hoppier
dogfish
head
indian
brown
ale
that
isnt
dry
actually
thats
how
i
can
explain
this
beer
the
best
even
though
i
like
dogfish
heads
iba
better
because
it
has
more
of
that
earthy
hop
that
tastes
real
delicious
with
the
scotch
ale
caramel
creaminess
this
beer
still
has
all
those
qualities
too
and
its
delicious
this
is
a
quiet
sleeper
of
great
divide
its
a
beer
that
shoudl
definitely
get
some
more
attention
because
its
great
one
overall
this
is
one
of
the
finer
examples
of
the
scotch
alewee
heavy
style
that
ive
come
across
if
great
divide
could
figure
out
how
to
keep
the
alcohol
in
check
then
the
smell
and
taste
scores
for
me
would
go
up
to
4
5
and
the
mouthfeel
perhaps
too
and
this
would
be
nearly
an
a
beer
for
the
style
theres
a
lot
of
potential
in
this
beer
i
might
have
to
pick
up
a
sixpack
and
see
if
the
alcohol
is
more
subdued
in
the
bottle
d
i
could
easily
see
this
as
my
friday
nighter
then
off
to
bed
great
example
of
a
wee
heavy
bold
malts
balanced
just
enough
by
the
hops
and
smokiness
recommended
o
well
this
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
ive
enjoyed
different
smoke
beers
in
the
past
and
this
seems
to
be
the
dominant
piece
of
this
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
pull
it
off
if
im
looking
for
a
scotch
ale
ill
go
elsewhere
as
this
is
just
average
i
know
jack
about
beer
brewing
i
think
i
do
know
something
about
scotch
ale
however
this
one
is
well
its
one
of
the
worst
ive
had
bad
scotch
ales
taste
like
overboiled
peas
and
beans
this
one
tastes
like
that
plus
wet
dog
fur
or
maybe
its
wet
cat
fur
or
a
wet
wool
coat
that
hasnt
been
cleaned
in
three
seasons
and
could
really
really
use
a
good
cleaning
right
now
in
any
case
this
is
one
scotch
ale
to
avoid
i
had
a
headache
before
i
even
finished
the
bottle
if
you
want
a
good
american
sa
head
to
the
aisle
that
holds
founders
dirty
bastard
better
still
head
to
the
aisle
with
the
orkney
skull
splitter
its
a
very
dark
red
with
just
a
hint
of
light
at
the
edges
of
my
perfect
pour
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
spice
lit
cinnamon
the
taste
is
nicely
malted
sweet
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
caramel
the
body
seems
just
a
tad
thin
the
finish
is
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
worth
a
repeat
bottle
or
6
the
taste
is
very
good
i
like
how
the
malt
and
yeast
are
integrated
with
some
dark
fruit
notes
like
date
and
light
cocoa
with
some
woody
elements
as
well
the
flavor
brings
a
gentle
toasted
grain
which
also
comes
off
like
roasted
beans
but
is
not
really
bready
just
smooth
and
chewy
the
only
drawback
to
this
beer
for
me
is
it
lacks
a
little
in
the
complexity
factor
a
very
drinkable
beer
mind
you
and
i
found
it
to
have
a
very
well
hidden
7
7
abv
but
there
are
many
better
examples
out
there
imo
drink
good
as
usual
from
gdbc
very
smooth
and
easy
to
sip
on
md
average
dry
abrasive
mouthfeel
and
smokiness
would
keep
me
from
having
any
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
d
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
with
such
a
nice
malt
profile
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
d
altogether
a
well
rounded
beer
for
the
style
i
think
that
it
would
have
improved
from
a
little
less
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
slightly
dryer
finish
only
slightly
the
smoky
character
may
also
needed
to
be
turned
back
just
a
touch
certainly
would
get
this
one
again
though
cheers
dgreat
brew
from
great
divide
would
definitely
like
to
have
this
one
again
first
time
was
at
the
porter
bar
in
atlantaga
on
tap
great
divides
claymore
scotch
ale
is
to
borrow
a
term
from
mary
hirsch
a
rubber
sword
it
makes
a
point
without
drawing
blood
that
point
is
that
american
brewers
have
left
no
stone
unturned
and
are
by
now
brewing
all
styles
of
beer
as
well
or
in
many
cases
better
than
the
brewers
of
the
styles
originating
countries
themselves
overall
i
was
not
looking
forward
to
this
after
the
pour
and
nose
but
it
is
fantastic
look
forward
to
another
bottle
to
see
if
any
preconceptions
change
on
those
fronts
shes
a
dandy
drinkability
usually
wee
heavies
are
so
sweet
i
cant
drink
many
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
quite
balance
and
mellow
the
sweetness
is
there
but
not
dominate
i
think
i
could
have
another
just
fine
drinkability
decent
beverage
for
the
style
maybe
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
drinkability
excellent
ballance
of
toasty
malt
flavors
and
sweet
malt
makes
it
go
down
super
smooth
and
linger
delightfully
on
the
tongue
verdict
i
enjoyed
the
dark
fruits
and
buttery
taste
but
it
isnt
uncommon
to
find
that
in
a
lot
of
beers
while
the
taste
was
complex
it
didnt
respectfully
agree
with
my
taste
buds
drinkability
is
where
this
thing
shines
it
begins
to
taste
better
with
every
sip
simply
because
my
ability
to
discern
overall
flavor
profile
tends
to
diminish
after
even
just
a
beer
and
since
the
flavors
of
chocolate
chip
cookies
and
brandy
are
pretty
delicious
i
can
see
myself
wanting
another
at
the
end
of
the
night
this
after
all
has
a
unique
flavor
one
that
i
may
enjoy
at
other
times
its
just
that
i
always
scrutinize
my
first
beer
of
the
night
and
challenge
it
to
make
me
enjoy
it
beer
always
tastes
different
depending
on
the
situation
and
i
think
this
beer
is
just
not
a
sipper
that
is
meant
to
be
distilled
of
its
flavors
its
meant
to
be
in
a
pint
glass
and
gulped
with
friends
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
the
appearance
is
inviting
although
a
bit
too
dark
for
being
so
low
on
the
alcohol
side
of
a
wee
heavy
it
is
a
120
schilling
looking
80
schilling
beer
regardless
it
is
definitely
great
tasting
d
the
brew
was
pretty
drinkable
but
was
just
an
average
wee
heavy
d
particularly
drinkable
despite
the
heaviness
and
abv
o
despite
blunted
edges
this
claymore
is
definitely
forged
from
a
complex
composite
that
creates
an
intimidating
impression
and
is
definitely
worth
wielding
again
d
undecided
i
was
somewhat
full
when
i
drank
this
beer
but
although
it
tasted
delicious
i
cant
tell
how
many
i
would
be
able
to
drink
it
is
thick
and
sweet
and
bitter
i
dont
know
how
long
i
would
be
able
to
drink
it
not
as
sweet
as
expected
certainly
more
on
the
bready
side
somewhat
dissapointing
i
always
have
high
expectations
from
great
divide
so
i
wont
hold
it
against
them
still
a
beer
im
sure
someone
can
really
enjoy
its
not
bad
i
just
wasnt
crazy
about
it
claymore
is
a
good
ale
dont
get
me
wrong
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
like
many
micros
great
divide
dumbs
down
a
classic
style
d
very
nice
balanced
beer
a
little
on
the
thick
side
and
boozy
aftertaste
nice
for
a
sipper
served
in
a
tulip
glass
claymore
pours
a
near
black
color
with
slight
brown
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
as
it
is
poured
into
the
glass
it
generates
a
nice
amount
of
creamy
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
brew
leaves
a
scattered
amount
of
lacing
around
the
glass
which
i
have
found
to
be
typical
of
the
style
claymore
scotch
ale
has
an
overall
scent
of
deep
malts
possibly
coffee
malts
and
dark
roasted
nutty
scents
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
not
exactly
what
ive
come
to
expect
of
the
style
but
that
being
said
it
is
not
in
anyway
unpleasant
the
initial
taste
is
that
of
deep
malts
with
a
slight
molasses
note
backed
by
roasted
nut
hues
as
the
brew
finishes
more
of
the
woody
flavors
and
a
very
slight
scotch
note
work
their
way
onto
the
pallet
there
is
very
little
alcohol
burn
which
really
helps
it
drink
easily
the
brew
is
very
smooth
on
the
pallet
and
has
a
nice
complexity
of
flavors
overall
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
more
scotch
notes
in
the
scent
and
even
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
but
i
did
find
the
brew
to
be
quite
pleasant
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
that
disappears
almost
instantaneously
scent
is
definitely
malty
with
some
caramel
aromas
and
dark
fruits
i
also
pick
up
a
bit
of
toffee
and
roasted
scents
taste
is
initially
roasted
malt
followed
by
toffee
and
caramel
then
i
definitely
get
the
biscuit
flavor
with
a
bit
of
roastedbitter
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
alcohol
at
the
end
i
havent
had
too
many
weeheavys
but
one
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind
would
be
founders
dirty
bastard
and
that
was
sooo
much
better
other
than
that
and
belhaven
i
cant
think
of
much
to
compare
it
to
mouthfeel
is
sorta
rich
and
somewhat
creamy
drinkability
is
fair
as
it
is
a
tasty
beer
but
maybe
just
not
my
favorite
particular
style
as
of
right
now
medium
bodied
but
on
the
lighter
end
with
slight
bitter
hop
presence
up
font
along
with
subtle
roasted
malt
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
as
some
alcohol
sweetness
and
biscuit
slight
astringency
with
alcohol
heat
dry
finish
d
i
wouldnt
mind
pickin
a
6
of
this
some
day
or
some
singles
ive
had
wayyy
better
scotchs
in
my
day
dark
horses
scotty
karate
dont
know
if
it
came
from
the
brewery
this
way
or
if
the
lines
at
the
ale
house
were
dirty
either
way
i
need
to
have
it
again
somewhere
else
to
really
know
d
a
timid
middleroad
scotch
ale
that
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
scottish
export
than
a
weeheavy
certain
qualities
of
this
beer
are
briefly
offputting
but
in
the
end
it
satisfies
especially
in
the
company
of
savory
food
a
very
good
scotch
ale
borders
on
being
too
sweet
but
it
holds
the
line
nice
showcase
of
woodsy
flavors
i
am
disappointed
that
they
dont
distribute
this
beer
to
ny
verdict
not
worth
tracking
down
and
a
somewhat
pedestrian
effort
it
is
a
scotch
ale
worthy
of
a
try
but
ive
had
better
d
if
youre
looking
for
a
cold
weather
beer
that
isnt
a
stout
or
porter
this
is
a
great
option
very
impressive
i
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
experience
any
wee
heavy
beers
and
am
enjoying
this
one
will
definitely
seek
out
more
in
this
style
a
decent
scotch
ale
but
doesnt
quite
compare
to
dirty
bastard
1
on
ba
for
scotch
ale
at
the
moment
and
my
goto
scotch
ale
although
i
would
love
to
try
their
sappy
slappy
bastard
which
sounds
even
better
overall
very
solid
wee
heavy
another
solid
offering
from
great
divide
i
would
recommend
trying
it
just
a
delicious
beer
has
a
rich
thick
aroma
that
is
strongly
yeasty
and
a
little
fruity
and
malty
it
pours
a
barely
translucent
light
chocolate
brown
with
a
pale
tan
head
flavor
is
malty
yeasty
and
fruity
like
thick
unpasteurized
apple
juice
with
just
a
hint
of
semisweet
chocolate
smooth
rather
thick
texture
had
a
nice
fizz
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
for
the
price
i
will
probably
not
purchase
this
again
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on

of

pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
some
lacing
beer
smells
somewhat
earthy
with
roasted
malts
tastes
alot
like
it
smells
earthy
boozey
and
roasted
malts
not
too
much
going
on
here
its
an
alright
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
one
way
or
the
other
im
a
big
fan
of
great
divide
and
i
can
think
of
a
bunch
of
their
beers
id
grab
before
i
picked
up
this
one
again
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
especially
for
its
price
id
buy
this
again
if
given
the
option
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
brown
with
a
small
shortlived
tanned

aroma
is

some
dark

not
cloying
taste
is
toasted

dark
fruit
chocolate
and
some
molasses
long
finish
of
fruit
and
chocolate
tasty
brew
d
overall
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
again
some
would
say
adequate
i
will
say
mediocre
its
rougher
than
id
like
forget
the
claymore
to
fix
things
here
a
steamroller
would
be
more
appropriate
very
enjoyable
beer
would
drink
again
probably
wouldnt
pay
what
i
paid
for
this
again
however
17

in

cty
maryland
expensive
due
mainly
to
locale
and
beer
store
drinkability
this
one
went
really
fast

for
a
dark
heavy
beer
4
55
fingers
worth
of
rich
brown
color
full
range
of
bubble
sizes
with
poor
retention
lacing
fares
just
slightly
better
the
liquid
is
a
very
deep
brown
but
does
avoid
blackness
fully
opaque
you
get
some
amber
red
to
orange
tint
around
the
rims
the
nose
is
not
especially
heavy
but
it
sure
is
sweet
loaded
with

butterscotch
maple
syrup
caramel

up
appreciably

beer
not
paying

thats
for
sure
nowhere
close

hides

well
but
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
drinkability
is
really
very
good
with
a
complex
yet
pleasing
taste
and
an
exceptional
mouthfeel
definitely
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
tried
thus
far
and
yet
another
excellent
brew
from
the
guys
at
great

d
easy
to

however
has
a
decently
high
abv
sweetness
can
be
a
bit
much
at

overall
definitely
recommended
for
people
into

good
d
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
despite
a
higher
abv
it
is
easy
to
drink
not
overly
sweet
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
rather
odd
beer
but
tastes
quite
good
the
flavors
here
produce
a
rather
dry
wee
heavy
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
pours
an
opague
dark
brown
with
tinges
of
red
around
the
edges
the
head
is
a
rocky
light
brown
which
subsides
with
time
aroma
is
caramel
and
malt
with
no
hint
of
hops
a
very
slight
fruitiness
is
also
present
carbonation
is
fairly
low
and
appropirate
for
such
a
big
beer
taste
is
fairly
dry
with
lots
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
for
a
fairly
big
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
a
very
worthy
beer
but
not
the
most
impressive
wee
heavy
that
ive
tasted
bigger
bodied
with
a
smooth
thick
feel
a
nice
warmerupper
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
but
it
borders
on
porter
more
than
scotch
ale
lots
of
dark
malts
especially
chocolate
such
a
dark
demeanor
to
the
beer
i
think
i
should
get
a
bottle
and
age
it
to
see
how
it
goes
d
sweet
malts
are
very
inviting
and
makes
this
easy
to
keep
drinking
pours
a
very
dark
almost
burnt
brown
color
that
produces
a
small
yet
creamy
off
white
head
almost
looks
like
a
stout
at
this
point
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
has
that
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
like
quality
very
rich
and
enticing
the
flavor
profile
is
very
nice
and
has
a
good
scottish
style
maltiness
to
it
there
is
a
distinct
spicy
texture
and
flavor
to
it
very
viscous
and
perfectly
carbonated
for
my
liking
this
time
of
year
overall
this
is
a
home
run
and
really
a
great
buy
pours
a
super
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
almost
black
in
color
small
tan
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
primarily
of
molasses
and
fresh
soil
taste
is
rich
toffee
up
front
with
a
bit
of
rye
bread
in
the
middle
and
a
buttery
leafy
finish
quite
sweet
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
low
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
very
little
detectable
alcohol
this
is
a
smooth
sipper
that
i
would
certainly
get
again
d
definate
drinkability
not
heavy
alchohol
taste
im
a
sucker
for
a
sweet
beer
and
this
one
has
it
in
spades
i
do
normally
like
my
scotch
ales
a
bit
more
peaty
but
this
is
good
too
an
absolutely
fantastic
mouthfeel
it
has
a
creaminess
just
short
of
a
glass
of
milk
and
very
enjoyable
for
this
type
of
beer
d
i
would
almost
never
say
high
for
a
7
brew
but
this
one
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
or
tiring
on
the
palate
another
fine
offering
from
great
divide
d
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
if
it
was
offered
to
me
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
however
i
dont
see
myself
searching
for
this
one
again
nothing
too
amazing
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easy
slightly
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
sipper
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
d
delicious
beer
seems
to
be
smokier
than
the
few
wee
heavies
i
have
had
before
and
also
more
of
a
milky
character
not
too
filling
for
such
a
rich
tasting
beer
d
w00t
but
not
spectacular
note
the
taking
for
grantedness
a
top
for
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
middlin
scotch
ale
far
from
my
favorite
its
still
a
drinkable
malty
treat
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
such
d
nice
scotch
ale
great
divide
does
another
great
job
with
yet
another
style
d
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
lighter
batch
in
one
heavier
in
another
or
if
this
beer
gets
boozier
with
age
but
i
defiantly
like
it
fresh
since
it
has
more
of
a
coffee
tone
that
covers
the
abv
will
try
it
and
find
it
again
with
hopefully
less
than
2
months
age
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
all
the
flavors
blended
beautifully
you
might
spend
a
little
more
for
the
6pack
than
you
would
any
other
6pack
of
craft
brews
but
its
a
6pack
you
cant
back
away
from
id
love
to
include
this
in
a
tasting
among
others
of
the
style
i
do
enjoy
this
brew
i
do
feel
the
finish
lacks
a
bit
of
linger
but
it
wouldnt
keep
me
from
exploring
it
more
i
got
this
as
a
part
of
a
mixed
sixpack
and
was
disappointed
with
many
of
the
beers
that
came
in
it
the
scotch
ale
however
was
somewhat
of
an
exception
it
was
pretty
much
everything
you
would
expect
or
want
from
a
scotch
ale
good
maltyspicy
aroma
great
flavor
nice
light
head
to
contrast
the
dark
caramel
colored
beer
a
must
try
for
scotch
ale
lovers
very
flavorful
brew
stands
up
with
the
best
strong
dark
ales
slightly
sweet
nice
and
malty
and
definitely
has
some
subtle
scotch
and
chocolate
overall
very
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
just
a
great
overall
drink
lots
of
subtle
flavors
that
pairs
great
with
some
great
food
taste
is
similar
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
but
finishes
with
a
more
complex
semi
dry
hint
of
toasted
nuts
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
a
greater
level
of
carbonation
than
i
had
originally
anticipated
and
could
be
dialed
back
in
my
opinion
fairly
drinkable
given
its
alcohol
content
and
an
all
around
good
beer
comes
short
of
the
exceptional
characteristics
found
in
some
of
great
divides
other
brews
i
definitely
expected
the
roasted
malt
properties
of
this
beer
to
better
balance
out
the
malt
sweetness
but
it
was
not
the
case
this
was
just
good
beer
nothing
crazy
or
over
the
top
in
either
a
poor
or
great
way
but
overall
im
glad
i
sampled
it
overall
those
looking
for
a
true
weeheavy
might
be
a
bit
thrown
off
by
the
porterlike
characteristics
that
are
present
in
this
beer
but
those
simply
looking
for
a
good
beer
will
not
be
disappointed
give
this
one
a
try
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
almost
opaque
black
with
a
quickly
diminishing
head
aroma
is
dark
malts
with
a
slight
bit
of
roast
the
taste
is
a
nice
dark
malts
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
even
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
d
solidly
average
im
sure
there
are
better
examples
of
a
wee
heavy
this
ismy
first
foray
into
the
style
i
can
see
the
attraction
but
this
particular
beer
didnt
quite
take
for
me
claymore
scotch
ale
calls
itself
a
wee
heavy
and
thats
probably
a
good
description
it
could
benefit
from
a
tad
heavier
malt
profile
though
its
in
no
way
a
bad
beer
overall
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
found
d
an
enjoyable
beer
but
it
could
be
better
it
tasted
like
it
was
so
close
to
being
great
but
just
fell
a
little
bit
short
a
bit
heavy
on
the
malt
side
to
be
extremely
drinkable
for
me
the
medium
body
had
a
good
thick
stickiness
to
it
and
the
finish
was
dry
given
the
7
7
abv
this
one
is
incredibly
drinkable
man
do
i
really
really
really
miss
mcewens
now
searching
for
a
new
scotch
ale
to
fall
in
love
with
ive
been
trying
them
all
old
chub
from
dales
has
been
my
go
to
so
far
so
this

i
thought
id
try
claymore
since
it
finally
showed
up
here
poured
a
nice
caramel
tawny
golden
brown
some
head
but
not
much
tasted
sweet
and
roasty
some
bite
but
more
of
a
malty
mouthful
but
after
10
min
no
head
and
flat
what
a
huge
disappointment
drinkability
very
solid
scotch
ale
all
around
even
if
not
too
complex
and
a
trifle
thin
recommended
one
of
the
finest
looking
and
tasting
american
versions
of
a
scotch
ale
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
had
a
pour
from
the
gd
tap
room
and
was
very
impressed
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
with
dense
mocha
head
lots
of
roasted
malt
character
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
roasted
coffee
notes
flavor
profile
focuses
primarily
on
the
malt
here
with
dense
malt
flavors
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
in
the
background
finishes
clean
with
a
hint
of
hop
presence
wish
the
feel
was
a
bitter
rounder
and
denser
but
this
one
really
great
and
stands
up
to
the
best
of
em
a
gently
softer
smoother
more
rounded
quality
is
possibly
the
only
thing
preventing
the
feel
from
being
spot
on
its
not
big
and
lipsmacking
and
its
not
slick
and
thin
it
has
some
pull
to
it
tight
compact
touch
of
viscosity
very
nice
ill
be
back
this
is
a
very
good
wee

something
i
really
enjoyed
and
would
recommend
d
fantastic

and
a
pleasure
to

a
best

a
thick
frothy

that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
really
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
peated
and
roasted
malts
its
sweet
with
a
light
smokey
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
rich
malty
flavor
that
borders
on
sweet
but
finishes
with
a
slightly
dry
peated
edge
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
it
has
excellent
malt
character
and
a
smooth
finish
this
was
a
new
style
for
me
though
i
am
very
much
looking
forward
to
trying
more
representations
of
it
in
the
future

definitely
not
my

guess

good

had
this

tiger
in

poured
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
into
a
pint
glass
with
two
fingers
of
beige
head
and
excellent
lacing
smelled
very
bready
toasty
and
yeasty
with
only
a
tiny
hint
of
molasses
the
flavor
didnt
reveal
much
else
either
with
an
overwhelming
breadybiscuity
essence
and
a
dry
finish
this
beer
could
certainly
benefit
from
a
little
more
flavor
balance
from
the
smell
and
appearance
i
expected
the
body
to
be
thicker
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
it
medium
smooth
and
mildly
carbonated
i
wouldnt
attempt
to
session
this
unless
the
flavor
balance
is
tweaked
a
little
but
the
body
feel
does
help
this
beers
drinkability
easy
enough
to
drink
but
very
filling
very
drinkable
scotch
ale
i
could
see
enjoying
this
beer
alongside
a
nice
steak
and
potatos
dish
for
sure
dvery
full
bodied
but
still
very
drinkable
the
aftertaste
throws
me
a
bit
since
i
cant
really
pinpoint
what
it
is
but
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
d
good
brew
not
sure
id
have
more
than
a
few
though
as
it
would
catch
up
to
me
quick
d
the
higher
abv
is
undetectable
and
this
beer
drinks
very
smoothly
for
the
style
overall
a
good
scotch
ale
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
for
some
reason
i
have
had
a
negative
association
with
scotch
ales
im
pretty
sure
its
the
word
scotch
that
just
turned
me
off
because
of
the
drink
by
the
same
name
and
not
that
i
dislike
scotch
but
because
of
the
thought
of
having
hot
alcohol
flavor
in
my
beer
totally
stupid
i
knowso
i
have
always
steered
away
from
them
glad
i
didnt
totally
give
up
on
them
this
is
the
2nd
or
3rd
wee
heavy
scotch
ale
ive
tried
and
really
liked
it
right
up
there
with
orkneys
skullsplitter
a
black
mahogany
color
with
a
decent
oatmeal
colored
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
brings
alcohol
malt
and
bayberry
hop
not
bad
but
not
impressing
me
much
yet
the
flavor
is
a
tangy
maple
syrup
and
juniper
malt
alcohol
is
pretty
intrusive
here
and
not
entirely
to
my
liking
as
it
seems
like
the
astringent
qualities
are
knocking
out
the
malt
sweetness
its
grassy
and
medicinal
to
me
chemical
hilights
medium
bodied
and
very
lazily
carbonated
it
has
a
somewhat
silky
but
limp
feel
soapy
sweet
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
a
disappointment
from
great
divide
especially
for
a
normally
exotic
style
like
this
vaguely
drinkable
pours
a
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
doesnt
retain
particularly
well
but
that
seems
typical
for
a
scotch
ale
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
smokiness
initially
along
with
salty
bacon
burnt
bread
toffee
and
molasses
some
dark
fruits
fig
and
date
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
similarly
has
an
intense
smoky
character
upfront
with
notes
of
bacon
and
peat
along
with
some
blackstrap
molasses
burnt
bread
plum
and
fig
treacle
tobacco
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
very
solid
scotch
ale
a
little
on
the
smoky
side
but
im
sure
that
floats
some
peoples
boat
a
medium
to
full
bodied
heavy
hitter
yum
this
brew
is
perhaps
a
bit
heavy
and
rich
to
session
but
i
could
easily
knock
back
several
solid
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
so
i
wait
to
finish
the
glass
body
is
only
medium
and
id
actually
like
more
alcohol
feelflavor
here
to
balance
all
the
sweet
malt
but
there
is
little
to
quibble
with
here
for
a
sipping
style
this
is
remarkably
drinkable
done
more
please
very
creamy
mouthfeel
smooth
d
i
think
this
is
an
easy
wee
heavy
its
much
more
approachable
and
palatable
than
many
others
of
this
style
that
doesnt
mean
its
among
the
best
overall
another
great
one
from
great
divide
probably
not
my
favorite
but
still
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
and
i
would
do
so
again
d
drinkable
though
i
dont
know
how
much
after
the
first
one
rich
and
malty
a
bit
of
abv
but
it
tastes
so
good
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissapated
quickly
nose
has
hints
of
smoked
peat
and
carmalized
malts
taste
is
big
on
carmalized
smoked
malts
slightly
sweet
but
not
cloying
finish
is
slightly
dry
with
light
hop
action
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
moderately
carbonated
and
fairly
smooth
overall
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
it
drinks
easy
i
wanted
to
try
this
brew
when
it
came
out
in
09
but
could
not
find
until
i
visited
my
old
beer
guy
jonpols
store
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
and
i
would
try
again
less
sweet
than
most
scotch
ales
in
fact
id
describe
this
as
a
unhopped
porter
neutral
body
and
carbonation
easytodrink
but
overall
uninteresting
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
for
the
style
but
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
beer
but
i
wish
they
would
have
called
it
something
else
by
giving
it
the
scotch
ale
label
they
are
setting
up
expectations
they
cant
meet
heck
id
rate
this
beer
higher
if
they
called
it
something
nondescript
like
a
dark
ale
however
expectations
are
a
big
part
of
the
taste
experience
very
dark
in
coloralmost
porter
looking
might
be
a
tad
dark
for
the
style
but
stll
a
good
lookin
brew
extremely
malty
aromahints
of
caramel
and
a
very
mild
roasted
quality
to
it
whisper
of
smoke
very
malty
flavor
upfront
has
a
great
carameltoffee
like
quality
slight
hop
bite
body
is
right
there
with
the
flavor
and
the
style
dangerously
drinkablea
great
wee
heavy
certainly
not
balls
to
the
wall
on
the
alcohol
scale
like
some
well
balanced
and
very
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
quaffable
for
sure
but
these
are
sippin
beers
will
have
another
next
week
great
divide
has
never
failed
me
in
any
of
their
beers
ive
tried
and
im
happy
to
say
that
they
didnt
disappoint
me
this
time
either
this
stands
proudly
alongside
such
delicious
brews
as
hercules
double
ipa
and
yeti
imperial
stout
feeldrink
nice
thick
mouthfeel
really
nice
drinkablity
is
right
on
i
enjoyed
4
out
of
the
6
already
d
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
wish
i
had
a
few
more
the
malt
is
smooth
and
heavy
with
a
sugary
flavor
that
soon
gives
way
to
the
smoky
malt
flavor
the
sweet
flavor
in
the
beer
is
really
well
balanced
with
smokiness
and
a
slightly
bitter
hop
edge
in
the
after
taste
in
the
end
the
overall
taste
is
good
but
i
doubt
its
the
best
but
since
im
new
to
this
style
mostly
i
have
to
say
i
want
more
and
that
this
is
good
mouth
feel
is
heavy
rich
and
smooth
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
fireplace
as
do
many
poorly
interpreted
american
versions
also
the
appropriate
lower
level
of
carbonation
really
gives
it
a
soft
inviting
mouthfeel
nothing
drives
me
nuts
more
than
american
breweries
that
brew
a
nonamerican
style
and
then
fail
to
nail
the
carbonation
level
cheers
to
great
divide
for
emulating
a
classic
style
perfectly
pours
black
topped
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
airy
brown
foam
aromas
of
dark
malt
molasses
and
burnt
sugar
with
a
just
a
hint
of
peat
smoke
and
cream
on
the
palate
the
peat
smoke
is
immediately
noticeable
from
the
first
sip
dominating
all
else
up
front
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
i
get
some
coffee
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
fine
for
the
style
alcohol
content
is
understandably
hindering
in
that
area
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
though
a
bit
more
nose
would
bump
its
allure
a
bit
a
gorgeous
dark
beauty
thats
meant
to
be
savored
but
which
begs
to
be
quaffed
quite
nice
d
a
great
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
normally
dont
like
much
butter
or
banana
in
my
wee
heavies
but
this
brew
keeps
it
in
the
background
being
one
of
the
handful
of
good
scotch
ales
in
america
i
highly
recommend
grabbing
one
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
were
excellent
and
blended
really
well
together
for
a
very
very
good
beer
appears
a
deep
cola
brown
in
the
body
with
a
light
khaki
tan
head
forming
thick
carbonation
seems
a
bit
lively
but
it
does
last
a
good
while
dwindling
down
nice
and
slow
scattered
speckled
lacing
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
my
chalice
aromatics
come
with
sweet
caramel
and
plum
and
raisin
notes
earthy
and
herbal
hops
with
a
touch
of
peated
smoked
malt
even
a
bit
of
dark
powdered
cocoa
edges
come
off
with
some
toasted
nuttiness
maybe
its
the
yeast
and
malt
playing
together
flavors
build
upon
each
other
nicely
deep
with
malt
character
plums
dark
fruits
with
caramel
and
a
bit
of
booze
mild
smoked
malt
and
with
dark
chocolate
herbal
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
just
enough
to
balance
it
out
booze
is
there
but
doesnt
overburden
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
easy
going
medium
bodied
sturdy
but
not
overdone
in
carbonation
not
off
flavors
left
behind
drinkability
is
decent
a
good
beer
to
go
with
some
rustic
wild
game
a
nice
bison
steak
and
this
beer
could
befriend
one
another
drink
on
its
on
but
id
only
be
good
for
a
max
of
23
12
ounce
portions
claymore
is
a
good
but
by
no
means
great
scotch
ale
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
spot
on
and
the
heat
is
nice
but
the
feel
is
only
soso
and
the
weak
aroma
doesnt
help
anything
really
only
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
cant
find
a
superior
instantiation
of
it
in
the
store
or
on
the
menu
drinkable
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
watching
curling
on
the
tv
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
im
surprised
by
how
unique
and
quaffable
this
is
my
only
experience
with
scotch
ales
has
been
that
they
are
syrupy
and
cloying
this
is
not
the
case
though
its
still
on
the
heftier
end
of
beers
i
questioned
this
being
a
yearround
beer
and
the
porter
being
discontinued
but
i
think
this
substitute
is
bold
enough
and
unique
enough
to
make
it
worthy
really
impressed
with
this
beer
by
great
divide
claymore
is
an
interesting
beer
i
like
it
very
much
the
porter
like
character
was
unexpected
but
very
appreciated
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
great
divide
seldom
dissapoints
let
this
ale
warm
so
as
to
maximize
the
flavour
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
malts
roasted
just
a
tad
too
much
i
put
this
somewhere
between
old
chub
pretty
good
and
dirty
bastard
excellent
i
do
prefer
claymore
to
the
st
bridgets
it
replaces
dark
brown
almost
black
not
much
head
rich
malty
smell
and
a
smoky
malty
taste
easily
fits
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
being
darn
near
8
good
stuff
but
i
really
dont
need
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
im
not
sure
why
this
is
going
yearround
but
it
must
sell
well
for
7

may
not
be
one
of
the
sexier

but
its
as
solid
as
a

if
you
have
any
interest
in
the
style
this
would
be
a
great
place
to
start
and
if
the
strongly
rumored
changes
to
the
iowa

laws
come
to
pass
i
might
even
be
able
to
buy
it

with
a
multitude
of
flavors

be
enjoyed
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
drinkability
is
high
because
of
the
clean

sweet
flavor
this
beer
is
certainly
quaffable

would
prefer
to
enjoy
it

6
oz
sampling
poured
dark
brown
with

thin
beige
head
aromas
were
slightly
fruity
some
butterscotch
but
had
a
strange
rancid
aroma
that
was
difficult
to
describe
tastes
were
malty
with
butterscotch
notes
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
very
sweet
finishes
sweet
with
no
bitterness
and
a
mild
taste
of
caramel
with
some
offflavors
resembling
the
aroma
mentioned
earlier
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
one
as
far
as
resembling
the
style
i
feel
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
but
the
flavors
just
werent
right
for
me
i
am
honestly
impressed
with
this
one
granted
its
not
a
fresh
bottle
and
i
would
like
to
try
one
but
i
think
this
tastes
better
than
a
fresh
bottle
would
i
like
that
the
bitterness
has
dropped
off
and
the
smokey
malts
shine
through
a
good
offering
from
a
great
brewery
pours
near
black
in
color
with
a
finger
of
head
smell
is
bread
right
out
of
the
toaster
with
some
caramel
drizzled
on
top
taste
is
slightly
ashy
which
is
unfortunate
a
bit
sweet
with
lots
of
bread
and
caramel
malt
qualities
medium
bodied
this
one
isnt
too
bad
but
the
ashiness
detracts
from
the
drinkability
this
has
too
much
black
patent
malt
tilting
it
towards
a
smokey
tipple
a
bit
high
on
the
carbination
as
well
doubtfull
ill
buy
again
too
many
others
that
deliver
the
malty
silkiness
i
associate
and
appreciate
in
this
style

strong

comes
through
with

dark

notes
including
ripe

first
sip
shows
a
hint
of
smoke
quickly
yielding
to
a
very
sweet
palate
full
of
silky
fruit
this
fruit
feel
is
a
mix
of
sweet
grape
juice
raisins
plum
and
some
backround
spice
overall
this
is
quite
sweet
with
a
smokey
balance
but
it
is
almost
to
sweet
it
is
a
bit
scattered
on
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
solid

solid
choice
in
the
usmade
scotchwee
heavy
category
plenty
of
flavor
longlasting
some
happy
accidents
develop
along
the
way
to
make
things
interesting
one
id
be
happy
to
have
again
thanks
for
the
bottle
john
the
brew
is
tasty
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
it
is
almost
a
bit
like
a
winter
warmer
which
is
what
i
wasnt
looking
for
decent
brew
more
of
a
sipper
then
an
all
nighter
a
very
underrated
style
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
red
color
huge
off
white
foamy
head
to
it
get
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
nose
and
a
hint
of
booziness
taste
is
just
magically
smooth
great
body
and
mouthfeel
to
this
beer
nice
roastiness
flavor
to
it
a
bit
hot
on
alcohol
on
the
swallow
which
i
dont
really
mind
although
some
people
may
find
it
a
negative
thing
incredibly
well
balanced
and
fairly
drinkable
for
a
higher
abv
beer
ive
liked
everything
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
especially
this
one
give
it
a
try
poured
from
a
bottle
i
received
in
trade
from
dwennis
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
has
a
very
dark
ruby
color
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
but
it
is
in
clumps
not
uniform
around
the
glass
i
can
smell
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
mild
bourbon
there
is
some
hop
in
the
taste
but
ot
is
not
bitter
there
is
also
some
mellow
caramel
sweetness
that
is
quite
tasty
you
can
also
taste
some
alcohol
at
the
end
which
provides
some
warmth
very
nice
like
a
good
port
or
bourbon
this
is
a
rich
creamy
beer
it
has
a
fullbodied
mouthfeel
and
provides
some
warmth
as
it
goes
down
im
drinking
it
a
bit
above
cellar
temperature
and
it
is
near
perfect
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
all
night
because
it
is
so
strong
and
rich
but
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
of
these
beers
my
overall
opinion
is
that
it
is
an
excellent
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
poured
a
deep
mahogany
opaque
with
a
short
ring
of
offwhite
bubbles
some
lacing
at
first
but
dissipates
halfway
down
the
glass
rich
caramel
and
smoke
aroma
some
chocolate
and
toffee
but
always
with
a
nice
lingering
smoke
smooth
slick
mouthfeel
with
a
long
finish
hearty
malt
profile
more
smoke
kind
of
peaty
but
matched
with
the
caramel
malt
bit
of
a
hop
bitterness
towards
the
back
again
toffee
and
cocoa
flavors
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
d
i
had
no
problems
drinking
this
one
the
body
is
moderate
and
really
lacking
for
style
some
sugary
notes
leaves
an
almost
dry
finish
overall
a
bit
disappointing
would
like
to
see
more
depth
and
maltiness
out
of
this
one
but
very
easy
to
drink
had
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
this
really
quite
a
nice
scotch
ale
pours
very
dark
brown
with
some
reddishbrown
highlights
little
head
smells
complex
nutty
slightly
smokey
and
treacly
but
still
fairly
dry
tastes
a
little
like
kombuchi
toasted
brown
rice
treacle
nutty
and
with
an
interesting
scotch
whisky
note
that
floats
in
and
out
very
interesting
smooth
and
round
in
the
mouth
this
is
overall
a
tiny
bit
challenging
to
drink
easily
with
its
smoky
overtones
but
still
delicious
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
upfront
but
finishes
tingly
tasty
and
drinkable
good
drinkability
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
scotch
ale
it
wasnt
real
impressive
but
i
might
try
it
again
d
great
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
ill
be
looking
for
it
again
super
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
d
claymore
scotch
ale
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
that
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
another
solid
beer
from
great
divide
recommended
this
beer
is
certainly
not
bad
by
any
means
but
still
a
bit
disappointing
the
super
dark
appearance
was
fairly
impressive
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
have
little
more
to
offer
than
roasty
malt
and
not
even
in
a
really
good
way
as
you
can
find
with
some
doppelbocks
etc
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
but
not
chewy
i
suggest
drinking
it
cold
as
i
had
one
that
was
approaching
room
temp
and
it
became
quite
unpleasant
not
too
much
complexity
in
the
flavor
but
again
its
not
bad
i
dont
know
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
but
it
certainly
is
decent
and
if
youre
nuts
about
scotch
ales
its
worth
trying
poured
from
bottle
to
stout
glass
deep
dark
brown
in
color
very
light
tan
head
about
one
finger
which
didnt
last
very
long
very
little
lacing
sweet
roasted
malty
scent
little
hop
character
mouth
feel
was
pleasant
a
little
sweet
with
some
bitterness
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
this
beer
could
drink
a
few
more
d
this
was
more
first
endevour
into
the
wee
heavy
catagory
so
perhaps
i
need
to
get
used
to
it
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
expected
more
malty
sweetness
rather
than
the
bitterness
i
was
left
with
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hop
with
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
slight

spicecaramel
medium

drinkable
another
nice
brew
from
gd
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
richness
to
it
malty
and
thick
without
being
overly
sweet
the
rich
concentrated
fruit
really
adds
to
this
beer
and
the
touch
of
hops
adds
just
enough
balance
to
the
over
all
profile
bottle
ours
a
deep
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
head
is
creamy
and
lasting
the
head
is
producing
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
and
nuts
has
a
light
carbonation
the
flavor
is
on
the
lines
of
a
light
stout
has
good
blending
hints
of
a
slight
metalic
taste
has
a
medium
body
a
solid
finish
with
a
good
aftertaste
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
pretty
high
actually
this
would
be
a
great
fall
beer
the
smokeytoasty
presence
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
campfire
while
the
body
isnt
what
i
would
have
preferred
still
a
solid
beer
overall
and
id
gladly
drink
some
more
d
this
was
a
good
one
to
go
to
for
a
try
at
something
new
but
it
did
not
quite
hit
the
mark
for
me
i
guess
scotch
ales
taste
the
same
to
me
and
leave
me
wanting
more
variety
perhaps
some
short
term
aging
in
the
cellar
can
mute
that
alcohol
sting
that
was
present
and
meld
the
flavors
better
overall
not
bad
but
certainly
some
room
for
a
little
more
body

frequent

body
is

of

really
good
stuff
which
is

d
not

nice
shot
at
the
style
the
scotch
alewee
heavy
style
is
one
thats
easily
overdone
tipping
either
towards
too
much
malt
or
too
much
alcohol
and
even
just
within
the
maltiness
it
can
lean
too
much
towards
caramel
or
too
much
towards
roastiness
but
theres
none
of
that
here
its
very
focused
and
thats
what
the
style
is
really
about
its
a
big
beer
and
its
rich
but
its
also
very
focused
which
keeps
it
drinkable
great
divide
is
kind
of
known
for
that
in
all
of
their
beers
but
its
particularly
welcome
here
very
nicely
done
and
id
have
to
say
quite
possibly
the
most
authentic
americanbrewed
version
of
the
style
although
a
little
more
yeast
character
wouldnt
hurt
superb
feel
and
drinkability
mediumheavy

with
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
life
ive
had
other
great
divide
beers
that
were
poor
but
in
this
one
i
can
find
no
fault
its
a
nice
beer
this
is
one
that
ill
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
again
though
id
like
to
explore
the
style
further
before
i
come
back
nothing
outstanding
or
mind
shattering
about
his
brew
it
is
as
it
should
be
d
a
unique
yet
true
to
form
scottish
wee
heavy
d
these
are
very
drinkable
there
is
a
very
good
toffee
or
coffee
taste
that
makes
you
come
back
and
wish
for
more
it
gets
better
throughout
the
pint
which
makes
for
a
good
beer
tastemouthfeel
a
sweet
caramel
that
comes
across
without
being
overly
sweet
the
taste
is
spiced
up
with
the
alcohol
content
there
is
a
muted
sour
aftertaste
im
usually
impartial
to
that
flavor
but
it
melds
very
well
with
the
caramel
it
has
a
very
well
rounded
taste
overall
no
taste

is
all

drinkability
is

a

its

any

the
smoke

really
make
this

they
refine
and
sharpen
this

a
lot
come
to
think
of
it
theyre
just
what
bells

needed
the
comparison
naturally
comes
to
mind
sorry
but
there
it
is
this
ones
better
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
really
nice

a
tad
of
the
sweet

that
lingers
and
plenty
of
peaty
smokeyness
and
very
robust

dont
like
my

i
can
tell
not

this
is
a

of
the

one
or
two
is
enough
for
me
great
divide
came
through
with
this

i
always
imagine
this
style
with
hearty
holiday
meals
i
might
have
to
get
another
bottle
for
easter
sunday
cheers
a
solid

maybe
not
the
best
scotch
ale
but
certainly
very
strong

it
is
a
nice

representation

i
got
to
try

my
reference
wee

is
dirty
bastard
by
founders
this
is
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
that
i
like
it
but
id
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
to
pick
out
the
nuances
d
this
is
a
decent
easy
to
drink
beer
though
i
wouldnt

its

my
favorites

would
be
perfect

an

flavor
tempered
by
a

the
smokiness

flavor
imparts
a
bitterness

helps
offset
the
sweetness
from
the

that
it
has
a

of
a
toffeeness

by

it

it
should

an

worthy
of
another
look
d
not

a

recommended
i
can
fully

myself
snatching
up
a
sixpack
of
the
stuff
overall
a
very
good

i
find
many
to
be

like
the

of
the
sweet

smoke
and
bitterness
in
this
one
d
this
one
grew
on
me
as
i
progressed
through
the
glass
its
appearance
is
way
too
dark
almost
to
an
offputting
level

the
aroma

make
up
for
that
i
would
drink
this

this

however
looked

be
a

elegant

with

one
hell
of
an
interesting
beer
drinkability
i
love
the
way
this
one
blends
together
and
great
divide
just
has
a
way
of
making
their
beers
ultimately
drinkable
only
negative
points
here
are
the
noticeable
alcohol
on
the
tongue
and
the
nose
overall
this
is
another
great
one
from
great
divide
overall
a
relatively
good
beer
not
my
favorite
interpretation
of
the
style
d
a
bit
atypical
for
the
style
yet
tasty
worth
a
try
but
not
one
that
id
actively
seek
out
again
overall
impression
this
one
is
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
abv
another
good
offering
from
great
divide
d
my
favorite
of
the
three
beers
i
had
at
the
tap
room
its
a
nice
departure
from
great
divides
heavier
offerings
the
smell
was
just
not
good
on
this
one
but
it
redeemed
itself
by
tasting
good
i
wont
rush
out
for
more
but
its
one
of
the
only
scotch
ales
around
here
d
there
isnt
an
abv
on
this
bottle
but
reading
other
reviews
i
would
say
its
7
58abv
you
really
dont
notice
until
after
its
going
down
it
warms
you
from
the
inside
and
with
each
drink
you
want
more
i
can
imagine
drinking
more
but
i
am
afraid
that
after
23
i
would
be
gone
picked
up
a
single
from
abes
for
2
at
abes
this
is
a
bit
different
for
the
usual
heavy
sweet
caramel
and
smoke
wee
heavy
i
get
this
is
a
dry
extremely
bready
like
dark
multigrain
loaf
crust
there
are
notes
of
cocoa
and
toast
with
an
underlying
caramel
malt
profile
despite
the
7
7
this
beer
was
fairly
drinkable
and
id
go
back
it
check
this
beer
out
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
different
with
the
style
drinkability
the
label
on
the
bottled
on
feb
17
2009
bottle
says
its
7
7abv
and
i
think
theyve
done
one
heck
of
a
job
of
hiding
it
but
i
would
not
turn
around
and
open
another
bottle
this
style
seems
to
be
a
real
hit
or
miss
with
me
and
the
claymore
falls
somewhere
in
between
i
say
try
it
and
judge
for
yourself
pours
a
beautiful
clear
root
beer
color
with
a
small
quickly
dissipating
head
and
not
much
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malts
caramel
and
just
a
tad
of
dark
fruits
first
sip
is
creamy
clean
and
refreshing
with
the
sweet
roasted
malts
and
caramel
giving
way
to
a
welcomed
rather
bitter
finish
great
malty
goodness
here
with
almost
no
hop
presence
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
as
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
though
with
great
divide
on
the
label
i
should
have
been
expecting
it
definitely
worth
a
shot
formed
a

dense

well
with
a
touch

great
im
liking
this
one
im
impressed
really
impressed
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
in
a
good
while
and
definitely
an
interesting
interpretation
nice
to
see
an
american
brewery
take
on
a
style
with
so
much
power
and
make
something
so
ultimately
drinkable
definitely
wish
i
had
a
few
more
on
me
at
the
moment
a
problem
i
will
have
to
rectify
in
the
morning
hands
down
a
must
try
no
question
i
always
looked
to
old
chub
for
a
good
scottish
ale
but
this
beer
has
just
changed
my
preference
d
nice
flavorful
beer
and
has
a
good
even
flavor
a
good
take
on
this
style
of
beer
one
of
the
better
american
brewed
scotch
ales
highly
recommended
sweet
smell
candied
caramel
and
apple
malt
slight
roasted
followed
through
in
the
taste
as
well
sweet
but
not
overly
good
balance
a
nice
crisp
finish
but
not
dry
i
havent
had
many
wees
but
this
one
is
darn
good
even
though
its
not
my
style
d
extremely
impressive
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
good
feels
good
and
an
enjoyable
experience
probably
the
most
well
balanced
yet
complex
scotch
ales
that
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
two
thumbs
up
to
great
divide
on
what
may
become
a
staple
in
my
beer
fridge
notes
from
and
tasted
on
3409
this
is
a
nice
enough
beer
though
i
cant
say
i
was
wowed
by
it
its
definitely
a
beer
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
not
sure
i
am
today
edit

the
2010
version
of
this
apparently
has
a
different
yeast
and
tastes
even
stronger
smoke
carries
through
more
d
extremely
drinkable
it
drinks
like
a
very
well
done
doppelbock
but
hits
you
like
an
english
style
stout
im
extremely
impressed
as
unfamiliar
to
scotch

just
wasnt
good
in
any
aspect
poured
into
a
sniffer
aged
about
a
year
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
cola
from
the
addition
of
kola
nut
never
would
have
thought
this
to
be
a
scotch
ale
more
like
an
extra
dark
and
malty
brown
ale
nevertheless
the
scotch
style
malts
added
another
level
of
complexity
to
the
beer
massive
tastes
of
honey
give
this
beer
extra
depth
as
well
a
combination
of
malt
dark
sugars
and
alcohol
make
this
a
heavy
yet
delicious
beer
hope
to
see
it
on
the
shelves
again
and
would
highly
recommend
it

with
an
off

the
aroma
has
a
nice
deep
toasty
malt
note
with

smoke
dark

and

the
flavor
mimics
the
nose
with
more
of
the

some
of
the
brown

and
char
and
of
course
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
beer
drinks
easy
and
smoothly
overall
this
is
a
solid
option
and
very
nice
on
tap
the
commercial
description
is
almost
as
good
as
the
beer
and
the
beer
is
very
good

at
a

with
a

opaque

color
aroma

dark
roast
malt
traditional
scotch
ale
flavor
is
a
little
muddled
upfront
but
it
really
comes
out
in
the
finish
as
an
excellent
traditional
scotch
ale
lots
of
dark

flavors
toffee
little

not

in
that

is

for
this

boozy
great
drinkin
scotch
ale
outstanding
beer
its
fastfleeting
exit
lightens
considerably
and
casts
aside
the
bulk
of
sweetness
favoring
a
drier
and
spicy
finish
thats
predicated
on
peppercorn
spruce
toasted
husk
with
vinous
and
dried
stone
fruit
its
arid
dryness
subtle
warmth
and
stern
effervescence
enlivens
a
tepid
ash
character
thats
sure
to
be
to
the
delight
of
fine
cigar
aficionados
overcarbonated
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
with
red
highlights
virtually
opaque
in
the
glass
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
leaving
thin
lacing
interesting
aroma
of
brown
bread
molasses
caramel
sweet
nuts
hints
of
cola
spicing
and
light
cardboard
similar
to
aged
stouts
flavor
is
a
mellow
blend
of
dark
toasty
malt
molasses
dates
figs
mixed
nuts
cocoa
and
hints
of
coffee
and
cola
really
complex
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
to
heavy
body
a
fun
complicated
ale
that
has
elements
of
both
scotch
ale
and
porter
but
with
other
interesting
and
complimentary
flavors
there
was
so
much
going
on
here
it
seems
almost
all
over
the
map
but
still
feels
well
melded
and
integrated
im
impressed
the
heavy
malt
and
molasses
flavors
make
it
more
of
a
sipping
beer
despite
its
moderate
abv
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
will
snag
another
one
when
it
rolls
around
one
of
my
all
time
favourites
would
highly
recommend
very
dark
brown
color
with
some
sparse
bubbles
around
the
edge
and
a
thin
weblike
covering
deep
malty
aromas
along
with
molasses
and
prune
pretty
mild
overall
though
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
sweet
bread
berries
some
stickiness
bitter
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
cola
medium
bodied
clean
and
dry
a
nice
little
scotch
ale
overall
a
very
tasty
if
not
overly
sweet
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
though
the
sweetness
does
make
it
difficult
to
drink
though
its
too
sweet
for
me
even
though
it
is
complex
it
is
very
drinkable
excellent
scotch
ale
o
for
about
4
oz
this
one
truly
kicks
ass
in
terms
of
both
drinkability
and
enjoyment
factor
but
as
soon
as
the
sweetness
accumulates
it
becomes
a
little
less
likable
for
my
tastes
killing
an
entire
bottle
would
be
difficult
but
not
unbearable
this
is
one
to
share
with
others
between
this
and
taking
heroin
id
pick
drinking
this
11
times
out
of
10
suspicious
of
this
one
given
brewdogs
taste
for
gimmickry
and
the
ingredients
but
its
a
welljudged
and
hearty
with
a
combo
of
spice
hops
and
black
malt
acid
but
no
roast
balancing
the
prodigious
sweetness
maybe
not
the
most
faithful
to
style
but
a
good
winter
sipper
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
dark
mahogany
pour
with
a
touch
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
two
finger
beige
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
spicy
malty
and
really
complex
with
hints
of
nutmeg
molasses
figs
toffee
smoke
honey
and
just
a
touch
of
coffee
and
mocha
the
honey
really
comes
out
in
the
taste
as
this
comes
to
temperature
extremely
toasty
and
malty
with
hints
of
cocoa
dark
fruit
molasses
brown
sugar
coffee
and
just
a
bit
of
red
berries
and
licorice
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
silk
with
a
subtle
creaminess
and
tangy
bitter
finish
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
as
im
not
a
big
fan
of
honey
a
very
unique
and
tasty
interpretation
of
the
style
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
very
rich
looking
its
got
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
that
holds
a
very
good
retention
not
much
lacing
though
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
malty
with
some
smoked
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
also
loaded
with
a
strong
malt
dominance
lots
of
caramel
in
there
with
subtle
smoke
and
chocolate
toast
flavors
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
heavy
its
dense
and
should
be
for
the
style
overall
its
a
good
brew
i
dont
pick
up
on
the
addition
of
heather
or
honey
too
much
in
it
however
it
remains
a
good
beer
and
is
worth
trying
in
my
personal
opinion
its
far
better
than
the
original
dogma
overall
a
wellmade
scotch
ale
which
i
definitely
enjoyed
o
full
of
twists
and
turns
its
worth
a
try
all
in
all
much
better
than
what
i
remember
its
previous
namesake
to
be
odd
marketing
tho
httpabarwithnoname

com
the
beer
pours
a
yellowish
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
peat
malt
with
some
nice
toffee
and
caramel
notes
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
once
again
fairly
peaty
with
some
dark
fruit
and
heather
notes
there
is
also
as
expected
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
much
better
than
the
original
dogma
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
a
good
scotch
ale
and
the
heather
honey
adds
interesting
depth
it
is
missing
a
little
fruit
for
my
liking
but
it
works
well
otherwise
hands
down
once
sipped
the
aromas
intensity
gives
way
to
a
different
intensity
big
burny
booze
washes
up
against
zippy
brown
ale
malt
and
the
affect
is
akin
to
a
beer
that
starts
off
as
a
bock
but
ends
as
an
almosttoosweet
super
boozy
brown
at
no
point
is
the
beer
bad
but
it
never
quite
ties
together
very
dark
in
glass
almost
black
until
you
pick
up
the
glass
and
see
deep
red
color
with
a
tan
head
that
is
not
falling
a
slight
milk
chocolate
upfront
with
an
immediate
alcohol
hit
you
can
feel
it
as
you
swallow
and
it
finishes
with
a
sweet
cream
finish
very
very
good
scotch
ale
it
was
an
interesting
beer
i
would
love
to
try
it
again
poured
this
beer
from
a
bomber
this
beer
was
phenomenal
and
probably
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
i
have
ever
had
very
dark
color
with
aromas
of
peated
scotchy
malts
scotchy
flavors
are
present
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
roasted
malt
scotchy
peated
flavors
are
similar
to
flavors
from
islay
whiskey
casks
an
8
5
abv
helps
the
overall
taste
as
well
and
makes
this
a
hearty
beer
absolutely
loved
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
it
oa
style
that
more
people
need
to
make
one
of
the
better
ones
poured
a
very
deep
brown
not
sure
if
its
cloudy
or
clear
because
you
cant
see
through
it
almost
no
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
minimal
but
it
has
a
big
malty
sweet
flavor
notes
of
caramel
fruit
and
nice
sweetness
from
the
alcohol
no
carbonation
and
little
oily
on
the
texture
but
not
in
a
bad
way
a
great
big
scottish
ale
a
nice
big
malty
scotch
ale
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
overall
and
certainly
too
sweet
to
take
down
too
much
of
i
like
its
density
though
and
its
grain
richness
in
some
ways
its
like
a
dopplebock
on
the
grain
front
this
may
be
a
little
less
german
but
its
dark
caramel
and
dried
red
fruit
complexion
is
in
line
with
that
earthy
up
front
before
the
sweet
dark
amber
to
mahogany
in
color
thick
in
body
but
not
overly
so
carbonation
is
upbeat
for
the
style
which
really
helps
with
the
sugar
there
is
a
real
molasses
character
to
the
front
end
and
even
a
mellow
hop
bitterness
there
too
it
just
feels
like
dessert
to
me
a
glass
of
this
brings
cures
the
itch
of
both
a
sweet
tooth
and
an
individual
in
need
of
a
little
buzz
you
cant
taste
the
booze
in
it
really
but
i
can
definitely
feel
it
after
even
half
a
glass
solid
beer
overall
well
made
but
not
all
that
different
and
quite
sugary
in
the
finish
overall
good
without
being
special
im
surprised
ive
never
reviewed
this
had
this
on
cask
at
the
brick
store
pub
awhile
ago
reviewing
from
notes
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
big
creamy
head
and
the
typical
cask
carbonation
the
smell
is
a
little
light
but
very
malty
and
a
bit
redolent
of
chocolate
the
taste
has
big
malt
flavors
but
fairly
dry
overall
meaty
almost
bacony
and
and
maybe
with
a
touch
of
hay
very
interesting
and
quite
good
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
drying
tannic
finish
which
is
very
welcome
overall
delicious
o
mixed
feelings
on
this
one
i
like
it
but
not
for
a
scotch
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
big
khaki
colored
head
of
foam
the
aroma
has
rich
toffee
and
dark
fruit
notes
some
chocolate
notes
are
there
as
well
the
taste
is
more
of
that
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
sweetness
some
sherry
notes
perhaps
big
chewy
mouthfeel
and
body
lower
end
of
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
strong
prune
taste
and
smell
made
me
not
enjoy
it
as
much
a
very
different
take
on
a
scotch
ale
very
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
personality
o
a
great
tasting
beer
worth
getting
again

mostly
opaque
aroma
of
sweet
molasses
chocolate
roast
smoke
toffee
biscuits
and
more
chocolate
flavor
is
a
nice
roasty
smokey
chocolate
with
a
lingering
peaty
flavor
on
the
palate
sweet
molasses
takes
over
the
palate
after
chocolate
subsides
up
front
rich
and
creamy
but
with
offsetting
light
carbonation
and
not
stout
heavy
good
scotch
ale
ad
can
see
how
this
would
take
on
the
bourbon
barrels
well
will
have
to
find
the
ba
version
this
season
bought
this
bad
boy
last
year
at
the
brewery
and
loved
it
so
much
that
i
had
a
friend
that
visited
tampa
a
couple
weeks
after
to
bring
me
another
one
because
it
loved
it
so
much
cant
wait
until
the
new
one
comes
out
because
i
will
be
hoarding
them
for
a
year
just
like
im
doing
with
the
bottle
my
buddy
brought
me
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
do
yourself
a
favor
o
a
solid
scotch
ale
but
overall
a
bit
more
sweet
than
i
would
have
liked
its
a
beer
worth
trying
but
i
would
recommend
splitting
this
with
a
few
friends

that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
scotch
ale
very
nice
balance
and
big
complexity
of
maltfruity
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
this
is
a
straight
up
malt
bomb
a
great
quality
wee
heavy
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
definitely
a
sipper
i
could
see
this
going
great
with
a
nice
cigar
and
not
just
because
its
made
by
a
brewery
called
cigar
city
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
to
myself
was
awesome
yet
foolish
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
in
the
future
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
tried
opened
a
2012
bottle
on
dld
the
malts
really
take
over
in
this
one
with
a
slight
hint
of
cherries
the
coffee
didnt
really
come
out
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
but
it
was
still
a
very
nice
beer
overall
looking
forward
to
trying
the
barrel
aged
versions
overall
decent
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
would
like
to
try
the
ba
version
i
bet
i
would
enjoy
it
more
big
sound
pours
out
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
drops
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
intensely
malty
with
just
a
bit
of
smoke
the
taste
is
awesome
this
is
a
huge
and
rich
scotch
ale
that
provides
a
massive
amount
of
malt
flavors
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
over
the
slightest
amount
of
peaty
smoke
theres
a
solid
amount
of
booze
on
the
finish
as
well
the
mouthfeel
like
most
big
cigar
city
beers
is
exceptional
its
got
a
pretty
large
body
yet
is
very
smooth
the
drinkabiliy
is
very
good
overall
big
sound
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
theres
a
little
less
peat
presence
than
id
like
but
its
otherwise
nice
and
complex
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
toffee
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
malty
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
looks
like
slightly
flat
coca
cola
in
the
glass
though
a
little
darker
a
head
appears
then
disappears
just
as
fast
faint
if
none
existant
aroma
of
none
discript
maltyness
the
flavor
delivers
a
lot
where
other
areas
of
this
beer
fall
short
very
malty
with
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
roast
coffee
petey
to
a
degree
with
brown
sugar
it
is
full
and
malty
but
dry
not
sweet
at
all
big
full
mouthfeel
a
little
oily
a
little
lacking
in
carbonation
despite
the
beers
lack
of
appearance
and
aroma
it
really
delivers
well
if
this
was
available
in
my
market
id
drink
it
frequently
in
the
cooler
months
overall
a
decent
beer
certainly
not
tops
for
the
style
but
above
average
price
point
is
nice
so
i
would
probably
get
this
one
again
overall
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
i
miss
in
texas
if
only
i
could
get
something
similar
in
the
area
consider
yourself
lucky
if
this
is
a
shelf
beer
where
you
live
overall
pretty
decent
and
a
worthy
drink
but
i
think
i
prefer
other
wee
heavy
beers
compared
to
this
one
overall
this
was
just
alright
ive
had
piles
of
wonderful
beers
from
cigar
city
but
this
one
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
a
little
light
in
body
and
the
flavor
lacked
up
front
a
bit
still
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
think
i
expected
more
from
this
one
cheers
again
for
doing
the
legwork
pops
love
trying
stuff
from
this
brewery
o
if
every
wee
heavy
tasted
and
felt
like
this
i
might
change
my
name
to
weeman
o
this
is
pretty
good
indeed
much
better
than
the
infected
bottle
i
had
a
darn
good
scotch
ale
a
thick
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
and
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
i
like
this
very
much
and
would
highly
recommend
it
a
nicely
complex
scotch
ale
cigar
city
never
disappoints
o
tasty
scotch
ale
it
would
be
nice
if
the
sweetness
were
dialed
back
just
a
bit
but
it
mostly
works
here
a
good
bottle
to
split
this
was
an
interesting
scotch
ale
bigger
and
sweeter
than
the
average
with
some
interesting
flavors
this
is
worth
a
try
but
its
not
mindblowing
overall
a
solid
take
on
the
style
im
glad
i
ended
up
sharing
this
bottle
with
a
couple
friends
as
it
would
be
a
task
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
alone
nice
flavor
but
its
not
gripping
drink
nice
beer
i
believe
this
one
was
aged
about
112
years
nice
bottle
for
a
birthday
in
prompteau
tasting
o
not
too
familiar
with
scottish
ales
but
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
not
boozy
at
all
for
strength
all
and
the
flavors
are
kept
in
check
smooth
drinkable
with
potent
flavors
smooth
rich
creamy
and
fullbodied
this
is
a
good
brew
only
downside
would
be
that
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
even
for
me
light
effervescence
and
a
light
coating
of
the
palate
but
no
real
warming
like
i
expected
a
good
beer
for
sipping
as
in
dessert
had
some
smokepeat
presence
too
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
thin
lasting
beige

is
lots
of
sweet

dark

big

the
finish
mouth
feel
is

with
a
smooth
finish
great
tasting
brew
but
almost
no
resemblance
to
a
scotch
ale
tastes
similar
to
their
warmer
winter
i
enjoyed
this
scotch
ale
by
cigar
city
its
now
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
o
not
at
all
what
i
had
hoped
o
i
know
this
is
down
from
my
earlier
firkin
review
of
this
same
beer
but
ive
had
traquair
house
ale
in
the
meantime
and
its
changed
how
i
view
the
style
with
increased
abv
comes
required
complexity
m
very
mellow
rounded
mouthfeel
incredibly
drinkable
some
burnt
malttoffee
undertones
the
beer
appears
a
hazy
brown
hue
with
a
small
beige
head
the
aroma
offers
some
candied
fruit
malt
alcohol
nice
flavor
slightly

well
balanced
mildly
tannic
really
delicious
the

with
only
a

light
passing

aroma
is
wide
ranging
with
syrup
dark

intermixed
this
one
initially
is

and
it
hard
to
overcome
this
one
is
very
smooth

dark
fruits
a
little
creamy
with
slight
smokey
hues
and
a
maple
like
finish
body
is

overall
this
one
was
way
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
to
give
this
my
top
rating
rich
and
decandent
very
balanced
and
tasty
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brownish
red
just
a
shade
or
two
darker
than
root
beer
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
crowns
the
beer
and
quickly
recedes
leaving
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
dark
fruits
and
sweet
roasted
malts
comprise
the
aroma
first
sip
is
all
raisins
like
picking
out
all
those
plump
fat
sugar
coated
sweetened
raisins
from
a
box
of
raisin
bran
and
chewing
them
all
at
once
plenty
of
malt
and
toffee
too
a
welcomed
splash
of
bitterness
brings
up
the
finish
nicely
carbonated
makes
for
a
very
good
mouthfeel
very
nice
indeed
very
dark
and
viscous
looking
pour
with
a
thin
medium
tan
head
looks
the
part
of
a
porter
very
sweet
and
fruity
aroma
a
lot
of
dried
dark
fruit
notes
along
with
some
berries
caramel
toffee
and
even
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
and
leather
flavor
is
very
sweet
but
not
cloying
underlying
fruit
notes
are
quickly
displaced
by
roasty
and
coffee
flavors
rich
caramel

flavors
interplay
wonderfully
definitely
improves
as
it
nears
room
temperature
palate
is
thick
and
full
with
a
lingering
sweetness
on
the
finish
a
little
offkilter
pun
intended
for
the
style
but
extremely
wellmade
and
delicious
one
of
my
new
favorite
scotch
ales
would
love
to
try
this
in
barrelaged
form
overall
this
is
very
nice
and
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
like
scotch
ale
this
and
robert
the
bruce
would
probably
be
my
two
examples
of
the
style
to
present
to
a
new
beer
enthusiast
its
a
super
amplified
scotch
ale
clearly
a
great
beer
but
not
my
thing
its
like
an
american
treated
scotch
ales
like
he
would
treat
an
ipa
or
an
ris
i
prefer
more
toned
down
scotch
ales
would
really
taste
good
with
a
fruit
pie
of
some
sort
o
i
have
never
ever
had
a
wee
heavy
like
this
and
i
doubt
ill
ever
have
another
this
beer
is
oneofakind
demonstrating
such
impressive
craftsmanship
from
cigar
city
even
in
the
nose
the
light
fruits
caught
me
off
guard
with
their
unique
power
the
flavor
profile
was
just
delicious
as
well
topped
off
by
an
amazingly
drinkable
body
this
ones
for
the
record
books
a
wee
heavy
that
shovels
its
alcohol
down
with
complex
flavor
and
mindblowing
drinkability
o
i
was
aging
this
beer
for
a
short
amount
of
time
only
to
be
let
down
a
second
time
by
ccb
due
to
an
apparent
lack
of
quality
control
the
onset
of
infection
in
noticeable
in
the
beer
especially
given
the
14
inch
of
yeasty
sediment
residing
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
its
a
shame
because
from
the
flavors
that
were
in
the
beer
i
can
tell
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
much
more
were
it
not
for
the
constant
reminder
of
the
detracting
infected
flavors
i
finished
about
half
of
the
bottle
before
my
drain
received
the
rest
not
bad
but
not
worth
drinking
o
a
great
scotch
ale
very
nice
to
sip
on
a
cold
florida
evening
as
the
brew
warms
i
am
getting
more
and
more
smoke
on
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
truly
an
exceptional
beer
at
first
this
didnt
really
meet
the
scotch
ale
style
but
the
traditional
style
comes
out
more
and
more
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
drunk
at
no
colder
than
50
degrees
i
originally
scored
this
as
an
a
but
this
is
an
a
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
that
has
passed
through
these
lips

not

that

the

that
which
says
something
a

would
be
better
served

22

is
just
too
much
because
of

a

of
this

really
rich

still
though
i
think
i

backwoods
o
try
to
find
this
its
worth
it
or
find
it
next
year
a
gentlemens
upgrade
to
the
original
big
sound
overall
i
really
like
this
one
i
thought
it
was
great
and
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
i
like
the
base
beer
and
this
is
an
improvement
i
love
how
much
flavor
there
is
and
how
good
the
bourbon
is
yet
this
is
still
drinkable
and
not
hot
at
all
very
impressive
worth
seeking
out
very
tasting
second
best
vintage
of
big
sound
i
have
had
o
yep
its
a
hit
in
my
book
love
the
bourbon
flavor
and
the
mix
of
sweet
do
yourself
a
favor
and
let
this
one
warm
up
its
worth
the
wait
bottle
from
a
trade
you
can
tell
from
the
first
hit
of
the
nose
immediately
after
taking
the
cap
off
that
its
outstanding
thick
toffee
and
dark
fruit
and
caramel
and
bourbon

the

strongly
sweet

back
end
one
of
the
better
barrel
aged
beers
out
there
another
cigar
city
success
o
this
was
a
nobrainer
the
scotch
ales
sugar
character
and
fruit
impressions
are
a
natural
setting
for
bourbon
barrel
aging
the
vanilla
and
booze
of
the
bourbon
plus
the
drying
of
the
barrel
vapors
creates
a
decadent
fruity
array
of
aroma
flavor
and
feel
ccb
kills
another

beer
they
are
at
the

of
the

and
this
is
outstanding

i
prefer
the
nonba
version
but
that
was
so
good
malty
and
you
feel
the
alcohol
almost
bourbonlike
while
it
is
a
wee
heavy
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
yum
i
live
fairly
close
to
devils
backbone
and
go
out
there
occasionally
and
while
i
like
many
of
their
beers
this
remains
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
as
a
fan
of
the
style
that
normally
is
above
average
on
wee
heavy
this
one
disappointed
had
a
late
aftertaste
that
was
not
really
bitter
almost
like
rubbing
alcohol
that
lingered
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
despite
not
being
extremely
big
you
notice
the
alcohol
they
did
not
disguise
it
very
well
hopefully
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
o
not
very
complex
but
tasty
enough
a
decent
but
unremarkable
scottish
ale
first
drink
was
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
to
my
taste
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
brew
first
wee
heavy
ive
had
in
a
while
makes
me
want
to
look
for
some
more
love
the
eight
point
ipa
also
produced
by
devils
backbone
and
virginia
beers
overall
born
and
raised
so
i
decided
to
give
this
beer
a
shot
pours
a
dark

with
minimal
head
and
moderate

taste
is
very
sweet
aromatic
citrus
overall
a
great
taste
but
nothing
wildly
unique
or
explosive
goes
down
smooth
with
very
little
aftertaste
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
o
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
perfect
for
a

rather
unimpressive
all
told
has
a
nice
ruddy
hue
leaning
towards
brown
there
is
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
microscopic
amounts
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
underwhelming
with
only
slight
malt
tones
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
more
robust
with
a
nice
generic
malt
profile
and
a
decent
hit
of
alcohol
that
threatens
to
overwhelm
it
but
then
dials
back
there
is
also
a
nice
earthy
hops
quality
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
to
it
and
a
good
thick
feeling
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
not
much
of
a
aroma
its
my
first
scotch
ale
but
ive
got
to
say
i
like
the
sweet
taste
pours
dark
very
little
head
not
much
smell
taste
not
too
bitter
smooth
going
down
after
taste
a
bit
like
scotch
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
to
give
it
a
kick
drink
a
few
of
these
and
switch
to
a
larger
with
less
alcohol
volume
to
keep
the
buzz
outstanding
beer
from
one
of
the
best
devils

beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
beer
pours
reddish
orange
with
little
head
beer
smells
of
fruitiness
this
is
inviting
tastes
of
nice
barrel
aged
taste
with
dark
berries
not
bad
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
an
above
average
beer
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
mainly
because
it
seems
off
the
category
i
was
expecting
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
winter
night
doing
a
full
review
now
i
notice
the
flaws
in
the
beer
a
bit
more
that
being
said
this
is
the
last
beer
of
the
2nd
6pack
that
i
picked
up
its
a
solid
beer
works
just
as
well
out
of
the
bottle
as
out
of
the
glass
and
itll
warm
you
up
d
this
was
an
average
scotch
ale
at
best
the
scent
and
taste
and
body
werent
bad
but
not
that
enjoyable
the
finish
was
a
little
rough
too
so
it
wasnt
easy
to
drink
or
enjoy
not
recommended
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
very
little
lacing
rather
strong
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
roasted
caramel
notes
with
a
slightly
bitter
but
not
too
bitter
very
nice
mouthfeel
overall
a
rather
tasty
beer
will
be
buying
this
one
again
overall
not
bad
a
wee
heavy
not
the
best
but
reasonably
priced
and
quite
drinkable
a
big
malty
treat
overall
its
also
not
quite
boozy
for
the
style
but
the
palate
flavor
is
intriguing
and
enjoyable
nice
one
to
add
to
the
devils
backbone
collection
who
wouldnt
love
this
by
name
alone
i
was
a
wee
bit
leery
of
the
moniker
of
scottish
ale
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
on
first
sip
i
tasted
hints
of
black
licorice
and
another
sweetness
that
i
could
just
cannot
put
my
finger
on
perhaps
a
true
scotchy
flavor
nonetheless
i
am
savoring
this
pint
and
sipping
it
slowly
as
this
is
not
a
quaff
to
be
chugged
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
after
seeing
it
in
the
store
i
had
liked
wee
heavys
in
the
past
so
figured
itd
be
worth
it
poured
into
a
snifter
from
the
bottle
nice
dark
amber
color
with
minimal
head
lots
of
smells
very
complex
cant
put
my
finger
on
everything
but
i
get
some
nice
malty
backbone
apricot
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
very
much
the
same
solid
beer
overall
very
happy
i
bought
it
o
a
nicely
malty
scottish
ale
alcohol
only
peeks
out
as
it
warms
not
really
complex
but
carries
some
good
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
i
think
they
missed
on
this
one
love
the
brewery
just
not
this
beer
not
a
typical
nor
above
average
wee
heavy
but
a
solid
attempt
and
certainly
a
couple
will
warm
you
on
a
cool
night
oi
dont
normally
drink
this
style
but
this
wasnt
that
bad
i
wouldnt
go
back
but
if
its
your
thing
seems
worth
a
try
regardless
goes
down
fast
for
the
abv
so
there
is
that
o
one
of
devils
backbones
best
offerings
not
trying
to
be
anything
other
than
a
solid
example
of
the
style
o
this
brew
hits
where
it
counts
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
for
that
i
gotta
say
im
pretty
impressed
been
meaning
to
drink
devils
backbone
stuff
being
in
va
im
really
rooting
for
it
nice
offering
here
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
on
the
high
side
of
the
style
overall
its
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
the
malt
flavors
were
nicely
done
and
it
was
pretty
drinkable
and
flavorful
overall
o
i
have
not
been
a
huge
fan
of
db
offerings
so
far
but
this
is
probably
the
best
one
i
have
tried
yet
i
am
reminded
of
a
belgian
influenced
scotch
ale
if
you
can
imagine
now
that
this
brewery
has
expanded
distribution
across
most
of
va
it
would
be
nice
to
see
them
take
a
step
back
and
think
about
doing
some
more
unique
perhaps
reserve
beers
a
la
blue
mountain
barrel
house
just
down
the
road
we
shall
wait
and
see
i
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
though
on
tap
at
rustico
during
the
devils
backbone
nova
launch
served
in
a
taster
glass
pours
a
decentlydark
brown
color
with
a
good
tan
head
spots
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
some
sweet
caramel
and
a
bit
of
bread
and
toffee
mild
sweetness
to
the
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
fruit
in
the
background
body
is
medium
good
finish
o
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
had
nice
smokey
flavours
and
a
beautiful
warming
effect
that
feels
nice
on
a
stormy
day
let
it
warm
up
before
drinking
and
you
will
have
yourself
an
excellent
drink
highly
recommended
great
for
cold
weather
climates
i
seem
to
remember
this
beer
being
maltier
with
less
alcohol
flavor
before
they
discontinued
it
and
began
rebrewing
maybe
thats
just
nostalgia
though
dark
brown
lots
of
smokey
malt
alcohol
comes
through
in
flavor
and
smell
oak
and
whiskey
notes
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
with
lots
of
good
memories
glad
they
brought
it
back
even
though
i
have
to
drive
5
hours
to
buy
it
prefer
it
just
under
room
temp
fridge
temp
takes
away
a
lot
of
the
flavor
overall
this
is
the
granddaddy
of
scotch
ales
and
its
absolutely
delicious
ill
always
have
some
of
this
on

this

taste
just
like
heaven
i
wish
it
was
in
the
states
still
excellent
wee
heavy
plenty
of
malt
and
smoke
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
at

with
only
a
slight
bitter
on
the
end
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
has
a
caramel
and
peat
aftertaste
well
worth
drinking
over
and
over
again
im
glad
to
see
this
beer
is
back
in
the
states
had
this
at
some
random
bar
in
dunoon
in
scotland
it
was
a
decent
scottish
ale
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
ok
people
were
unattractive
and
soccer
was
on
so
that
didnt
help
overall
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
many
years
ago
and
i
am
thrilled
to
try
it
again
it
actually
tastes
somewhat
similar
to
what
i
remembered
but
at
the
time
i
did
not
recognize
that
there
were
belgian
elements
to
this
scotch
ale
overall
it
is
sweet
and
decadent
but
not
quite
cloying
good
stuff
pours
dark
black
with
no
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
solid
sweet
and
malty
with
chocolaty
notes
to
the
nose
i
found
the
taste
a
bit
underwhelming
it
starts
a
bit
bland
and
watery
but
finishes
sweet
it
tastes
very
sugary
almost
like
chocolate
milk
the
aftertaste
is
unique
its
sweet
the
booze
is
almost
undetectable
which
is
impressive
for
an
8
0
abv
overall
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
its
a
solid
beer
with
a
sweet
finish
but
the
flavor
doesnt
blow
me
away
its
worth
a
try
though

the

completely
masks

set

glad
this
outstanding
ale
is
back
not
bad
overall
but
dont
rush
out
to
get
one
o
this
beer
seems
a
little
lighter
compared
to
some
other
scotch
ales
but
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
interesting
enough
to
sip

alright
the
real
overall
would
be

math
geek
but
let
me
say
even
though
the
world
waited
for
so
long
it
was
worth
the
wait
if
you
truly
enjoyed
mcewans
before
the
same
joy
can
be
had
again
no
now
you
are
older
balder
and
heavier
you
have
aged
terribly
but
mcewans
hasnt
i
hope
it
will
be
with
us
for
many
years
to
come
overall
a
delicious
dark
fruitcentric
beer
with
a
touch
of
earthiness
fairly
peaty
the
cola
flavor
is
offputting
c
o
a
very
smooth
wee
heavy
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
but
this
was
a
cask
ale
not
from
a
bottle
so
a
bit
of
difference
would
like
to
try
from
a
bottle
my
only
wish
is
that
caledonia
would
start
exporting
it
to
the
us
again
this
was
my
second
favorite
beer
ale
of
all
time
traquir
house
ale
was
1
but
for
the
price
of
1
traquir
house
ale
i
could
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
exceptional
ale
extremely
heavy
taste
wonderful
flavour
not
ovehopped
like
most
microbrews
remember
gotta
serve
it
at
6065
degrees
slightly
chilled
not
cold
one
word
awesome
and
its
a
meal
too
i
dont
drink
anymore
but
if
i
did
this
is
all
id
drink
beers
are
boring
a
ale
takes
a
lot
more
work
to
get
it
to
be
fantastic
at
near
room
temperature
nothing
gets
better
than
this
its
not
chewable
but
comes
pretty
close
if
you
prefer
malty
beers
scotch
ales
are
a
great
place
to
start
those
who
are
not
fond
of
hops
will
really
enjoy
them
a
good
nightcap
beer
mcewans
is
a
good
quality
example
of
the
style
d
i
had
been
putting
this
one
off
for
a
while
because
i
really
didnt
expect
to
enjoy
this
one
at
all
but
thankfully
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
to
and
extent
the
dark
and
rich
complexities
here
are
something
pretty
foreign
to
me
but
i
enjoyed
them
much
more
than
i
had
intended
to
overall
this
was
a
much
better
experience
than
previous
tastings
led
me
to
believe
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brownish
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
the
head
left
a
decent
lacing
behind
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
burnt
wood
and
some
smoke
some
whiskey
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
was
rather
burnt
as
well
seemed
to
be
very
bitey
and
left
a
charred
dry
taste
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
heavier
side
which
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
overall
i
would
drink
this
one
again
if
i
ever
see
it
around
that
is
poured
from
bottle
no
date
into
thistle
glass
pours
clear
brown
with
a
ruby
tint
it
had
a
nice
creamy
pinkish
head
very
strong
aromas
of
smoke
wood
scotch
and
call
me
crazy
but
i
detected
a
tropical
pineapplecoconut
whiff
as
well
it
has
a
very
malty
alcoholic
taste
with
a
heavy
chewey
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
and
drinkable
beer
taste
has
a
nice
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
due
to
its
soft
carbonation
the
caramel
malt
has
an
odd
taste
to
it
like
its
been
steeped
in
tea
while
unique
im
not
sure
im
a
big
fan
of
it
no
heat
on
the
tongue
but
i
can
feel
the
strength
i
dont
feel
like
im
drinking
beer
when
having
this
as
ive
thought
to
myself
many
times
before
never
buying
this
again
but
i
know
a
year
from
now
ill
probably
buy
it
again
hoping
for
the
best
i
do
think
i
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
than
last
time
though
excellent
when
the
weathers
cold
also
a
personal
favourite
ingredient
in
a
rich
beef
stew
one
bottle
for
the
pot
and
one
for
the
cook
of
course
im
still
hoarding
these
so
feel
free
to
send
me
some
in
trade
drink
once
again
points
for
originality
but
not
a
beer
that
is
for
me
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
drambuie
liqueur
mixed
with
beer
and
molasses
and
red
wine
worth
a
try
if
you
are
looking
to
mix
it
up
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
caramel
and
malts
taste
is
of
caramel
alcohol
a
bit
nutty
finishing
slightly
sour
a
lot
going
on
but
somehow
not
gelling
together
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
decent
brew
as
a
house
scotch
ale
the
mcewans
does
treat
me
quite
well
the
finish
is
appetizing
and
it
pairs
very
well
with
rich
meats
and
bbq
smoked
cheeses
can
be
nice
but
this
beer
is
very
potent
and
may
overwhelm
cheese
enjoy
it
on
its
own
for
best
results

still
one
of
the
better
imports
available
at
the
bo
not
exactly
my
cup
of

but
it
seems
to
be
a
decent
example
of
the
style
given
my
very
limited
experience
rather
sweet
but
shows
some
interesting
complexity
would
be
quite
enjoyable
sipping
inside
on
a
blistery
cold
winter
evening
almost
the
staple
of
what
a
typical
scotch
ale
should
be
lots
of
sweetness
perhaps
too
much
roasty
and
dark
malts
a
little
boozy
quality
little
smoked
malts
probably
could
have
used
more
and
a
smooth
rich
texture
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
are
looking
for
this
beer
tasty
and
i
could
drink
this
more
often
in
winter
simply
a
classic
amongst
the
style
it
is
though
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
now
if
compared
to
other
scotch
ales
and
wee
heavys
but
always
a
pleasure
nontheless
a
nice
beer
though
it
grew
less
pleasing
as
it
warmed
my
first
wee
heavy
but
hopefully
not
my
last
d
this
ones
a
sipper
for
me
no
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
d
an
amazing
beer
this
is
the
first
ive
had
of
this
style
and
wont
be
the
last
the
sweet
malts
are
not
overpowering
at
all
and
the
alcohol
content
is
hidden
very
well
the
taste
is
fairly
simple
but
rich
fullbodied
smooth
and
mellow
it
has
strong
fruit
especially
cherries
toast
hints
of
chocolate
and
red
wine
and
spices
the
feel
is
zesty
and
rather
lively
despite
light
oiliness
alcohol
adds
a
nice
full
warmth
without
being
too
evident
the
result
is
a
beer
that
may
lack
complexity
of
some
wee
heavies
but
still
has
plenty
of
firm
character
some
complexity
and
is
also
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
sweet
malty
rich
beer
which
goes
down
easy
but
can
quickly
overwhelm
you
with
its
strong
taste
and
high
alcohol
content
enjoyable
but
i
dont
think
i
can
handle
it
on
a
regular
basis
a
pleasant
surprise
i
like
the
chocolateey
highlights
and
it
has
a
decent
body
without
being
a
fullon
stout
it
has
a
strong
taste
without
too
strong
an
alcohol
flavor
albeit
the
fact
that
it
is
8
by
volume
will
definitely
be
buying
again
and
am
somewhat
disappointed
that
as
i
write
this
i
have
finished
my
last
bottle
d
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
6er
back
too
back
but
its
not
a
problem
putting
down
one
or
two
i
plan
on
drinking
this
in
the
future
overall
a
great
brew
especially
if
drunk
as
a
dessert
beer
very
sweet
but
not
cloying
which
is
what
i
find
to
be
a
huge
turn
off
with
other
darker
coloured
beers
im
super
glad
i
bought
this
and
would
love
to
have
another
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
big
and
yet
hidden
but
this
is
a
massive
goliath
of
a
beer
and
a
definite
sipper
it
feels
bigger
and
bigger
to
you
as
you
go
but
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
flavor
has
a
beautiful
complexity
and
a
great
length
i
really
have
to
say
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
so
its
a
tad
depressing
knowing
that
i
have
just
about
the
last
one
shipped
to
the
us
but
i
guess
i
will
have
to
hunt
out
similar
examples
of
the
style
if
you
can
get
this
near
you
surely
worth
a
try
drinks
very
smooth
the
thickchewy
body
still
goes
down
great
d
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
necessarily
a
standout
here
o
friggin
scots
and

was

mostly

while
this

wasnt

i
thought
i
might
really
be
onto
something
i
searched
around
and
this
was
the
first
import
scotch
ale
i
could
find
and
wow
nectar
of
the
gods
for
me
smoky
finish
so
im
left
to
wonder
how
old
this
is
as
it
just
has
a
great
aged
quality
to
it
id
say
its
got
some
of
the
qualities
of
a
j

lees
harvest
ale
and
brown
sugar
body
is
medium
good
kick
sugar
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
it
is
slightly
herbal
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
caramelized
malts
solid
carbonation
this
one
is
seriously
crazy
but
the
somewhat
nebulous
scotch
alewee
heavy
style
doesnt
give
me
good
enough
guidemarks
to
rate
it
highly
for
stylistic
fidelity

the

a

scotch
ale
in

in

are

a

this
tastes
bland
maybe
i
was
given
an
old
can
hopefully
i
can
revisit
this
beer
in
the
future
overall
a
very
delicious
scotch
ale
that
has
a
more
moderate
abv
at
least
for
a
scotch
but
yet
tons
of
great
flavor
a
very
nice
on
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
this
is
a
very
drinkable
scotch
ale
that
ive
imbibed
numerous
times
watching
football
on
a
chill
autumn
weekend
at
one
of
the
local
establishments
my
only
knock
is
that
its
a
little
bland
and
could
use
some
complexity
maybe
ramping
up
the
smokiness
just
a
smidge
not
too
much
and
a
wee
bit
more
bittering
hops
in
my
area
this
beer
sells
for
about
8
50
for
a
4pack
of
pint
cans
which
is
very
reasonable
a
fine
maltforward
beer
loaded
with
light
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
smoke
seems
to
come
out
with
time
but
i
would
say
it
is
balanced
nicely
by
toasted
malts
and
fairly
strong
yeast
fruit
notes
drinks
like
a
slightly
smoked
english
brown
loved
cold
smoke
this
was
a
very
generous
gift
from
a
man
who
frankly
was
far
too
busy
with
his
wedding
to
remember
this
beer
for
me
but
he
did
a
testament
to
his
awesomeness
and
thoughtfulness
and
it
certainly
did
not
disappoint
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
has
me
keen
for
more
a
deep
maple
amber
colored
brew
not
real
heady
but
some
bubbles
and
a
thin
tan
film
are
visible
radiant
glow
to
it
real
low
wintery
looking
sturdy
and
emitting
amazing
and
enticing
aromatics
of
birch
syrup
soft
smoke
oak
chocolate
and
specialty
red
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
molasses
sweetness
it
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
maybe
better
a
very
long
flavor
trip
it
starts
hearty
and
malty
but
not
sweet
or
as
heavy
as
many
its
also
quite
subtle
with
the
smoke
very
northern
alaskan
or
maine
or
something
rustic
and
woodsy
hair
on
the
chesty
stuff
here
but
the
smoke
is
only
one
component
of
many
beautiful
body
smooth
and
rich
but
again
only
just
sweet
enough
ale
yeast
but
with
some
lager
properties
suggesting
cold
and
slow
fermentation
and
a
patience
for
the
process
truly
one
of
the
better
and
more
sessionable
american
scotch
ales
ive
encountered
and
i
am
extremely
thankful
to
the
groom
for
remembering
to
share
this
with
me
on
his
big
day
memorable
dark
mahogany
pour
with
a
quickly
fading
one

beige
head
with
minimal
lacing
really
nice
sweet
malty
nose
with
hints
of
caramel
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
brown
bread
molasses
and
just
a
touch
of
cocoa
the
taste
follows

with
sweet
roasty
caramel
malt
up

along
with
hints
of
tobacco
brown
bread

subtle
peaty

bringing
this
one
back
a
decently
tasty
scotch
ale
kind
of
on
the
easydrinking
side
of
the
style
spectrum
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
popular
beer
in
its
area
but
i
think
a
lot
of
what
makes
it
more
palatable
makes
it
less
exciting
to
me
o
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
nice
complexity
with
the
different
aromas
and
flavors
the
carbonation
is
too
damn
high
poured
into
a
pint
glass
perfect
pour
with
a
nice
amount
of
light
tan
head
that
went
straight
to
the
brim
of
the
glass
beer
color
is
more
like
a
porter
deep
amberbrown
smells
of
vanilla
oak
slight
hint
of
fruit
overtone
of
grapes
tastes
very
smokey
malty
sweet
chocolate
slight
bitterness
from
hops
very
faint
but
in
the
aftertaste
real
smooth
on
the
palate
a
little
creamy
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
goes
down
like
a
nice
stout
this
is
very
well
balanced
beer
never
thought
i
liked
scotch
ales
until
i
had
this
and
the
three
floyds
one
very
nice
overall
we
were
surprised
that
this
one
finished
one
or
two
for
all
of
us
weve
all
had
it
a
million
times
and
we
couldnt
pick
this
one
out
of
the
two
we
thought
it
might
be
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
worth
drinking
for
sure
got
this
beer
from
a
friend
who
went
to
montana
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
nice
bit
of
lacing
not
much
retention
aroma
a
bit
of
nice
caramel
and
mild
toffee
flavor
is
mild
does
not
have
much
of
the
caramel
or
toffee
that
is
in
the
aroma
very
mild
caramel
and
a
bit
of
maybe
roast
there
is
also
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
theres
really
not
much
going
on
mouthfeel
is
too
light
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
too
high
overall
this
beer
is
nice
but
definitely
not
a
great
scotch
ale
i
think
another
point
or
two
of
abv
and
maybe
a
bit
more
body
would
have
been
helpful
do
very
impressed
with
my
first
kettlehouse
offering
may
not
in
the
top
tier
scotch
ale
conversation
but
very
solid
nonetheless
thanks
fdkayti
the
epitome
of
creamy
like
milkshakes
and
pudding
all
at
once
velvety
smooth
sticky
flavor
linger
here
and
there
but
the
finish
isnt
long
lasting
enough
to
really
be
a
full
level
stickiness
its
a
here
a
there
not
everywhere
really
really
like
this
beer
it
makes
me
want
to
get
more
of
their
stuff
no
jokes
on
that
time
waster
drain
pour
not
remotely
a
scotch
ale
i
cannot
believe
the
other
reviewers
were
drinking
the
same
product
as
i
cold
smoke
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
a
somewhat
rare
brew
in
fact
i
hadnt
even
heard
of
a
scotch
ale
only
scottish
ales
until
i
did
field
work
out
in
yellowstone
this
summer
and
brought
this
back
to
me
this
seems
to
be
more
balanced
than
the
majority
of
brown
ales
more
hops
while
still
retaining
an
alluring
sweetness
a
better
beer
than
double
haul
and
worth
the
2
50
i
paid
for
it
within
the
park
i
wonder
what
it
can
be
had
for
on
tap
or
at
a
more
reasonable
venue
overall
its
a
good
beer
this
is
a
pretty
strongly
average
scotch
ale
with
some
slightly
above
average
features
the
mouthfeel
is
certainly
the
weakspot
on
this
one
thin
and
a
tad
flat
with
no
appealing
carbonation
theres
a
bizarre
oversweetness
in
the
aftertaste
on
this
and
the
heat
comes
through
a
little
thick
in
the
beginning
balance
is
a
big
issue
in
this
beer
but
overall
it
comes
through
with
a
sweet
alcohol
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
classic
scotch
ale
not
bad
to
drink
but
also
not
that
easy
to
give
a
flattering
tick
overall
a
smackable
beer
not
to
sweet
but
brewed
to
the
style
i
would
think
most
beer
drinkers
would
enjoy
a
cold
one
of
these
o
a
really
good
maltforward
beer
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
the
next
time
im
in
montana
cold
smoke
hold
a
place
in
my
heart
as
one
of
the
best
beers
to
have
graced
my
tastebuds
like
the
name
a
pint
dripping
with
sweat
and
crisp
white
head
leaves
me
dreaming
of
the
a
days
turns
in
the
seemingly
never
ending
cold
smoke
of
a
fresh
powder
day
and
its
august
overall
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
o
this
brew
reminds
me
of
being
in
glacier
national
park
awesome
cant
wait
to
go
back
and
enjoy
more
of
this
fine
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
hunt
but
definitely
seek
great
job
kettlehouse
overall
nice
enjoyed
this
canned
beer
quite
a
bit
i
guess
i
prefer
especially
for
this
category
for
the
flavors
to
be
a
little
more
bold
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
just
nothing
that
would
make
me
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
poured
from
16
oz
can
a
darker
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
stayed
around
a
bit
not
exactly
sure
what
the
nose
picked
up
but
the
taste
was
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
and
an
ever
so
slight
bit
of
hop
bitternessbite
at
the
end
decent
brew
but
i
definitely
prefer
the
eddy
out
over
this
one
another
one
shared
by
schmittymack
on
saturday
evening
this
one
poured
from
the
tall
boy
can
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
lingering
tan
head
aromas
of
toffee
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
smoke
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
caramel
toffee
sweet
malt
and
a
little
smoke
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
rather
mild
some
malts
present
taste
is
good
lots
of
malts
some
sweetness
hints
of
coffee
just
a
touch
of
hops
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
this
scotch
ale
has
a
great
look
its
a
deep
rich
brown
liquid
with
a
creamy
ecru
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
theres
a
touch
of
peat
in
there
along
with
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
a
touch
sweeter
than
id
prefer
but
its
still
quite
good
a
little
more
smokiness
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
its
a
pleasant
enjoyable
beer
and
i
could
imagine
having
it
in
regular
rotation
especially
for
fans
of
the
style
good
stuff
nice
flavor
profile
somewhat
mild
but
clean
and
without
any
offflavors
the
dark
malts
suggest
bakers
chocolate
coffee
and
a
toasted
nuttiness
and
are
wellbalanced
by
an
earthy
herbal
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
silky
at
the
same
time
the
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
pepper
the
front
sides
of
the
tongue
while
still
allowing
the
beer
to
finish
with
a
velvety
gulp
quite
a
wellcrafted
scotch
ale
this
not
the
most
flavorful
or
eyeopening
of
the
bunch
but
it
drinks
incredibly
well
for
the
style
would
i
buy
more
of
it
hells
yes
great
stuff
in
a
great
big
awesomelooking
can
loads
of
malty
goodness
and
just
about
perfect
on
a
cold
night
in
front
of
the
fireplace
with
the
right
price
point
i
could
see
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
during
a
winter
evening
hopefully
one
day
ill
end
up
in
montana
to
go
skiing
and
make
it
happen
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
solid
scotch
ale
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
with
lingering
coffee
and
roast
malt
profiles
drinkable
oh
yeah
very
one
easydrinking
scotch
ale
no
heat
from
the
fortifying
booze
at
all
which
means
that
the
name
is
at
least
halfright
the
titular
smoke
being
pretty
ethereal
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
overly
heavy
or
high
on
abv
this
is
the
first
wee
heavy
ive
tried
but
it
sets
a
pretty
decent
standard
overall
this
was
a
nicely
done
scotch
ale
very
smooth
and
generous
with
different
varities
of
malt
flavors
well
worth
a
shot
long
time
since
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
a
cold
smoke
compared
with
a
few
other
topgrade
examples
within
the
style
it
could
have
a
little
more
bulk
nevertheless
a
very
nice
easydrinking
scotch
ale
that
is
worth
a
trip
to
the
kettlehouse
taproom
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
yourself
in
missoula
the
body
was
typical
and
drinkability
was
slightly
above
average
overall
a
decent
example
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
my
pour
created
two
fingers
worth
of
bubbly
thick
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
colabrown
with
nequality
clarity
and
ruby
highlights
nose
was
sweet
milk
chocolaty
cocoa
and
coffee
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
more
muted
sweetness
on
the
tongue
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
finish
had
a
coffeecocoa
flavor
that
lingered
this
was
nowhere
near
as
sweet
as
i
had
girded
myself
to
expect
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
its
absence
of
noticeable
hops
made
it
less
compelling
than
many
americanipas
would
be
for
me
spent
a
week
in
missoula
last
september
stopped
in
to
the
kettlehouse
brewery
and
tried
this
beer
after
being
disappointed
in
their
bongwater
porter
the
name
fits
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
found
this
beer
on
tap
most
everywhere
we
ate
on
tap
the
only
other
wee
heavy
id
had
was
an
import
from
scotland
this
beer
comes
damn
close
a
strong
offering
from
the
folks
up
in
montana
not
as
good
as
old
chub
but
still
very
tasty
love
seeing
craft
beer
in
cans
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
both
good
the
ale
is
really
smooth
and
a
little
thick
appearance
is
rather
ordinary
nothing
to
make
you
go
wow
but
a
typical
looking
scotch
ale
this
beer
however
delivers
in
superior
taste
and
drinkability
at
6
5
abv
this
drinks
like
a
4
5
a
great
scotch
ale
and
very
good
entry
beer
for
those
wanting
to
sample
different
styles
without
taking
a
big
risk
dtasty
stuff
this
alone
could
let
me
down
multiples
i
like
the
smoked
elements
plus
the
sweetness
is
not
overwhelming
a
fault
i
see
in
many
scotch
ales
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
tasty
brew
from
a
can
no
less
give
it
just
a
bit
more
body
and
round
out
the
smoothness
and
this
could
become
a
world
beater
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
not
as
sweet
as
expected
as
most
scotch
ales
i
have
had
have
been
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
is
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
not
a
bad
lil
scotch
ale
though
i
could
stand
and
would
appreciate
a
ramped
up
peaty
smokiness
drinkability
great
i
have
found
a
new
favorite
scotch
ale
one
that
should
be
the
keystone
to
which
the
style
is
interpreted
peaty
malty
and
creamy
not
to
mention
that
it
comes
in
a
can
very
nice
this
is
a
really
approachable
broad
pleasing
kind
of
beer
i
think
it
would
be
tasty
with
lots
of
different
kinds
of
foods
if
you
can
find
it
give
it
a
try
the
pint
went
down
easier
then
most
anything
ive
ever
drank
ive
had
glasses
of
warm
milk
at
bedtime
give
me
a
rougher
time
too
bad
i
only
had
one
can
time
to
hit
the
trading
forums
i
have
1
more
in
the
cellar
i
will
probably
keep
it
for
a
rainy
day
but
you
never
know
cold
smoke
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
really
like
to
share
with
friends
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
pretty
tasty
brew
id
drink
this
regularly
if
it
was
available
to
me
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
surlys
bender
without
all
the
big
flavor
like
its
little
brother
thanks
again
to
johngalt1
drinkability
i
want
to
buy
a
plane
ticket
to
missoula
so
i
can
access
this
beer
continually
i
fear
itll
be
far
too
long
until
this
rare
treasure
passes
my
lips
again
i
could
drink
one
or
two
of
these
but
i
need
my
hops
and
this
is
a
good
one
to
have
between
a
couple
of
hoppy
beers
to
cleanse
the
palate
as
you
will
draught
big
sky
this
one
pours
a
ruby
tinged
brown
color
it
has
a
fairly
decent
frothy
off
white
head
on
it
but
it
doesnt
last
too
long
a
bit
of
a
roasted
sweet
malt
to
the
nose
as
well
as
some
smokiness
i
didnt
really
get
any
peat
out
of
it
as
i
might
expect
in
a
scotch
ale
a
good
medium
body
and
flavor
mainly
the
sweet
roasted
malts
that
were
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
some
of
the
smokiness
some
lurking
hops
for
balance
but
fairly
hidden
decent
d
very
flavorfull
would
have
tasted
better
on
a
nice
cold
winter
day
very
good
beer
nonetheless
this
dark
scotch
ale
was
not
as
impressive
as
the
others
at
the
brewery
the
roasted
malt
was
paired
with
a
fruity
hop
character
the
brew
was
light
and
refreshinga
little
too
light
and
refreshing
for
a
style
of
ale
that
was
probably
created
to
impart
the
need
in
man
to
throw
objects
in
many
different
ways
for
sport
or
war
overall
i
didnt
like
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
poor
example
of
the
style
the
taste
didnt
remind
me
much
of
a
wee
heavy
and
i
thought
it
tasted
more
like
a
poorly
brewed
old
ale
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
the
smoothest
it
was
cloying
a
little
sticky
flat
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
half
the
bottle
is
enough
for
me
anymore
than
that
and
i
think
it
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
and
it
was
fairly
unique
but
it
just
wasnt
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
off
of
the
style
it
was
the
only
aspect
i
think
that
could
be
identified
to
be
scotch
ale
like
would
be
the
appearance
other
than
that
it
would
be
a
tough
sell
to
convince
me
this
is
what
a
wee
heavy
is
suppose
to
taste
like
i
also
didnt
like
how
it
had
pretty
much
no
carbonation
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
and
theres
a
good
chance
i
would
turn
it
down
if
i
was
offered
one
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
a
beer
or
a
wee
heavy
its
not
a
great
example
of
either
all
in
all
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
it
just
had
too
many
things
wrong
with
it
and
it
didnt
do
justice
for
the
style
this
is
now
my
least
favorite
dragonmead
beer
and
its
now
one
of
my
least
favorite
wee
heavys
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
needs
a
lot
of
work
o
pretty
good
flavor
balance
easy
to
drink
smells
real
good
gonna
have
to
try
this
one
at
the
brewery
on
tap
only
let
down
out
of
the
bottle
was
the
lack
of
a
head
or
lacing
meh
ok
but
not
wonderful
deep
brown
almost
black
coloring
upon
pour
12oz
bottle
into
snifter
very
little
head
but
off
white
where
it
is
nice
caramel
molasses
on
the
nose
very
smooth
sweetness
upon
a
low
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
great
scotch
alewee
heavy
give
her
a
try
cheers
o
unique
taste
indeed
probably
not
at
its
best
but
then
again
the
bottle
was
from
a
reliable
store
and
carefully
coldstored
for
just
a
few
months
i
note
other
reviewers
have
reported
bad
versions
of
the
bottled
ale
overall
this
is
a
winner
very
enjoyable
on
a
cool
fall
night
overall
that
is
a
tasty
brew
sweet
but
balanced
dark
and
rich
knowingly
alcoholic
not
much
you
could
do
to
make
it
better
nice
brew
in
a
style
that
is
very
traditional
and
when
done
right
like
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
thanks
to
my
man
rick
for
bringing
this
back
from
michigan
for
me
under
the
kilt
isnt
exactly
cheap
i
paid
3
for
this
bottle
but
i
cant
say
that
it
isnt
worth
that
slight
upcharge
a
truly
outstanding
beer
with
an
awesomely
tasty
blend
of
dark
fruits
malts
hops
and
scotch
that
keeps
me
coming
for
another
sip
now
one
of
my
favorite
beers
one
of
dragonmeads
more
manageable
options
much
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
although
the
bottle
is
still
tasty
its
got
a
tartness
that
may
be
a
little
distracting
as
it
seems
more
akin
to
slight
unintended
infection
rather
than
intentional
souring
it
always
goes
down
easy
although
quality
control
might
be
a
concern
overall
this
just
tastes
good
and
fruity
if
youre
patient
enough
to
wait
for
the
head
to
go
down
its
delicious
the
problem
is
when
i
want
beer
i
want
it
now
it
just
takes
too
long
but
its
good
once
you
get
it
o
definitely
true
to
its
style
its
very
sweet
and
fruity
though
skull
splitter
is
still
my
wee
heavy
of
choice
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
some
lighter
brown
highlights
some
filmy
pools
on
the
top
lots
of
junk
in
the
bottom
fairly
mild
nose
is
mainly
chocolate
with
some
light
dried
fruit
taste
is
likewise
strong
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
breadiness
and
raisins
a
touch
of
grain
stronger
spicy
caramel
shows
through
in
the
aftertaste
feel
is
think
and
creamy
although
the
aftertaste
is
hort
and
doesnt
really
coat
your
mouth
this
ones
tasty
although
not
as
good
as
some
scotch
ales
ive
head
12
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
no
bottle
dating
pours
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fairly
dense
1
finger
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
nice
soapy
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
huge
raisin
grape
plum
molasses
caramel
toasted
malt
bread
and
light
earthiness
pretty
nice
aromas
that
are
much
fruitier
than
i
was
expecting
taste
of
big
raisin
plum
tart
cherry
caramel
molasses
toast
light
chocolate
bread
earth
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twang
lingering
notes
of
dark
fruit
molasses
caramel
bread
and
earth
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
flavors
are
quite
balanced
but
there
are
a
bit
of
off
flavors
noticeable
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
as
expected
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
well
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
wee
heavy
it
was
certainly
fruitier
than
i
was
anticipating
but
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
ill
give
this
beer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
the
overall
category
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
it
again
fresh
nothing
wrong
here
but
it
sure
was
not
interesting
either
it
was
easy
to
drink
with
its
clean
malt
flavor
i
wish
i
had
a
non
infected
version
overall
this
isnt
bad
it
has
a
lot
going
on
in
the
profile
i
just
dont
know
if
all
of
those
notes
belong
some
more
bubbles
would
go
a
long
way
here
onot
too
bad
not
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
alesbut
decent
o
really
liked
this
one
coming
to
realize
that
a
i
really
like
scotch
ale
and
b
dragonmead
knows
beer
medium
body
with
a
slightly
chewy
feel
alcohol
lends
some
warmth
which
is
nice
for
the
style
a
pretty
well
made
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
wee
heavy
that
does
not
blow
me
away
but
is
quite
enjoyable
this
is
only
my
second
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
am
much
more
impressed
by
this
offering
overall
the
plum
flavor
is
a
little
too
overpowering
for
me
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
though
as
others
have
already
mentioned
there
are
better
scotch
ales
out
there
especially
when
the
price
is
taken
into
account
worth
trying
once
but
ill
probably
never
seek
it
out
again
overall
very
awesome
beer
lots
of
depth
to
it
maybe
a
touch
too
tasting
of
alcohol
but
what
do
you
expect
for
a
nearly
8
brew
i
like
it
first
sip
is
fairly
sweet
although
it
can
be
a
bit
distracting
from
the
overall
mouthfeel
taste
is
a
bit
more
coppery
than
i
was
expecting
still
as
scotch
ales
go
this
one
is
pretty
much
what
you
should
expect
from
it
not
that
its
quite
on
par
with
a
founders
dirty
bastard
or
dark
horse
scotty
karate
but
still
a
pretty
this
beer
is
okay
but
to
me
it
almost
seems
like
a
dark
belgian
rather
than
a
scotch
ale
and
not
great
at
either
ill
seek
out
another
bottle
at
some
point
to
see
if
something
was
abnormal
with
this
one
or
better
yet
make
a
trip
to
the
brewery
because
all
the
tap
reviews
look
a
lot
different
than
the
bottle
ones
a
good
beer
overall
but
im
not
sure
what
its
supposed
to
be
the
sourness
reminds
me
of
three
philosphers
but
theres
no
mention
of
it
on
the
bottle
or
packaging
its
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
it
misses
the
style
mark
like
crazy
d
i
thought
this
beer
was
good
but
nothing
amazing
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
also
easy
to
forget
towards
the
end
there
was
a
hint
of
sour
tang
probably
due
to
age
but
this
was
nonetheless
a
satisfying
interpretation
of
a
rather
uncommon
style
and
is
definitely
recommended
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
very
dark
copper
brown
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
settles
and
then
collars
around
the
glass
the
aroma
on
this
is
interesting
with
a
sour
fruit
like
smell
mixed
with
caramel
and
vegetable
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
creamy
texture
the
taste
is
i
think
a
little
better
than
the
aroma
with
a
soft
subdued
spiced
apple
taste
mixed
with
some
notes
of
alcohol
also
has
a
sour
pear
taste
not
terrible
but
like
no
other
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
had
before
overall
not
a
scotch
ale
worth
seeking
out
while
i
would
still
consider
it
a
scotch
ale
its
pretty
close
to
being
called
a
scottish
ale
due
to
the
weak
flavor
and
thin
body
dragonmead
sells
this
beer
in
a
4
bottle
box
you
will
need
a
friends
help
with
this
or
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
d
this
is
my
first
dragonmead
beer
so
im
not
too
familiar
with
them
i
liked
this
one
but
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
to
style
i
would
grab
a
sixer
of
this
once
in
a
while
if
it
was
available
to
me
a
couple
in
a
night
would
be
fine
but
more
than
that
would
get
me
into
trouble
i
have
had
my
eye
on
this
beer
for
a
while
ive
come
to
love
dragonmead
but
am
slightly
disappointed
in
their
wee
heavy
interpretation
overall
sad
i
couldnt
have
this
beer
in
its
unspoiled
glory
but
i
am
still
finding
myself
enjoying
what
is
left
of
the
complexities
of
this
brew
beneath
a
sour
blanket
dragonmead
should
consider
deliberately
souring
some
of
this
wee
heavy
next
time
i
am
in
mi
i
will
snag
another
bottle
because
i
have
heard
nothing
but
good
things
about
their
brews
hopefully
i
have
a
better
experience
next
time
around
my
score
is
style
based
as
i
said
its
not
bad
soured
drinkability
is
good
not
necessarily
a
sipper
needs
a
little
more
punch
nice
carbonation
despite
the
small
head
possible
due
to
higher
abv
although
it
is
not
listed
on
the
bottle
not
overdone
this
wee
heavy
goes
down
easy
and
has
enough
depth
of
flavor
to
hold
its
own
with
some
haggis
and
mashers
reddish
amber
color
topped
by
a
thin
tan
head
very
sweet
aroma
of
graham
cracker
and
dark
fruit
palate
is
very
fruity
up
front
with
a
bready
character
emerging
on
the
finish
with
a
good
dose
of
booze
body
is
just
a
touch
sticky
pleasurable
but
not
exactly
easydrinking
still
overall
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
sparkly
and
like
pop
rocks
on
my
tongue
drinkability
is
nonexistent
perhaps
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
infected
or
not
avoid
at
all
costs
i
spent
like
4
on
this
bottle
oh
well
at
least
i
didnt
get
a
6
pack
down
the
drain
with
you
dragonmead
dgood
beer
overall
as
it
has
a
richness
that
lingers
and
nice
balance
of
flavors
d
this
is
a
very
rich
and
a
lot
of
strong
and
earthy
flavors
definitely
a
good
scotch
ale
and
is
certainly
my
favorite
from
dragonmead
comes
out
of
the
tap
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
rich
malty
woody
and
slightly
honeysweet
mouth
filling
malty
flavor
has
undertones
of
molasses
and
honey
and
just
a
hint
of
woody
taste
texture
is
fizzy
and
tingly
quite
satisfying
d
pretty
good
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
this
poured
a
cloudy
dark
mahogany
with
almost
no
head
it
smelled
like
caramel
and
roasted
barley
and
fig
with
some
balsamic
vinegar
and
pear
it
tasted
like
wild
flower
honey
and
burnt
sugar
and
blackberry
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
oak
it
was
thin
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
sharp
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
pretty
interesting
beer
that
used
not
sweet
versions
of
naturally
sweet
flavors
i
e
burnt
sugar
it
had
weak
body
but
it
hid
the
alcohol
fairly
well
so
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
this
was
good
to
try
once
but
wasnt
something
i
really
care
to
drink
again
d
not
bad
at
all
reasonable
balance
and
pretty
good
flavors
i
had
this
on
tap
during
my
recent
trip
to
warren
over
the
weekend
and
must
say
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
scottish
ales
great
caramel
roast
flavor
and
the
classic
scotch
ale
yeast
flavor
that
lovers
of
this
style
have
come
to
expect
this
is
a
great
brew
so
i
picked
up
a
4
pk
to
bring
home
glad
i
did
great
brew
this
beer
poured
an
almost
black
dark
amber
color
and
formed
a
medium
tan
foamy
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
cocoa
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
malt
coffee
and
hint
of
cocoa
the
body
was
medium
and
the
finish
was
astringent
and
slightly
burnt
drinkability
a
very
odd
wee
heavy
lacking
in
the
appropriate
butterscotch
smoke
and
peat
and
replacing
that
with
an
unusual
sourness
drinkable
but
way
off
style
and
not
particularly
tasty
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
easily
and
i
could
easily
sip
my
way
through
more
than
one
during
an
evening
ill
be
returning
to
this
one
whenever
possible
overall
a
unique
representation
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
that
ive
had
i
think
both
dark
horse
scotty
karate
and
founders
dirty
bastard
both
brew
better
local
representations
because
of
the
better
local
alternatives
i
probably
will
not
buy
this
one
again
worth
trying
dark
ruby
color
and
a
dense
tan
head
smells
like
prunes
alcohol
sweet
malted
barley
and
sugary
carmel
awesome
creamy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
light
roasted
coffeelike
flavor
with
a
little
alcohol
warmth
heavy
malt
presence
otherwise
the
same
aromas
are
in
the
flavor
as
well
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
heavy
highalcohol
beer
this
is
good
beer
pours
out
a
deep
ruby
red
color
about
a
finger
of
offwhite
frothy
head
very
little
lacing
smells
are
of
malts
and
sugar
has
a
very
sweet
smell
to
it
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
taste
is
also
sweet
a
bit
fruity
finishes
off
a
little
bitter
its
pretty
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
is
well
carbonated
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
although
its
definitely
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
bite
of
carbonation
mouth
is
pretty
thick
and
satisfying
as
this
style
calls
for
drinkability
in
the
overall
sense
is
good
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
wee
heavy
style
and
is
another
standout
in
dragonmeads
portfolio
its
a
wee
pricey
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
other
locally
available
scotch
ales
which
reduces
its
appeal
to
me
but
i
do
like
what
this
one
brings
to
the
table
and
all
fans
of
the
style
owe
it
to
themselves
to
give
it
a
try
notes
dragonmead
was
my
first
microbrewery
ive
ever
went
to
their
quality
years
later
is
still
great
bottle
2008
a
cloudy
rusty
pour
with
a
miniscule
tan
head
aroma
is
some
sweet
malt
and
carameltoffee
with
a
little
spicey
hop
accent
sweet
malts
caramel
and
only
a
hint
of
chocolatecoffeesmoke
a
little
more
lively
than
i
would
like
but
not
terrible
finishes
clean
with
just
a
slight
hop
note
lingering
in
the
throat
is
the
caramel
malt
all
in
all
not
bad
and
a
little
unique
for
the
style
d
nice
blend
of
drinkability
and
peat
smoked
malts
a
little
nuttyvery
good
i
would
buy
this
again
taste
rich
and
creamy
with
a
sweet
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
d
not
too
bad
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
edit
had
some
on
tap
at
the
great
taste
08
and
it
was
significantly
fresher
more
richness
in
the
flavor
no
astringency
id
get
this
on
tap
again
but
would
avoid
the
bottles
overall
a
great
example
of
a
style
that
ive
begun
to
appreciate
more
and
more
it
tastes
and
feels
like
this
bottle
of
under
the
kilt
wee
heavy
scotchstyle
ale
is
a
bit
worn
and
is
not
in
perfect
working
order
ive
decided
not
to
comment
on
the
obvious
association
between
advanced
age
and
flacidity
because
no
one
wants
or
needs
that
mental
image
the
search
for
a
second
bottle
has
now
officially
begun
good
stuff
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
hrmm
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
better
on
tap
at
the
brewery
not
my
cup
of
tea
with
quite
a
few
faults
and
totally
out
of
style
pass
on
this
especially
if
youre
getting
charged
up
the
wazoo
for
bottles
a
heavy
intense
and
totally
inappropriate
interpretation
rated
as
a
beer
not
as
a
scotch
ale
d
its
safe
to
say
that
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
mediocre
wee
heavy
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
some
lighter
brown
highlights
some
filmy
pools
on
the
top
lots
of
junk
in
the
bottom
fairly
mild
nose
is
mainly
chocolate
with
some
light
dried
fruit
taste
is
likewise
strong
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
breadiness
and
raisins
a
touch
of
grain
stronger
spicy
caramel
shows
through
in
the
aftertaste
feel
is
think
and
creamy
although
the
aftertaste
is
hort
and
doesnt
really
coat
your
mouth
this
ones
tasty
although
not
as
good
as
some
scotch
ales
ive
head
a
touch
disappointing
given
the
hype
this
micro
has
around
michigan
area
cheers
d
not
a
great
choice
for
summer
but
overall
not
bad
i
would
get
this
again
and
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
drinkability
somewhat
discordant
components
and
not
really
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
the
flavors
are
intriguing
even
boundarypushing
but
they
just
dont
do
it
for
me
d
likable
wee
heavy
but
with
some
issues
that
i
couldnt
quite
get
over
in
particular
the
dark
bitterness
and
slight
sourness
i
guess
i
was
looking
for
more
malt
sweetness
still
its
good

liking
just
not
full
enough
to
balance
making
it
slightly
cloying
however
it
is
still
a
very
tasty
scot
hints
of
peat
smoke
melted
chocolate
of
the
milk
variety
bing
cherry
raisin
toffee
and
thick
sweet
gooey
toffee
bottle
purchased
at
merchants
in
dearborn
pours
dark
with
a
reddish
hue
nice
solid
creamy
head
chocolately
and
smokey
malt
odor
sweet
peaty
malt
flavor
with
some
smokiness
very
tasty
alcohol
not
noticeable
at
all
some
biscuity
malt
but
mostly
the
beer
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
peaty
flavor
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
well
made
a
great
rendition
of
the
style
my
first
from
dragonmead
is
a
winner
hazy
dark
chestnut
with
a
light
brownyellowish
head
some
lacing
good
retention
the
aroma
was
chocolatey
a
little
dry
cocoa
light
roast
with
a
bit
of
lactic
character
the
flavour
was
quite
sweet
very
malty
with
plenty
of
caramel
and
toffee
nuts
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
some
dry
roastiness
creamy
texture
full
bodied
and
lightish
carbonation
very
nice
the
full
maltiness
really
works
here
d
a
very
good
wee
heavy
d
it
was
good
but
nothing
too
good
if
you
happen
to
come
across
some
pick
it
up
people
out
there
have
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
have
very
attractive
deep
brownpurplemud
color
the
smell
makes
me
think
of
the
cumulative
effect
of
thanksgiving
dinner
just
as
all
dishes
are
about
ready
for
serving
and
some
type
of
dessert
is
in
the
oven
lots
of
earthy
robust
smells
but
warm
toffee
and
malts
dominate
taste
is
a
gentle
combination
of
malts
and
toffee
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
not
forceful
with
the
malts
the
tastes
blend
superbly
finish
has
a
hint
of
liquor
scotch
grappa
maybe
sambucasoaked
coffee
beans
but
this
is
almost
an
afterthought
not
forceful
or
artificial
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
smooth
thick
and
creamy
with
an
ideal
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
barely
perceptible
let
alone
enough
to
hint
at
the
7
80
abv
immensely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
flavor
is
quite
nice
smokey
peat
with
lots
of
tart
malts
and
caramels
rather
sweet
kind
od
a
dark
cherry
thing
going
on
too
medium
body
but
perhaps
a
bit
thin
overall
all
kind
of
tinny
too
still
very
drinkable
overall
if
i
lived
in
michigan
id
definitely
buy
this
again
and
again
mouth
is
superb
an
extra
thanks
to
skyhand
for
the
suggestion
to
trade
for
this
overall
an
easy
drinking
powerfully
tasting
scotch
ale
maybe
a
little
light
on
complexity
im
not
sure
if
the
vinegar
smell
was
intended
but
it
was
definitely
something
that
i
didnt
expect
and
seemed
out
of
place
for
the
style
ill
have
to
give
this
another
try
to
see
if
that
one
has
the
same
smell
as
is
i
still
think
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
thanks
tim
full
bodied
sweet
up
front
and
dry
in
the
finish
not
much
lingering
flavor
not
hugely
drinkable
but
itll
put
some
hair
on
your
balls
overall
its
good
now
its
time
to
bring
on
the
glenlivet
dark
ruby
grape
juice
brown
with
good
amount
of
bubbles
and
head
vineous
and
booze
and
smell
of
bourbon
and
barrel
but
its
not
that
version
its
just
aged
1
5
years
picked
up
from
whole
earth
in
detroit
mildly
sour
and
spicey
and
so
smooth
and
malted
taste
is
much
like
i
expected
with
chocolate
malt
and
a
roasted
smoky
flavoring
nice
carbonation
levels
that
fizz
on
the
tongue
just
before
swallowing
for
almost
an
8
abv
they
hide
it
very
well
i
would
get
this
again
even
though
scotch
ales
are
not
my
favorite
brew
pours
out
an
almost
brown
dark
reddish
color
with
a
tall
tan
sticky
head
that
leaves
some
clingy
rings
of
lace
sweet
dark
fruits
with
some
earthy
notes
a
light
smokiness
is
also
present
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
starts
off
with
more
sweet
ripe
fruit
and
light
peaty
smoke
a
mild
earthy
bitterness
helps
balance
the
sweet
out
fruity
finish
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
pretty
thick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
really
easy
drinking
stuff
that
goes
down
like
a
smaller
beer
tasty
and
enjoyable
even
if
the
flavor
is
a
bit
simple
poured
from
the
tap
a
dull
tawny
brown
with
small
off
white
headaromas
of
caramel
malt
and
roasty
and
some
unsweetened
chocolate
flavors
are
pretty
vibrant
big
juicy
fruitiness
and
caramel
sweetness
with
a
light
smoky
peaty
character
in
the
finish
very
chewey
mouthfeel
but
glides
down
smoothly
a
very
well
made
heavy
rich
and
flavorful
in
my
notes
i
gave
this
beer
an
over
all
of
4
out
of
5
its
very
good
put
it
up
aginst
its
scotish
cousins
anyday
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
atop
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
trace
of
smokiness
caramel
and
chewy
malt
flavors
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
some
trace
of
an
alcohol
flavor
has
somewhat
of
a
homebrew
wang
to
itsort
of
a
sharpnessbitter
flavor
good
body
an
enjoyable
beer
though
the
sharpness
in
the
flavor
detracts
a
bit
for
me
well
worth
a
try
from
the
tap
poured
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
dark
fruits
nutty
toffee
flavor
roasted

anice
bitterness
a
good
beer
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
bewery
i
am
gald
they
bottle
this
so
i
can
just
pick
up
a
4
pack
every
now
and
than
bottle
obtained
from
the
beer
depot
in
ann
arbor
while
passing
through
over
the
holidays
pours
a
twofinger
light
caramel
head
over
a
clear
dark
brownamber
liquid
smells
coffee
roast
and
sweet
caramel
underneath
chocolate
tastes
flat
caramel
with
undertones
of
roast
and
chocolate
rich
tofee
rises
late
and
is
accompanied
by
a
grassy
dry
woody
edgy
caramelized
hint
of
smoke
this
beer
is
dry
dry
dry
in
the
finish
md
thick
body
and
moderately
carbonated
well
done
example
of
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
rich
brew
it
holds
a
depth
that
is
only
comparable
to
that
of
a
stout
and
thus
is
more
of
a
one
hitter
i
could
surely
see
myself
getting
in
over
my
head
with
these
however
this
would
be
good
for
dessert
after
a
hearty
meal
or
as
a
nightcap
to
end
the
day
which
i
shall
do
at
this
time
the
abv
makes
this
brew
a
bit
too
potent
for
session
work
although
it
serves
well
as
a
fall
or
winter
warmer
beer
nice
balance
between
flavors
and
malt
sweetness
a
must
try
for
malt
lovers
very
drinkable
wee
heavy
that
i
would
like
to
keep
around
what
a
beauty
on
draught
full
malty
core
coldconditioned
smooth
with
full
biscuit
roast
barley
and
a
flick
of
grapelike
fruitiness
never
cloying
never
filling
but
holding
strong
with
a
mediumfull
mouthfeel
opens
to
a
gorgeous
scent
of
longboil
caramelized
melanoidin
goodness
easy
to
drink
huge
while
simple
complex
but
smooth
with
a
hum
of
alcohol
to
remind
you
what
its
packin
underneath
all
that
malt
pours
deep
brown
with
reddish
highlights
good
head
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
soft
slight
bready
malty
smells
taste
is
well
blended
almost
a
hint
of
smoke
some
mineral
some
peat
well
blended
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
thick
this
is
a
good
beer
perhaps
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
still
really
good
this
beer
was
a
marvelous
surprise
i
found
some
of
this
while
i
was
pursuing
a
package
store
here
in
ann
arbor
it
poured
a
dark
amber
to
brown
clear
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
settled
to
a
sheet
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
had
an
overwhelming
toffee
character
backed
by
mild
citrus
and
a
distinct
fig
character
the
taste
has
the
toffee
like
biting
into
a
toffee
apple
more
of
the
citrus
and
loads
and
loads
of
caramel
alcohol
heat
kicks
in
on
the
finish
and
alters
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
making
it
just
a
little
rough
this
is
a
great
beer
right
up
there
with
the
stone
products
of
this
type
pours
clear
brown
with
ruby
tints
around
the
edges
and
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
forms
lacing
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
consists
of
some
sweet
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
followed
by
a
hint
of
noble
hops
flavor
is
fairly
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
huskygrainy
note
just
a
hint
of
smoke
and
fruitiness
and
enough
noble
hops
to
balance
the
malt
overall
a
very
good
scottish
ale
but
i
dont
really
think
its
big
enough
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
for
a
wee
heavy
and
it
falls
a
bit
short
of
my
expectations
i
prefer
mine
with
more
body
mouthfeel
and
a
thicker
maltier
presence
a
nice
offering
from
the
guys
at
dragonmead
pourd
out
to
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
odors
of
earth
and
malt
were
most
noted
as
were
hints
of
hops
and
brown
sugar
flavor
was
suprisingly
smooth
with
overtones
of
smoke
grain
and
burnt
grain
this
brew
also
was
quite
smooth
and
went
down
with
a
good
amout
of
ease
finished
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
grain
and
wheat
on
the
palate
a
touch
sour
as
well
ive
had
other
scotch
ales
and
if
i
had
my
choice
id
go
with
this
recommended
nice
full
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
light
brown
in
color
like
a
varnish
head
is
creamy
and
1
finger
tall
lasts
a
minute
or
too
then
dissipates
smell
is
of
butterscotch
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
taste
is
of
caramel
hops
butterrscotch
and
toffee
a
slight
cardboard
taste
overall
a
good
example
of
the
scotchstyle
ale
somewhat
higher
alcohol
content
is
hidden
pretty
well
the
roasted
flavor
probably
would
keep
from
downing
a
lot
or
using
as
a
session
beer
more
of
a
single
bottle
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
my
first
dragonmead
beer
if
theyre
all
this
good
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
brews
very
delicious
thanks
fantome
for
sharing
my
excellent
brotherinlaw
trbeer
brought
this
down
to
me
thanks
i
tried
this
one
a
few
months
ago
and
it
was
the
first
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
had
i
fell
in
love
with
the
style
that
night
i
also
think
dragonmead
is
the
perfect
atmosphere
to
drink
this
style
pours
a
nice
deep
caramel
color
with
a
huge
tan
colored
head
that
insists
on
hanging
around
for
the
duration
aroma
of
bourbon
with
nice
vanilla
and
caramel
are
evident
from
a
distance
of
a
foot
or
more
very
intense
aromas
up
close
beautiful
on
the
tongue
the
vanilla
is
present
backed
by
a
strong
alcoholic
burn
subsequent
sips
bring
back
thoughts
of
my
trips
to
bardstown
ky
slightly
medicinal
finish
mouthfeel
is
fairly
lively
for
a
brew
with
this
much
noticeable
alcohol
drinkability
is
ok
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
many
of
these
in
a
month
this
is
very
close
to
my
deserted
island
beer
slàinte
suas
leis
a
alba
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
satiny
smooth
one
of
the
finer
wee
heavies
easily
something
i
could
drink
all
day
many
thanks
to
trbeer
for
sharing
this
one
this
is
a
nice
clear
dark
brown
beer
with
red
highlights
the
head
is
short
and
light
tan
in
color
it
reduces
to
a
very
thin
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
sweet
slightly
smokey
and
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
good
the
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
the
roasted
smokey
flavor
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
substantial
it
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
its
hard
not
to
just
pour
it
down
in
one
big
gulp
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a

of
dense

over
the
raspberrybrown

head

slowly
down
to
a
layer
of

is
average
aroma
is
malty
with
peat
and
notes
of
alcohol
taste
is
as
well
of
medium
to
dark
malts
with
peat
notes
apparent
and
alcohol
warming
on
the
outset
mouthfeel
is
good
and
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
makes
for
a
sessionable
scotch
ale
which
is
always
a
scary
yet
enjoyable
proposition
drinkability
draught
version
is
definitely
better
this
version
is
decent
but
the
flavors
dont
mesh
as
well
and
the
minor
metallic
and
alcohol
hits
make
it
a
little
harsher

a
punch
with

by

nice
sipping

but
just
a
wee
heavy
for
the
average
beer
drinker
an
intense
scotch
style
ale
with
a
tawny
color
chewy
palate
and
a
fullbodied
rich
character
consider
the
appearance
and
smell
tentative
as
i
couldnt
gauge
them
in
the
format
they
were
presented
pure
british

toffee
perfect
integration
of
mineral
humus
rocks
soft
caramel
and
mocha
these
elements
entwine
in
a
perfectly
attenuated
package
of
satiny
smoothness
sweet
natured
but
far
from
cloying
clean
like
all
of
the
dragonmead
products
and
billowy
in
texture
not
complicated
odd
malt
profile
that
doesnt
match
up
well
with
the
barrel
a
rare
miss
for
revolutions

program
o
5
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
cant
believe
how
much
bourbon
they
were
able
to
impart
into
this
beer
its
one
of
the
most
delicious
brews
ive
ever
had
hands
down
lots
of
bourbon
tobacco
leather
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
one
of
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
ever
had
period
one
of
my
favorite
barrel
aged
revolution
beers
hope
to
see
this
bottled
regularly
pours
dark
brown
with
very
little
lift
making
it
through
this
beer
smell
has
aromas
of
english
toffe
candi
sugar
brown
sugar
vanilla
oak
and
a
bourbon
alcohol
finish
taste
follows
the
nose
with
toffee
malt
and
candi
sugar
first
to
hit
the
palate
moderate
caramel
sweetness
and
a
heafty
alchohol
presence
dominate
the
midsection
with
notes
of
charred
oak
barrel
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
more
alcohol
and
bourbon
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
wit
moderate
carbonation
and
an
alchohol
bite
in
the
finish
i
really
liked
this
beer
overall
doesnt
look
that
great
on
the
pour
but
wonderfully
smooth
and
beautifully
balanced
overall
overwhelmed
by
bourbon
you
only
get
a
glimpse
of
the
scotch
ale
at
the
beginning
then
all
bourbon
smooth
full
body
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
an
extremely
boozy
strong
ale
it
was
delicious
it
really
sets
the
tone
for
the
evening
o
bourbon
bomb
that
is
well
balanced
and
extremely
tasty
the
folks
at
revolution
are
quickly
turning
into
my
favorite
brewery
very
smooth
tasty
beer
but
the
smell
and
finish
were
almost
sickly
sweet
in
my
opinion
a
solid
4
25
definitely
would
enjoy
trying
this
again
in
the
future
ive
not
had
a
ton
in
this
style
that
are
barrel
aged
but
the
ones
ive
had
were
all
much
better
than
this
the
smell
is
nothing
but
bourbon
the
mouthfeel
is
just
flat
zero
carbonation
and
not
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
there
was
no
head
on
this
one
glad
this
was
something
a
friend
shared
with
me
and
i
didnt
seek
it
out
i
think
this
beer
is
worldclass
like
most
of
revolutions
beers
are
very
balanced
sweet
and
boozy
quasi
barleywineish
yet
very
drinkable
and
a
joy
to
savor
o
while
i
am
a
fan
of
bourbon
as
well
as
beer
this
comes
in
second
place
to
backwoods
bastard
for
me
which
is
itself
in
second
place
to
wulver
given
my
inability
to
find
much
beer
under
the
bourbon
combined
with
the
serious
alcohol
heat
that
poured
out
of
this
as
it
warmed
its
not
a
favorite
for
me
age
might
do
wonders
for
this
beer
however
taking
off
the
boozy
edge
and
allowing
the
malt
to
come
forward
john
what
have
you
done
you
told
me
this
was
really
goodthen
sent
me
one
its
like
telling
me
about
the
great
plate
of
scallops
at
the
place
down
the
street
then
telling
me
theyre
closing
tomorrow
revolution
has
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
is
one
excellent
hit
revolution
crafted
a
really
good
ba
scotch
ale
here
overall
an
excellent
bourbon
barrel
wee
heavy
a
do
think
it
is
slightly
hotboozy
across
the
entire
range
of
temperatures
and
a
tad
thin
on
body
but
has
some
really
good
qualities
for
me
even
though
i
enjoy
it
i
would
personally
have
a
hard
time
buying
again
based
on
the
fact
i
can
get
the
much
better
wulver
for
less
money
i
dont
think
anyone
would
be
disappointed
in
this
purchase
though
i
suggest
trying
yeah
theyre
not
tapping
last
years
bcs
for
a
few
hours
but
whatever
theres
a
barrelaged
scotch
ale
from
revolution
we
win
period
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
ruby
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
light
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
deep
bourbon
toffee
light
dark
greens
and
a
bit
of
mild
buttery
biscuit
the
taste
holds
notes
of
whiskey
caramel
malts
light
chocolate
mild
dark
greens
and
some
brief
flashes
of
oak
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
is
just
as
good
as
assumptions
would
lead
you
to
believe
it
would
be
very
good
times
indeed
diggin
this
what
about
you
billy
good
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
lots
of
bourbon
flavor
another
nice
deep
wood
series
beer
from
revolution
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
did
not
want
to
stop
drinking
hides
its
booziness
quite
well
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
abv
is
hidden
pretty
well
served
on
tap
at
the
brew
pub
appearance
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
decent
clarity
short
white
head
nose
is
bourbon
forward
with
heavy
vanilla
character
and
marshmallow
not
getting
much
from
the
base
beer
the
flavor
is
similar
with
huge
vanilla
notes
mild
smokiness
and
more
vanilla
the
flavor
isnt
ever
boozy
but
very
bourbony
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
mellow
overall
very
tasty
but
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
malt
character
a
barrel
aged
wee
heavy
that
is
as
smooth
as
the
fonze
the
vanilla
notes
really
shine
through
if
baby
jesus
had
a
floor
this
would
be
it
after
my
first
sips
i
recall
hearing
the
beatles
on
my
head
i
could
add
a
bunch
of
other
beer
mumbo
jumbo
but
i
dont
feel
it
appropriate
because
this
was
tasty
you
can
sort
of
taste
the
alcohol
but
at
9
7
it
is
not
that
noticeable
overall
an
incredible
scotch
ale
overall
very
fine
example
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
if
they
bottle
it
ill
definitely
pick
some
up
good
stuff
o
a
nice
ba
scotch
ale
that
has
been
aged
on
woodford
the
best
ive
seen
from
any
brewery
the
booze
is
hidden
well
but
still
there
and
the
base
beer
is
complimented
by
the
alcohol
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
it
would
be
great
if
they
had
this
more
often
this
was
excellent
and
was
really
aided
by
the
bourbon
barrel
deep
aromas
of
bourbon
and
peated
malt
mostly
bourbon
though
sweet
brown
sugar
vanilla
toasted
oak
some
light
spirit
fumes
the
peated
malt
comes
through
more
in
the
taste
rich
with
some
earthy
peat
complexity
still
identifiable
as
the
base
beer
with
layers
of
bourbon
barrel
characteristics
over
the
top
rich
and
burly
with
a
low
to
medium
carb
level
slight
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
but
its
tempered
by
the
big
malt
sweetness
though
not
fully
disguised
in
the
end
the
bourbon
character
slightly
overshadows
but
at
least
there
was
some
nuance
from
the
base
scotch
ale
unique
and
recommended
this
is
a
fine
ba
scotchwee
heavy
cant
say
ive
had
many
of
those
d
this
is
another
barrelaged
winner
from
revolution
i
dont
normally
like
ba
scotch
ales
but
this
was
delicious
and
i
actually
regret
not
ordering
a
full
serving
hopefully
this
is
still
ontap
next
time
i
swing
by
the
brewpub
cost
8
for
a
9
oz

across

a

the

c
overall
tasty
different
kudos
this
is
currently
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
ale
i
feel
confident
that
i
know
what
to
expect
and
appreciate
when
tasting
this
style
both
imported
and
domestic
however
i
have
to
admit
that
i
have
limited
experience
with
bourbon
barreled
scotch
ales
that
having
been
said
i
still
have
to
say
that
i
found
this
example
just
a
bit
wee
heavy
in
the
abv
and
bourbon
flavor
i
plan
on
purchasing
another
bomber
and
will
hold
it
for
a
while
to
see
what
evolves
bottle
from
hop
city
on
my
atlanta
visit
pours
murky
amber
colored
with
a

finger
creamy
off
white

nutty
aroma
with
lots
of

and
very
dry

caramel

some

flavor
is
a

bourbon
and

very

caramels
and
biscuity
malts
abound
plus

with
more
than
adequate
carbonation

overall

nice
things
going
on
here
a

i
like
my

this
is
a
great
example
of
a
wee
heavy
it
really
warms
up
your
mouth
and
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
lingering
sweet
flavor
that
just
begs
you
to
take
one
more
sip
o
not
bad
at
all
just
a
little
light
in
the
flavor
dept
id
rather
have
an
alesmith
or
backwoods
something
that
stands
out
this
is
fine
but
just
fine
oi
would
have
never
guessed
the
alcohol
was
around
11
and
it
was
rather
drinkable
that
being
said
this
bomber
is
the
same
price
as
a
4
pack
of
backwoods
bastard
and
a
little
more
than
the
price
of
two
bottles
of
wulver
this
like
many
of
clown
shoes
offerings
are
completely
hit
or
miss
and
i
would
never
pay
to
drink
this
again
release
it
as
a
4
pack
for
the
same
price
and
i
will
consider
it
but
this
was
a
watery
disappointment
overall
35
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
i
started
to
get
a
little
worried
when
i
got
to
the
aroma
and
the
barrel
aspect
was
pretty
light
but
it
made
up
for
in
the
taste
with
more
barrel
flavors
and
some
really
nice
balance
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
fairly
sticky
a
little
silky
not
too
crisp
a
little
warming
slightly
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holing
my
attention
one
glass
might
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
but
i
know
ill
have
no
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
even
though
it
is
a
little
warming
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
very
nice
and
it
was
just
what
i
expect
from
the
style
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
pretty
nice
but
they
still
could
have
used
just
a
little
work
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
cellar
and
see
how
it
changes
over
time
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
barrel
aged
scotch
ales
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
and
a
little
impressed
i
started
to
doubt
it
a
little
but
when
i
got
to
the
taste
it
really
delivered
and
i
ended
up
enjoying
it
since
i
did
a
comparison
between
wulver
backwoods
bastard
recently
im
confident
in
saying
this
is
my
third
favorite
of
the
style
with
backwoods
coming
in
second
and
wulver
first
but
they
are
all
pretty
close
to
being
on
the
same
level
good
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
keep
up
the
hard
work
pours

fades
quickly
to
a
ring

some

color

medium
bodied
strong
bourbon
nose
flavor
is
bourbon
and
hints
of
caramel
maybe
some
alcohol
in
the
background
nice
wee
heavy
pricey
at
12
99
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
big
deal
irving
spofford
nh
o
good
but
nothing
spectacular
definitely
worth
the
price
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
next
time
i
get
a
clown
shoes
beer
i
will
probably
go
back
to
their
riss
that
i
love
4
overall
decent
beer
with
a
decent
barrel
character
the
mouthfeel
really
seems
to
be
something
that
really
helps
and
gives
the
beer
some
better
life
as
the
brew
seems
to
weaken
shortly
after
opening
a
solid
though
barrel
aged
wee
heavy
though
clown
shoes
continues
with
a
good
utilization
of
barrels
it
is
hard
not
to
compare
this
to
the
central
waters
reserve
or
backwoods
but
honestly
it
holds
up
fairly
well
to
both
of
them
the
oak
is
just
a
bit
more
juxtaposing
but
i
would
get
this
again
for
sure
not
sure
what
people
see
in
this
that
give
it
such
high
ratings
if
i
was
doing
a
blind
tasting
the
nose
would
tell
me
this
was
a
flanders
red
really
nice
wood
and
some
earthy
tartness
in
the
nose
followed
by
not
much
in
regards
to
flavor
yeah
theres
really
not
too
much
going
on
here
just
some
barrel
character
vanilla
sweetness
and
some
heat
thats
pretty
much
it
drinks

a
highly

offering
had

i
was
drinking
straight

which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
if
you
love
bourbon
i
just
prefer
my
bba
beers
to
be
more
subtle
also
not
enough
malt

o
good
and

falls

a

what
a
boozy

you
dont
expect
subtly
from
a
group
named

this
is
a

over

i
cant

making
it

pretty

bourbon
fell
off

still
a
sipper
overall
a
very
good
beer
when
i
first
smelled
the
aroma
of
this
one
i
thought
i
smelled
a
little
vinegar
but
as
the
beer
warmed
a
little
that
went
away
completely
so
i
figured
it
was
just
me
22

is

theres
a

the
brew
smells
like

vanilla
bourbon
caramel
and
some

the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
peaty
smoke
and
brown

and
theres
a
bit
of
apple
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
up

also
a

boozy

not

is
full

rich
and
a

syrupy

i
think
its
a
good
brew
maybe
i
should
have
picked
up
another
bottle
to
see
how
it
ages
13
99
a
bomber
o
not
a
bad
wee
heavy
pretty
typical
but
a

overall
4
0
a
very
nice
beer
and
done
in
a
style
bba
wee
heavy
that
i
really
enjoy
but
that
i
can
never
seem
to
find
very
often
in
the
context
of
the
lack
of
availability
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
i
would
probably
buy
again
in
the
right
opportunity
but
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
to
it
perhaps
this
is
a
case
of
expectations
being
too
high
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
i
would
prefer
old
chubs
over
this
if
i
was
looking
for
a
wee
heavy
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
a
11
00
abv
beer
i
am
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
to
age
jd
overall
this
beer
is
okay
but
only
just
its
watery
and
honestly
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
something
like
a
stronger
miller
high
life
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
cant
believe
with
the
other
amazing
beers
clown
shoes
puts
out
that
this
was
what
they
were
shooting
for
while
this
one
was
definitely
a
big
let
down
ill
be
looking
forward
to
next
years
release
hopefully
they
decide
to
go
back
and
do
some
tweaking
i
think
the
hype
has
gotten
to
this
one
o
its
a
good
beer
feels
like
they
might
have
bottled
it
too
fast
though
i
feel
like
a
wee
heavy
that
is
barrel
aged
should
have
more
of
a
depth
of
flavor
i
am
being
very
critical
as
i
hold
clown
shoes
to
a
high
standard
give
this
one
a
shot
o
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
my
description
does
not
do
this
beer
justice
and
any
negative
connotations
you
get
from
reading
my
review
are
probably
due
more
to
my
inability
to
adequately
describe
it
than
any
shortcomings
on
the
part
of
the
beer
this
is
good
stuff
and
worthy
of
a
try
if
you
even
remotely
like
the
style
o
like
most
cs
ba
beers
just
missing
something
from
making
them
great
its
like
you
go
to
the
plate
for
a
home
run
then
you
bunt
i
know
ppl
are
impressed
with
how
they
churn
out
ba
beers
and
their
availability
but
i
think
their
availability
is
due
to
not
being
astonishingly
good
grab
a
backwoods
bastard
or
a
thirsty
dog
wulver
if
you
want
satisfaction
from
a
ba
wee
heavy
there
is
more
available
at
one
of
my
favorite
stores
but
im
not
buying
any
more
i
was
hoping
for
a
grand
slam
and
got
a
double
because
of
an
error
by
the
short
stop
even
more
solid
work
from
clown
shoes
its
good
to
see
them
getting
more
respect
as
they
continue
to
expand
their
high
quality
barreled
offerings
ride
the
lion
is
perhaps
not
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
but
it
is
quite
delicious
nonetheless
the
bourbon
barrel
saves
this
beer
o
probably
the
best
thing
i
have
had
from
this
company
pretty
impressed
a
good
representation
of
the
style
especially
because
of
that
butteriness
and
the
barrel
aging
is
well
done
serving
type
bottle
this
is
a
fantastic
bba
wee
heavy
the
integration
of
the
bourbon
barrels
is
flawless

very
tasty
with
the
subtleties
that
ive
come
to
see
as
a
trademark
of
barrel
aged
clown
shoes
beers
not
really
mindblowing
like
very
angry
beast
but
im
not
complaining
about
a
delicious
bba
scotch
ale
how
does
it
compare
to
backwoods
bastard
meh
both
very
good
bb
has
a
lot
of
bottle
variation
its
best
is
better
than
this
its
worst
is
not
i
already
feel
like
what
im
writing
is
trifling
so
time
to
stop
othe
ba
taste
was
more
whiskey
than
bourbon
but
still
smooth
had
alot
of
dark
fruit
tastes
mixed
with
malt
a
twist
of
the
sawh
on
bb
is
very
good
exceptional
wee
heavy
awesome
barrel
aging
as
always
from
clown
shoes
and
always
loving
the
label
art
i
liked
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
barrel
aged
wee
heavy
in
comparison
to
my
favorites
backwoods
bastard
and
wulver
somewhere
in
the
middle
between
the
two
but
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
any
lover
of
this
type
of
beer
another
winner
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
a
very
nice
example
of
a
ba
wee
heavy
not
quite
as
barrel
forward
as
backwoods
but
it
is
still
integrated
very
well
and
plays
a
big
enough
role
far
too
easy
to
drink
for
being
11
as
well
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
to
sip
on
and
allow
it
to
warm
and
open
up
snag
some
if
you
can
find
it

boozy
dark

taste
very
smooth
though
does
have
that
bourbon
tastes
very
aromatic
goes
down
very
well
may
have
a
slight
caramel
taste
to
the
end
a
brew
that
needs
to
be
allowed
to
rise
to
almost
room
temp
this
was
dull
until
that
point
opened
up
like
a
hosta
in
the
sun
afterwards
like
most
of
clown
shoes
product
a
good
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
wee
heavies
ive
tasted
from
a
us
brewer
very
well
thoughtout
balance
between
alcoholic
finish
oak
and
fruit
overall
strong
work
from
clown
shoes
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
as
backwoods
bastard
but
its
close
a
nice
ba
scotch
wee
heavy
well
done
by
clown
shoes
o
a
nice
ba
wee
heavy
not
as
good
as
wulver
or
backwoods
bastard
but
overall
pretty
good
still
a
bit
hot
glad
i
picked
up
a
couple
so
i
can
sit
on
them
for
awhile
priced
at
12
99
for
the
bomber
is
way
more
expensive
than
bastard
but
essentially
the
same
as
wulver
really
enjoy
this
style
glad
to
have
another
good
example
a
perfectly
dialed
in
wee
heavy
with
only
flaw
beig
a
little
light
in
body
flavors
and
aromas
of
toffee
chocolate
malt
raisin
toast
sherry
and
light
oak
the
aroma
is
on
the
mild
side
but
its
pleasant
and
enticing
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
there
are
many
beers
within
the
style
that
have
bigger
flavors
bigger
isnt
always
better
this
is
refined
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
another
stunning
beer
deep
dark
reddish
color
with
a
large
head
thats
about
where
the
good
stuff
ended
i
expected
a
stronger
aroma
especially
from
the
oak
but
i
got
very
little
didnt
get
much
flavorwise
either
i
found
it
to
be
more
of
a
very
easy
drinking
ale
with
not
much
to
it
not
bad
but
nothing
noteworthy
o
easy
to
drink
with
lighter
mouthfeel
and
well
hidden
alcohol
very
enjoyable
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
overall
well
balanced
o
good
smells
delicious
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
fill
the
promise
i
love
scotch
ales
but
prefer
them
with
a
little
more
weight
and
sometimes
a
little
smoke
this
one
is
on
the
light
side
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
drinkable
and
goes
down
smooth
but
if
i
want
a
scotch
ale
ill
reach
for
a
skull
splitter
overall
this
import
is
both
special
and
underrated
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
great
nice
just
different
from
past
memory
one
two
three
four
five
words
overall
definitely
a
keeper
scottish
beer
has
come
a
long
way
from
the
bad
old
days
of
tennents
extra
and
special
brew
i
could
easily
imagine
partaking
of
a
few
of
these
whilst
enjoying
a
plate
of
haggis
and
neeps
again
the
hopheads
will
probably
hate
this
but
for
me
theres
a
spoton
balance
of
malt
and
hops
to
complement
the
various
other
flavours
that
are
present
o
its
pretty
pleasant
its
very
smooth
with
a
soft
light
taste
that
isnt
overwhelming
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
id
grab
it
if
i
ever
saw
it
again
overall
just
a
bit
too
dark
and
bitter
for
my
preferences
in
a
scotch
ale
if
only
the
taste
could
feature
more
of
the
nose
of
caramel
and
toffee
i
am
seriously
wondering
about
the
age
as
a
wee
heavy
i
would
think
it
might
not
matter
as
much
but
i
cant
see
this
being
rated
so
highly
the
beer
is
decent
and
not
being
an
english
bitter
beer
fan
i
am
trying
to
adjust
for
that
however
the
feel
really
kills
this
beer
for
me
from
being
rated
highly
even
for
me
overall
a
very
good
scotch
ale
and
more
fruity
than
many
of
the
other
ones
i
have
had
great
interplay
between
the
wood
smoke
and
fruit
and
well
balanced

great

that

beer
i
wouldnt

again

i
would
put
down
the
8
bucks
to
give
it
a
shot
it
is
subdued
enough
while
maintaining

it
might

o
a
tasty
brew
although
at
first
surprisingly
and
lingeringly
bitter
moreso
than
i
expected
from
a
toprated
ale
of
this
type
o
world
class
beer
that
should
age
well
or
drink
great
fresh
like
great
food
it
is
not
overly
complex
with
to
many
competing
flavors
but
the
couple
of
flavors
that
are
present
are
just
right
and
that
is
what
makes
it
the
great
beer
it
is
fellow
ba
claystation
left
this
one
in
my
fridge
and
darn
it
all
i
need
a
beer
so
here
goes
ill
make
it
up
to
him
lovely
pour
rich
caramel
color
deep
dark
almost
brown
with
a
dim

glow
when
held
to

a

flashing
inch
plus
of
just
off
white
head
that
settles
back
to
patchy
spots
but
leaves
great
lace
it
smells
dusty
timeless
ancient
in
some
way
preindustrial
gorgeous
heavy
earthen
grain
and
a
bready
yeast
strain
that
gives
this
a
very
genuine
vibe
warming
there
is
that
classic
scotch
ale
sweetness
to
the
taste
but
it
gives
way
to
bolder
roasty
flavors
toffee
and
buttery
richness
and
a
soil
quality
its
low
key
for
its
robustness
and
the
ale
yeast
on
top
really
makes
it
sing
traditional
and
delicious
exemplar
of
the
style
not
sure
ive
had
a
wee
heavy
i
like
more
drinkably
full
bodied
warming
booze
that
can
be
felt
and
not
tasted
perfect
for
late
fall
i
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
this
and
am
now
curious
to
try
more
of
their
beers
how
cool
would
it
be
to
visit
this
place
great
beer
o
you
read
aged
in
oak
barrels
but
need
to
keep
in
mind
you
are
not
drinking
a
barrel
aged
beer
from
an
american
brewery
the
intent
is
different
here
and
the
execution
is
nearly
flawless
this
is
a
top
notch
wee
heavy
glad
to
recommend
overall
awesome
definitely
of
the
older
scotch
ale
variety
thats
not
as
up
front
as
the
u
s
style
and
most
certainly
better
because
it
isnt
the
beer
is
silky
smooth
offers
a
wide
variety
of
sensations
on
the
tongue
from
the
spiciness
to
a
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
its
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
is
really
quite
good
id
get
more
of
this
in
a
heartbeat
o
just
the
slightest
ding
in
my
rating
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
beer
itself
the
price
at
nearly
8
this
isnt
something
i
can
buy
often
enough
but
as
far
as
the
beer
if
you
enjoy
a
good
wee
heavy
this
is
a
wonderfully
delicious
example
very
good
beer
but
i
think
its
a
bit
overrated
traquair
jacobite
with
fuller
body
and
more
intense
flavours
and
aromas
is
slightly
better
than
this
one
that
is
too
bad
i
wanted
this
to
be
good
this
is
a
highly
recommended
beer
for
those
who
want
a
fantastic
sipping
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
but
without
the
overpowering
inebriates
3
75
d
overall
its
a
pretty
damn
good
brew
i
didnt
pick
up
any
astringency
in
the
jacobite
so
maybe
this
is
just
how
this
batch
turned
out
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
style
i
quite
like
i
wish
the
aroma
was
a
bit
more
powerful
and
the
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
lower
with
some
some
more
thickness
in
the
mouth
but
id
definitely
drink
again
pours
a
clear
dark
red
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
strong
sweet
aroma
of
malt
and
dried
fruit
flavor
is
raisins
dried
cherries
toast
and
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
a
little
more
alcohol
burn
than
usual
for
the
style
medium
body
slightly
slick
oily
finish
and
very
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
comfortable
beer
with
enough
character
to
be
interesting
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
distracting
from
other
pursuits
while
consuming
warmth
is
a
good
friend
to
this
beer
which
was
aged
four
years
in
the
cellar
just
overall
an
excellent
excellent
beer
would
grab
this
again
in
a
second
great
representation
of
a
nice
drinkable
malty
beer
that
goes
down
well
at
almost
time
d
very
drinkable
so
mellow
yet
with
a
good
deal
of
complexities
definitely
let
this
beer
warm
up
some
before
diving
in
somewhat
pricey
but
well
worth
the
try
o
interesting
beer
lots
of
typical
scotch
ale
flavors
nice
transition
from
being
sweet
and
malty
up
front
to
being
dry
and
and
tannic
and
even
a
little
bitter
in
the
finish
regardless
surprisingly
complex
and
balanced
brew
having
said
that
i
much
preferred
jacobite
o
personally
im
more
inclined
to
prefer
a
less
bonedry
scotch
ale
like
old
chub
im
also
a
bit
let
down
in
its
lack
of
depth
but
on
the
flipside
the
drinkability
this
presents
is
impressive
all
things
considered
a
bit
too
expensive

fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
overall
a
rocksolid
beer
theres
nothing
flashy
or
showy
about
it
but
the
more
time
you
spend
with
it
the
more
you
realize
that
it
has
an
understated
elegance
i
think
the
key
that
holds
everything
together
is
the
water
an
enjoyable
ale
with
better
than
normal
complexity
and
depth
overall
a
pretty
good
wee
heavy
this
one
is
not
nearly
as
over
powering
as
most
i
truly
enjoyed
every
drop
of
this
elixir
i
dont
remember
having
an
ale
that
was
aged
in
oak
barrels
and
if
youre
wondering
if
it
makes
a
difference
it
does
the
trailing
oak
flavor
was
a
perfect
compliment
for
a
cool
evening
in
a
warm
bar
and
i
look
forward
to
an
opportunity
to
try
it
again
in
the
near
future
i
strongly
recommend
giving
this
a
try
o
this
is
quite
wonderful
pricey
but
mostly
worth
it
due
to
the
high
drinkability
traquair
continues
to
be
solid
in
my
book
t
opens
with
a
modest
dark
fruit
flavor
and
a
touch
of
booze
toasted
oak
a
faint
peatiness
raisin
and
some
faint
burnt
brown
sugar
finish
leaves
just
a
trace
of
warmth
with
a
touch
of
oak

one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
had
finally
and
what
ive
yet
to
mention
is
what
makes
this
beer
remarkable
like
ive
already
hinted
at
this
beer
isnt
the
best
at
any
particular
aspect
even
within
its
own
style
this
beer
does
however
carry
alot
of
soul
it
might
seem
like
overromantization
but
its
something
that
i
really
struggle
to
put
into
words
it
just
feels
like
it
was
made
with
the
purpose
of
capturing
a
specific
frame
of
existence
and
that
it
somehow
perfectly
captures
it
i
personally
find
it
hard
not
to
wonder
off
to
a
roadside
tavern
in
the
scottish
coastland
it
really
is
an
experience
like
one
of
the
bros
pointed
out
o
excellent
balances
the
dark
and
sweet
tones
in
a
very
grown
up
manner

this
is
an
outstanding
scotch
ale
dark
amber

fast
smells
of
malt
peat
toffee
and
scotch
lightly
bitter
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
very
smooth
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
out
there
i
hesitated
at
spending
7

for
a
bottle
of
it
but
it
was
worth
every
penny
im
buying

one

and
a

an
unexpectedly
dry

and
somewhat
more

flavor
than
i
expected
but
nicely
balanced
and
pleasant
medium
bodied
but
has
a
light
creaminess
that
gives
an
excellent
mout
feel
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
from
a
great
traditional
brewer
not
many
good
scotch
ales
available
here
but
this
one
of
them
pours
mahogany
with
a
thin
loose
ecru
head
rich
caramel
and
toffee
subtle
mustiness
like
mossy
decomposing
wood
nice
spicy
oak
note
vanilla
and
toasted

balanced
bitterness
with
an
earthy

slightly
metallic

note
on
the
finish
this
is
a
relatively
young

and
is
already
super
mellow
i
like
the
new
500ml
format
as
opposed
to
the
old
330ml
bottles
overall
a
very
good
wee
heavy
as
above
a
bit
too
much

after

the
website
says
its
a
winter
ale
but
it
tastes
great
in
the
summer
warm
a
good
scotch
on
the
side
almost
sounds
very
complimentary
im
a
happy
man
tonight
deeper
smoother
more
complex
and
drier
than
jacobite
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
intriguing
as
it
suggests
a
blend
of
many
flavours
at
work
an
interesting
somewhat
complex
taste
noticed
the
hint
of
raisin
that
others
mentioned
in
the
flavour
a
pleasant
surprise
that
goes
down
quite
nicely
a
good
smooth
scotch
ale
and
no
overt
alcohol
taste
which
is
appreciated
overall
ok
however
must
also
admit
not
my
given
preferred
style
have
tried
to
review
objectively
but
find
difficult
a
very
clean
robust
tasting
dark
ale
wellbalanced
with
excellent
depth
complexity
and
richness
to
satisfy
a
widerange
of
dark
ale
aficionados
highly
recommended
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brownish
in
color
with
a
tan
like
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
notes
of
chocolate
and
a
small
earth
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
a
small
roast
earthy
and
a
small
alcohol
bite
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
earth
and
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
the
beer
that
changed
my
life
and
i
cannot
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
review
it
overall
a
tasty
enough
scotch
ale
it
doesnt
blow
my
socks
off
especially
with
its
mild
aroma
but
it
is
a
perfectly
serviceable
wee
heavy
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
over
7
i
am
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
and
i
would
probably
reach
for
it
again
if
given
the
chance
overall
not
a
bad
brew
it
is
worth
giving
a
try
d
a
dark
complex
and
flavorful
beer
im
not
familiar
with
scotch
ales
a
great
deal
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
definitely
one
to
try
again
if
i
can
find
it
as
this
was
delicious
great
great
stuff
i
no
longer
drink
but
far
and
away
the
best
i
ever
had
was
the
traquair
house
ale
ive
tried
just
about
every
thing
available
until
3
years
ago
this
was
far
and
away
the
best
ale
i
ever
had
second
place
was
mcewans
scotch
ale
most
beers
are
like
a
entree
this
is
a
dessert
an
expensive
and
well
worth
is
dessert
a
dark
sweet
beer
not
sure
id
call
it
an
ale
not
a
huge
head
but
nicely
laced
great
mouthfeel
not
very
bitter
not
hoppy
at
over
5
for
a
bottle
i
d
say
youre
paying
a
premium
for
uneconomical
home
brewing
oldest
house
in
scotland
and
travel
across
the
pond
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
way
overpriced
the
reveal
traquair
house
ale
nice
good
stuff
also
this
is
a
1001
book
beer
thanks
a
decent
beer
though
the
taste
was
a
bit
subdued
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
very
pleasant
to
drink
everything
is
well
balanced
and
not
too
much
id
had
this
on
my
list
for
years
as
id
always
heard
read
that
it
was
a
really
good
example
of
a
style
i
really
liked
dont
know
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
particular
bottle
but
i
thought
it
really
fell
pretty
flat
nothing
bad
about
it
but
not
much
very
memorable
either
id
be
up
for
trying
it
again
but
i
cant
really
say
im
impressed
by
this
one
overall
a
good
scotch
alewee
heavy
perhaps
it
could
be
a
bit
sweeter
but
i
would
only
enjoy
that
if
there
was
still
a
bitterness
that
balanced
it
out
towards
the
finish
regardless
this
beer
is
still
good
a
very
good
scotch
ale
the
ale
is
not
as
malty
as
other
scotch
ales
and
easily
drinkable
personally
id
like
the
feeling
to
be
a
little
more
thick
and
texture
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
everything
has
its
place
nothing
overpowering
and
a
smooth
overall
feel
rich
and
complex
without
overwhelming
the
palate
overall
a
well
done
brew
which
has
come
from
the
ancient
brewhouse
in
the
oldest
inhabited
house
in
scotland
to
my
glass
proof
that
history
can
be
tasty
the
fruity
flavor
leaves
quickly
and
yields
a
full
flavored
beer
that
has
multiple
layers
of
flavor
the
hops
break
up
the
malty
sweetness
nicely
at
first
sip
i
wasnt
a
fan
at
last
sip
id
like
another
which
i
find
to
be
a
great
quality
in
beer
it
shows
its
depth
great
stuff
despite
the
high
price
tag
overall
a
solid
scotch
ale
no
frills
traditionally
made
and
traditional
tasting
well
made
on
all
counts
full
flavored
with
sweet
milked
cocoa
malt
flavor
theres
a
dollop
of
bittering
hop
in
the
swallow
but
this
is
a
tale
of
delicious
near
cakelike
chocolate
malt
taste
rich
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
level
overy
smooth
compared
to
most
scotch
ales
wishing
it
had
more
aroma
though
the
alcohol
did
not
overpower
the
beer
if
i
was
searching
for
a
good
scotch
ale
i
would
seek
it
out
notes
decent
but
not
exceptional
and
definitely
not
worth
the
price
overall
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
available
the
complex
flavors
of
the
different
malts
and
the
herbal
hops
make
this
a
fun
beer
to
drink
id
prefer
a
little
more
malty
thickness
in
the
body
and
a
very
small
amount
more
smoke
but
for
the
style
this
is
very
very
good
overall
an
impressive
display
of
light
and
bold
from
taste
to
feel
very
impressive
and
an
interesting
unique
scotch
ale
i
am
drinking
this
by
a
fire
with
snow
outside
and
i
cant
think
of
a
better
time
to
do
so
big
toffee
tobacco
like
qualities
on
the
palate
backbone
is
a
ton
of
sweet
malts
backend
of
a
touch
of
booze
heat
i
think
the
body
could
be
a
bit
more
beefy
but
that
just
might
be
my
americanized
palate
that
needs
everything
to
be
over
the
top
other
than
the
body
being
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
its
a
solid
wee
heavy
if
only
the
price
were
a
bit
lower
or
my
income
a
bit
higher
i
would
go
back
for
more

o
my
god
this
is
delicious
everything
a
scotch
ale
should
be
rich
and
fantastically
smooth
this
is
a
perfect
winter
beer
my
only
complaints
are
that
the
carbonation
seemed
to
disappear
a
little
too
quickly
as
did
some
of
the
flavor
otherwise
id
say
seek
this
one
out
asap
sipping
on
this
one
after
an
evening
dip
in
the
spa
to
start
with
it
looks
like
absolute
perfection
in
the
glass
tiny
bubbles
streaming
up
the
vessel
meeting
the
beautifully
compact
beige
cream
head
nose
is
a
bouquet
of
dark
fruit
and
bittersweet
caramel
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
little
sweet
booze
goes
down
very
smoothly
a
great
evening
sipper
oa
classic
scotch
ale
o
recent
american
maltbomb
scotch
ales
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
or
three
from
this
amazing
old
world
original
pours
very
dark
copper
light
stone
head
which
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
which
persists
for
the
glass
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
restrained
sweetish
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
caramel
over
roasted
malt
very
dry
some
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
characteristics
as
it
warms
medium
carbonation
and
medium
light
bodied
this
is
less
rich
than
others
of
the
style
overall
a
good
light
scotch
ale
pretty
drinkable
o
the
beer
goes
down
rather
easy
for
the
style
because
it
is
well
balanced
relatively
light
in
body
and
has
its
alcohol
well
hidden
from
the
taste
a
great
smelling
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
overall
very
nice
good
for
after
a
nice
meal
maybe
a
bit
pricey
for
the
size
in
total
american
palates
might
feel
this
beer
is
lacking
punch
ive
had
beers
all
over
scotland
and
the
subtlety
of
these
beers
is
not
to
be
missed
really
once
youve
had
a
good
caledonian
80
on
cask
you
can
begin
to
really
appreciate
what
european
brewers
are
trying
to
do
very
rich
very
malty
gorgeous
experience
overall
very
impressive
a
very
drinkable
wee
heavy
though
quite
smooth
it
is
a
more
refined
less
inyourface
take
on
the
scotch
ale
as
it
from
scotland
perhaps
i
should
instead
look
at
this
as
more
representative
as
compared
to
its
more
aggressive
american
cousins
still
a
nice
ale
that
you
should
make
sure
to
have
if
given
the
occasion
jd
mouthfeel
sticks
to
the
palate
with
that
alcohol
spiceness
it
has
a
nice
red
brown
look
with
a
decent
white
head
that
doesnt
linger
too
long
the
smell
is
that
is
raisinssugars
the
usual
strong
belgian
scents
the
taste
is
excellent
it
is
very
smooth
and
has
a
great
finish
this
one
really
surprised
me
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
the
abv
is
above
7
so
its
not
something
to
guzzle
but
more
to
enjoy
after
a
nice
dinner
if
you
can
get
2
overall
was
excited
for
this
beer
because
my
buddy
hyped
it
up
big
time
however
i
was
pretty
let
down
by
the
lack
of
flavor
which
killed
this
beer
for
me
o
nowhere
near
as
good
as
jacobite
but
stands
tall
on
its
own
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
stickier
on
the
tongue
im
not
sure
at
5
49
a
bottle
its
worth
it
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
ale
another
great
offering
from
scotland
which
in
my
opinion
has
great
beers
for
such
a
small
country
this
is
a
smooth
but
complex
ale
to
be
sipped
and
savored
any
time
of
year
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
thick
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
trace
of
off
white
head
that
laces
well
but
doesnt
retain
the
atoms
has
notes
of
raisins
and
citrus
with
a
caramel
malty
sweet
sweetness
the
taste
starts
with
raisin
and
plums
and
the
switches
to
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
velvety
an
finishes
clean
overall
a
great
beer
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
looking
brown
color
not
much
light
gets
through
this
one
the
head
was
pretty
good
left
a
decent
amount
of
retention
the
smell
was
earthy
had
some
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
smokiness
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
good
sweetness
also
with
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
there
might
even
be
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
has
a
good
thickness
to
it
as
well
overall
i
found
this
wee
heavy
to
be
rather
enjoyable
o
excellent
beer
to
sit
and
sip
and
enjoy
on
its
own
or
with
a
meal
probably
not
one
for
a
session
drink
but
certainly
top
notch
o
a
very
nice
beer
the
smell
was
a
little
off
on
this
bottle
but
that
could
be
an
exception
and
it
actually
plays
nicely
against
the
flavor
this
is
the
2nd
type
of
beer
ive
had
from
traquair
and
i
cant
wait
to
find
more

for
a
12oz
at
steves
liquor
in
madison
overall
this
was
pretty
good
as
close
to
a
sessionable
scotch
ale
as
i
have
ever
tried
maybe
not
quite
as
complex
as
for
example
the
jacobite
but
still
quite
good
the
flavours
followed
the
smells
chocolate
and
coffee
with
the
coffee
being
the
dominant
one
this
time
the
alcohol
content
is
just
below
the
surface
but
can
just
about
he
found
as
the
mouth
dries
after
each
sip
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
might
be
or
expected
after
the
first
sniff
this
ia
a
well
balanced
brew
for
a
wee
heavy
very
easy
to
drink
with
almost
no
perceptible
alcohol
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
overall
drinkability
a
slow
sipper
this
one
while
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
a
meal
i
almost
think
this
beer
is
best
alone
for
an
afterdinner
treat
it
needs
to
warm
up
a
bit
for
all
the
flavors
to
come
out
but
that
adds
to
the
experience
of
slowly
enjoying
this
beer
one
of
those
beers
i
just
sat
down
with
by
myself
in
my
living
room
and
just
drank
it
slowly
doing
nothing
else
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
little
trip
we
took
my
mouth
was
wet
and
loving
it
o
this
is
a
very
solid
enjoyable
brew
its
delicately
complex
and
balanced
not
a
single
dominant
flavor
will
overpower
you
i
dont
even
want
to
write
the
rest
of
this
review
this
beer
is
thin
slightly
sour
ive
never
heard
of
this
beer
being
infected
but
i
hope
it
is
o
overall
pretty
nice
a
bit
simple
to
me
but
i
liked
what
it
had
to
offer
overall
pretty
good
the
herbal
hops
are
always
a
negative
for
me
but
it
was
used
in
moderation
here
and
tolerable
and
some
nice
malts
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
classic
scotch
ale
always
worth
picking
up
if
you
dont
mind
the
price
tag
overall
this
doesnt
seem
very
complicated
but
it
does
have
nice
solid
easy
to
enjoy
flavors
it
is
a
good
and
interesting
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
from
scotland
ive
had
its
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
for
regular
drinking
but
it
is
certainly
one
to
be
enjoyed
occasionally
its
a
great
warming
beer
for
a
chilly
night
overall
good
beverage
for
the
price
not
sure
if
i
will
revisit
but
an
overall
solid
beverage
this
is
a
brew
for
the
ages
a
masterpiece
not
to
be
taken
for
granted
bathe
in
its
glory
and
craftsmanship
and
you
will
know
there
is
greatness
in
man
poured
into
snifter
a
deep
amber
with
only
a
faint
head
that
made
a
very
brief
appearance
smell
reminds
me
of
an
old
ale
and
kvass
for
me
the
first
taste
was
almost
like
biting
into
an
almost
ripe
apple
followed
by
its
own
bite
and
then
a
little
bitterness
and
a
little
bready
and
then
back
to
the
apple
again
as
a
lingering
finish
on
my
palate
has
an
average
mouthfeel
for
me
but
suprised
me
a
little
because
there
is
a
little
tingle
that
i
would
usually
attribute
to
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
but
this
lacked
in
head
enough
to
trick
me
i
really
enjoy
this
and
as
far
as
its
classified
style
goes
i
would
grab
this
over
other
scotch
ales
and
wee
heavies
that
i
have
had
unique
and
distinctive
and
a
tasty
beverage
worthy
of
purchase
even
at
its
56
retail
per
bottle
o
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
a
distinctive
compelling
character
dont
know
that
ill
return
to
this
one
however
comes
in
an
elegantly
designed
bottle
pours
an
oaky
brown
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
nutty
aroma
with
a
strong
essence
of
caramel
malt
very
strong
malt
in
the
taste
with
some
roast
and
faint
coffee
roasted
nuts
in
the
taste
as
well
very
smokey
overall
highly
carbonated
and
full
bodied
drinkability
is
great
as
well
a
very
unique
beer
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
a
while
drinkability
one
to
drink
slowly
and
savor
with
a
good
book
this
is
an
excellent
brew
very
enjoyable
d
a
good
beer
with
some
appreciable
flavours
an
excellent
taste
drinkability
very
tasty
but
the
alcohol
is
no
joke
quite
warm
but
not
overly
hidden
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
would
sip
it
snuggled
by
a
fire
d
drinkability
was
great
a
little
too
good
considering
the
price
and
the
fact
that
i
wanted
to
down
it
too
quickly
i
will
be
going
back
to
my
store
tomorrow
and
buying
them
out
of
this
amazing
this
is
the
second
scotch
ale
ive
had
from
traquair
and
for
me
this
one
slightly
edges
out
the
other
being
their
jacobite
ale
the
unique
peat
character
is
beautifully
rendered
and
comes
out
wonderfully
in
the
finish
and
makes
for
a
great
addition
to
all
of
the
staple
sweet
and
sticky
wee
heavy
characteristics
this
beer
already
possesses
the
next
time
i
see
this
ill
be
sure
to
pick
a
bottle
or
two
up
a
very
good
house
ale
thanks
again
graig
send
me
more
of
this
house
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
a
moderate
peaty
smoky
flavor
with
some
fruit
again
i
get
figs
with
some
red
delicious
apple
quite
dry
theres
flavors
of
toffee
burnt
sugar
and
a
little
caramel
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
peat
and
burnt
sugar
the
flavors
that
linger
are
excellent
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
feels
good
on
the
palate
i
really
like
the
flavors
on
the
finish
here
flavors
are
wonderfully
balanced
alcohol
is
hardly
apparent
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
i
only
feel
that
the
body
of
the
beer
needs
to
be
amped
up
a
bit
but
an
exceptional
beer
otherwise
o
i
like
this
a
lot
great
balance
of
caramel
sometimes
can
be
too
sweet
so
drink
sparingly
a
good
balance
welldone
and
a
really
nice
sipping
brew
pours
a
coppery
brown
with
a
slight
off
white
head
smells
of
yeast
bread
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
mostly
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
an
earthy
almost
funky
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
at
the
end
from
the
alcohol
but
this
is
still
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
i
was
blown
away
by
this
beer
the
body
is
amazing
d
overall
i
think
i
prefer
the
jacobite
ale
to
the
house
ale
though
this
may
be
a
betterbrewed
beer
its
a
solid
effort
and
definitely
tasty
i
will
probably
pick
up
another
couple
if
only
for
sharing
recommended
served
from
bottle
into
a
delirium
tremens
snifter
poured
a
deep
redbrown
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
cookies
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
very
slight
roasted
malt
sour
malt
subtle
spices
extremely
subtle
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palatae
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
quite
the
awesome
brew
the
flavor
on
this
one
was
very
nice
and
well
balanced
also
the
aroma
was
very
good
as
well
im
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
must
say
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
hasnt
gotten
the
opportunity
before
overall
this
was
a
lighter
beer
than
i
expected
it
would
be
the
flavors
blended
nicely
and
made
for
quite
a
relaxing
brew
as
excellent
as
this
beer
was
this
was
a
little
bit
too
drinkable
aka
i
wish
it
lasted
me
longer
than
it
did
excellent
beer
would
recommend
this
one
i
must
say
that
this
does
not
suffer
much
with
the
lower
abv
but
it
does
in
turn
not
have
as
much
to
a
body
the
look
and
smell
is
about
the
same
but
the
nose
is
but
more
muted
just
as
coriander
and
toffee
caramel
but
subsides
palate
is
leaner
but
also
seemed
more
susceptible
this
has
a
tad
of
a
metallic
quality
and
may
not
age
was
well
as
the
other
still
a
substancial
amount
of
flavor
for
the
sake
of
how
nice
and
lean
the
body
is
not
as
creamy
and
refreshing
as
the
jacobite
but
more
so
just
refreshing
a
nice
full
flavoured
but
easy
to
drink
ale
very
good
d
easiest
scotch
ale
to
drink
ever
enough
said
conclusion
i
expected
greatness
and
was
not
disappointed
this
is
a
great
scottish
beer
i
backpacked
95
miles
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
when
i
was
16
and
drank
my
first
beer
on
that
trip
become
of
that
experience
my
love
for
beer
is
connected
with
my
love
for
scotland
and
this
ale
brings
the
two
together
in
a
lovely
way
drink
this
if
you
havent
yet
d
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
scotch
ale
that
ive
had
so
far
its
excellent
taste
makes
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
worth
hunting
down
to
give
a
try
sometime
outstanding
a
must
try
ale
from
a
small
scottich
brewery
overall
a
very
enjoyable
scotch
ale
recommended
this
beer
is
so
so
smooth
and
so
silky
this
beer
is
a
wonder
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
is
warming
and
lovely
this
one
is
meant
to
be
sipped
savored
and
enjoyed
thoroughly
one
will
do
and
each
sip
is
better
then
the
next
well
worth
the
expenditure
and
should
be
searched

i
wont

it

so
very
glad
i
found
this
ale
and
worth
way
more
than
the
4
75usd
i
paid
for
it
i
could
have
paid
double
that
and
still
been
happy
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
so
magnificent
that
i
feel
bad
giving
the
look
such
a
respectively
low
score
over
something
as
meager
as
retention
and
lace
but
it
is
what
it
is
this
here
is
perfection
in
a
thistle
glass
i
could
drink
this
brew
in
indefinite
quantities
and
i
could
get
a
case
from
my
distributor
tomorrow
and
chug
pints
and
not
feel
a
pennys
worth
of
shame
for
it

im

alone

a
fine
fine

decent

not
that
amazing
cant
wait
to
try
out
the
other
one
at
the

poor
retention
and
modest

very
malty

with
some
hints

the
taste
confirmed
a
very
sweet
malty

fruitoriented
flavor
with
a
modest
toastiness
and
a
sweet
finish
noncarbonated
fullbodied
feel
the
excessive
sweetness
combined
with
the
syruplike
texture
was
a
little
overpowering
for
me
had
at
the
publick
house
brookline
ma
cocacola
hues
with
a
thin
head
the
beer
not
the
pub
and
surprisingly
little
aroma
i
pulled
hard
and
found
some
butterscotch
leather
malt
and
vanilla
not
much
smoke
in
either
the
smell
or
the
taste
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
frankly
ditto
the
malt
i
knew
it
was
in
there
but
for
some
reason
it
just
seemed
diminished
letting
it
warm
solved
most
of
these
problems
still
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
smoke
and
malt
warming
also
brought
out
plenty
of
molasses
definitely
a
sipper
this
lands
near
the
top

my
scotch
ale
list
top
3
most
drinkable
beers
ive
experienced
curse
the
fact
its
around
6
a
11
2
for
me
this
is
he
pinnacle
scotch
ale
that
is
readily
brewed
i
have
had
some
limited
brews
that
i
enjoyed
more
but
this
is
what
you
will
find
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
visit
i
still
favor
the
belgian
ales
over
scot
but
would
never
turn
this
ale
down
beer
is
really
creamy
very
nice
good
caramel
notes
in
the
mid
and
late
palate
finishes
completely
cleanly
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
some
early
sweet
notes
but
its
not
a
super
malty
beer
bitterness
is
really
low
but
thats
expected
a
really
really
good
beer
im
so
glad
i
picked
these
up
finally
i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
im
trying
it
side
by
side
with
the
jacobite
and
am
quite
excited
about
that
now
d
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
wee
heavy
the
earthy
flavors
dominate
the
experience
for
me
id
prefer
a
cleaner
malt
taste
and
maybe
a
bit
of
smoke
but
this
character
is
totally
different
a
liked
this
a
lot
better
than
i
did
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
beer
but
also
a
little
underwhelming
considering
its
ranked
in
the
top
10
for
its
style
the
flavours
were
pleasant
but
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
intensity
to
them
to
push
this
to
the
next
level
however
i
was
impressed
with
the
drinkability
of
this
one
which
was
far
higher
than
any
other
scotch
ale
ive
come
across
and
the
alcohol
is
skillfully
hidden
decent
stuff
and
worth
the
shot
even
if
its
not
mindblowing
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
rich
and
fairly
complex
the
finish
leaves
something
to
be
desired
however
its
a
bit
thin
and
doesnt
reflect
the
beer
well
it
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
quite
smooth
d
ill
get
through
the
bottle
easily
enough
but
i
wont
be
craving
another
maybe
another
jacobite
that
blows
this
out
of
the
water
classic
wellbalanced
and
not
overthetop
like
many
american
attempts
low
carb
medium
mouthfeel
id
like
it
a
touch
higher
i
have
to
hide
this
beer
from
myself
to
keep
from
drinking
it
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
alcohol
dark
fruit
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
caramel
peet
smoke
and
dark
fruit
the
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
a
slightly
smokey
scotch
whisky
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
bland
mouthfeel
not
good
o
good
better
than
the
jacobite
but
again
over
priced
i
enjoyed
this
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
for
6
i
could
buy

or

economist
in

is
unsatisfied

one
the
fuller
side

a
nice
feel
this
house
ale
has
a
good
level
of
drinkability
overall
love
this
beer
wished
i
could
afford
it
more
often
i
sat
and
drank
this
sipped
this
while
sipping
on

the
rocks
and
watching

doesnt
get
better
than
that
d
scotch
ale
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
for
a
reason
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
happily

the
lack
of
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
and
the
general
smooth
drinkability
that
comes
from
a
thinner
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
smooth
and
medium
in
body
though
stiff
and
formidable
all
the
same
drinks
well
not
your
every
day
goto
beer
for
diving
into
but
this
may
well
be
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
especially
for
its
representation
of
one
of
my
fondest
styles
lacking
little
overdone
in
nothing
nearly
perfect
for
style
by
sweetness
balance
malt
and
depth
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
it
has
a
light
body
that
is
full
of
flavor
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
overly
fruity
traquair
house
ale
seems
very
wellbalanced
and
is
quite
delicious
notes
to
self
try
more
beer
in
the
scotch
alewee
heavy
style
and
reevaluate
the
review
from
the
oldest
inhabited
house
in
scotland
sitting
in
my
tasting
glass
its
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
contrasted
with
a
foamy
cap
resting
right
on
top
this
gives
off
a
distinctly
doughy
almost
cinnamonbread
aroma
subtle
yet
distinct
like
a
good
bakery
the
scotch
ale
taste
is
refined
its
very
well
balanced
with
caramel
bready
and
raisiny
sweetness
slight
hints
of
roasted
coffee
as
well
this
would
go
well
with
a
cinnamon
roll
or
something
sweet
and
crumbly
goes
down
easy
with
a
slight
hop
kiss
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
was
inspired
to
drink
this
one
from
traquairlovers
username
i
now
understand
why
he
chose
that
cant
wait
to
try
the
jacobite
sitting
in
my
fridge
d
high
marks
here
even
at
7
2
this
is
one
you
could
have
a
couple
of
if
you
happen
to
have
a
few
on
hand
easy
drinking
and
very
tasty
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
great
flavor
wonderful
profile
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
really
like
this
scotch
ale
drinkability
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
beer
both
on
a
sip
by
sip
basis
and
in
the
feeling
that
i
want
more
and
have
the
intent
to
have
more
in
the
future
bottle
courtesy
of
bobsy
aroma
is
molasses
banana
whiskey
and
spices
cinnamon
cloves
flavor
is
bready
brown
sugar
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
palate
is
quite
full
for
the
style
with
soft
carbonation
not
exceptionnal
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
dont
often
have
the
opportunity
to
tatse
this
style
this
was
a
very
smooth
and
graceful
scotch
ale
maybe
the
best
tasting
example
ive
had
could
drink
several
more
easily
would
recommend
pours
with
moderate
carbonation
producing
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
its
color
is
a
very
dark
ruby
or
reddishgold
and
on
the
palate
it
is
velvety
smooth
very
rich
you
can
taste
a
hint
of
the
7
2
abv
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
the
slightest
suggestion
of
peat
smoke
the
finish
is
dry
enticing
you
to
take
another
sip
absolutely
true
to
the
style
one
of
the
classic
strong
scotch
ales
in
the
world
today
i
had
to
pace
myself
in
drinking
this
one
to
allow
it
to
warm
i
could
have
dusted
this
one
quickly
and
reached
for
another
im
mad
at
myself
because
i
purchased
this
bottle
about
two
months
ago
and
judging
by
the
other
reviewers
im
not
experiencing
the
same
nuances
no
telling
how
long
it
sat
on
the
shelf
in
the
store
before
sitting
for
an
additional
two
months
in
my
beer
cellar
because
it
lacks
complexity
and
shows
signs
of
sourness
something
tells
me
this
would
have
been
a
different
experience
had
it
been
a
fresher
bottle
or
on
tap
im
dissapointed
mainly
in
myself
this
deserves
a
second
review
with
a
fresh
batch
d
the
stuarts
have
made
a
classic
james
i
would
be
proud
everything
is
here
in
balance
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
i
cant
believe
this
it
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
in
4
years
nice
beer
a
little
sweet
but
nothing
that
takes
away
from
its
good
characteristics
this
beer
is
worth
looking
for
try
it
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
d
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
i
could
drink
a
case
of
this
in
a
week
i
would
def
recommend
this
for
the
those
who
like
micros
d
this
could
of
been
a
world
class
brew
if
the
taste
was
more
pronounced
still
an
excellent
beer
that
ill
be
revisiting
very
shortly
drinkablity
a
classic
brew
very
satisfying
rich
and
flavorful
shockingly
found
this
at
a
local
liqour
store
5
min
from
my
house
wonderful
caramel
flavor
along
with
deft
sweetness
can
tell
alcohol
is
present
but
balances
the
before
mentioned
flavors
excellently
on
my
way
back
to
the
store
for
a
few
more
delicious
id
sip
on
this
as
the
full
sweet
flavours
dont
really
lend
themselves
well
to
drinking
quickly
at
all
still
highly
drinkable
though
mouthfeeldrinkability
low
carbonation
and
totally
gulpable
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
just
perfectly
balanced
not
too
strong
yet
it
has
a
ton
of
flavor
its
kind
of
a
let
down
another
user
described
it
as
a
watery
porter
that
sums
it
up
perfectly
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
mostly
plum
and
berries
with
some
chestnuthazelnut
notes
and
slight
alcohol
warmth
kind
of
a
barleywine
brown
ale
hybrid
corby112nov
01
this
is
a
solid
brew
the
taste
kind
of
lets
you
down
after
the
wonderful
scent
of
the
thing
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
i
figured
on
a
little
bit
stronger
a
little
lackluster
in
the
flavor
all
in
all
nor
even
for
the
second
bottle
on
the
same
night
because
its
so
precious
and
rare
very
good
probably
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
very
nicely
drinkable
with
the
7
2abv
very
nicely
hidden
a
very
slight
warming
is
the
only
indication
of
its
slightly
elevated
abv
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
will
be
drinking
it
again
excellent
beer
i
cant
believe
ive
just
now
got
around
to
trying
this
now
i
want
to
get
more
for
some
aging
especially
after
reading
spointons
review
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
lean
towards
the
maltier
side
of
things
d
though
this
is
a
sipper
and
it
unabashedly
shows
its
alcohol
it
never
felt
like
a
big
beer
and
was
never
hot
in
any
way
i
could
easily
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
long
sunday
afternoonevening
by
a
fire
or
in
a
comfortable
chair
reading
a
book
i
am
glad
i
saved
this
bottle
for
so
long
and
will
now
dedicate
myself
to
laying
many
more
bottles
down
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
dark
and
rich
molasses
honey
wheat
buttery
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
creamy
yeast
it
tasted
like
earthy
molasses
rich
buttery
toffee
nutty
malts
and
bready
yeast
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
covered
cherry
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
some
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
sweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ever
and
it
tasted
great
and
had
great
body
too
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
also
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
what
a
great
beer
maybe
my
favorite
scotch
ale
better
than
skull
splitter
and
i
really
like
that
style
plus
this
seems
to
have
great
potential
for
aging
i
can
only
imagine
how
sweet
and
rich
the
malty
flavors
would
become
looking
forward
to
jacobite
notes
just
a
great
wee
heavy
one
of
my
favorites
excellent
faithfulnes
to
the
style
d
like
it
but
not
a
session
this
beer
is
ok
but
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
d
a
very
tasty
beer
with
rich
aromas
rather
complex
and
well
balanced
has
somewhat
of
a
sophisticated
expression
it
does
remind
me
of
my
brief
travels
through
scotland
it
tastes
like
most
of
the
dark
ales
you
can
find
in
that
country
but
much
much
better
great
beer
no
matter
the
place
yum
i
wouldnt
call
this
one
a
chugger
but
a
damn
drinkable
beer
rich
complex
and
sippable
not
big
sips
but
many
of
them
in
quick
succession
very
worthy
d
a
little
pricey
to
drink
one
after
the
other
but
very
very
pleasant
and
smooth
i
sipped
it
at
first
to
make
it
last
and
continued
sipping
it
to
savor
the
smells
and
the
flavors
overall
obviously
i
rate
this
highly
and
im
happy
to
have
found
it
having
not
paid
much
attention
previously
it
appears
it
won
some
awards
last
year
and
i
can
see
why
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
thats
true
to
the
style
definitely
worth
a
shot
a
reasonable
substitute
for
old
chub
when
i
cant
get
it
d
easy
to
finish
and
left
me
wanting
to
reach
for
another
a
little
pricey
to
be
drinking
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
something
ill
check
out
again
but
not
for
a
while
d
im
beginning
to
move
away
from
scotch
ales
and
wee
heavies
and
this
one
really
isnt
going
to
draw
me
back
if
i
were
still
into
the
style
id
acknowledge
that
it
is
midrange
but
the
watery
mouthfeel
is
one
heck
of
a
drawback
the
web
site
describes
this
ale
as
sherrylike
which
gets
at
the
very
mellow
fruitiness
and
depth
of
this
ale
mouthfeel
is
malty
yet
bitter
with
some
scotch
like
delicacies
along
the
tongue
leading
to
slick
ending
m
relatively
smooth
especially
for
the
higher
abv
medium
bodied
solid
carbonation
level
great
palate
medium
to
full
body
little
carbonation
some
lingering
aftertaste
of
malt
and
alcohol
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
color
13
inch
head
of
a
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
chocolate
and
strong
malts
fits
the
style
of
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
bitter
mouth
feel
that
is
still
very
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
average
carbonation
levels
are
present
tastes
of
strong
malt
up
front
and
then
quickly
the
alcohol
flavors
dominate
a
slight
hop
kick
is
noticeable
in
the
finish
overall
a
very
smooth
beer
with
lots
of
strong
malt
characteristics
id
feel
very
confident
in
recommending
this
brew
for
no
apparent
reason
ive
overlooked
this
one
for
a
while
looks
promising
though
so
here
goes
a
dark
reddishbrown
pour
is
completed
with
a
nice
twofinger
light
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
smattering
of
lace
is
left
behind
aroma
is
complex
with
plenty
of
cherries
figs
sweet
malts
yeast
caramel
and
dark
chocolates
a
slight
booziness
wafts
up
in
the
middle
of
it
all
more
dark
chocolates
subtle
cherries
toasted
malts
and
a
faint
bit
of
spice
perhaps
nutmeg
all
fill
the
palate
while
not
quite
as
bold
as
the
smell
the
taste
is
almost
perfectly
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
weighted
more
toward
the
medium
than
the
heavy
and
it
goes
down
smooth
and
maybe
even
a
little
bit
creamy
theres
a
pretty
good
pop
of
bubbles
upon
a
good
shake
which
evinces
good
carbonation
and
keeps
things
from
being
too
heavy
on
the
way
down
the
alcohol
content
while
not
huge
by
any
means
helps
keep
the
beer
interesting
as
its
not
overwhelming
but
definitely
noticeable
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
the
uk
a
quick
bit
of
internet
research
reveals
that
this
brew
is
an
18th
century
recipe
which
was
discovered
in
the
1960s
we
could
only
hope
more
of
these
lost
gems
could
be
rediscovered
as
that
would
make
for
some
very
tasty
brews
from
the
isles
dont
serve
this
too
cold
it
really
limits
the
beer
a
nice
cellar
temp
will
do
just
fine
a
great
cold
winter
beer
that
would
be
really
versatile
with
food
im
thinking
breakfast
mfd
easy
to
drink
but
not
enough
carbonation
for
my
taste
hardly
any
but
still
fitting
for
the
style
i
guess
a
cloudy
brown
pour
sweet
malt
does
smell
a
bit
like
malt
vinegar
tastes
is
not
so
much
but
malt
and
sweet
malt
some
raisin
woodiness
a
bit
thin
throughout
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
of
an
old
ale
so
i
was
a
little
dissappointed
not
bad
but
for
6
bucks
i
could
have
found
something
better
pours
a
dark

excellent
stuff
ill
have
this
again
anytime
one
deftly
rendered
wee
heavy
to
be
sure
everything
one
might
need
to
preparefortify
you
for
your
particular

tomorrow
after
that
this
will
still
do
you
well
at

until
springs
first
tentative
promises
of
lagerfueled

d
great
beer
ill
have
again
it
made
for
a
nice
sunday
night
sipper
a
surprisingly
easy
drinker
at
7
2
heat
is
incredibly
well
hidden
i
mean
you
really
cant
tell
its
there
mouthfeel
only
makes
you
want
to
confirm
this
more
add
this
to
a
rich
and
complex
flavor
profile
and
you
have
the
markings
of
an
excellent
brew
though
at
6
50
a
pop
i
wont
be
making
this
a
regular
addition
to
the
fridge
i
was
shocked
to
see
this
was
advertised
as
an
english
strong
ale
as
it
has
all
of
the
taste
and
appearance
of
a
scottish
ale
just
like
the
site
says
brown
pour
with
an
offwhite
head
nice
aroma
of
caramel
smoke
and
earthiness
more
caramel
and
smoke
in
the
taste
with
some
peat
toffee
and
a
lot
of
malt
smooth
taste
and
mouthfeel
delicious
drinkability
excellent
beer
will
be
having
again
drinkability
i
have
seen
this
particular
beer
sitting
on
many
store
shelves
and
just
recently
picked
one
up
to
try
man
what
was
i
thinking
being
a
malthead
this
is
exactly
what
i
like
a
relatively
big
beer
with
tremendously
complex
malt
flavors
very
good
notes
this
completes
the
trio
of
traquair
beers
that
are
available
for
purchase
to
me
i
would
love
to
try
the
other
more
available
one
name
escapes
me
as
it
is
apparently
a
completely
different
style
but
anyway
i
enjoyed
all
three
of
them
this
one
specifically
is
the
most
drinkable
and
it
is
appropriately
named
the
house
ale
i
recommend
this
one
and
any
traquair
beer
that
you
find
all
of
the
traquair
beers
imo
demand
your
attention
and
are
excellently
crafted
d
this
is
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
tried
so
far
its
a
subtle
drinkable
brew
d
overall
a
decent
brew
but
somehow
was
expecting
more
d
i
wish
i
hadnt
had
this
when
i
was
already
kind
of
full
i
suspect
i
might
have
liked
it
even
better
than
i
already
did
still
i
dont
see
how
it
can
be
anything
other
than
a
oneanddone
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
thick
off
white
head
from
somewhat
aggressive
pour
dissipates
quickly
with
splotchy
lacing
sour
cherries
and
hints
of
malt
in
the
nose
alcohol
taste
is
next
to
none
i
believe
this
is
due
to
colder
fermentation
temps
and
cold
conditioning
the
pleasant
sour
flavor
hits
the
tongue
and
is
washed
over
by
a
fig
like
maltiness
a
mild
sourness
remains
begging
for
another
sip
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
be
as
dry
and
thin
in
the
mouth
the
lingering
sourness
along
with
the
low
alcohol
perception
and
dryness
make
this
incredibly
drinkable
top
on
my
list
of
scottish
ales
d
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
poured
into
a
snifter
dark
brown
but
clearly
not
black
transparent
if
held
to
bright
light
thin
ecru
head
fades
quickly
little
lacing
aroma
is
stewed
dark
fruit
with
a
dark
toastiness
and
sweet
grapes
flavor
is
raisiny
with
caramel
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
the
smoke
and
peat
that
was
conspicuously
absent
from
the
aroma
medium
body
and
a
sticky
finish
nothing
outstanding
but
a
very
solid
and
traditional
beer
more
of

the

is
quite

the
taste
is

rich
fruity
flavor
some
burnt

some

a
really
nice
and
easygoing
drink
no

alcohol
d
great
the
alcohol
is
strong
but
this
is
not
a
hot
beer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
delicious
md
medium
to
full
bodied
excellent
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
despite
the
high
sweetness
d
this
is
an
outstanding
ale
i
couldnt
really
find
a
scotch
ale
i
liked
until
now
the
only
problem
is
that
it
costs
about
6
a
bottle
around
here
wont
be
having
this
one
too
often
because
of
the
price
but
it
will
be
a
real
treat
every
time
i
do

a
very
good
beer

d
this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
it
isnt
as
aggressive
as
many
out
there
but
rather
more
balanced
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
delicious
across
the
entire
temperature
range
though
a
bit
pricey
in
my
opinion
still
the
price
of
quality
cannot
be
understated
a
beutiful
deep
russett
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
shows
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
and
head
keeps
working
throughout
a
fantastic
nose
starting
with
alcohol
but
softening
to
a
great
earthy
nose
woody
with
hints
of
figs
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
the
same
way
soft
malty
sweetness
rolling
into
hop
bitterness
with
slight
alcohol
afterbite
it
rolls
softly
across
the
tongue
leaving
one
ready
for
more
this
is
the
stuff
poured
into
a
tulip
and
produced
a
finger
of
foam
for
couple
of
minutes
attractive
dark
brown
liquid
smells
very
pleasant
sweet
fig
grape
caramel
toffee
wood
and
an
overall
earthy
must
gadzooks
the
flavor
is
pretty
complex
and
i
must
not
be
very
familiar
with
this
style
because
it
is
not
what
i
am
used
to
it
is
very
earthy
not
much
sweetness
at
all
really
a
very
nice
bittering
hop
evens
out
the
biscuity
malts
finishes
like
licorice
and
some
nice
alcohol
warmth
about
average
carbonation
for
the
style
pretty
smooth
and
a
little
bit
more
than
a
medium
body
overall
it
rocked
my
socks
off
this
was
a
great
beer
found
mine
at
bevmo
the
bottle
is
simple
and
i
was
sold
on
its
tag
line
a
handmade
ale
brewed
in
the
ancient
brew
house
in
the
oldest
inhabited
house
in
scotland
product
of
scotland
give
it
a
shot
i
could
easily
keep
one
in
the
fridge
for
special
occasions
i
think
this
beer
does
well
on
its
own
or
would
make
a
nice
compliment
to
bbq
roasted
veggies
or
red
meat
overall
a
very
good
beer
it
was
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
have
liked
it
could
have
gone
for
some
more
bite
the
taste
has
similar
qualities
and
is
wonderful
its
zesty
lively
and
complex
very
full
of
flavour
but
all
restrained
and
nothing
overpowers
the
other
qualities
or
the
drinkability
it
is
on
the
dryish
side
despite
a
light
port
and
fermented
plumraisin
character
with
toastiness
quitwe
a
bit
of
black
pepper
and
licorice
some
chocolate
and
a
faint
leafy
and
earthy
quality
it
has
a
dryish
toasty
lightly
bitter
zesty
finish
very
smooth
and
complex
taste
all
the
ingredents
are
blended
very
wellno
standouts
and
very
well
balanced
taste
dark
fruitlots
of
earthyness
with
subtle
maltiness
has
a
nice
touch
of
tartness
with
gentle
hints
of
smoke
complex
tastes
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
and
a
slight
tangyness
with
no

at

make
this
beer
extremely
quaffable
has
a
nice
creamyness
making
for
a
light
mouthfeel
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
if
i
could
afford
it
the
steep
price
tag
over
a
100
a
case
knock
the
drinkability
down
a
half
notch
for
me
excellent
brew
must
try
beer
in
my
book
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
and
watery
very
light
carbonation
highly
drinkable
yet
delicate
and
softly
complex
mouthfeel
is
moderate
while
not
too
light
it
has
some
heavier
qualities
but
nothing
like
a
dark
ale
or
stout
again
interesting
very
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
and
a
very
enjoyable
experience
drinkability
i
picked
this
up
never
hearing
anything
about
it
and
im
glad
i
did
a
great
ale
one
that
is
nicely
savored
and
can
easily
be
pared
with
cheese
or
red
meat
maybe
even
try
smoked
cheeses
and
meats
d
as
good
as
i
remember
a
legendary
beer
that
provides
a
defining
example
of
what
a
scotch
ale
can
and
should
be
very
complex
rich
but
delicate
a
must
try
for
beer
geeks
drinkability
oh
so
good
not
a
chugging
beer
but
one
to
sip
continuously
through
the
night
glass
after
glass
drinkability
a
satisfying
malty
brew
that
delivers
both
on
taste
and
complexity
but
still
remains
fairly
easy
to
drink

delicious
a
perfect

of
bready

full

suits
beer
perfectly
a
beautifull
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
most
anytime
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
dry
bitter
aftertaste
love
love
love
the
malty
sweet
earthiness
of
this
one
it
may
be
my
new
favorite
scotch
ale
super
drinkable
ive
had
two
beers
from
traquair
and
both
have
been
world
class
if
you
see
this
do
not
hesitate
to
try
it
i
was
wondering
if
i
was
ever
going
to
experience
the
wonder
others
have
had
with
this
brew
and
it
came
towards
the
last
minute
and
what
a
treat
it
was
give
it
some
time
to
warm
after
pulling
it
from
the
fridge
and
you
too
will
experience
the
goodness
of
what
others
have
had
summery
in
one
word
quality
good
complexity
throughout
the
sip
with
a
smoky
malty
backbone
some
mildly
spicy
hops
and
a
velvety
smooth
texture
some
extant
alcohol
but
i
find
it
complimentary
almost
no
carbonation
at
all
very
relaxed
and
mellow
overall
a
nice
sipper
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
its
very
subdued
ill
take
an
old
chub
over
this
any
day
i
would
definitely
buy
another
bottle
excellent
beer
d
a
nice
beer
not
something
id
drink
often
but
every
now
and
then
would
be
fine
d
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
joy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
so
one
can
knock
back
a
few
no
problem
d
this
is
a
nice
ale
good
malt
taste
excellent
drinkability
is
another
shining
feature
among
many
in
this
a
truly
outstanding
beer
this
will
be
a
repeat
buy
for
me
this
beer
makes
no
bones
about
it
origins
i
feel
like
i
am
tasting
peat
smoked
malts
in
every
sip
even
though
this
scotch
ale
may
not
be
as
extreme
as
some
of
its
stateside
cousins
it
is
very
true
to
the
style
pours
a
very
dark
red
with
a
short
whitish
head
laces
nicely
smells
sweet
and
fruity
and
malty
notes
of
truffles
figs
dates
strawberries
cherries
and
liquor
very
inviting
smells
fantastic
surprizingly
unassertive
flavor
that
doesnt
live
up
to
the
smell
subdued
clean
and
peaty
malt
reserved
fruitiness
alcohol
noticeable
as
a
warming
sensation
on
the
finish
hints
of
blackcurrant
chocolate
thinner
than
i
expected
not
the
experience
i
though
it
would
be
but
reasonably
tasty
nonetheless
drinkability
is
high
but
this
is
one
to
sip
an
savor
it
gets
a
bit
thick
though
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
and
im
not
sure
id
enjoy
a
second
glass
as
much
i
love
this
beer
a
fine
example
of
a
great
style
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
rather
small
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
brown
bread
a
bit
buttery
and
nutty
some
light
wine
like
smells
as
well
the
taste
is
of
bready
malt
hints
of
raisins
slight
buttery
finishes
with
a
smooth
mellow
nutty
malt
flavor
the
feel
is
well
bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
silky
smooth
a
very
well
constructed
brew
the
feel
and
finish
of
this
brew
is
excellent
drinkability
great
beer
smooth
and
sweet
almost
juicy
save
for
the
balancing
bitter
kick
at
the
end
it
appears
a
dark
amber
without
head
retention
rich
caramel
aroma
with
a
hint
of
peat
and
earth
the
flavor
is
semidry
caramel
grains
with
a
mild
herbal
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
this
is
a
very
subtle
beer
and
it
hides
its
strength
well
however
id
like
a
little
more
flavor
out
of
a
7
scotch
ale
worth
a
try
for
the
great
drinkability
the
only
weak
point
of
the
beer
is
that
despite
good
carbonation
levels
it
is
quite
thin
for
something
of
its
class
still
the
alcohol
is
completely
masked
and
the
flavor
is
top
notch
id
say
scotch
ales
dont
get
much
easier
to
drink
interesting
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
7
abv
well
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
of
this
brew
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
a
skunked
bottle
at
least
i
hope
i
did
dbetter
than
average
as
there
are
interesting
flavors
here
but
i
wouldnt
drink
alot
of
these
very
subtle
flavors
and
aroma
ill
try
this
again
as
my
palate
improves
lightmedium
body
that
doesnt
seem
heavy
at
all
for
a
wee
heavy
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
extremely
well
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
for
an
ale
drinker
that
likes
a
malty
brew
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
good
its
smooth
and
very
drinkable
at
7
2
its
relatively
modest
and
amplifies
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
definitely
recommended
all
in
all
i
havent
had
but
maybe
two
scotch
ales
in
my
life
so
i
cant
really
compare
it
with
much
plus
im
not
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
nice
and
complex
beer
if
it
were
this
or
mcewans
ild
take
this
had
this
for
a
dessert
beer
and
it
was
wonderful
pours
a
mahoganytinted
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
frothy
head
that
leaves
minor
lacings
there
is
a
strong
malt
presence
in
the
aroma
hard
to
pick
out
exactly
what
malt
but
i
picked
up
some
coffee
chocolate
and
possibly
toasted
i
am
not
sure
there
couldve
been
hazelnut
in
there
too
there
are
also
currents
of
caramelhoney
figs
and
dark
fruit
this
had
to
be
one
of
the
smoothest
brews
i
have
ever
had
yet
alone
a
wee
heavy
the
malt
taste
is
defining
but
there
are
citric
fruit
notes
i
think
there
might
even
be
some
crisp
apple
notes
in
there
on
the
side
and
the
caramel
rounds
it
out
the
hop
bite
on
the
back
end
is
perfect
just
enough
to
make
itself
distinguishable
yet
letting
the
beer
remain
ultrasmooth
not
slick
or
watery
perhaps
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
sessioning
is
the
price
i
cant
afford
7
a
beer
for
a
whole
night
well
worth
the
splurge
and
a
musttry
the
taste
is
firstly
dark
fruit
with
plum
and
fig
followed
by
some
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus
that
adds
just
a
bit
of
tartness
and
bitterness
for
balance
nice
the
dark
fruit
is
really
ruling
it
and
pretty
much
dominates
the
flavour
several
sips
in
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
just
some
warming
after
the
swallow
one
fine
sipper
i
have
here
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
medium
full
and
its
lightly
carbonated
man
i
wish
i
knew
why
i
havent
bought
it
the
times
i
made
my
visits
to
colorado
because
im
really
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
it
highly
recommended
dvery
easy
to
drink
because
of
how
balanced
the
flavor
is
the
malty
flavor
is
strong
but
not
too
over
powering
also
the
sweetness
is
there
but
not
too
sweet
either
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
too
many
of
these
because
of
the
higher
alcohol
but
it
would
make
a
great
session
ale
other
than
that
fact
d
very
good
as
excellent
beer
but
not
quite
as
interesting
as
the
1977
4
5
worth
a
try
rich
deep
reddish
brown
with
small
light
tan
head
smell
is
a
musty
peaty
rich
malty
sweetness
similar
in
a
way
to
a
mcewans
but
more
complex
taste
is
somewhat
similar
to
smell
but
more
muted
and
less
sweet
still
earthy
flavored
with
a
quite
mild
bitter
finish
to
it
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
bad
at
all
but
not
my
preferred
style
either
pours
a
dark
brownish
red
with
a
medium
tan
head
smells
of
yeast
and
raisins
taste
is
buttery
toffee
with
a
bit
of
twang
to
it
there
is
also
a
nice
earthy
flavor
from
the
hops
bitterness
levels
are
good
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonation
levels
are
a
little
high
i
could
drink
several
of
these
drinks
like
a
session
ale
yet
is
over
7
abv
this
is
the
first
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
ive
had
and
i
must
say
i
enjoy
this
style
a
lot
excellent
if
i
ever
find
it
on
tap
or
cask
somewhere
scotland
perhaps
ill
be
in
trouble
the
smell
is
sweet
and
of
figs
the
taste
is
smooth
and
it
malt
dominated
up
front
but
as
it
lingers
on
the
palate
it
is
bitter
very
cool
it
has
a
earthiness
to
it
like
a
mushroom
from
the
ground
overall
the
best
scotch
ale
or
strong
scottish
ale
i
have
tasted
to
date
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
with
a
little
sweetness
at
the
end
drinkability
is
good
for
this
abv
a
couple
of
these
on
a
cold
night
would
be
nice
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
can
find
it
and
if
you
get
the
chance
save
a
few
bottles
for
a
few
years
down
the
road
cheers
overall
i
thought
this
was
very
good
surprisingly
good
actually
its
a
little
hard
to
find
around
here
in
raleigh
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
my
review
doesnt
seem
to
match
the
others
on
here
maybe
a
skunked
or
too
old
bottle
pours
dark
woody
brown
with
a
slight
haze
and
red
notes
when
held
to
the
light
aroma
is
very
roasty
but
with
some
fruityestery
notes
and
hints
of
pepper
flavor
is
roasty
with
licorice
character
and
some
dark
fruits
figs
and
raisins
the
dark
malts
dry
it
out
quite
a
bit
but
not
unpleasantly
so
aftertaste
is
more
licorice
and
dark
malts
expressing
as
coffee
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smooth
a
nice
beer
but
i
remember
it
being
much
more
floral
and
complex
hearty
and
rich
with
a
thick
grain
flavor
on
the
end
definitely
supremely
crafted
and
well
made
and
even
more
so
definitely
worth
tryingand
trying
again
when
i
roamed
the
shelves
before
the
days
of
ba
where
i
could
find
a
little
help
here
and
there
on
what
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
brew
id
be
searching
for
flavor
and
style
no
need
to
say
any
more
than
that
this
is
a
quite
unique
and
enjoyable
scotch
i
think
i
prefer
jacobite
but
this
is
one
that
should
not
be
missed
pours
dark
red
slightly
cloudy
little
head
very
very
smooth
going
down
hardly
notice
the
abv
if
someone
asked
me
to
define
a
scotch
style
ale
this
is
what
i
would
hand
them
fruity
aromas
slight
hop
finish
sails
down
the
throat
like
sanka
down
the
pushcart
track
but
dont
drive
your
pushcart
after
a
few
of
these
even
if
you
have
your
lucky
egg
notes
this
is
pretty
rich
and
complex
stuff
but
its
so
good
that
id
almost
consider
it
sessionable
if
not
for
rarity
and
price
highly
recommended
excellent
had
a
bottle
at
the
ginger
man
in
houston
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
that
i
wish
was
more
readily
available
it
is
hard
for
me
to
describe
everything
going
on
but
it
is
all
perfectly
balanced
a
great
beer
it
is
almost
exactly
like
i
am
drinking
what
i
smell
fruits
plums
cherries
sweet
malt
licorice
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
my
irish
hat
is
off
to
all
the
scotsman
who
get
to
drink
this
all
day
d
this
is
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
turning
other
onto
its
the
sort
of
subtle
ale
that
i
need
some
times
after
lots
of
craft
beers
with
a
focus
on
hops
its
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
increadibly
easy
to
drink
a
remarkable
brew
bordering
the
exceptional
not
a
session
beer
though
the
last
few
have
gone
down
much
smoother
than
the
first
still
wish
it
had
a
headier
scent
but
its
a
great
beer
from
the
oldest
inhabited
house
in
scotland
poured
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
rich
reddish
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
smells
fruity
with
a
bit
of
toffee
aroma
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
fruits
and
alcohol
but
balanced
very
well
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
was
my
first
scotch
ale
and
i
think
im
going
to
have
to
try
some
more
overall
not
bad
at
allhave
onesit
back
and
relaxenjoy
the
brew
and
then
move
on
to
something
else
walnut
brown
color
with
thin
foam
fruity
and
toffee
odors
sweet
malt
taste
up
front
mild
roastiness
apparent
finish
has
some
alcoholic
bitterness
a
bit
reminiscent
of
a
stout
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
slickness
well
balanced
but
not
so
drinkable
at
7
2
a
really
fine
beer
it
makes
one
wish
that
there
were
more
scottish
ales
to
be
had
in
the
us
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
and
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
some
average
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
subtle
peat
with
some
toffee
malt
is
well
balance
taste
is
also
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
toffee
malt
with
some
subtle
notes
of
peat
which
is
quite
enjoyable
body
is
quite
full
with
a
very
nice
creamy
texture
very
well
done
and
something
i
would
love
to
have
more
often
it
clearly
has
the
hallmarks
of
authenticity
and
is
one
of
the
most
distinctive
scotch
ales
ive
tried
overall
a
wonderful
glass
of
malty
goodness
very
drinkable
and
the
alcholol
content
is
dangerously
hidden
quite
an
impressive
brew
12
oz
bottled
poured
into
snifter
bad
pour
producing
little
head
smelled
of
caramel
and
subtle
vanilla
raisin
tasted
a
smooth
caramelmolasses
very
warming
in
the
mouth
aftertaste
was
sweet
but
not
syrup
great
beer
to
drink
slightly
warmer
than
normal
and
would
be
great
during
a
winter
snowstorm
this
beer
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
was
initially
sherry
like
but
then
developed
into
a
maltycaramel
smell
the
taste
is
malty
and
complex
caramel
and
raisons
come
to
mind
as
some
of
the
stand
out
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
coats
the
tongue
nicely
without
being
chewy
i
think
this
is
a
delightful
beer

complex
but
smooth
i
think
ill
put
it
on
my
a
list
drinkability
well
if
you
can
find
any
of
these
gems
pick
them
up
and
store
them
i
think
it
was
a
worthwhile
cellaring
nice
bit
of
history
and
certainly
an
honor
to
have
been
included
in
the
sharing
of
this
fine
elixir
taste
is
slightly
burned
with
the
roast
of
chocolatemalt
which
gives
the
beer
its
maltbitter
there
is
a
light
bitter
but
nothing
to
really
fight
against
the
roast
flavors
the
yeast
adds
a
spiciness
which
is
a
little
liquorice
and
a
little
green
herbs
body
is
quite
thin
i
always
thought
scotch
ales
are
supposed
to
be
more
sweet
overall
a
good
subtle
brew
more
akin
to
a
gruit
than
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
very
mild
and
drinkable
perhaps
to
a
fault
drinkability
this
is
decent
ale
but
not
great
so
for
me
that
holds
down
sessionability
d
minimal
alcohol
burn
but
still
a
bit
much
to
drink
all
night
d
all
around
a
brilliant
ale
that
would
seem
to
suit
any
frame
of
mind
its
malt
character
is
delicious
and
its
balance
and
composition
is
so
well
executed
that
it
ranks
very
high
in
the
drinkability
category
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
amber
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
dark
toasted
malts
with
dark
fruits
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
the
taste
contains
dark
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
coffee
and
a
dry
lingering
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
will
try
again
whenever
a
rare
bottle
shows
up
here
in
the
midwest
330
ml
bottle
served
in
my
paceña
glass
it
pours
an
unfiltered
dark
maroon
with
light
carbonation
and
a
halfinch
khaki
head
that
retains
a
thin
blanket
and
leaves
light
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
inviting
and
consists
of
raisinsfigs
sherryred
wine
straw
and
blackberries
light
vanilla
and
some
oak
overtones
complex
almost
divine
it
tastes
smoky
and
earthy
at
the
start
but
moves
into
notes
of
chocolate
leather
tea
red
berries
apples
flowers
and
mild
hops
while
the
oak
and
vanilla
contribute
throughout
the
body
is
medium
with
equal
carbonation
and
finish
and
is
fairly
drying
overall
a
great
complex
example
of
a
scottish
ale
and
one
i
would
drink
more
often
were
it
not
for
the
above
average
cost
drinkability
not
too
much
i
would
drink
it
again
but
there
isnt
a
lot
of
drinkability
factor
on
this
one
its
quite
a
big
beer
with
that
7

abv
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
basically
no
lacing
at
all
the
nose
is
malty
figs
prunes
raisins
slight
licorice
and
some
caramel
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
very
slight
alcohol
warming
in
the
throat
otherwise
abv
hidden
very
well
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
little
wee
heavy
quite
different
than
others
ive
had
recommended
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
think
it
is
good
i
will
buy
this
again
d
this
is
a
real
winter
beer
for
me
drinking
it
in
may
and
i
still
enjoy
it
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
lots
of
great
flavours
and
lingering
character
in
the
taste
definitely
one
to
note
12oz
brown
bottle
from
rons
dark
brown
body
with
ruby
red
highlights
and
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
toasty
nutty
aroma
on
this
one
tastes
like
nut
caramel
malt
with
roasty
and
burnt
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
full
flavored
and
complex
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
support
it
fairly
drinkable
for
the
fullbodiednesss
and
abv
fantastic
a
mellow
tasty
brew
for
sipping
much
like
its
distilled
counterparts
great
beer
d
quite
good
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
this
isnt
a
beer
ill
rave
about
but
its
one
id
like
to
have
again
recommended
d
nice
cold
weather
sipping
beer
very
tasty
nice
very
drinkable
although
could
get
you
in
trouble
with
abv
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
may
be
more
bitter
than
your
typical
scotch
style
but
i
enjoy
that
this
beers
refinement
is
what
sets
it
apart
from
others
in
the
style
a
more
average
example
may
have
a
grainier
or
sharper
malt
profile
but
this
was
extremely
smooth
and
mellow
and
transitioned
smoothly
to
a
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
with
a
touch
of
mild
coffee
grounds
the
creamy
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
made
this
one
go
down
dangerously
easily
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
thin
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
not
a
pretty
beer
the
aroma
is
complex
and
winey
with
the
alcohol
noticeable
but
not
dominant
and
with
top
notes
of
dry
malt
and
brandied
dark
fruits
with
some
sherry
notes
there
as
well
the
flavor
has
more
of
that
malty
winey
flavor
more
dark
fruit
a
touch
of
woodiness
and
attenuated
raisin
and
sweet
sherry
flavors
there
is
a
little
nutty
spiciness
on
the
finish
and
a
rich
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
although
the
beer
is
slightly
thinner
than
you
might
have
guessed
it
would
be
quite
drinkable
but
best
as
an
after
dinner
sipper
this
beers
was
one
of
my
early
favorites
maybe
20
years
agoand
its
nice
to
see
that
it
still
impresses
after
all
these
years
great
brew
after
striking
out
with
other
scottish
ales
i
tried
this
beer
i
was
suprised
by
how
much
i
liked
it
its
one
of
the
more
expensive
beers
ive
tried
but
worth
every
penny
the
taste
was
complex
but
well
balanced
i
felt
like
it
was
a
lil
heavy
but
very
drinkable
and
had
a
pleasant
after
taste
give
it
a
try
you
may
be
suprised
this
was
just
sorta
blah
for
me
im
starting
to
think
that
i
just
dont
care
much
for
this
style
i
was
hoping
this
might
be
the
one
to
show
me
the
way
but
no
such
luck
a
little
too
subtle
for
me
i
will
have
to
try
the
jacobite
one
of
these
days
d

easy
sipper
worth
trying
d
this
scotch
ale
is
very
drinkable
an
excellent
scotch
ale
the
7
2
warms
the
chest
slightly
on
the
way
down
this
beverage
is
refreshingly
drinkable
recommended
this
is
a
really
great
beer
certainly
amongst
my
favorites
a
bit
difficult
to
find
but
if
you
do
find
a
bottle
try
it
a
wonderful
beer
to
savor
drinkability
ive
always
been
hesitant
to
buy
this
beer
because
of
the
price
but
no
more
its
absolutely
worth
it
a
real
gem
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
especially
for

beautiful
deep

topped
by
a
thin

that
dissipates
to

rather
sour
much
like
cider
vinegar
coupled
with
rich
sweet

and
some
underlying
notes
of
dark
fruit

much
less
acidic
complex
sweet
roasted
malt
with
some
assertive
smoky
notes
finish
is
actually
fairly
light
and
airy

is
smooth

superb
a
fine

wellworth
the
premium

occasion

in

only
however
there
was
a
slight
hops
presence
that
struck
me
in
the
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
thick
and
stickly
with
high
carbonation
this
beer
was
a
very
lovely
example
of
scotch
ale
nicely
drinkable
but
rather
expensive

still
this

definitely
quite

well

d
opened
this
for
burns
night
this
is
my
first
traquair
and
i
love
it
i
could
see
buying
more
of
this
for
the
mild
florida
winter
nights
overall
this
ale
holds
up
to
its
famous
heritage
i
cant
remember
a
better
smelling
ale
from
the
bottle
in
a
very
long
time
id
give
it
a
6
if
i
could
the
dryness
makes
this
otherwise
sweet
and
sometimes
cloying
style
really
stand
alone
in
the
originality
category
i
bet
its
going
to
be
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
find
a
finer
wee
heavy
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
im
very
grateful
and
glad
i
got
to
try
this
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
probably
my
favorite
scotch
ale
so
far
good
for
a
special
day
or
just
a
cold
winter
night
highly
recommended
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
like
it
wow
this
is
really
dark
brown
and
nearly
black
yet
golden
on
the
edges
not
too
much
head
nose
is
kissed
with
hops
brown
sugar
and
caramel
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
this
is
decent
but
nothing
remarkable
good
beer
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
with
its
less
than
12
oz
bottle
and
nearly
6
price
tag
this
one
has
thoroughly
disappointed
me
buttery
mess
of
a
beer
d
im
sure
that
if
it
was
fresh
it
would
rank
a
90
but
this
is
definitely
not
the
traquair
house
ale
is
a
good
strong
scotch
ale
if
you
like
a
good
porter
youll
probably
really
like
this
beer
it
pours
golden
brown
with
reddish
hues
and
has
a
thin
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
very
nice
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
peat
chocolate
and
black
licorice
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
predominantly
roasted
malt
that
is
well
balanced
and
not
sweet
leading
to
a
dry
roasted
malt
finish
the
perfect
beer
for
kicking
back
a
few
pints
on
a
cold
night
sitting
in
front
of
a
large
fireplace
in
an
old
scottish
hunting
lodge
this
is
an
incredibly
balanced
complex
brew
and
an
absolute
pleasure
to
sip
slightly
chilled
this
is
a
very
nice
sipping
brew
it
has
a
unique
complex
taste
i
highly
recommended
this
one
i
cant
recall
what
i
paid
for
the
tiny
euro
bottle
but
i
remember
it
as
something
of
an
indulgent
splurge
traquair
house
is
charming
in
its
own
rustic
way
but
overvalued
in
my
view
i
prefer
belhaven
overall
a
nice
beer
to
finish
out
the
evening
pours
out
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
dark
cherrywood
and
saddle
leather
with
a
thin
forced
head
that
settles
out
to
a
perfect
khaki
ring
smells
like
a
mixture
of
caramel
toffee
grape
juice
cherries
bread
dried
fruit
plum
and
a
hint
of
anise
reminds
me
of
a
malty
belgian
sans
spicy
yeast
flavor
has
a
lot
of
grape
in
it
along
with
slightly
burnt
toast
dates
raisins
honey
caramel
and
toffee
i
get
caramel
and
pears
in
the
aftertaste
ridiculously
complex
while
im
not
always
crazy
about
a
sticky
sweet
beer
this
one
is
damn
near
perfect
mouthfeel
wise
full
body
practically
a
still
beverage
and
it
leaves
a
lingering
coating
on
the
tongue
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
pretty
perfect
for
a
cold
and
windy
night
poured
from
a
330cl
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bottle
had
a
bottling
indicator
but
not
clear
on
dating
poured
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
tint
had
a
good
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
smell
was
very
pleasant
with
a
sweet
malt
front
and
tones
of
fig
and
fruit
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
but
that
is
typical
of
the
style
the
taste
was
very
good
from
start
to
finish
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
the
7

abv
kind
of
sneaks
up
on
you
towards
the
end
it
doesnt
really
taste
high
alcohol
but
by
the
end
you
get
that
nice
warm
feeling
highly
recommend
its
too
pricey
to
be
in
heavy
rotation
but
definitely
worth
getting
as
a
treat
4
rr
ty
when
poured
it
was
a
very
dark
brown
with
very
little
dark
tan
foam
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
fruit
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
flavor
of
roasted
malts
mixed
with
caramel
was
very
pleasing
a
nice
balance
of
all
the
components
in
this
ale
but
not
worth
the
price
find
it
buy
it
drink
it
enjoy
it
and
fill
yourself
with
wonderful
memories
of
it
pours
from
the
bottle
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
tint
dark
brown
head
that
lingers
well
and
slowly
dissipates
to
decent
lacing
sweet
malty
aroma
of
chocolate
and
toffee
with
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
nice
thick
body
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
creeping
in
at
the
end
leaves
for
a
nice
long
finish
dark
brown
pour
with
a
cherry
hue
against
the
light
dirty
tan
head
two
fingered
dissapating
to
a
slim
frothy
ring
the
generous
nose
consists
of
roasted
malts

cedar
and
prunes
the
first
taste
strong
with
toasted
wheat
and
roasted
grains
hop
notes
are
faint
offering
a
sour
floral
background
the
tartness
remains
in
the
finish
along
with
an
alcoholic
warmth
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
suprisingly
water
mouthfeel
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
raisony
sweetness
develop
towards
the
end
pleasant
nicely
drinkable
an
excellent
coolevening
sipper
not
something
id
like
a
huge
amount
of
but
a
great
changeup
from
the
beers
ive
been
drinking
recently
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
nothing
really
caught
my
attention
though
it
was
a
bit
watery
at
times
and
the
carbonation
was
strange
and
inconsistent
not
a
bad
drinker
but
not
the
best
either
wow
nice
ale
kind
of
snobtastic
i
feel
like
i
could
sit
around
trying
to
make
this
review
way
more
overblown
than
it
already
is
great
finisher
and
ill
surely
be
coming
back
to
this
little
number
come
winter
as
a
warmer
itll
be
a
great
temptation
to
overindulge
d
meh
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
am
still
sipping
at
it
not
hugely
drinkable
at
least
for
me
but
i
plan
on
finishing
the
bottle
well
quite
unimpressed
with
this
one
after
reading
the
reviews
here
i
wonder
if
im
even
drinking
the
same
brew
its
just
a
decent
beer
that
is
highly
overrated
id
rather
drink
a
winter
welcome
over
this
which
is
what
this
beer
wants
to
taste
like
skip
it
traquair
house
ale
was
redbrown
in
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
layer
in
a
minute
or
so
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
was
very
malty
this
beer
just
had
an
wonderful
complex
malt
flavor
it
was
medium
bodied
and
delicious
a
must
try
pours
a
clear
but
thick
dark
redbrown
small
off
white
head
forms
some
spots
of
lace
head
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
but
stays
there
smell
is
malty
toffee
perfumefloral
some
vanilla
chocolate
maybe
an
oakiness
little
alcohol
nice
taste
is
real
malty
floral
and
toffee
vanilla
chocolate
grains
some
oxidization
so
this
may
not
be
too
fresh
of
a
bottle
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
nice
smooth
scotch
ale
although
i
fear
this
isnt
the
freshest
example
while
pouring
it
is
a
milky
brown
with
a
strange
greenish
almost
iridescent
hint
only
seen
while
pouring
weird
get
a
strong
whiff
of
nice
scottish
malt
medium
dark
cream
colored
head
that
stays
very
thin
but
present
through
the
enjoying
glass
a
strong
lace
that
only
appears
while
tipping
the
glass
a
woody
nutty
aftertaste
thats
very
pleasant
good
mouth
feel
nice
wee
heavy
nice
beer
overall
i
havent
seen
this
one
localy
but
from
what
ive
heard
it
is
readily
available
in
the
states
maybe
ill
make
this
one
my
house
ale
had
a
bottle
that
poured
very
dark
with
a
2
inch
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
one
inch
it
had
a
light
scotch
whiskey
smell
with
a
hint
of
juniper
but
i
had
to
practically
stir
the
brew
with
my
nose
to
get
it
i
liked
the
taste
heavy
malty
flavor
washes
over
the
tongue
with
a
nutty
chocolate
taste
but
leaves
a
light
impression
which
makes
for
easier
drinkibility
in
the
long
run
i
didnt
notice
any
strong
alcohol
taste
despite
the
slight
whisky
smell
and
at
7
percent
its
almost
pushing
it
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
watery
interesting
how
the
taste
is
rather
bold
but
the
texture
of
the
beer
is
not
overall
and
interesting
beer
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
quite
nice
but
i
dont
think
i
would
put
this
on
my
top
100
beers
but
who
am
i
pop
goes
the
plain
black
cap
and
alcoholic
rumsoaked
cherries
waft
up
through
the
neck
mmm
there
is
a
beauty
in
a
wee
heavy
unlike
any
other
style
and
this
is
no
exception
rich
dark
chestnut
hue
with
less
ruby
than
some
others
of
the
style
i
have
had
hints
of
red
but
mostly
an
ebony
tealike
colour
i
got
only
a
thinnish
head
from
the
beer
but
what
was
there
was
nice
and
tight
dusty
white
colouration
fine
tiny
bubbles
and
quickmoving
lace
a
respectable
looking
wee
heavy
plenty
of
sweet
candy
and
red
licorice
at
first
on
the
nose
then
some
herbal
aromas
reminiscent
of
pinesomewhat
akin
to
some
of
the
heather
ale
beers
alcohol
is
fairly
detectable
then
lots
of
prunes
and
rum
and
brown
sugar
there
is
also
a
creamy
milk
note
that
renders
the
aroma
extremely
appetising
a
unique
malthop
combination
here
too
the
malts
are
very
grainy
but
the
hopping
makes
it
seem
very
florallike
sweet
flowers
the
malts
dominate
as
they
should
though
adding
a
myriad
of
smells
like
raisins
sweet
chocolate
maple
syrup
and
caramel
lovely
aroma
the
taste
falls
a
little
short
for
me
from
what
i
was
expecting
at
first
there
are
all
sorts
of
lovely
sugarladen
fruits
and
plenty
of
alcohol
i
think
it
is
the
end
where
the
beer
leaves
a
very
dry
dusty
charcoal
feel
rather
than
following
up
on
the
sweet
smoothness
before
it
too
the
body
seems
to
thin
out
at
the
end
not
too
say
that
the
beer
is
without
taste
plenty
of
woody
hop
character
dry
dark
malts
and
chocolate
and
coffee
up
front
almonds
licorice
oak
and
some
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
mediumcarbonated
and
very
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
however
i
find
it
too
dry
for
the
style
still
lovely
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
have
another
why
yes
thank
you
d
not
bad
i
could
have
another
pretty
easily
a
very
good
scotch
ale
without
whacking
you
in
the
face
with
alcohol
tastes
very
smooth
and
malty
with
coffee
notes
and
some
burnt
wood
or
caramel
great
creamy
mouthfeel
makes
it
pleasant
with
simple
food
nice
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
beer
thoroughly
enjoyable
seems
like
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
be
really
excellent
with
a
heavy
meal
if
you
want
stoutish
flavors
but
less
body
this
is
your
beer
if
you
want
it
for
less
than
5
a
bottle
youre
probably
out
of
luck
this
pours
a
dark
mahogny
with
a
large
white
head
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
the
smell
is
malty
with
alcohol
bananasand
some
nuttyness
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
bananas
and
a
hoppy
aftertaste
surprisingly
there
is
no
alcohol
tastethis
is
a
smooth
and
creamy
beer
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
this
is
an
ale
to
behold
i
could
drink
this
all
day
mmmm
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
complexity
and
agressive
tastes
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
not
necessarily
an
everyday
quaffer
but
i
could
down
a
few
pints
in
the
right
mood
cheers2beers
truly
one
of
the
more
pleasurable
beers
out
there
such
a
lively
and
complex
brew
borrowing
the
rich
texture
of
a
fine
scotch
and
the
soft
mellow
flavouring
as
well
these
flavours
only
enhanced
as
it
warmed
up
as
well
i
think
this
is
an
ultimate
dessert
beer
and
as
impressive
as
any
liquor
etc
a
beer
which
exibits
such
refinement
and
elegance
a
truly
special
scottish
ale
i
wanted
to
try
this
beer
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
i
was
a
little
disappointed
it
was
nice
to
look
at
and
smell
but
i
didnt
particularly
like
the
taste
it
was
a
medium
to
dark
brown
color
with
a
sweet
caramel
odor
it
had
a
sweet
taste
with
some
hops
but
a
fairly
yeasty
aftertaste
it
was
thinner
than
i
expected
from
its
appearance
a
fair
beer
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
it
is
probably
one
of
the
better
scottish
styles
that
i
have
had
in
some
time
i
enjoy
the
fact
that
this
beer
isnt
really
peaty
like
many
from
this
region
as
i
dont
care
for
that
character
this
is
a
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
am
sure
that
i
will
be
drinking
again
in
the
future
this
beer
is
top
notch
traquair
house
has
really
reinforced
my
liking
for
the
scotch
ale
making
it
among
my
favorite
styles
truly
a
great
brew
very
good
balanced
wee
heavy
i
could
drink
this
again
and
again
easily
quaffed
brew
with
nothing
to
detract
from
it
definite
caramel
on
the
tongue
little
carbonation
to
speak
of
a
very
nice
beer
fantastic
i
have
nothing
negative
to
say
about
this
one
certainly
a
sipper
though
i
dont
see
myself
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
for
the
money
i
am
let
down
i
would
like
to
enjoy
it
again
but
dont
see
myself
opting
for
this
often
when
so
much
else
is
available
better
and
for
less
color
is
dark
mahogany
with
a
ruby
glow
creamy
head
is
light
brown
and
mediumsized
retention
is
somewhat
weak
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramelized
earthy
malt
a
touch
of
english
herbal
hop
rounds
out
the
aroma
taste
is
of
sweet
toasty
malt
with
a
caramelized
sugar
sweetness
an
earthynutty
malt
is
also
in
the
mix
especially
the
finish
hopping
is
moderate
and
has
an
herbal
flavor
this
is
very
flavorful
and
has
a
nicely
layered
taste
however
the
overall
flavor
seems
to
pale
in
comparison
to
many
of
the
glowing
reviews
ive
read
for
this
beer
ill
definently
give
this
another
whirl
to
see
if
ive
missed
something
the
beer
poured
brown
with
mild
ruby
highlights
it
was
topped
by
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
receded
quickly
into
the
glass
the
aroma
is
more
complex
than
i
expected
it
has
dark
caramel
toffee
dates
i
get
a
little
raisin
in
this
too
even
a
yeast
character
never
found
that
in
a
scottish
ale
before
layers
of
flavor
a
lot
of
dark
caramel
dates
more
of
the
raisin
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
yeast
comes
across
on
the
finish
too
just
a
hint
of
bread
dough
this
beer
is
a
game
changer
as
far
as
beers
from
scotland
are
concerned
it
really
reminds
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
smooth
full
mouth
feel
no
heat
at
all
very
drinkable
by
far
my
favorite
scottish
ale
i
personally
love
this
beer
its
got
a
great
malt
profile
but
isnt
grainy
like
some
malt
monsters
out
there
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
this
brewerys
products
are
in
general
excellent
and
worth
seeking
out
cask
or
bottle
at
any
opportunity
d
a
good
dessert
after
dinner
beer
easily
drinkable
dark
brown
w
reddish
character
halfinch
light
foam
cap
minor

aroma
of
sweettangy
nuttiness
caramellike
and
toasty
nose
is
quite
weak
though
the
taste
is
of
brown

choccaramel
with
a
raisin
sweetness
slightly
bitter
and
toasty
very
dry
tasting
medium
thick
with
average
carbonation
alcohol
not
overpowering
i
wasnt
as
impressed
as
id
hoped
maybe
this
was
a
bad
bottle
the
sweetness
was
nice
but
a
bit
funky
perhaps
stale
maybe
i
just
dont
like
this
style
all
that
much
its
still
worth
a
try
and
even
i
might
have
to
attempt
another
bottle
the
malt
sweetness
is
nearly
dead
on
for
my
taste
preferences
which
tend
to
run
on
the
malty
side
of
things
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
no
where
near
levels
of
belgian
candi
sugar
derivation
the
malt
flavor
itself
is
quite
complex
to
boot
a
beautifully
crafted
ale
the
mouthfeel
seems
very
smooth
and
almost
flat
still
quite
good
though
feels
just
right
for
what
it
is
drinkability
is
good
ive
been
shying
away
from
some
of
the
beers
available
at
my
work
since
im
unsure
of
their
age
but
this
one
is
still
cracking
ill
probably
drink
it
in
the
future
and
ill
definitely
recommend
to
my
mother
who
loves
a
good
scotch
ale
traquair
house
ale
is
a
big
time
winner
it
engages
challenges
evolves
and
rewards
so
what
does
it
sound
like
well
by
my
ear
it
sounds
kind
of
like
the
ocean
but
that
could
have
just
been
the
snifter
oh
well
four
out
of
five
aint
bad
this
is
simply
one
of
the
finest
ales
i
have
tasted
pours
a
murky
brown
almost
black
with
minimal
head
and
very
little
lacing
smells
of
dry
fruits
such
as
fig
raisens
and
dates
also
strong
caramel
notes
has
a
very
pleasently
sweet
taste
but
not
too
sweet
as
the
alcohol
taste
is
just
right
very
notable
caramel
and
fruit
notes
all
around
just
an
excellent
brew
mouthfeel
is
extraordinarily
smooth
frighteningly
smooth
deceptively
drinkable
im
not
even
a
third
of
the
way
through
the
glass
and
its
already
the
best
scottish
ale
ive
ever
had
if
this
werent
so
blasted
expensive
nearly
6
per
12oz
bottle
it
would
be
a
fridge
staple
pours
a
clear
caramel
color
under
a
thin
light
beige
head
that
barely
musters
12
finger
then
retreats
to
film
and
collar
leaving
a
smattering
of
lace
spots
caramel
and
roasted
nut
dominate
the
nose
with
lots
of
barley
malt
in
the
background
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
quite
heavy
with
syrup
honey
and
nuts
greet
the
palate
with
some
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
mild
dry
hops
as
it
warms
plum
and
grape
also
emerge
and
the
bitterness
strengthens
nice
and
complex
but
one
is
probably
enough
its
a
glass
of
stalwart
tradition
earthen
and
staid
rich
and
graceful
fitted
like
a
wellworn
favorite
sweater
its
a
warm
cozy
british
friend
easy
to
enjoy
theres
no
need
for
quantity
but
the
one
or
two
you
have
are
mighty
fine
in
themselves
so
sure
one
tonight
and
then
one
another
night
as
well
real
soon
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
lightly
tart
up
front
with
a
rich
malt
character
that
has
notes
of
toasted
malt
a
dry
biscuitlike
note
with
lots
of
rich
toffee
on
top
the
taste
is
quite
light
up
front
which
is
what
i
expected
the
taste
is
fairly
dry
which
seems
to
accentuate
the
tart
tamarind
notes
i
really
like
the
malt
notes
in
this
beer
they
are
rich
and
satisfying
despite
the
beer
being
light
something
that
seems
to
be
missed
on
this
side
of
the
pond
mouthfeeldrinkability
relatively
quiet
in
the
mouth
even
with
some
gentle
swishing
the
bubbles
dont
seem
to
want
to
emerge
surprisingly
thin
as
the
beer
gradually
warms
but
certainly
big
in
flavor
and
warmth
a
bolder
and
more

alternative
to
some
of
our
more
available
scotch
ales
i
dont
know
how
good
this
bottle
is
it
seems
to
have
set
there
for
about
a
year
pours
a
beautiful
head
that
slowly
dissapates
leaving
a
little
lacing
behind
color
is
bright
and
dark
amber
to
brown
smells
very
nutty
and
creamy
very
nice
it
has
a
very
bready
taste
and
aftertaste
taste
is
a
little
creamy
nutty
and
smooth
it
has
a
coffee
undertone
and
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
its
also
slightly
sweet
and
malty
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
thats
a
little
watery
d
this
beer
really
caught
me
by
surprise
it
has
nice
earthy
sweet
malts
with
some
notes
of
cherries
that
really
compliment
the
other
flavors
spiced
raisins
dates
and
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
and
peat
in
the
aroma
poured
rum
brown
with
a
sliver
of
a
white
head
molasseslike
texture
and
the
flavors
of
bourbon
spiced
bread
pudding
very
malty
and
full
the
alcohol
flavors
actually
would
lead
me
to
believe
it
was
10
rather
than
7
2
but
i
have
noticed
many
scottish
brews
often
taste
more
alcoholic
than
they
actually
are
it
is
kind
of
the
inverse
of
the
belgian
trademark
of
masking
alcohol
poured
a
deep
dark
hue
of
red
very
attractive
when
held
to
light
as
the
ruby
tones
emerge
head
was
ok
and
didnt
last
long
leaving
a
ring
and
some
patchwork
nose
was
malty
and
full
a
slight
hint
of
fruitiness
as
well
which
gave
me
a
strong
impression
of
apples
taste
was
unexpectedly
clean
and
pure
full
of
rich
robust
maltiness
with
just
barely
enough
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
alcohol
was
actually
less
forward
than
expected
probably
because
i
am
trying
this
after
a
rochefort
10
maybe
not
the
best
combination
but
i
couldnt
help
it
overall
a
really
nice
beer
which
is
deserving
of
all
the
acclaim
however
as
others
have
said
cost
is
completely
prohibitive
for
me
over
5
bucks
for
a
12
oz
bottle
unfortunately
i
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
very
soon
due
to
the
cost
although
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
is
an
expensive
beer
to
produce
excellent
beer
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
rich
and
complex
enough
to
rival
any
belgian
ale
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
the
beige
head
is
modest
and
too
oily
to
leave
much
for
lace
the
aroma
is
mostly
malts
caramel
and
alcohol
and
is
fairly
faint
very
sweet
earthy
malt
character
acrid
hop
bitterness
with
an
alcoholic
chaser
i
remember
this
being
better
last
time
i
tried
it
but
this
was
a
fairly
fresh
bottle
not
bad
but
certainly
not
worth

for

a
perplexingly
complex
and
superb
beer
well
worth
the
effort
to
find

to

for

i
wouldnt
drink
this
all
the
time

a
nice
change

quite
chewy
in
the
mouth
some
bready

characteristics
just
a
touch
of

would
drink
this
regularly

for
the

im
one

its

not

tobacco
taste
this
is
a
topnotch
scotch
ale
the
stereotypical
touristfriendly
marketing
on
the
label
made
me
feel
a
bit
suspicious
about
this
beer
no
reason
this
is
an
excellent
ale
it
poured
with
a
dark
amber
almost
maroon
color
and
with
a
brownish
head
the
foam
melted
quickly
away
and
settled
as
half
a
fingers
hat
the
smell
was
of
malt
and
caramel
with
some
bitterness
and
smoke
in
the
background
too
much
carbonation
though
it
tasted
pretty
much
as
it
smelled
with
the
hops
kicking
in
in
the
aftertaste
and
not
with
as
much
alcohol
as
expected
traquair
house
ale
is
a
fully
developed
ale
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
this
is
very
drinkable
but
also
very
expensive
drinkability
has
to
take
a
hit
though
its
a
bit
strong
which
isnt
too
bad
but
it
is
also
a
bit
expensive
and
that
puts
it
a
little
more
out
of
reach
the
carbonation
is
mild
like
one
could
expect
and
short
the
bubbles
are
very
small
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
onefinger
white
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
buttery
and
caramelly
the
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malt
withbuttery
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
dry
with
nice
cabonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
relaxing
brew
beer
is
good
happy
scotch
weeheavy
bering
taste
the
malts
are
there
in
your
face
it
has
a
little
smokiness
to
it
and
the
caramel
and
vanilla
really
come
through
in
the
finish
theres
almost
no
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
velvety
really
nice
this
one
poured
a
deep
brown
with
red
highlights
not
really
any
head
to
speak
of
even
in
wellrinsed
glassware
earthy
heavy
malt
aroma
backed
by
peat
toffee
and
a
hint
of
smoke
the
flavour
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
low
herbal
bitterness
toffee
was
more
pronounced
than
caramel
it
finished
quite
malty
yet
not
overly
sweet
very
low
carbonation
a
bit
dead
but
the
full
body
was
velvety
what
a
big
complex
malt
bomb
definitely
an
experience
a
lot
of
flavor
in
here
similar
to
a
dopplebock
but
more
robust
caramelized
and
heavy
aromas
bring
out
a
serious
molassas
sweetness
with
a
very
slight
grainy
bitter
quality
some
dark
fruits
like
plumb
dates
raisons
flavors
are
more
intense
than
the
aroma
throw
in
brown
sugar
caramel
and
above
all
malt
subtleties
of
smoke
chocolate
and
coffee
accentuate
the
flavors
with
a
sypupy
thick
texture
this
beer
falls
short
of
silky
smooth
because
of
the
carbonation
light
grain
texture
and
alcohol
sensation
not
drying
a
bit
cloying
makes
for
slow
sipping
still
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
had
flavor
is
smokey
vanilla
molasses
scotch
whiskey
some
sugar
with
a
healthy
alcoholic
kick
seems
a
bit
higher
than
its
listed
7
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
1
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
tastegood
but
just
seems
disappointing
after
spending
that
kind
of
money
id
take
a
750ml
of
maudite
any
day
over
this
it
is
smooth
malty
a
nice
bit
of
hop
at
the
end
this
would
be
a
great
dinner
beer
wow
now
thats
special
buy
now
d
based
on
the
other
reviews
im
hoping
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
may
try
this
one
again
hoping
that
this
is
the
case
but
if
its
like
this
one
its
just
not
worth
spending
the
money
on
pours
a
soft
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
and
deep
amber
mohagony
color
has
a
deep
malt
character
and
a
beautiful
aroma
the
initial
taste
seems
dry
with
a
slight
alcohol
warming
later
there
is
a
delicious
nutty
biscuit
flavor
that
lingers
nothing
overpowering
but
very
complex
this
beer
has
a
smooth
and
deep
body
but
not
too
thick
the
sweetness
is
perfectly
balanced
by
the
alcohol
hops
and
carbonation
this
is
an
amazing
beer
on
its
own
i
can
only
imagine
pairing
it
with
a
good
meal
here
is
where
the
beer
failed
and
in
my
opinion
made
it
less
than
world
class
the
alcohol
is
almost
imperceptable
until
the
finish
when
it
burns
the
esophagus
it
is
almost
as
if
the
beer
seperated
somehow
i
am
not
knocking
this
beer
because
i
dont
like
strong
beer
i
would
drink
rochefort
10
for
breakfast
if
it
didnt
have
1100
calories
it
is
just
a
strange
and
bad
experience
two
times
for
me
the
taste
was
pretty
good
and
truly
smooth
though
while
most
beers
have
dominate
tastes
that
yell
this
one
is
so
seemless
truly
less
is
more
there
are
no
sharp
corners
to
this
all
the
tastes
experiences
have
rounded
edges
that
flow
seemlessly
it
was
an
eye
opening
to
a
new
type
of
beer
construction

highly
recommend

flavor
is
hoppier

i
thought
too
for
an
english
brew
the
malts
provide
a
nice
sweet

the

provide
a

even
better

been
to
me
the
feel

maybe
a
touch
more

would
help
it
overall
i
really
like
the
brew
the
flavors
are
intense
but
not
offensive
the
alcohol
is
not
present
at
all
in
the

or
the
flavor
very
solid

is
an
excellent
savory

ale
perhaps
best
in

great

love

what

going

this

proof
ive
tried
quite
a
few
beers
aged
in
uncoated

but
traquair
house
ale
has
by
far
the
strongest
oak

which
i
found
unrelenting
by
the
time
the
beer
was
done
amazing
things
going
on
a
juggling
act
of
flavors
but
not
one
ill
be
back
for
any
time
soon
thanks
to
todd
my

i

with

bastard
the
closest
comparison
i
can
come
up

on

with
the
complexity

that
arise
once
it
warms
to
room
temperature
make
this
one
imposing
and
difficult
to
session
scotch
ale
but
jesus
eatin
beans
its
an
amazing
beer
and
the
highest
rating
ive
given
yet

is
long
and
pleasingly
bitter
with

truly
outstanding
and
unique

scotch

and
tasty
brew
overall
impression
great
beer
the
chocolate
i
so
strongly
tasted
really
fits
into
a
great
scottish
ale
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
rated
so
highly
poured
a
rich
brown
with
a
red
tinge
and
a
thick
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
the
aroma
was
of
rich
sweet
malt
with
a
mineral
quality
to
it
the
taste
has
a
very
complex
malt
flavor
that
has
hints
of
smoked
malt
mixed
in
with
sweet
carmelized
grains
and
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
linger
in
the
end
with
the
smoke
the
surprising
effect
of
this
beer
is
to
have
a
sweet
smoky
malt
flavor
which
masks
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
until
the
very
end
of
the
taste
when
the
malt
goes
away
to
leave
only
the
smoke
and
the
hops
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
smooth
carbontion
that
allows
the
flavor
to
be
expressed
very
well
nice
to
have
once
in
awhile
the
high
alcohol
prevents
one
from
having
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
an
excellent
example
of
a
historic
brew
which
has
survived
the
ages
headless
pour
just
a
thin
white
ring
around
the
collar
and
zero
carbonation
still
what
lace
there
is
slides
down
the
glass
lethargically
after
a
thinnish
swirl
beer
is
rosewood
in
color
with
bright
nearly
cherry
red
highlights
first
aromatic
impressions
suggest
cocoa
powder
with
a
dry
mealy
nosefeel
datelike
sweetness
emerges
to
drag
the
nose
into
a
bog
of
malt
licorice
liqueur
whispers
in
the
finish
which
is
clean
and
airy
if
brief
and
boy
does
it
taste
good
flavors
of
spoiled
walnuts
are
balanced
with
the
leafy
bittersweetness
of
sasparilla
these
presently
merge
with
a
forceful
body
of
black
pepper
and
moist
tobacco
the
last
warm
sips
are
quite
whiskyish
as
of
peat
and
smoked
cereal
chaff
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
with
an
uncarbonated
yet
tingly
finish
slightly
astringent
hard
to
stop
sipping
what
with
the
light
body
and
full
flavor
this
might
go
well
with
peanut
brittle
and
cigarillos
but
is
probably
best
as
a
nightcap
very
relaxing
sadly
yet
another
one
my
liquor
board
has
decided
to
stop
carrying
hopefully
it
and
stuff
from
belhaven
will
return
next
fall
a
complex
and
interesting
beer
excellent
excellent
brew
great
just
to
sit
and
sip
wonderful
flavors
and
leaves
you
very
warm
definitely
worth
the
four
and
a
half
bucks
for
the
bottle
from
the
bottle
poured
a
muddy
amber
with
no
head
aroma
like
a
port
wine
malts
caramels
honey
black
licorice
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
some
smoke
flavor
1st
sip
did
nothing
2nd
sip
i
let
it
linger
around
in
the
mouth
for
a
little
while
than
the
flavors
came
out
yum
sweet
chocolate
honey
malts
port
wine
caramel
a
little
bit
of
coffee
drinkability
truly
an
exceptional
scottish
ale
deserving
of
its
accolades
pretty
freakin
drinkable
if
it
werent
for
the
4
price
tag
for
a
single
really
goes
down
smooth
for
a
7
beer
a
sharp
looking
label
thats
for
sure
pours
with
virtually
no
head
save
for
a
little
white
on
the
top
that
quickly
retreats
to
the
rings
of
my
glass
the
brew
itself
is
a
nice
browndeep
copper
color
aroma
is
super
strong
rich
malty
notes
fill
the
room
a
bit
of
chocolate
is
noticable
as
well
the
malt
is
very
rich
in
this
beer
but
it
does
not
dominate
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
adds
a
nice
balance
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
smokiness
present
in
the
finish
very
rich
and
drinkable
would
be
very
nice
after
thanksgiving
dinner
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
this
is
the
classiest
beer
in
this
style
by
far
the
marriage
of
malt
and
hops
with
the
smooth
finish
puts
this
in
that
top
shelf
beer
club
which
lesser
brews
only
aspire
to
belhaven
wee
heavy
is
a
great
beer
but
it
lacks
the
refined
complexity
of
this
beer
it
uses
diplomacy
rather
than
the
club
to
bring
its
point
across
which
is
why
it
is
a
special
beer
to
be
savoured
notes
lighter
bodied
than
i
expected
smoothes
and
mellows
as
it
warms
drinkability
i
could
live
on
a
steady
diet
of
this
exceptional

screams

thats

shelflife
pours
out
a
deep
clear
ruddy
walnut
tone
a
bit
of
beige
foam
on
the
head
that
subsides
quickly
alcohol
immediately
has
a
warming
effect
when
inhaling
the
aroma
rich
malts
brown
sugar
molasses
dried
dates
the
combination
of
the
flavour
and
the
mouthfeel
is
what
makes
this
truly
a
delight
to
drink
alcohol
is
present
immdediately
upon
the
first
sip
as
well
but
has
a
soothing
effect
not
a
bite
rich
caramel
malts
chocolate
carob
nut
some
earthiness
but
all
so
very
smooth
along
with
a
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
this
comes
close
to
what
ambrosia
must
be
like
it
takes
a
while
for
the
hops
to
make
themself
apparent
lightly
herbal
a
bit
grassy
more
spicy
carob
on
the
aftertaste
incredibly
smooth
for
the
alcohol
content
a
masterful
execution
of
the
brewing
arts
i
would
love
to
experience
what
this
would
be
like
after
its
been
aged
a
good
5
years
or
so
humble
gratitude
is
extended
to
stephenlouis
for
sending
out
a
bottle
of
this
for
me
to
try
you
have
excellent
taste

a
nearly
opaque
dark
brown

thin
fine
head
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
strongly
peatish
in
fact
it
smells
like
a
shot
of
tequila
very
interesting
oh
the
flavour
of
this
beer
woody
smoky
burnt
caramel
and
bittersweet
chocolate
delicious
in
my
haste
to
sample
a
few
brews
before
my
housemoving
i
wish
i
would
have
saved
this
for
a
cool
october
afternoon
in
the
country
this
is
a
very
earthy
malty
and
bittersweet
ale
that
is
bitter
in
the
finish
and
longingly
dry
and
smoky
on
the
tongue
a
taste
treat
would
be
great
with
some
roasted
nuts
and
pumpkin
seeds
in
the
fall
a
brew
i
will
revisit
red
clear

with
a
three
finger
offwhite
head
is
quite
attractive
in
my
goblet
despite
having
pre
wetted
the
glassware
there
was
excellent
head
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
sweetly
fruity
and
a
bit
oxidized
the
taste
was
vinous
and
peppery
with
definitely
warming
liquor
like
alcohol
sensation
the
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
rich
but
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
the
hops
were
surprisingly
strong
for
a
scotch
ale
and
dried
the
palette
nicely
a
good
hearty
offering
from
across
the
atlantic
a
clean
a
clear
reddish
amber
when

head
settles
nicelyit
could
be
a
bit
thicker
nice
aroma
a
little
milder
than
expected
probably
because
i
tried
the
jacobite
ale
first
its
an
excellent
scottish
ale
and
perfect
as
a
meal
accompaniment
the
flavour
is
strong
but
does
not
become
overwhelming
by
the
end
of
the
bottle

dark

with

that
settled

the

the
small

could
easily

no

appeared
as
i
poured
it
slowly
into
a
10

just
a
few

no

aroma
is
all
malts
loads
of
caramel
sweet
dark
with
a
earthy
undertone
of
tobacco
and
wet
wood
taste
is
super
mellow
of
caramel
dark
toffee
some
dark
fruit
notes
of
plum
and
banana
the
malts
are
provided
all
over
the
place
but
not
thick
more
so
of
a
very
clean
and
softly
calming
chewyness
thinnish
to
the
point
of
becoming
nonexistent
really
not
very
flavorful
some
notes
of
hazelnut
and
molasses
poke
through
as
it
warms
but
nothing
sticks
out
really
kinda
boring
and
plain
feel
is
a
bit
thin
the
front
of
this
is
like
water
nothing
there
but
luckily
it
picks
up
some
and
renders
some
light
heft
over
the
middle
and
has
a
smooth
lightly
sticky
calm
malty
sweet
finish
that
doesnt
last
all
that
long
not
something
id
buy
again
nearly
forgetable
drinkability
agree
with
other
reviewers
make
sure
the
chill
is
off
before
this
is
served
slightly
cold
its
thin
and
blah
let
it
warm
and
the
character
explodes
pricey
but
a
great
way
to
treat
yourself
best
example
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
perfect
chestnut
brown
coloralmost
murky
to
the
eye
with
a
very
minimal
but
fine
veil
of
foam
that
lingers
throughout
and
puffs
up
quickly
with
added
swirling
wonderful
warm
almost
spirit
like
in
the
nose
with
cinnamon
raisin
and
vanilllasome

and
memorable
a
very
decent
drink
sat
very
dark
in
the
glass
with
little
visible
activity
wonderful
champagne
like
aromalots
of
nice
flavors
happening
especially
molasses
and
currant
because
of
its
low
carbonation
it
had
the
smoothest
of
all
possible
textures
loses
a
little
bit
of
its
sweetness
as
it
goes
along
lots
of
setiment
on
bottom
of
glass
wonderful
stuff
a
little
pricey
and
the
next
morning
i
had
some
intestinal
problems
that
i
couldnt
blame
on
anything
but
the
beer
dark
burgundy
color
medium

is
malty
and
peaty
a
medium
bodied
scottish

malts
are
chocolate
plums

dominate
the
flavors
there
is
also
a

quite
a

once
you
have

a

beer
to

this
is
a

ale
it
is
apples

but
traquair
jacobite
is
a
great
deal
better
so
if
there
is
a
choice
between
the
two
beers
i
am
taking
jacobite
this
one
is
still
recommended
pours
a
very
nice
brown
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
with
a
light
headaroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
oaky
aromas

and
malty
with

notes
some
dried
fruit
flavors
linger
with
some
definent
oak
hints
as
well
incredibly
well
made
a
nice
beer
to
savor
before
bed
i
opened
this
one
after
opening
a
july
1
1996
kulmbacher
reichelbrau
eisbock
my
friend
commented
that
that
reminded
him
of
traquair
house
ale
which
i
just
happened
to
have
in
my
fridge
as
well
we
opened
this
to
compare
i
must
note
the
bottle
is
from
a
case
purchased
of
untold
age
as
the
label
green
writing
on
cream
color
label
as
we
were
told
has
not
been
been
around
since
the
early
90s
it
poured
a
nice
chestnut
brown
color
with
the
certainty
of
a
fig
aroma
there
was
not
really
a
head
to
be
seen
this
is
certainly
a
special
beer
for
it
to
hold
up
so
well
over
time
the
taste
was
a
rather
sweet
and
currentlike
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
and
full
i
must
say
the
reichelbrau
was
a
tad
richer
tasting
but
that
may
be
because
this
was
old
and
possibly
not
kept
in
ideal
conditions
update
i
sampled
this
again
in
2004
it
was
as
complex
as
i
remember
it
before
i
picked
up
a
lot
more
chocolate
and
coffee
im
not
changing
any
of
the
ratings
but
once
again
highly
recommend
this
offering
from
traquair
house
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
much
like
some
of
the
belgian
abbey
ales
it
had
a
small
and
quickly
dissipating
head
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
again
like
some
of
the
better
belgian
abbey
ales
the
aroma
of
malt
is
also
present
the
flavor
is
very
full
and
has
lots
of
character
the
flavor
of
some
sweet
fruit
maybe
grapes
is
very
apparent
my
only
gripe
is
that
it
tastes
very
tart
after
the
head
died
down
there
was
no
carbonation
left
in
the
drink
which
made
it
pretty
smooth
pretty
decent
beer
a
little
tart
but
good
nonetheless
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
one
finger
of
light
caramel
foam
that
fades
away
to
a
small
collar
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
rich
nutty
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
and
toffee
the
smell
really
pumped
me
up
for
the
taste
the
taste
is
a
smooth
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
mix
not
too
much
hops
present
but
who
needs
it
with
this
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
nutty
flavor
the
body
is
heavy
yet
smooth
the
drinkability
is
also
pretty
nice
for

a
big
thanks
to
brewdlyhooked13
for
this
fine
ale
this
house
ale
is
a
beautiful
rich
ruby
brown
with
a
very
pale
thin
head
it
smells
somewhat
buttery
with
a
hint
of
fruit
maybe
grapes
the
taste
is
something
between
a
tangy
chocolate
and
toffee
something
a
little
walnutty
there
too
and
again
like
the
smell
something
reminiscent
of
fruit
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
really
really
nice
though
good
thick
mouthfeel
with
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
overall
a
real
treat
that
ill
definitely
be
trying
again
so
expensive
though
pours
out
a
medium
brown
with
a
small
head
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
wellrounded
with
a
nuttiness
thats
quite
intriguing
with
a
little
hop
tinge
in
the
back
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
warm
my
taste
buds
really
liked
this
one
bh
pours
a
gorgeous
rich
impenetrable
cordovan
with
ruby
hues
the
fading
beigetan
head
with
varying
sized
bubbles
leaves
a
sliding
lace
citrusy
hop
sweet
malt
and
toffee
aromas
last
awhile
an
alcohol
fume
fades
after
a
couple
of
whiffs
the
full
malty
body
provides
a
complex
array
of
flavors
of
plums
butterscotch
coffee
and
blended
scotch
citrus
hops
a
trace
of
mint
candy
sweetness
and
a
slightly
resinous
camphor
taste
contribute
to
an
ale
just
bursting
with
multidirectional
flavors
this
is
a
wonderful
ale
what
took
me
so
long
to
try
it
all
in
all
a
wonderful
beer
and
the
true
exemplar
of
the
wee
heavy
style
drinkability
a
great
savoring
beer
should
almost
be
enjoyed
out
of
a
snifter
or
wine
glass
wherever
this
is
the
house
ale
im
coming
over
more
often
big
thanks
to
johnnyduvel
for
the
trade
while
it
seems
a
bit
pricey
at
almost
5
for
a
small
bottle
its
well
worth
it
only
modesty
prevents
me
giving
this
beer
the
5
5s
yes
it
would
get
excellent
drinkablity
but
who
could
afford
to
drink
many
medium
to
full
bodied
good
going
down
i
would
list
it
more
toward
the
dark
strong
ale
end
of
this
category
after
i
finished
this
one
i
wanted
more
the
color
is
wonderful
dark
amber
shade
with
a
nose
that
to
me
has
an
almost
gingerbread
smell
but
that
is
just
me
the
only
compliant
that
i
can
find
with
traquair
is
that
the
bottle
is
to
small
i
would
love
to
find
it
in
750
ml
bottles
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brownish
red
color
with
a
thick
clingy
tan
head
and
a
firm
mouthfee
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
grassiness
the
taste
is
clean
nutty
malt
with
a
slight
herbal
quality
and
pleasant
warming
alcohol
overall
a
rich
malty
ale
with
a
clean
rather
dry
finish
indian
browndark
amber
in
color
a
small
but
thick
offwhite
head
forms
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
but
no
lacing
down
the
glass
raisins
and
dark
fruits
as
well
as
some
alcohol
are
in
the
strong
aroma
its
a
smooth
mediumbodied
brew
with
low
carbonation
the
aroma
translates
to
the
flavors
very
amazing
with
just
the
right
balance
and
touch
of
alcohol
its
definitely
a
sipper
as
it
warms
prepare
for
a
little
more
alcohol
character
and
a
pleasant
toasty
touch
as
well
as
more
pronounced
raisindark
fruit
flavors
unfortunately
this
was
my
second
beer
at
the
sitting
the
first
was
westy
12
im
going
to
have
to
come
back
to
this
one
a
beer
brewed
in
a
castle
a
nice
start
is
the
pour
a
deep
dark
brown
beer
with
a
perfect
1
inch
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
standout
a
very
complex
mixture
of
ripe
fruittobacco
with
a
hint
of
smokechocolatemolassesvanillabrown
sugar
and
various
spices
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
not
as
complex
tasting
as
the
aroma
it
starts
malt
sweet
with
a
little
orange
peel
with
a
nice
dry
hop
bitterness
and
smoke
in
the
finish
the
finish
is
drier
and
shorter
than
i
remember
from
past
bottles
this
one
may
be
a
bit
oxidized
ill
have
to
try
another
one
to
see
boo
hoo
me
a
very
nice
scottish
strong
ale
and
another
bottle
may
give
it
a
better
score
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
but
was
somewhat
dissapointed
little
to
no
head
and
a
hazy
cherry
in
appearance
aromas
were
mostly
that
of
sweet
fruit
very
caramelly
in
flavor
with
some
good
fruitiness
as
well
but
overall
everything
just
seemed
to
blur
together
alcohol
was
evident
but
not
over
the
top
still
had
to
drink
pretty
slowly
little
to
no
head
atop
this
dark
chesnutcopper
brew
it
was
consumed
a
little
below
room
temp
and
a
distinct
mix
of
piney
earth
and
alcohol
aromas
was
present
tasted
of
dry
earth
and
alcoholic
carmelish
flavors
malt
sweetness
just
the
tiniest
bit
bitter
at
the
end
wellbalanced
nothing
that
stands
out
in
my
mind
as
one
of
the
greats
but
its
certainly

still

rjt
o
easy

considering
the

of

it

the

and
the
preciseness
is
due
to
the
brewery
including
it
on

thanks
the
nose
had
an
earthy
sweetness
sort
of
medicinal
like
geritol
or
along
those
lines
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
taste
was
quite
vegetal
mostly
earthy
and
not
at
all
pleasant
the
bjcp
app
tells
me
that
this
is
allowable
due
to
the
use
of
peaty
malt
but
i
was
not
digging
it
we
used
to
be
admonished
not
to
review
based
on
style
due
to
brewers
interpretations
but
if
i
rated
this
just
on
its
merits
it
would
do
very
poorly
by
taking
style
into
account
it
at
least
gets
a
fighting
chance
finish
was
semisweet
but
that
vegetal
taste
was
going
to
linger
with
me
for
a
while
ugh
o
good
beer
not
up
there
with
some
of
the
other
scotch
styles
ive
had
but
good
nonetheless
o
not
like
old
chub
which
is
my
fav
so
far
in
this
style
but
fair
fine
by
itself
or
with
some
haggis
or
turnips
medium
body
firm
feel
and
a
maltforward
flavor
not
as
rich
as
some
scotch
ales
but
still
a
fair
amount
of
toasty
goodness
some
bread
and
biscuit
notes
up
front
are
quickly
accented
by
raisins
toffee
and
then
by
just
enough
of
a
hop
kiss
to
provide
some
spice
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
and
foodfriendly
beer
o
its
important
to
note
that
there
are
very
few
scotch
ales
ive
met
and
liked
that
being
said
this
one
isnt
bad
imo
since
its
drinkable
and
unoffensive
but
i
would
be
reaching
for
something
else
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
i
got
this
for
free
and
have
nothing
else
to
drink
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
wee
heavy
to
me
at
all
too
roasty
chocolately
and
not
enough
malt
complexity
to
be
to
style
for
the
wee
heavy
they
have
a
great
base
going
here
just
need
to
add
some
more
unfermentables
and
build
more
caramelbody
imo
of
course
theres
a
higher
than
moderate
carbonation
but
its
not
abrasive
i
just
think
it
should
have
more
thickness
as
a
weeheavy
i
picked
this
up
at
a
gas
station
for
4
bucks
so
im
still
content
definitely
not
a
bold
beer
by
any
measure
but
probably
a
good
beer
for
anyone
starting
out
with
the
genre
or
with
micro
brews
in
general
a
decent
wee
heavy
definitely
earthy
and
peaty
main
complaint
is
that
i
just
want
more
flavors
more
varietydepthcomplexity
out
of
it
d
well
done
the
balance
is
excellent
and
the
beer
hides
its
strength
quite
well
overall
this
beer
is
very
attractive
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
very
flavorful
the
abv
is
well
hidden
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
for
this
style
its
simple
but
that
almost
makes
this
one
better
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
great
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
i
guess
its
above
average
m
a
resounding
malty
body
wellcarbonated
with
just
a
bit
of
hoppiness
to
balance
the
nose
is
a
winner
followed
by
the
finish
of
a
warmer
glass
o
meh
it
would
be
a
pretty
simple
but
tasty
scotch
ale
that
would
probably
garner
a
4
but
the
carbonation
is
way
too
high
bringing
this
one
down
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
dark
clear
caramel
brown
color
there
was
just
a
wisp
of
an
off
white
head
on
it
nice
big
malty
nose
to
it
mainly
toffee
toasted
malts
and
caramel
just
a
hint
of
some
earthy
hops
medium
bodied
toasted
toffee
malt
taste
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
coming
through
nice
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
and
good
drinkability
its
worth
cehcking
out
i
like
this
weeheavyer
scotch
ale
perhaps
not
quite
in
the
top
tier
of
the
style
but
the
chocolate
gives
it
a
nice
twist
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
as
expected
the
aroma
is
full
of
malt
with
heavy
amounts
of
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
some
peat
malt
notes
a
hint
of
smoke
and
some
light
amounts
of
dark
fruit
the
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
good
scotch
ale
worthy
a
try
would
drink
it
again
overall
nice
and
tasty
my
first
french
broad
should
be
weeer
heavy
at
first
i
get
a
mild
bitterness
then
the
sweetness
sets
in
smooth
feeling
the
caramel
and
corn
syrup
really
take
the
forefront
here
toffee
comes
in
later
o
just
a
spoton
medium
sized
scotch
ale
imo
i
enjoyed
my
4
dollar
bomber
just
as
much
and
im
kicking
myself
for
not
getting
more
to
bring
home
i
love
the
subtlety
and
restraint
shown
with
this
beer
a
little
dissapointed
the
taste
that
comes
through
is
good
but
there
was
not
much
of
it
this
was
too
weak
and
thin
brown
with
a
huge
tan
colored
head
a
great
amount
of
lace
was
left
down
the
glass
and
the
settling
of
the
beer
was
a
fantastic
site
grat
pour
looked
perfect
smell
was
sweet
right
away
lots
of
sugar
and
caramel
smells
hints
of
grains
and
breads
and
even
a
light
hop
presence
rounded
this
put
nicely
the
taste
followed
right
away
but
was
alot
more
hoppy
then
i
had
envisioned
lots
of
caramel
and
sugar
flavors
overall
this
is
ok
at
best
i
think
this
bottle
may
have
been
well
past
its
prime
o
this
would
have
been
great
when
i
was
in
college
30
years
ago
but
it
is
rather
ordinary
by
todays
standards
with
all
the
great
brews
available
i
have
no
plans
for
a
repeat
purchase
rating
confirmed
with
22oz
bottle
in
may
2012
o
i
think
this
brew
would
fare
better
as
an
american
porter
but
it
is
still
too
simple
to
make
any
headway
there
simply
isnt
any
depth
that
said
as
simple
as
it
is
it
is
tasty
and
at
4
a
bomber
i
really
cant
be
too
disappointed
overall
meh
this
beer
isnt
terrible
but
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
o
if
i
was
given
this
beer
blindly
and
asked
what
style
it
was
by
ba
listed
styles
itd
take
at
very
least
double
digits
to
guess
wee
heavy
it
tastes
like
an
average
stout
it
just
isnt
what
it
claims
to
be
and
isnt
very
good
otherwise
and
i
judged
it
accordingly
overall
i
could
drink
this
beer
with
no
qualms
maybe
as
a
porter
rather
than
a
scotch
ale
but
its
not
much
to
write
home
about
french
broad
brewing
co
has
better
offerings
o
overall
very
impressed
with
this
beer
a
bit
on
the
brown
ale
side
of
the
spectrum
but
delicious
to
enjoy
i
normally
find
wee
heavy
beers
to
be
rather
lackluster
but
this
one
gets
the
job
done
4
25
for
22
oz
cant
beat
it
very
drinkable
while
delivering
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
overall
a
decent
flavored
wee
heavy
that
is
easy
to
quaff
o
nothing
terrible
but
nothing
awesome
either
i
enjoy
this
style
so
i
guess
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
for
a
wee
heavy
this
is
on
the
light
side
very
easy
drinking
quite
sessionable
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
french
broad
products
this
was
poured
from
a
22
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
moderate
brown
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
with
decent
lacing
smells
of
toffee
and
malt
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
malt
spike
notes
of
toffee
andpr
caramel
with
a
sweet
hop
character
the
slightly
elevated
abv
is
well
hidden
and
makes
me
happy
finish
is
clean
just
a
nice
well
rounded
scotch
ale
overall
meh
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
there
are
definitely
better
offerings
of
the
style
glad
to
say
i
got
to
try
it
though
as
ive
never
had
anything
from
this
brewery
unfortunately
i
likely
wont
be
as
excited
to
see
anything
from
them
in
the
future
based
upon
this
one
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
considering
its
strength
well
my
second
experience
with
french
broad
brewing
co
wasnt
anywhere
close
to
the
first
wee
heavyer
pales
in
comparison
to
rye
hopper
this
one
needs
work
the
biggest
problems
are
the
weak
nose
and
the
weird
acidic
flavor
remedy
those
two
things
and
this
one
might
be
headed
in
the
right
direction
id
take
a
pass
on
this
one
for
the
moment
nonetheless
thanks
for
the
opportunity
dan
warmth
finds
this
beer
gelling
better
offering
more
depth
of
flavor
seems
more
like
a
scottish
ale
than
a
wee
heavy
to
me
pretty
decent
overall
d
in
all
i
cant
bash
this
beer
but
i
cant
praise
it
nicely
drinkable
id
like
to
have
another
d
there
is
nothing
extreme
about
this
beer
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
d
i
like
it
it
does
not
jump
out
with
anything
overwhelming
and
is
lacking
in
some
complexities
but
in
this
case
that
is
what
makes
it
so
good
and
drinkable
it
defintely
stands
out
and
is
unique
without
being
extreme
in
any
direction
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
a
solid
drinkable
but
not
overly
inspired
beer
pours
a
fairly
dark
brown
color
off
white
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
with
caramel
brown
sugar
and
some
dark
fruits
trace
amounts
of
the
latter
the
taste
is
mostly
just
some
bready
caramelized
malt
feel
is
pretty
good
slightly
heavy
with
good
carbonation
good
drinkability
and
a
nice
winter
brew
22oz
bomber
courtesy
of
bucketboy
served
in
a
standard
pint
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
a
semihazy
clarity
and
a
loose
quarter
inch
offwhite
head
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
skim
and
a
band
only
two
random
strands
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
earthypeaty
malt
and
a
slightly
vinous
quality
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
buttery
character
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lively
almost
prickly
carbonation
the
overall
consistency
is
also
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
a
decent
wee
heavy
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
is
decent
drinking
pretty
well
for
9
abv
but
leaves
a
slight
sticky
taste
and
lingering
wild
yeast
funk
and
light
metallic
flavor
however
the
light
manageable
sweet
taste
to
start
and
dry
finish
adds
a
nice
touch
d
i
do
not
like
this
beer
at
all
and
i
will
not
finish
or
buy
it
again
the
flavor
completely
threw
me
for
a
loop
there
is
only
a
hint
of
the
expected
caramel
flavor
and
plenty
of
sour
flavor
not
quite
puckering
but
definitely
along
the
lines
of
many
sour
belgian
beers
ive
tried
in
the
past
nothing
at
all
like
a
wee
heavy
and
honestly
almost
undrinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
also
off
its
too
thin
for
a
big
scottish
beer
i
think
ill
be
able
to
finish
this
glass
but
there
is
no
way
im
pouring
another
hopefully
this
is
just
a
bad
batch
and
all
will
be
well
when
i
try
this
again
in
a
few
months
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
i
could
have
had
again
though
it
was
superior
on
tap
now
things
go
down
hill
the
brew
defiantly
had
a
sour
smell
to
it
as
well
as
a
taste
it
did
come
of
as
a
sour
brune
to
me
so
i
will
say
it
was
drinkable
but
not
as
a
wee
heavy
i
will
revisit
this
one
if
fortune
allows
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
there
is
something
in
the
aroma
that
really
turns
me
off
on
this
one
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
dont
do
much
to
save
it
glad
it
was
only
a
bomber
and
i
didnt
get
stuck
with
a
6pack
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
especially
if
there
was
nothing
better
available
d
easy
to
drink
had
no
problem
finishing
my
single
glass
overall
a
good
if
boring
example
of
a
scotch
ale
d
both
french
broad
beers
were
diacetylladen
and
characterless
otherwise
i
would
try
them
again
but
will
probably
wait
until
i
can
get
to
their
pub
to
sample
again
fairly
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
smoked
peat
as
well
some
nice
fruity
hints
as
well
medium
bodied
and
well
carbinated
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
although
it
seems
just
a
little
small
for
the
style
i
would
love
to
see
it
be
just
a
little
bolder
but
all
in
all
it
is
very
tasty
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
it
doesnt
go
above
and
beyond
but
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
or
have
with
a
meal
d
a
decent
beer
but
i
feel
that
im
partial
to
wee
heavies
so
for
the
style
its
only
ok
not
one
to
sit
and
ponder
its
complexities
but
still
better
than
bud
dgood
but
overall
a
bit
dull
and
lackluster
a
nonoffensive
and
interesting
brew
that
is
the
type
good
for
introducing
noncraft
drinkers
into
the
fold
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
tan
head
smells
roasty
stout
like
tastes
similar
i
dont
really
get
the
caramel
burntsweetness
that
i
find
in
these
beers
typically
its
more
of
a
big
brown
ale
or
a
stout
or
something
similar
the
alcohol
is
hidden
completely
though
dangerously
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
i
like
it
but
i
dunno
if
it
has
all
i
want
in
a
scotch
ale
drinkability
is
not
bad
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
the
style
and
would
be
sessionable
as
i
said
before
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
like
but
still
a
pretty
good
brew
id
say
its
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
brownish
color
very
nice
carbonation
huge

with
some

the
taste
is
sweet

with
some
nice

notes
dark

slight
spice
and
some

medium

drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
but
reminds
me
more
of
a
bsda
overall
an
enjoyable
maltdriven
scotch
ale
that
i
would
drink
again
not
sure
what
the
deal
is
with
this
one
rather
than
a
smooth
malt
bomb
this
one
is
a
tart
and
fizzy
brown
ale
d
well
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
does
suprise
dont
know
if
that
is
good
or
bad
the
flavors
look
feel
and
smells
all
have
suprises
that
kinda
toss
you
a
curve
this
does
taste
more
like
a
german
style
than
a
scotch
ale
has
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
if
you
ask
me
that
carbonation
level
is
just
way
too
high
and
needs
to
be
tamed
with
all
that
said
it
went
down
easy
and
was
refreshing
i
give
it
that
what
a
strange
experience
best
pairing
yet
ben
jerrys
chocolate
fudge
ice
cream
with
a
butterfinger
bar
crumbled
over
top
yowza
drain
pour
i
know
these
guys
make
good
beer
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
poured
a
leather
couch
brown
that
had
some
visibility
and
a
twofinger
white
head
that
died
quickly
aroma
is
a
mix
of
mild
malts
both
sweet
and
roasted
with
very
little
hops
not
a
nosecatching
aroma
but
it
did
attract
me
for
a
heavy
ale
this
is
rather
a
light
beer
mediumbodied
at
best
it
passes
smoothly
slightly
creamy
as
the
malts
are
rather
subdued
for
a
little
sweet
and
chewiness
caramel
hints
of
cocoa
and
some
toffee
along
with
roasted
are
in
there
but
nothing
that
is
really
outstanding
a
dab
of
fruit
flavoringsdryness
from
the
hops
which
provide
a
minor
sour
fruit
and
bitter
taste
for
balance
in
the
backend
but
are
overpowered
to
be
honest
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
im
looking
forward
to
with
a
heavy
scotch
ale
weeheavyer
scotch
ale
might
be
french
broads
biggest
seller
but
it
isnt
their
best
beer
of
those
that
ive
had
rye
hopper
is
clearly
numero
uno
maybe
weeheavyest
will
deliver
what
my
big
beer
lovers
palate
craves
drinks
pretty
easy
this
had
a
lot
of
nice
attributes
but
didnt
quite
pull
together
nice
to
have
this
brewerys
products
available
in
atlanta
these
days
this
one
was
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
pours
almost
black
with
a
faint
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
smells
malty
even
a
bit
treacly
as
well
as
quite
yeasty
the
aromas
are
on
the
lighter
side
though
tastes
pretty
satisfying
malty
but
fairly
dry
for
the
style
with
some
citrusy
bitterness
as
well
and
a
dash
of
anise
or
fennel
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
on
the
crisp
rather
than
the
rich
side
of
the
style
pleasant
and
easydrinking
on
tap
at
the
brewery
pours
a
clear
dark
ruddy
brown
with
a
tall
offwhite
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
smells
of
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
and
toffee
absolutely
no
smoke
or
peat
as
others
have
claimed
not
a
bad
thing
as
this
isnt
really
a
traditional
element
of
a
scotch
ale
tastes
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
littleno
hop
flavor
a
bit
of
honey
at
the
finish
nice
full
body
a
scotch
ale
true
to
its
origins
well
done
drinkability
is
good
will
be
buying
this
one
again
im
fairly
unimpressed
with
this
one
there
just
isnt
enough
flavor
or
body
to
make
this
much
more
than
average
if
that
about
what
i
expected
not
great
but
not
bad
at
all
theres
peat
in
there
too
i
didnt
pick
up
on
it
myself
but
i
read
some
other
reviews
and
tasted
again
and
its
in
there
still
looking
for
a
great
nc
scotch
ale
d
drinks
more
like
a
session
beer
than
a
weeheavier
but
i
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
kind
of
ruined
this
for
me
way
too
carbonated
and
pretty
thin
for
the
style
aside
from
the
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
i
feel
bloated
after
only
10oz
or
so
pours
out
a
nice
clear
brown
color
with
a
big
fluffy
yellowoffwhite
head
the
head
kind
of
fades
back
and
stays
around
leaving
minimal
lacing
looks
about
average
the
smell
is
very
nice
upfront
without
a
question
is
the
smell
of
scotch
i
wonder
if
this
ever
touched
wood
or
scotch
for
that
matter
there
are
lots
of
caramelized
sugars
and
a
bit
of
smoky
roasted
smells
a
bit
of
esters
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
very
nice
too
i
expected
booziness
after
the
smell
but
there
isnt
any
the
smell
has
a
great
smoky
flavor
but
it
isnt
to
the
beef
jerkey
level
theres
an
odd
roastedness
and
its
a
little
less
sweet
than
i
wouldve
expected
though
theres
plenty
in
this
it
finishes
a
little
dry
with
the
smokiness
coming
back
in
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
depth
but
im
fascinated
by
whats
here
definitely
could
be
improved
upon
with
a
bit
more
chewiness
and
roasted
flavors
not
smoked
malts
maybe
junt
a
hint
more
sweetness
or
some
hops
to
cut
through
the
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
though
theres
enough
body
to
satisfy
and
nothing
really
offputting
unless
you
dont
like
smoke
with
good
carbonation
levels
it
finishes
nice
and
clean
and
is
easy
to
drink
since
the
alcohol
isnt
apparent
and
the
beer
isnt
too
intense
i
think
im
a
bit
of
a
fan
and
would
recommend
it
at
least
once
the
scotch
smell
is
really
whats
so
fascinating
taste
is
toasted
barley
spices
and
slight
caramel
with
little
head
drinks
easy
for
a
heavy
beer
this
is
the
first
thing
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
and
its
not
good
overwhelmingly
oxidized
to
the
point
of
being
undrinkable
this
one
poured
all
head
and
i
really
mean
all
head
settled
into
a
deeper
amber
color
aromas
of
earthiness
wood
roasted
and
toasted
caramel
and
some
chocolate
tastes
of
caramel
roasty
lighter
earhy
and
chocolate
the
body
is
light
to
medium
since
it
is
not
sticky
the
mouth
feel
is
prickly
from
spice
and
carbonation

i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
but
given
some
of
the
great
beers
available
in

good
is
probably
about
square
on
not
bad

i
got

very
little
head
forms
on
this
beer
its
very
dark
brown
and
has
less
smoky
nose
then
i
thought
it
would
have
it
has
almost
a
soury
malt
nose
virtually
no
hops
on
the
taste
but
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
slightly
more
smokey
malt
taste
very
little
after
taste
theres
a
small
bit
of
tartness
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
my
favorite
scotch
ales
very
easy
drinking
for
the
considerable
abv
as
well
d
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
french
broad
while
its
not
my
favorite
scotch
ale
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
an
unfocused
scotch
ale
with
very
little
to
recommend
it
id
heard
good
things
about
french
broad
and
since
theyre
somewhat
local
id
pick
their
stuff
up
again
in
hopes
that
they
usually
do
better
jurys
out
this
tawny
brew
had
a
bit
of
haze
and
reddish
highlights
it
poured
with
a
fluffy
two
finger
cap
that
settled
extremely
slowly
with
just
a
few
clumps
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
malty
grain
aroma
a
little
bready
and
yeasty
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
little
sharpness
from
the
carbonation
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
flavour
in
the
finish
other
than
that
the
flavour
was
mostly
malt
as
in
the
nose
with
a
clean
yeast
profile
perhaps
a
bit
of
butterscotch
the
carbonation
was
sort
of
coarse
and
definitely
too
high
creating
a
texture
that
was
pretty
far
from
smooth
body
was
on
the
lighter
side
mild
dryness
too
which
i
wasnt
expecting
for
the
style
not
bad
but
fixing
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
would
go
a
long
way
for
this
beer
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
spectacular
about
it
carbonation
is
just
right
and
its
medium
bodied
the
flavor
hits
the
spot
with
a
peppery
bitter
chocolate
note
that
transitions
to
a
bit
of
musky
earth
and
tannin
mouthfeel
is
even
better
with
a
spritzy
yet
smooth
medium
body
and
a
lingering
finish
of
peaty
scotch
and
powdered
chocolate
a
slight
chalkiness
is
all
that
keeps
the
mouthfeel
from
a
5
0
in
my
book
overall
weeheavyer
is
a
tasty
scotch
ale
that
reps
the
style
well
and
will
likely
be
purchased
again
poured
a

hue
with
a
smallish
14
inch

aroma
was
malty
with
a
very
slight
whiff
of
hops
taste
was
malty
as
well
along
with
some
peaty
and
smoky
flavors
to
complement
the
malt
body
was
quite
light
for
the
style
and
thus
made
it
very
drinkable
and
quaffable
alcohol
was
not
at
all
evident
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
a
liitle
bit
too
tame
for
my
liking
md
mouthfeel
is
a
little
off
carbonation
is
little
too
much
for
me
though
it
tended
to
ease
up
after
a
while
and
at
times
i
get
a
bit
of
chalky
feeling
drinkability
is
decent
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
a
standout
for
the
style
d
fairly
complex
scotch
ale
that
is
a
pleasure

sip

the
beer
sports
a
thin
lasting
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
caramel
malts
not
much
else
there
but
still
fragrant
the
taste
is
also
a
nice
showcase
of
caramel
malts
as
expected
for
the
style
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
low
carbonation
and
well
hidden
alcohol
as
a
hophead
ill
admit
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
scotch
ale
but
this
is
one
that
certainly
does
not
disappoint
smooth
and
sweet
plenty
drinkable
beautiful

fairly

and

being
so

tap
room
in
durham
nc
i
enjoyed
this
dark
brown
ale
which
presented
a
fair
tan
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
pleasant
brown
sugar
and
molasses
the
flavor
jumped
out
as
a
malty
charcoal
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
it
was
a
little
bit
thin
for
this
style
i
thought
but
it
makes
for
an
easier
drinking
brew
i
certainly
expected
this
to
be
heavier
and
stronger
but
it
was
pleasant
and
ultimately
likeable
enough
to
want
to
drink
it
again
definitely
worth
a
try
once
you
understand
that
this
will
not
be
too
beefy
despite
the
impressions
from
the
name
loving
this
beer
it
offers
the
slimmest
of
earth
intangibles
without
going
overboard
its
an
american
ale
at
heart
but
it
certainly
has
garnered
inspirations
from
the
peatheavy
scottish
whiskeys
silly
scots
they
get
so
drunk
that
they
find
a
benefit
in
burnt
dirt
flavor
was
heavy
in
cinders
and
sulphuralmost
so
much
that
it
was
biting
and
bitter
and
i
liked
that
flavor
the
earths
were
not
so
much
erathy
and
peaty
i
associate
with
the
style
but
very
smokey
medium
body
and
filling
however
i
can
see
the
smokey
bitters
being
too
much
after
a
few
pints
tte
is
well
balanced
with
a
woody
smoky
subtext
to
the
malt
and
backing
hops
mouthfeel
is
measured
but
plenty
thick
and
savory
like
fine
gravy
not
an
earthshattering
wee
heavy
and
not
as
coarse
or
flavorful
as
most
scottish
versions
ive
tried
but
still
a
nice
effort

it
is
a

in

around

has
now
become
one
of

tried
and

anyway
enjoyed
this
wee
heavy
very
much
nice

character
dark
mahogony
and
very
easy
to
finish
need
to
try
an
entire
pint
next
time
especially
with
my
new
glass
a
beer
you
can
find
at
alot
of
restaurants
and
bars
around

a
deep
burgundy
with
nice
light
brown
colored

roasted

with
some
french
roast
coffee
and
brown
sugarto
be
expected
malt
driven
brown
sugar
and
dark
roast

flavors
finish
with
just
a
touch
dry
earthiness
a
decent
wee
heavy
to
be
had
here
not
earth
shattering
but
its
always
good
to
find
a
good
scottish
ale
out
there
this
beer
poured
with
little
head
a
nice
deep
brown
it
was
almost
black
but
not
quite
it
had
a
sweet
malty
smell
the
taste
was
very
smooth
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
there
was
no
harshness
at
all
i
could
drink
these
again
bought
a
growler
at
the
brewery
yesterday
there
was
some
yeast
sediment
in
the
growler
no
harm
though
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
wee
heavyest
when
it
is
released
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
all
but
i
was
kind
of
expecting
it
to
be
better
i
imagine
thats
more
my
problem
than
the
beers
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
but
despite
the
overall
heavy
nature
of
the
beer
manages
to
have
a
semicrisp
finish
which
allows
you
to
keep
drinking
overall
a
tad
on
the
sweet
and
heavy
side
but
without
doubt
one
of
the
best
ales
i
have
ever
tasted
reminiscent
of
a
rochefort
one

a
truly
enjoyable

this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
my
speed
not
enjoying
this
due
to
the
forward
character
of
the
alcohol
especially
as
it
warms
couldnt
finish
this
one
to
me
the
feel
again
is
a
minor
issue
in
this
beer
the
flavor
is
better
overall
which
helps
make
up
for
the
lack
of
body
imo
a
nice
offering
and
id
be
willing
to
try
again
to
see
if
i
might
be
missing
something
where
is
the
caramel
on
this
thing
or
great
mouthfeel
that
comes
from

aging
some
real
interesting

tones
but
for
a
wee
heavy
and
a
particular
barrel
aged
one
this
isnt
doing
much
for
me
as
decent
and
simple
the
beer
is
to
drink
this
is

excellent

its
made

prost
lampertland
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
while
it
isnt
the
truest
to
style
it
still
has
some
of
those
base
scotch
ale
flavors
but
the
sweetness
and
fruity
flavors
are
really
kicked
up
and
the
coriander
adds
to
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
smooth
rich
a
little
cloying
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
would
start
to
wear
on
me
so
i
think
one
glass
would
be
enough
for
me
but
i
think
this
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
cool
fall
night
by
the
bonfire
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
pretty
good
and
very
unique
and
complex
for
the
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
it
was
just
a
little
too
high
for
me
and
it
held
this
beer
back
from
being
as
good
and
drinkable
as
it
could
be
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
in
the
fall
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
but
its
a
little
expensive
and
i
wouldnt
buy
it
regularly
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
likes
sweet
and
fruity
beers
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
it
did
have
a
couple
things
that
held
it
back
but
when
it
came
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
it
was
pretty
complex
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
unique
take
on
the
style
and
i
actually
thought
that
the
coriander
worked
well
with
this
beer
and
i
wasnt
really
expecting
that
to
happen
and
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
more
scotch
ales
brewed
with
it
this
made
for
a
nice
first
impression
for
traquair
and
while
it
isnt
my
favorite
scotch
ale
it
sure
is
pretty
memorable
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
solid
work
othis
is
an
intriguing
and
tasty
winterwarming
type
beer
i
really
like
the
ruby
port
aspect
of
the
aroma
and
taste
which
is
a
slight
departure
from
the
typical
tawny
caramel
flavors
of
the
style
the
gently
warming
alcohol
fits
well
with
the
flavor
profile
and
the
feel
makes
for
good
drinkability
but
provides
enough
heft
to
make
it
worth
sipping
nicely
done
o
my
favorite
offering
from
traquair
just
scotch
ale
at
its
finest
these
guys
are
damn
near
under
rated
in
my
book
yet
ive
never
had
one
i
havent
liked
this
like
their
house
ale
is
top
shelf
scotch
beer
at
its
best
and
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
seeking
a
very
good
wee
heavy
the
price
is
worth
it
no
doubt
and
ill
buy
this
at
least
once
every
year
o
very
good
very
easy
drinking
will
definitely
seek
out
again
o
an
excellent
beer
overall
thick
and
malty
rich
perfect
for
cold
december
weather
glad
to
have
tried
would
definitely
drink
again
well
attenuated
flavorful
yet
subtle
ale
quite
complex
thanks
to
the
long
long
boil
and
resultant
kettle
caramelization
rather
than
the
addition
of
any
specialty
grains
worth
reading
up
on
how
this
is
produced
there
are
few
if
any
brewers
still
making
scotch
ales
this
way
while
i
think
i
actually
prefer
alesmiths
wee
heavy
this
has
a
certain
rustic
purity
not
found
elsewhere
o
great
drinkability
a
classic
that
deserves
its
reputation
overall
a
very
good
scotch
ale
worth
trying
overall
balance
and
integration
define
this
beer
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
lacks
presence
it
has
that
simply
no
note
defines
this
beer
and
therefore
this
beer
is
incredibly
accessible
for
a
scotch
ale
many
are
dominated
by
caramel
notes
which
taste
burnt
but
this
is
an
artful
melange
of
many
different
aspects
worth
a
try
even
if
you
havent
liked
scotch
ales
in
the
past
this
one
could
turn
you
brown
colour
no
head
smell
and
flavour
of
caramel
and
dried
fruits
almost
no
bitterness
there
are
better
scotch
ales
out
there
dogma
skull
splitter
dirty
bastard
and
i
think
this
one
is
bit
overratted
but
very
nice
pours
a
black

of
an

good

and
good

smells
of

alcohol
sight
oak
slight
hop
and
hint

the

slight

overall
a
really
nice
solid
understated
beer
from
traquair
house
would
recommend
reviewed

overall
somehow
this
beer
manages
to
be
light
and
refreshing
whilst
also
complex
and
strong
the
spices
are
very
well
blended
and
the
malt
is
well
balanced
with
the
bitterness
there
is
not
really
much
about
this
beer
that
can
be
criticised
although
perhaps
there
is
a
tad
too
much
coriander
and
possibly
a
little
too
refreshing
for
a
wee
heavy
note
i
deleted
my
original
review
because
the
wording
on
the
bottle
didnt
exactly
match
my
bottle
which
reads
ale
brewed
with
coriander
and
fermented
in
oak
barrels
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
though
i
believe
they
are
all
referring
to
this
ale
so
i
thought
it
best
not
to
add
an
additional
beer
to
the
mix
and
just
confuse
the
situation
even
more
however
this
is
not
your
typical
wee
heavy
scottish
beer
it
is
much
closer
to
a
belgian
trappist
in
my
opinion
initial
sip
is
predominantly
of
coriander
dark
fruit
and
sugar
however
at
the
end
im
left
tasting
buttered
toast
delicious
moderately
carbonated
medium
body
there
is
no
bitterness
to
this
brew
ps
word
to
the
wise
letting
this
beer
breathe
a
little
will
really
do
wonders
and
open
up
chocolate
caramel
and
other
spicy
flavours
pours
black
into
my
selinsgrove
snifter
but
shows
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
when
held
to
the
light
soft
white
head
quickly
fades
it
drinks
like
an
ale
but
shows
like
a
stout
and
i
could
drink
this
all
night
the
nose
is
a
delicate
blend
of
roasted
barley
and
floral
hops
tulips
corriander
figs
oats
and
subtle
horse
this
is
balanced
enough
for
anyone
to
drink
it
the
flower
hops
and
spices
rising
over
the
dark
fruits
fading
into
the
soft
corriander
outstanding

d
i
probably
rated
this
higher
than
it
deserves
but
i
love
coriander
so
thats
how
it
is
worth
a
try
either
way
though
solid
all
around
an
interesting
brew
spices
may
be
a
bit
too
much
for
me
i
dont
really
like
the
greenvegetalness
that
they
seem
to
impart
but
it
is
still
a
solid
brew
i
need
to
try
the
house
ale
again
now
to
compare
tonight
were
flashin
back
to
bonnie
prince
charlie
in
liquid
form
this
stuff
pours
a
very
dark
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
caramel
orange
juice
perfumey
and
earthy
greens
light
lime
rind
mild
pine
needles
light
wax
and
light
toasted
coconut
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
without
the
orange
juice
which
instead
comes
through
as
a
mild
bit
of
orange
peel
and
with
a
very
light
tinge
of
coffeeishness
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
watery
feel
overall
a
generally
solid
bit
of
scotch
ale
one
whose
admittedly
odd
complexity
both
sets
it
apart
from
others
in
the
style
and
also
keeps
it
from
achieving
greatness
therewithin
still
not
a
bad
bit
of
brew
this
bottle
aged
four
years
in
the
cellar
o
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
its
infinitely
drinkable
which
is
remarkable
given
the
alcohol
content
and
every
sip
leaves
you
wanting
more
theres
such
an
incredible
depth
to
this
beer
so
much
going
on
but
not
overpowering
or
overwhelming
overall
very
good
very
drinkable
nice
subtle
warming
effect
has
an
appreciable
earthy
quality
to
it
the
body
is
medium
with
soft
carbonation
overal
interesting
enough
brew
worth
trying
this
is
an
interesting
ale
worth
trying
hugely
disappointed
with
this
one
ive
had
a
bottle
of
the
house
ale
set
aside
for
a
while
and
i
really
hope
it
has
more
to
offer
on
first
sip
this
resembles
a
slightly
muted
belgian
quad
but
it
goes
rapidly
downhill
from
there
i
battled
to
drink
half
the
bottle
and
drainpoured
the
rest
o
i
didnt
expect
to
finish
this
one
so
quickly
its
the
exact
same
problem
i
had
with
sucaba
im
amazed
at
how
fast
i
can
kill
a
bottle
of
it
but
i
cant
help
but
want
this
to
be
a
more
decadent
and
savorable
treat
with
less
barrel
influence
still
despite
my
complaints
this
is
a
very
good
offering
pours
a
hazy
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
either
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
has
a
great
smell
quite
complex
beer
and
a
strong
one
at
that
but
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
on
as
well
there
is
a
good
mix
of
fruits
and
sweet
malts
along
with
enough
alcohol
to
give
the
beer
a
pleasant
boozy
kick
to
it
o
a
very
malty
brew
almost
zero
hoppiness
having
said
that
its
surprisingly
balanced
between
the
sweet
caramel
the
fruits
and
the
spices
it
actually
goes
down
well
despite
the
borderline
syrupy
feel
and
overall
heavy
sweetness
not
ridiculously
smoke
or
peaty
like
some
scotch
ales
too
i
enjoyed
it
great
example
of
the
style
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
i
dont
really
know
what
else
to
say
to
try
to
break
down
this
drinking
experience
might
cheapen
just
how
fantastic
it
was
i
just
want
to
remember
the
moment
not
define
it
overall
a
lovely
warming
beer
the
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
clear
dark
rubyamber
color
its
not
just
clear
it
is
like
a
colored
solid
glass
paper
weight
imagine
how
light
looks
when
it
passes
through
an
object
like
that
it
has
a
light
taupe
colored
head
the
head
consists
of
the
microbubbles
often
seen
in
nitroinfused
beers
the
aroma
is
mild
but
rich
with
toffee
and
sorghum
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
wet
and
slick
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
but
only
enough
to
balance
things
sweet
sorghum
emerges
first
with
faint
lemongrass
coming
in
late
i
dont
pick
up
the
corriander
but
this
beer
seems
to
be
all
about
balance
so
it
could
just
be
absorbed
into
the
overall
expression
of
flavor
its
very
drinkable
and
a
nicely
engineered
beer
beautiful
dark
brown
to
black
color
carbonation
remains
nicely
on
top
through
consumption
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
strongly
of
raisin
prune
and
some
other
dried
fruits
taste
adds
in
string
fruit
and
candy
mouthfeel
is
thin
all
of
the
flavors
are
still
present
but
not
as
bold
or
have
the
retention
of
others
id
put
in
the
same
class
but
still
very
enjoyable
overall
world
class
a
highy
respected
beer
that
has
very
distinct
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
balanced
and
full
of
flavors
its
pricey
but
well
worth
the
treat
after
the
belgiums
this
was
a
nice
treat
at
8
no
lacing
to
speak
of
more
malts
than
hops
of
course
and
very
fruity
bought
it
because
i
had
always
loved
the
tracquair
ale
but
had
never
tried
this
jacobite
stuff
it
says
its
flavored
with
coriander
and
i
think
this
one
might
be
my
new
favorite

heavier

gives
the
impression
of
something
along

the

for

was

it

is

light

it

almost

is

not

would
look

nitro
is
a
refreshing
and
smooth
ale
the
aroma
is
soft

nutty
with
a
delicate
yet
rich
initial
blast
the
feel
is
extremely
smooth
with
a
lower
carbonation
than
many
of
my
preferred
beers
but
it
compliments
the
softness
of
the
flavor
as
for
the
overall
taste
its
nutty
and
not
too
dry
many
describe
it
as
caramelly
and
chocolatey
but
id
personally
describe
it
as
a
soft
oaky
flavor
the
nitrogen
widget
makes
it
taste
just
like
its
off

which
enhances
the
refreshing
nature
of
the

even

good

overall
everyone
should
try
this
beer
it
is
a
scotch
ale
which
isnt
even
close
to
a
stout
but
i
compare
it
to
guinness
which
is
of
course
the
world
standard
for
a
stout
that
is
quite
the
compliment
for
this
relatively
new
brewery
in
colorado
so
i
would
surely
recommend
this
one
o
an
interesting
spin
on
the
regular
version
that
doesnt
really
add
or
detract
in
any
major
ways
aside
from
the
mouthfeel
obviously
solid
drinkability
and

with
that
micro
bubbled
tan
head
that
is
typical
of
a
nitrogenated
beer
sweet
caramel
and
dark
fruity
aromas
with
a
touch
of
smoke
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
nice
brew
when
you
pour
this
beer
i
opted
for
the
straight
into
the
glass
nitro
pour
you
get
the
cascading
nitro
effect
with
a
deep
tanbrown
colour
once
the
thick
head
rises
up
its
a
dark
brown
beer
with
deep
ruby
around
the
edges
with
a
tan
coloured
head
on
the
nose
lots
of
caramel
some
woody
tones
and
a
little
smoke
great
smelling
for
such
a
malt
forward
brew
you
can
really
pick
up
on
the
caramalisation
when
tasting
this
beer
theres
an
initial
wave
of
caramel
followed
by
hard
toffee
and
fudge
wood
and
a
light
smokiness
carry
through
the
palate
on
the
finish
theres
a
little
tea
aftertone
which
is
quite
nice
as
this
beer
is
nitro
its
insanely
smooth
and
almost
coats
your
throat
light
carbonation
and
a
sweet
finish
overall
the
lack
of
carbonation
allows
the
smokiness
to
shine
though
something
i
ha
not
noticed
before
with
the
regular
old
chub
old
chub
is
one
of
my
favorite
wee
heavies
and
the
nitro
version
is
quite
tasty
but
i
cant
say
it
enhances
the
beer
at
all
4
paws
the
nitro
seems
to
lessen
the
flavors
a
notch
a
little
disappointing
imo
good
but
nothing
superb
as
id
hoped
at
2
99
a
can
makes
a
decent
treat
or
crown
jewel
on
that
leisure
game
of
disc
golf
o
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
on
nitro
solid
flavors
and
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
o
think
ill
stick
to
the
regular
old
chub
from
now
on
a
great
taste
either
way
but
nitro
takes
all
the
punch
out
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
looked
nice
out
of
the
can
from
there
it
was
underwhelming
old
chub
is
already
a
fun
beer
but
on
nitrogen
it
just
raises
the
bar
although
i
feel
there
is
a
little
loss
on
the
palate
as
far
as
the
peaty
character
i
think
the
velvety
body
more
than
makes
up
for
it
top
notch
craft
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
a
lot
of
things
going
on
here
that
are
very
average
not
a
fan
of
this
overall
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
t
a
light
smoky
and
nuttiness
to
it
very
grounded
with
limited
sweetness
roast
chocolate
mildly
bitter
caramel
macchiato
and
peanuts
sans
any
sweetness
this
just
seems
bland
too
me
o
very
drinkable
for
8
but
missing
some
bite
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
scotch
ales
still
a
solid
brew
though
overall
impression
a
pleasant
and
unique
slant
on
this
classic
beer
i
think
the
nitro
mutes
the
wonderful
character
of
the
normal
version
of
this
beer
but
hard
to
tell
without
a
sidebyside
still
this
is
well
done
and
immensely
enjoyable
beautiful
burgundy
body
with
wet
sand
cascading
down
as
the
head
settles
to
a
one
inch
layer
of
dense
khaki
cap
sweet
fruity
caramel
malt
light
spice
brown
bread
and
malty
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
nice
wee
heavy
character
silky
smooth
body
as
is
customary
with
the
nitro
serving
medium
solid
everything
i
like
from
old
chub
with
a
really
nice
nitro
smoothness
absolute
quality
the
perfect
winter
ale
scotch
ales
like
this
are
warming
sweet
and
delicious
this
one
drinks
like
a
session
ale
hits
like
a
velvet
boxing
glove
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
old
chub
but
the
nitro
carbing
gives
it
a
supremely
smooth
mouthfeel
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
dense
creamy
light
tan
head
tons
of
lacing
smells
of
caramel
earth
smoke
and
roast
malt
smoky
malt
taste
creamy
sweetness
peat
and
smoky
malt
incredible
creamy
mouth
feel
semithick
regular
old
chub
is
good
but
the
nitro
takes
this
to
another
level
o
highly
enjoyable
if
youre
into
nitro
beers
i
will
seek
out
the
normal
version
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
a
curious
choice
to
apply
the
ol
nitrogen
gas
treatment
to
i
guess
its
still
keeping
it
in
the
celtic
tribe
and
all
that
anyways
some
the
edginess
of
the
base
beer
is
basically
shorn
off
rendering
this
actually
more
drinkable
huh
newfangled
technology
and
how
we
got
to
here
eh
its
a
good
thing
i
had
my
guinness
pint
glass
in
hand
because
the
second
i
popped
the
top
on
the
chilled
can
it
exploded
with
gushing
foam
several
ounces
were
laid
to
waste
as
they
spilled
over
the
sides
before
i
could
even
attempt
to
pour
it
wow
what
was
left
in
the
wake
of
the
explosion
was
a
pint
glass
full
of
stubborn
offwhite
foam
it
just
lingered
forever
with
amazing
retention
the
foam
served
as
a
barrier
to
the
deep
dark
brown
liquid
beneath
it
by
the
time
the
whole
can
was
poured
and
ready
to
drink
the
temperature
had
warmed
significantly
not
that
i
minded
but
it
was
a
little
annoying
to
sop
up
spilled
beer
and
wait
15
minutes
to
take
the
first
sip
the
can
says
the
nitro
widget
could
cause
unchilled
cans
to
overflow
well
this
one
came
straight
from
the
fridge
so
i
dont
know
what
went
wrong
here
however
once
i
tried
the
beer
everything
was
right
although
tamer
than
the
standard
version
it
still
produced
a
nice
malty
sweet
ale
with
negligible
bitterness
there
were
hints
of
smoked
peat
and
caramel
but
much
more
subdued
than
its
predecessor
unsurprisingly
where
it
really
shined
was
in
the
mouthfeel
exceptionally
smooth
and
creamy
the
combination
of
subtler
flavors
and
enhanced
body
made
this
extremely
refreshing
gulpable
in
fact
in
the
land
of
nitrowidget
cans
this
is
king
compared
to
its
nonnitro
brother
this
one
is
the
smooth
mellow
fellow
however
it
packs
more
than
enough
punch
in
both
the
abv
and
flavor
department
to
be
its
own
man
that
said
its
more
of
a
textural
experience
if
velvety
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
subdued
scotch
ale
flavors
are
your
bag
you
will
fall
all
over
yourself
for
this
beer
if
you
want
the
strong
scotch
ale
experience
then
you
might
want
to
stick
with
chubs
older
bolder
brother
this
one
could
definitely
get
me
in
to
trouble
i
could
crush
can
after
can
of
these
things
v
four
pack
of
tallboy
cans
good
value
by
far
one
of
my
current
all
time
favorite
brews
damn
it
is
good
this
beer
also
called
new
chub
on
tap
is
excellent
it
takes
the
slapyouaround
quality
of
old
chub
and
really
mellows
and
smooths
it
out
thanks
to
the
addition
of
the
nitro
definitely
grab
this
one
if
you
see
it
you
will
be
very
pleased
one
of
my
favorites
smooth
wonderful
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
nitro
helps
here
rich
and
with
a
little
alcohol
burn
overall
a
good
winter
beer
tasty
o
good
enough
as
a
scotch
ale
but
virtually
unsurpassable
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
in
nitro
looks
perfect
tastes
as
smooth
as
you
could
ever
imagine
a
beer
could
be
ill
be
buying
this
as
long
as
it
is
around
the
crack
also
caused
a
hiss
as
the
widget
energized
itself
and
due
to
it
being
a
tall
boy
as
well
as
an
n2
can
i
could
not
undertake
an
inverted
glug
instead
i
fired
some
into
the
glass
and
sat
back
in
amusement
as
the
cascade
took
place
i
would
up
with
a
finger
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
brown
to
dark
brown
srm
22
not
as
malty
as
i
had
hoped
alittle
watered
down
looked
a
nice
brown
with
a
luxurious
head
very
smooth
with
the
nitro
but
i
think
i
prefer
co2
carbonation
more
as
its
livelier
on
the
tongue
it
seemed
flat
being
so
smooth
overall
i
liked
this
one
because
of
the
mouthfeel
it
basically
reminded
me
of
a
better
guinness
worth
checking
out
for
sure
i
enjoy
the
belhaven
draught
can
and
this
does
the
style
justice
overall
love
whats
there
in
the
flavor
profile
but
as
others
have
noted
it
seems
a
bit
watered
down
especially
in
the
finish
too
bad
because
this
one
could
be
a
monster
odd
considering
it
comes
in
at
8
same
thoughts
on
this
as
the
original
old
chub
yet
the
taste
is
smoothed
out
and
the
mouth
feel
is
just
pure
silky
luxury
with
the
biggest
creamiest
head
i
have
ever
seen
from
a
nitro
can
with
astounding
suspended
lacing
very
enjoyable
for
the
style
and
the
best
nitro
infused
ale
i
have
ever
had
bar
none
most
excellent
try
old
chub
then
try
the
nitro
it
is
excellent
love
nitro
beers
delicious
brew
i
want
to
like
this
beer
because
i
really
respect
oskar
blues
and
love
everything
else
they
brew
but
i
cannot
get
behind
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
the
taste
sweet
and
cloying
its
similar
to
how
i
remember
the
nonnitro
version
i
thought
i
needed
to
try
the
nitro
version
but
it
was
a
bad
idea
if
you
want
a
great
example
of
this
style
have
a
skull
splitter
from
orkney
founders
backwoods
bastard
or
mcewans
scotch
ale
i
honestly
have
no
idea
how
old
chub
is
rated
higher
than
mcewans
taste
nice
sweetness
followed
by
toasted
malt
flavors
not
much
hoppy
flavors
everything
is
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
old
chub
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
perhaps
my
rating
is
driven
by
expectations
i
also
dont
know
much
about
nitro
beers
yet
but
i
think
this
one
is
less
flavorful
has
a
worse
mouthfeel
seems
watered
down
and
on
the
whole
is
a
poor
imitation
of
the
original
pours
a
black
color
34
inch
head
of
an

great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
hop
hint
of
yeast
and
dry
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
hop
hint
of
yeast
and
dry

overall
good
appearance
decent

great
feel
and

complexity

my
can

this
is
6

abv
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
very
little
light
passing
through
it
retains
some
head
throughout
i
had
some
trouble
identifying
a
particular
smell
other
than
the
alcohol
which
i
felt
slightly
masked
other
aromas
it
was
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
had
little
carbonation
somewhat
flat
an
overall
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
but
not
one
i
would
be
hunting
around
after

this
beer

purchased
at
chucks
greenwood
poured
into
an
ale
glass
pours
with
a
thick
dense
creamy
head
mahogany
colored
and
somewhat
cloudy
aroma
is
of
roasted

biscuits
a
bit
of
raisin
and
fig
sweet
flavor
with
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
and
sourness
creamy
and
full
bodied
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
quick
finish
this
beer
most
certainly
is
still
being
brewed
and
i
hope
they
continue
to
do
so
overall
a
classic
beer
where
all
the
components
are
excellently
harmonized
id
like
to
get
some
of
the
regular
old
chub
to
do
a
comparison
sometime
in
the
meantime
i
should
definitely
like
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
before
it
goes
out
of
production
again
between
this
and
the
ten
fidy
russian
imperial
stout
review
coming
in
the
future
oskar
blues
is
definitely
carving
out
a
place
as
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
this
is
simply
delicious
and
the
nitro
can
has
everything
to
do
with
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
huge
frothy
foam
head
excellent
retention
no
visible
lacing
at
this
point
nose
is
nutty
with
some
lightly
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
of
creamy
goodness
the
nuttiness
is
still
there
but
now
there
is
the
presence
of
very
sweet
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
very
sweet
has
a
smoky
taste
as
well
the
creamy
sweetness
is
definitely
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
despite
the
higher
abv
the
sweetness
and
creaminess
makes
this
one
rather
easy
to
drink
although
it
does
leave
the
mouth
a
bit
dry
honestly
im
not
super
well
versed
in
nitros
or
wee
heavy
but
this
is
an
okay
beer
not
the
greatest
for
either
style
on
tap
the
pour
and
cascade
were
wonderful
and
the
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
and
creamy
but
the
malt
flavors
dont
pop
like
i
would
have
hoped
maybe
it
will
be
better
on
tap
its
hard
to
say
if
i
prefer
this
to
regular
old
chub
time
and
place
for
both
i
suppose
and
it
depends
on
what
im
in
the
mood
for
standard
old
chub
is
cheaper
per
ounce
but
this
is
still
a
nice
beer
well
worth
a
purchase
if
you
can
find
it
o
i
prefer
this
to
the
original
very
smooth
and
easy

oz
can
very
creamy
taste
and
wonderful
thick
moutfeel
but
the
overall
taste
had
flattened
out
from
what
i
expect
to
find
in
an
old
chub
if
i
had
never
had
the
regular
chub
id
probably
be
more
or
less
satisfied
with
the
nitro
version
certainly
old
chub
nitro
is
superior
to
guinness
with
nitro
cans
but
i
dont
find
it
superior
to
nonnitro
old
chub
ill
be
seeking
some
regular
cans
of
old
chub
just
to
renew
my
faith
in
this
beer
where
else
would
one
find
such
a
complex
beer
sold
at
a
moderate
price
a
virtual
planetoid
with
rare
girth
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
dark
brwon
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
dark
fruits
taste
is
good
dark
fruits
malts
bready
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
feels
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
drank
it
from
the
can
and
like
the
original
it
tasted
of
roasted
to
just
about
burnt
malt
cocoa
toffee
caramel
toasted
grains
light
vanilla
coffee
grinds
syrup
light
rum
dark
fruit
peat
moss
and
alcohol
like
this
was
aged
in
a
wine
barrel
the
alcohol
was
very
mild
and
as
it
warmed
up
it
got
more
complex
and
tasty
the
smoky
notes
tamed
the
general
sweetness
and
the
nitro
made
it
flow
down
like
a
chocolate
milk
that
was
very
enjoyable
high
drinkability
this
went
down
a
lot
easier
than
it
should
have
for
an
8
abv
brew
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
nitro
version
taste
is
sweet
and
smokey
mouthfeel
is
silky
overall
not
bad
already
a
fan
of
old
chub
nitro
made
it
better
so
smooth
awesome
poor
and
mouth
feel
no
weird
flavor
sticking
out
highly
drinkable
i
like
regular
old
chub
much
more
than
old
chub
nitro
the
craftsmanship
on
this
beer
is
very
nice
but
the
nitro
just
brings
it
down
overall
in
my
opinion
its
ultimately
solid
but
it
doesnt
match
up
to
the
original
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
caramel
comes
out
more
to
dull
down
that
upfront
bitterness
highly
recommend
bringing
this
up
from
fridge
temperature
even
then
that
upfront
bitterness
is
the
major
detractor
of
this
beer
this
beer
pours
from
the
can
into
a
marshmallow
fluff
thickness
brown
sugared
colored
head
the
head
separates
into
a
day
old
coffee
colored
beer
that
sinks
below
a
sandy
beach
colored
head
first
sniff
smells
of
burnt
molasses
and
sourdough
pretzel
later
sniffs
smell
nutty
as
well
the
initial
taste
of
this
beer
is
apple
vinegar
as
the
taste
lingers
the
molasses
joins
in
tobacco
is
another
flavor
evident
in
the
developing
flavors
these
flavors
fade
into
a
lingering
aspirin
bitterness
all
of
this
is
accompanied
by
a
slippery
unset
gelatin
mouth
feel
this
is
a
cold
night
cigar
smoking
beer
overall
i
really
enjoy
regular
old
chub
so
i
picked
up
a
4
pack
of
the
nitro
cans
the
nitro
does
add
some
extra
dimensions
to
the
taste
and
feel
but
is
somewhat
shortlived
very
easy
drinking
for
a
pretty
strong
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
still
pleasant
overall
the
beer
is
an
absolute
winner
poured
from
a
nitro
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
dense
creamy
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
move
while
you
drink
this
pours
with
a
great
cascade
too
pretty
to
watch
aromas
of
rich
caramel
toffee
nut
and
cream
highlights
very
rich
and
creamy
sweet
nose
flavors
are
richly
sweet
forward
with
a
heavily
roasted
and
sugary
caramel
base
rich
toffee
and
cream
highlights
velvety
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
with
a
roasted
and
sweet
aftertaste
with
hints
of
underlying
bitterness
smooth
creamy
linger
in
the
light
clean
finish
it
is
a
deep
ruby
brown
and
almost
no
light
gets
through
there
is
a
nice
thick
and
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
throughout
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
on
the
mild
side
with
some
nice
dark
fruits
and
a
little
earthy
angle
to
it
the
taste
is
big
roast
malt
with
light
hints
of
burnt
sugar
and
again
a
little
earthy
hops
feeling
there
is
a
great
silky
quality
to
the
body
with
a
little
tingle
on
the
tongue
from
the
alcohol
a
great
use
of
nitro
to
make
a
really
good
beer
even
better
the
tangy
dryness
is
gone
you
still
get
the
brown
sugars
but
this
a
more
like
a
weak
brown
ale
left
too
long
in
the
can
it
mashes
all
the
high
notes
and
rye
like
qualities
the
regular
pour
has
and
makes
them
overly
sweet
and
smooth
i
think
the
nitro
cans
have
robbed
the
flavors
the
regular
can
has
too
bad
had
high
hopes
for
a
favored
beer
of
this
style
the
8
is
dangerously
absent
in
the
taste
which
could
lead
to
errors
in
judgement
be
forewarned
o
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
nitro
beers
it
makes
for
a
good
mouthfeel
but
i
feel
that
it
dumbs
a
beer
down
in
the
flavor
department
in
this
case
it
smooths
old
chub
over
in
all
the
right
areas
sweetness
is
played
up
a
bit
but
the
smokey
edge
is
rounded
off
i
actually
prefer
this
to
the
carbonated
version
its
just
that
much
more
drinkable
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
identify
this
as
a
wee
heavy
in
a
blindfold
test
id
probably
guess
milk
stout
doesnt
have
the
flavor
profile
of
a
traditional
scotch
ale
at
all
no
fruity
notes
smoke
or
peat
zero
booze
nonetheless
i
really
liked
this
i
have
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
nitro
cans
and
this
one
is
amongst
the
best
ive
ever
had
fun
to
drink
more
flavorful
than
anticipated
and
just
allaround
pleasing
to
the
senses
ill
be
back
for
more
recommended
the
taste
goes
more
toward
the
malts
with
sweetness
and
a
lingering
bitterness
at
the
end
very
nicely
done
i
love
a
nitro
most
nitros
for
me
will
bring
out
a
bit
more
of
the
flavor
and
complexity
the
old
chub
is
a
great
scotch
ale
but
the
nitro
version
seemed
a
bit
more
dulled
down
poured
great
great
head
retention
dark
amber
almost
brown
color
but
all
the
caramel
and
maltiness
and
big
flavor
that
kicks
you
in
the
throat
with
the
old
chub
is
still
present
but
a
lot
more
subdued
in
the
nitro
disappointing
if
thats
what
you
were
looking
forward
to
but
could
be
a
good
thing
if
you
were
looking
for
the
abv
and
flavor
but
wanted
a
smoother
drinking
experience
overall
just
as
with
the
old
chub
your
fondness
for
this
beer
will
grow
exponentially
as
you
near
the
end
o
i
love
regular
old
chub
and
this
one
while
still
very
tasty
doesnt
quite
hit
the
same
peaks
as
the
base
beer
does
on
the
other
hand
its
more
drinkable
an
interesting
idea
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
in
fairness
the
nitro
makes
this
one
more
approachable
i
just
think
the
regular
version
is
superior
overall
i
think
this
is
on
the
money
its
not
a
favorite
style
for
me
but
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
maybe
i
should
try
more
when
the
weather
cools
down
right
now
we
are
in
lager
and
ipa
season
a
nice
offering
but
not
as
good
as
the
regular
in
my
opinion
a
tad
too
sweet
and
overly
rich
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
still
a
long
slow
sipper
due
in
part
to
the
high
abv
a
bit
sticky
in
the
feel
but
nicely
full
bodied
anyway
id
have
again
but
i
prefer
the
regular
a
bit
more
this
is
a
longterm
sipper
poured
from
pint
can
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
july
2014
overall
stick
with
the
standard
carbonation
version
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
scotch
ale
the
nitro
adds
a
lot
of
cream
without
burying
the
malt
notes
too
much
yeah
id
definitely
have
this
again
and
id
definitely
say
its
an
upgrade
from
the
regular
old
chub
o
enjoyable
but
not
sure
that
the
nitro
really
adds
a
lot
of
difference
to
the
brew
possibly
a
slightly
lighter
and
creamier
mouthfeel
and
a
few
more
hints
of
sweetness
come
through
but
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
improve
upon
as
it
is
quite
good
in
the
original
formpackaging
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
old
chub
is
probably
my
go
to
beer
okay
it
is
definitely
my
go
to
cheap
super
tasty
and
a
style
i
love
so
i
had
to
try
the
nitro
version
when
i
saw
it
appearance
is
perfect
smell
is
also
excellent
the
taste
is
also
dead
on
very
smooth
although
i
love
the
appearance
of
the
nitro
i
am
not
sure
if
it
has
any
distinct
advantage
over
the
regular
old
chub
which
can
be
found
at
a
great
price
o
a
really
tasty
beer
overall
the
nitro
makes
a
marked
improvement
over
an
already
solid
scotch
ale
overall
the
regular
chub
is
better
in
most
ways
this
one
is
just
more
fun
to
drink
overall
the
nitro
was
a
bit
of
a
gimmick
here
but
i
thought
it
was
fun
overall
the
nitro
gimmick
dumbs
down
the
old
chub
the
widget
helped
the
nitro
head
but
not
much
of
a
cascade
and
made
it
more
subdued
and
watery
personally
i
think
the
nitro
boost
distracted
from
this
beer
it
made
it
a
bit
too
smooth
and
creamy
i
remember
this
one
from
the
variety
pack
before
it
was
nitrod
and
the
overall
appeal
of
this
scottish
ale
was
better
overall
this
was
an
upgrade
of
regular
chub
ima
seek
this
one
out
whenever
it
hit
this
beer
is
a
homerun
right
over
the
short
porch
for
me
the
nitro
does
wonders
for
this
beer
i
normally
dont
appreciate
scotch
ales
but
this
one
on
nitro
is
worth
my
time
finish
smooth
and
satisfying
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
feel
the
nitro
format
vastly
improves
upon
the
regular
old
chub

a
few
residual
spots
of

are

during
the
tasting
nose
very
much
subdued
but
theres
a
hint
of
something
vinous
mixed
in
with
a
trace
of
cocoa
and
an
earthyroasty
malt
profile
taste
consistent
with

with
perhaps
a
suggestion

a

something
metallic

this
beer
is
wonderful
lightmedium
in

with

overall
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
outstanding
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
prefer
the
standard
over
the
nitro
the
nose
and
flavors
all
come
off
a
bit
dull
and
underwhelming
malty
strong
slightly
smokey

dark

great

for
the

wee
good
an
excellent
scotch
ale
super
smooth
and

i
had
this
in

from
a
can
it

and
has
a
nice
tan
head
smell
is
chocolate
coffee
and
all
things
dark
feel
is
like
silk
in
the
mouth
not
a
heavy
ale
easily
drinkable
excellent
beer
malt
forward
with
a
subtle
hop
presence
a
solid
scotch
ale
excellent
with
great
scotch
taste
that
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
at
55
deg
and
above
its
very
good
compared
to
dirty
bastard
tastes
more
like
a
beer
but
i
get
that
same
overall
flavor
profile
same
lineage
there
win
the
style
but
given
the
4
stars
i
gave
to
dirty
bastard
lowering
to
3
5
which
is
not
a
knock
on
old
chub
by
any
means
just
trying
to
compare
the
two

draft
iron
horse
ale
house
very
dark
black
beer
with
nice
thin
brown
head
and
light
carbonation
smokey

and
chocolate
aroma
nice
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
texture
firm
solid
feel
nice
taste
and
kick
going
down
overall
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
good
scotch
ale
a
little
too
boozy
for
my
liking
but
otherwise
very
enjoyable
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
due
to
the
abv
solid
wee
heavy
not
as
good
as
those
i
tried
in
scotland
but
still
very
good
it
amazes
me
that
folks
here
rate
numerous
examples
of
this
style
above
traquair
house
the
clear
exemplar
of
the
style
pretty
smooth
nice
aroma
looks
above
average
would
be
great
without
the
smoked
flavor
which
is
a
bit
distracting
would
be
good
with
chili
but
not
by
itself
deep
dark
mahogany
pour
with
tiny
tan
fine
foam
light
aromas
of
malty
chocolate
and
some
alcohol
sweet
flavors
of
chocolate
and
caramel
are
so
smooth
and
dangerous
slightly
smokey
finish
per
commercial
desc
is
accurate
this
stuff
is
dessert
but
i
could
enjoy
several
fantastic
o
good
scotch
ale
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
big
sweet
and
grainy
overall
nope
i
drink
these
styles
of
beer
expressly
for
the
malt
as
soon
as
enough
hops
to
start
coming
forward
join
the
party
im
out
overall
pretty
good
on
its
own
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
sweeter
this
beer
is
really
amazing
with
any
dairy
or
caramel
dessert
smooth
drinking
medium
body
o
good
not
as
many
flavors
as
the
iron
thistle
if
you
like
some
bitterness
in
this
style
then
go
for
rahrs
offering
otherwise
this
is
a
good
choice
filled
with
toasty
and
nutty
feeling
what
i
compare
other
scotch
ales
to
o
4
all
in
all
a
nice
beer
im
not
going
to
wait
in
line
on
black
friday
to
get
this
but
i
certainly
will
buy
it
again
o
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
with
waves
of
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
with
just
enough
smokiness
to
keep
it
interesting
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
given
the
heavier
bodymaltiness
and
abv
great
scottish
ale
usually
there
is
some
hint
of
diacetyl
in
scottish
ales
but
these
guys
nailed
it
no
butter
after
taste
smooth
and
strong
o
not
big
on
scotch
ales
but
i
like
this
excellent
scotch
ale
definitely
recommend
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
i
wish
there
were
more
scotch
ales
on
the
market
this
is
a
great
example
malty
as
hell
and
delicious
there
are
hints
of
coffee
within
the
intense
malt
flavor
while
it
doesnt
sip
well
at
the
end
its
still
a
paramount
among
scotch
ales
malty
caramel
smoky
hides
the
abv
well
pours
a
very
deep
mahogany
that
is
almost
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
thin
foamy
head
sticky
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
malts
and
caramel
for
the
most
part
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
a
very
light
hint
of
smoke
that
actually
was
pleasant
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
and
you
couldnt
taste
the
higher
alcohol
content
but
knew
it
wasnt
a
5er
either
medium
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
a
really
good
brew
of
this
style
o
well
balanced
tasty
flavor
develops
while
it
warms
t
follows
the
nose
though
more
pronounced
and
theres
a
bit
of
nuttiness
around
the
edges
that
i
didnt
get
in
the
nose
the
malts
are
layered
and
come
in
a
hearty
breadiness
toffeecaramel
as
well
as
a
touch
of
chocolate
nothing
too
sweet
but
very
flavorful
what
really
makes
it
go
though
in
terms
of
taste
is
the
faint
peaty
smoke
a
little
grassy
hoppiness
and
the
oaky
vanilla
again
holds
back
from
becoming
too
sweet
or
cloying
really
delicious
really
great
beer
good
look
taste
and
feel
had
this
one
on
nitro
made
a
big
difference
with
the
mouth
feel
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
much
more
so
than
the
nitro
version
it
has
just
the
right
taste
and
feel
but
watch
out
this
angry
scot
will
will
club
you
down
if
youre
not

a

boozy
o
old
chub
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
gotos
its
affordable
and
available
in
many
grocery
stores
but
it
has
a
truly
complex
and
finely
crafted
flavor
that
is
virtually
unheard
of
in
its
price
range
the
only
downside
is
the
overwhelming
heaviness
of
the
sugars
and
malts
that
discourage
having
more
than
one
but
that
one
is
always
a
luxurious
and
memorable
delight
for
a
beer
that
comes
out
of
a
can
this
is
really
good
beer
100
points
had
in
aspen
tried
many
beers
but
this
one
is
just
perfect
cant
find
anything
like
this
very
pleasant
and
sessionable
for
the
style
had
this
on
nitro
tap
incredibly
smooth
smokey
peaty
heavy
mouthfeel
picked
up
a
six
for
my
fantasy
draft
just
to
try
something
other
than
the
ipas
and
lagers
that
would
be
around
i
was
able
to
only
have
two
of
them
as
the
rest
of
the
deadbeats
guzzled
them
overall
everyone
loved
it
i
rather
have
a
wee
strong
but
it
was
a
nice
taste
with
tons
of
malt
and
very
good
i
can
see
sipping
this
around
a
fire
place
while
making
fun
of
someones
haircut
i
could
go
on
all
day
about
this
brew
but
im
just
going
to
sum
it
all
up
in
one
sentence
perfection
in
a
can
this
is
a
dark
brown
ale
with
a
nice
12
thick
head
and
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
nice
full
malty
aroma
this
is
a
delicious
beer
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
i
will
drink
this
over
and
over
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
pours
a
dark
dark

almost
black
with
a

scotch
hinted
ale
good
stuff
a
little
on
the
cloying
side
but
overall
a
very
good
ale
overall
this
is
a
excellent
beer
but
at
8
abv
this
is
no
session
beer
and
needs
to
be
treated
with
the
utmost
respect
sweet
but
not
cloying
creamy
rich
malty
with
a
sweet
finish
very
smooth
and
very
easydrinking
excellent
value
to
boot
very
soothing
and
roll
around
the
mouth
on
the
finish
love
me
a
good
wee
heavy
that
doesnt
just
punch
you
in
the
mouth
will
happily
grab
a
six
pack
next
time
i
see
it
deep
brown
pour
delicious
beer
i
really
liked
the
nitro
version
of
this
beer
this
one
holds
its
own
for
sure
malty
and
rich
great
beer
man
i
love
this
one
sweet
and
warm
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
cheers
wow
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
punch
me
in
the
face
but
it
did
i
should
have
read
the
8
abv
on
the
can
before
buying
it
since
i
usually
like
my
scotch
ales
a
little
lighter
but
its
a
tasty
beer
though
i
think
it
might
be
a
little
better
if
it
was
in
fact
lighter
the
alcohol
kind
of
overwhelmed
this
one
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
content
combine
to
make
this
an
intense
heavy
beer
dont
let
the
can
turn
you
off
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
drank
it
straight
out
of
the
can
and
didnt
think
much
of
it
recently
i
had
it
out
of
a
glass
and
it
made
a
huge
difference
very
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
fantastic
few
friends
love
this
beer
acquired
taste
i
guess
was
not
for
me
strange
flavor
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
fair
bit
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
sweet
aroma
tastes
sweet
and
inviting
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
candied
fruits
and
carmel
very
pleasant
on
a
crisp
night
overall
a
really
nice
scotch
ale
certainly
an
american
take
on
the
style
smooth
light
beer
goes
perfectly
with
pizza
malty
scent
with
a
sweet
caramel
taste
and
mild
hops
medium
heavy
with
dark
amber
body
pretty
good
scotch
ale
one
of
the
few
ive
had
nice
malty
brew
o
a
very
great
beer
and
a
solid
example
of
the
wee
heavy
style
something
of
a
staple
for
me
i
always
want
to
make
sure
theres
some
old
chub
in
my
fridge
or
supplies
eric
i
had
this
on
a
nitro
tap
at
a
whole
foods
i
am
quite
a
fan
of
the
scotch
alewee
heavy
style
in
general
having
had
a
particular
opportunity
to
try
a
good
few
on
a
recent
trip
to
edinburgh
and
this
one
was
just
about
everything
i
want
in
one
it
was
malty
creamy
had
a
little
bit
of
that
whisky
flavor
and
all
in
all
a
great
dark
beer
in
general
and
a
wonderful
scotch
ale
the
nitro
tap
was
also
hug
in
bringing
out
the
creamy
and
almost
dessertlike
qualities
in
this
beer
which
were
outstanding
to
begin
with
coupled
with
the
consistency
of
a
nitro
pour
almost
like
a
milkshake
this
made
for
an
amazing
overall
experience
old
chub
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
nice
white
lacing
head
there
is
a
earthy
aroma
with
smokey
peaty
malt
notes
the
taste
has
smokey
peaty
malt
flavors
and
some
earthy
tones
brown
sugar
notes
great
body
and
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
top
notch
scottish
ale
this
is
a
tasty
ale
and
potent
strong
and
bold
if
you
want
a
smooth
strong
and
very
sweet
maltdominated
brew
this
is
a
good
option
the
nitro
especially
on
tap
is
a
fantastic
choice
pours
a
deep
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
thinner
creamy
tan
head
lingering
on
around
the
circumference
the
aroma
is
rich
malt
deep
with
notes
dark
fruit
and
rich
earth
the
taste
is
complex
deep
malt
flavors
with
more
dark
fruit
burnt
sugar
and
earthy
notes
it
has
a
nice
silky
mouthfeel
and
weight
a
great
scotch
ale
great
daily
drinker
but
also
goes
great
paired
with
a
spicy
thai
or
indian
dish
at
least
for
my
palate
not
the
most
prolific
example
of
the
scotch
ale
genre
you
will
find
but
an
extremely
tasty
wellcrafted
brew
especially
at
this
reasonable
of
a
price
point
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
my
initial
reactions
were
not
positive
at
all
i
gave
it
a
2
50
rating
within
the
first
two
minutes
obviously
i
deleted
that
rating
im
somewhat
new
to
the
craft
beer
scene
and
i
found
the
taste
syrupy
and
bitter
and
kinda
gross
but
as
i
approached
the
bottom
i
started
to
warm
up
to
it
and
the
beer
seemed
to
settled
down
i
dont
think
it
was
simply
the
alcohol
taking
effect
and
me
growing
acclimated
to
the
new
taste
though
im
sure
that
played
a
part
but
the
beer
seem
to
change
consistency
midway
through
i
found
it
quite
good
at
the
end
i
definitely
want
to
try
again
overall
this
is
a
waaaayyyy
better
beer
than
i
expected
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
considering
how
much
i
love
ten
fidy
its
just
that
most
of
the
discussion
ive
seen
was
about
either
that
or
dales
pale
ale
and
the
latter
is
sort
of
panned
so
i
thought
ten
fidy
was
maybe
a
onehit
wonder
sort
of
thing
that
was
not
the
case
and
i
will
now
try
any
oskar
blues
beers
i
can
find
i
cant
believe
this
is
yearround
and
less
than
10
a
six
pack
im
also
glad
i
got
this
with
regular
carbonation
because
i
really
dont
care
for
nitro
at
all
just
tastes
flat
to
me
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
moderate
tan
head
that
thins
and
laces
the
aromas
are
of
walnut
green
sappy
wood
fruity
pear
sweet
flavours
follow
the
nose
but
drying
with
addition
of
some
smokiness
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
smooth
followed
by
roasty
wood
notes
in
the
finish
nicely
done
heavyness
which
gives
all
the
flavor
only
detracts
from
the
drinkablity
in
minute
amounts
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
strength
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
good
malty
taste
typical
strong
scotch
ale
good
beer
o
a
very
nice
evening
beer
to
relax
with
but
not
quite
a
fireside
beer
a
beer
that
i
would
limit
to
1
maybe
2
to
a
sitting
because
of
its
richness
highly
recommend
letting
the
beer
warm
to
cellar
temp
before
drinking
this
beer
was
ok
it
was
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
that
it
would
be
it
is
a
really
dark
beer
almost
black
it
does
not
have
a
very
strong
scent
to
it
almost
like
their
is
no
scent
to
it
at
all
it
could
just
be
me
but
i
did
not
notice
that
much
of
a
scent
it
is
a
smooth
beer
for
a
dark
beer
the
taste
was
ok
not
my
favorite
but
it
was
ok
just
a
little
too
sweet
other
than
that
pretty
much
the
perfect
wee
heavy
final
word
not
as
complex
as
id
like
but
at
least
the
flavor
here
is
good
the
beer
became
more
flavorful
and
enjoyable
as
i
drank
it
so
id
recommend
letting
it
warm
up
some
before
diving
in
the
profile
was
so
simple
mostly
consisting
of
sweet
malt
and
chocolate
that
there
is
no
danger
of
this
beer
becoming
overwhelming
at
a
higher
temperature
even
after
the
beer
opened
up
a
bit
it
was
still
very
straightforward
and
simple
this
a
beer
for
people
who
like
sweet
caramel
malts
but
arent
a
fan
of
any
hop
bitterness
in
their
beer
id
choose
this
one
as
a
safe
bet
if
theres
nothing
great
around
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
enough
to
warrant
ordering
it
over
beers
you
already
know
you
love
great
lowhop
flavored
ale
i
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
a
lot
of
hops
this
afternoon
so
i
decided
to
skip
the
ipas
this
time
to
try
a
malty
scotch
ale
good
on
the
nose
great
feel
in
the
mouth
and
very
good
followthrough
on
the
taste
with
a
caramel
malt
finish
so
good
i
had
to
order
a
second
one
just
to
make
sure
the
first
impression
was
correct
and
it
was
old
chub
is
a
beer
that
i
havent
had
in
a
long
while
but
this
revisit
has
me
dogearing
the
page
great
beer
from
a
can
into
a
glass
of
course
poured
into
a
glass
and
was
very
impressed
the
color
was
dark
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
smell
had
a
bit
of
wood
and
a
lot
of
malt
in
it
the
taste
was
great
with
smooth
wood
beginning
and
then
you
get
a
little
bit
of
hop
and
then
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
takes
over
for
such
a
robust
beer
i
was
surprised
that
it
wasnt
overly
syrupy
thick
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
and
i
liked
that
i
could
bring
the
cans
out
fishing
o
well
balanced
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
very
well
hidden
alcohol
rich
and
creamy
with
a
really
nice
flavor
definitely
one
of
the
best
easy
to
find
year
round
beers
in
this
style
serving
type
can
overall
this
was
my
first
time
drinking
this
beer
and
honestly
i
was
blown
away
i
heard
a
lot
about
it
and
when
i
walked
into
the
bar
and
found
this
in
their
selection
i
just
had
to
try
it
definitely
cant
wait
to
go
to
my
liquor
store
and
buy
this
for
myself
to
enjoy
on
the
regular
o
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
this
one
it
is
less
like
a
traditional
beer
think
lager
flavor
and
almost
like
more
of
a
soft
drink
with
8
0
abv
really
easy
to
drink
really
nice
mouth
feel
and
flavor
very
happy
surprise
with
this
one
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
ooverall
a
wonderfully
balance
beer
can
i
have
another
please
check
out
that
bite
at
the
end
love
the
burnt
malty
molasses
and
brown
sugar
character
up
front
and
then
there
is
this
diabolical
hop
bitterness
that
pushes
its
way
forward
on
the
backside
not
bitter
but
it
leaves
a
mark
lovely
beer
overall
this
is
my
first
scotch
ale
i
think
very
enjoyable
lots
in
common
with
a
good
stout
cant
wait
to
try
the
backwoods
bastard
in
the
fridge
it
looks
great
dark
with
a
creamy
head
that
isnt
too
voluminous
or
fluffy
but
what
sold
it
for
me
was
the
smooth
feel
and
rich
taste
it
also
helps
that
a
pint
doesnt
feel
overly
filling
the
alcohol
content
is
a
nice
middle
ground
between
weak
and
overwhelming
at
one
point
i
was
a
huge
scottish
and
scotch
ale
buff
id
like
to
think
this
is
still
true
but
over
the
last
little
bit
exemplars
of
this
style
have
fallen
a
tad
flat
for
me
and
its
not
just
the
naturally
low
carbonation
for
these
styles
nyuk
nyuk
let
me
just
say
that
old
chub
has
restored
my
faith
a
dark
ruddy
brown
brew
with
a
shapely
large
khaki
colored
head
the
aroma
jumps
right
out
in
the
rich
sweet
malt
department
all
toffee
and
malted
milk
powder
palate
is
classic
sweet
malts
as
well
the
same
components
as
on
the
nose
with
a
little
treacle
and
faint
wispy
campfire
smoke
on
top
of
these
tobeexpected
elements
i
also
get
some
boozy
raisins
and
dry
chocolate
complex
malt
bill
is
shining
and
although
one
can
concoct
a
solid
scottish
ale
with
nothing
but
pale
malts
and
a
pinch
of
roasted
barley
the
multifaceted
approach
is
working
well
here
just
a
bit
boozy
the
sweetness
persists
right
through
until
the
finish
but
there
is
also
some
dry
cacao
powder
to
provide
some
balance
wonderful
wee
heavy
and
highly
recommended
o
old
chub
is
a
very
pleasant
scotch
ale
o
this
was
an
awesome
beer
ive
been
on
a
big
malt
kick
lately
and
this
one
definitely
didnt
disappoint
i
loved
the
combination
of
aromas
and
flavors
in
this
beer
and
how
they
played
together
so
well
with
the
scotch
very
nicely
balanced
and
well
crafted
overall
very
nicely
done
and
very
much
to
the
style
o
an
appropriate
analogy
for
this
beer
would
be
old
chub
malt
enjoy
by
hops
a
great
example
of
an
american
take
on
a
scottish
malt
bomb
i
love
that
it
comes
in
cans
and
is
rather
affordable
too
is
it
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
not
by
a
long
shot
but
damn
do
i
feel
comforted
that
i
can
go
to
a
trader
joes
world
market
or
novelty
beer
selection
of
whole
foods
and
find
an
easy
pack
of
these
bad
boys
to
indulge
in
without
breaking
the
bank
cloudy
rusty
brown
pour
with
a
inch
or
so
of
offwhite
head
that
lasts
a
while
leaving
some
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
pretty
much
fullblown
malts
and
dark
sugars
light
phenols
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
caramel
malts
toffee
and
brown
sugar
sweet
chocolate
notes
lightly
smoked
peat
some
earthy
hops
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
sticky
aftertaste
medium
body
pretty
much
appropriate
all
around
for
the
style
tried
this
beer
once
at
my
cousins
wedding
after
about
12
dales
pale
ales
wasnt
too
impressed
wanted
to
give
it
a
go
with
a
clear
palate
and
mind
as
well
as
few
years
more
experience
poured
from
the
can
52214
date
into
my
snifter
this
poured
a
deep
dark
hue
like
a
translucent
mahogany
with
a
12
finger
of
eggshell
head
which
retained
pretty
well
lacing
galore
in
my
glass
nice
bready
aromas
with
some
figraisin
goodness
and
a
slightly
boozyfunky
note
caramel
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
mix
of
the
dark
fruits
and
booze
nice
balance
of
malt
and
bitterness
mediumheavy
body
to
this
one
great
carbonation
throughout
and
a
nice
bit
of
chew
to
the
brew
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
second
time
around
look
forward
to
trying
a
few
more
in
the
style
cheers
overall
packs
a
bit
of
a
punch
and
is
available
at
a
pretty
good
value
would
have
again
well
worth
trying
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
scottish
style
beers
o
a
nice
scotch
ale
a
very
easy
drinker
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
im
never
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
style
but
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
looks
a
bit
lifeless
shame
the
head
disappears
so
rapidly
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
replete
with
sweet
caramel
and
hints
of
sugar
along
with
a
touch
of
pineladen
hops
nice
smooth
body
a
solid
effort
though
i
cant
say
it
blew
me
away
worth
sampling
if
you
stumble
across
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
hunting
for
it
o
a
decent
effort
but
lacking
in
some
key
elements
i
almost
found
this
to
be
closed
to
an
english
strong
ale
than
a
scotch
ale
probably
wouldnt
rush
to
buy
it
again
onot
my
favorite
style
but
a
solid
representation
of
what
i
think
a
scotch
ale
should
be
o
such
a
great
scotch
ale
the
flavors
in
this
beat
any
other
scotch
ale
ive
had
yet
very
well
done
scottish
ale
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
easy
to
sit
back
and
drink
multiple
glasses
overall
a
decadent
sipper
from
start
to
finish
a
very
well
done
scotch
ale
big
robust
yet
smooth
malts
and
a
complimentary
mouthfeel
o
that
first
sip
shocked
me
but
after
letting
it
sit
and
air
out
the
flavors
exploded
and
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
i
am
now
a
big
fan
and
introduced
it
to
friends
who
felt
the
same
way
initially
but
also
fell
in
love
with
this
scotch
ale
after
letting
it
breath
o
quite
let
down
by
this
one
very
little
complexity
and
what
flavor
it
has
is
offputting
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
with
nice
red
edges
when
held
to
the
light
foamy
one
finger
head
when
poured
with
some
vigor
that
fades
to
a
thin
sticky
lace
delicious
aromas
of
caramel
and
toffee
malty
but
not
markedly
sweet
with
enough
hops
bitter
and
carbonation
to
leave
a
fairly
clean
and
dry
finish
flavors
of
burnt
toffee
roasted
coffee
bourbon
and
vanilla
are
present
on
the
palate
and
finish
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
a
bit
too
malty
for
my
taste
but
this
one
is
good
nonetheless
o
i
could
drink
this
one
all
the
time
a
fine
example
of
a
scotch
ale
so
smooth
the
bourbon
backbone
makes
it
all
the
better
recommended
overall
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
image
an
archetypical
wee
heavy
i
really
cant
fault
this
beer
it
drinks
so
easily
for
such
a
high
gravity
beer
the
sweet
malts
dont
overwhelm
the
senses
because
of
the
wonderful
balance
of
bittering
hops
if
you
like
wee
heavies
then
you
will
love
this
guaranteed
if
you
havent
tried
one
but
enjoy
robust
porters
and
stouts
give
this
style
a
try
i
bet
youll
really
enjoy
it
overall
ive
only
had
a
few
scotch
ales
and
havent
completely
developed
a
taste
for
them
yet
but
this
is
on
par
with
what
ive
had
in
the
style
although
i
think
it
needs
to
be
more
smokey
solid
beer
nonetheless
o
a
good
scottish
ale
the
finish
was
a
high
note
for
me
o
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
tasting
on
week
night
planned
to
have
one
off
six
pack
now
finishing
off
fourth
could
be
the
chub
speaking
but
this
one
a
keeper
ill
repeat
myself
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
scotch
ale
meaty
and
hefty
without
making
you
work
to
drink
it
just
bitter
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
clingy
and
heavy
the
malt
shines
here
in
a
world
full
of
ipa
this
and
ipa
that
its
nice
to
have
a
relatively
big
bold
malty
brew
to
turn
to
this
one
fits
that
bill
nicely
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
very
good
scottish
ale
and
not
too
pricy
i
will
have
more
of
this
ale
overall
i
would
totally
buy
this
again
and
i
really
like
it
alot
oskar
blues
never
disappoints
i
like
this
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
its
great
a
heavy
beer
but
pretty
delicious
i
asked
he
bartender
to
suggest
something
different
and
he
slowly
said
well
we
just
tapped
some
old
chub
and
its
pretty
good
this
was
more
than
just
pretty
good
it
was
an
excellent
surprise
im
not
a
scottish
ale
expert
but
if
this
is
an
indicator
im
in
for
more
this
was
a
mild
sweet
porter
like
ale
with
hints
of
malt
fruitiness
and
lingering
flavour
this
is
a
sipper
and
not
a
guzzler
ive
heard
good
things
about
oskar
and
it
was
great
to
try
my
first
one
blind
overall
a
extremely
good
beer
my
first
in
the
scottish
ale
category
so
i
cant
compare
to
others
as
of
yet
but
who
would
want
to
this
is
everything
i
want
it
to
be
with
that
being
said
i
took
a
hard
look
at
my
ratings
and
asked
can
it
truly
be
improved
upon
and
i
said
no
it
cant
to
taste
and
mouthfeel
so
i
upped
them
to
5s
looks
id
like
a
bit
more
lacing
smell
a
bit
more
than
just
the
woodmolasses
that
i
was
getting
big
fluffy
khaki
head
recedes
quickly
to
a
soapy
foam
decent
lacing
garnet
amber
beer
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
taste
has
some
coffee
overtones
with
very
pleasing
smoothness
of
caramel
toffee
and
light
earthiness
mild
carbonation
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
pleasant
toffee
caramel
finish
o
thank
you
waiter
for
recommending
this
wonderful
beer
this
is
a
really
solid
scotch
ale
not
amazing
but
quite
good
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
scotch
ale
many
fail
to
deliver
the
characteristic
butterscotchcaramel
flavors
that
come
from
the
long
boil
and
caramelization
of
the
malt
but
this
does
not
its
definitely
worth
a
try
and
recommended
as
are
all
of
their
beers
poured
from
nitro
tap
into
a
snifter
pours
pitch
black
with
a
nice
slightly
off
white
head
smells
of
chocolate
with
slight
coffee
tastes
of
very
strong
coffe
with
nice
chocolate
aftertaste
beer
is
medium
bodied
very
smooth
nice
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
was
served
this
for
the
first
time
in
the
clubhouse
on
draft
at
a
friends
golf
course
i
dont
usually
drink
darker
beers
while
playing
but
this
was
so
good
i
wanted
to
go
back
for
more
tastemouthfeel
wow
this
beer
is
way
more
complex
than
i
even
expected
definitely
roasted
malt
caramel
bread
and
coffee
not
too
bitter
but
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
prepared
for
actually
a
nice
surprise
that
theres
little
to
no
cloying
sweetness
round
in
the
mouth
medium
body
warming
slightly
on
the
tongue
which
is
quite
pleasant
the
coffee
notes
come
through
the
more
i
taste
through
this
brew
medium
carbonation
i
personally
miss
the
carbonation
but
it
truly
is
spot
on
stylistically
high
appreciation
for
this
particular
brew
well
executed
and
very
enjoyable
tried
this
on
tap
at
dick
odows
after
they
ran
out
of
draft
tenfiddy
the
pour
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
head
but
a
decent
lasting
lacing
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
clarity
of
this
in
the
dark
bar
but
it
seemed
darker
and
a
touch
thicker
than
many
of
the
scotch
ales
ive
had
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
almost
too
sweet
carmel
and
toffee
notes
abound
flavor
follows
suit
with
notes
of
smoke
and
a
pleasant
alcohol
bite
on
the
tail
im
not
sure
i
like
how
sweet
this
one
is
almost
a
little
cloying
as
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
i
believe
ill
stick
with
dirty
bastard
or
wulvers
next
time
but
still
a
nice
offering
from
an
excellent
brewer
drinking
this
beer
mid
afternoon
after
an
easy
shift
given
to
me
by
a
friend
who
usually
is
into
ipas
it
has
a
mellow
feel
with
a
good
drinkability
unsure
of
the
price
that
this
would
cost
at
a
bar
or
by
the
612
at
the
store
but
id
pay
2
bucks
for
it
overall
another
great
oskar
blues
offering
my
first
oska
blues
try
i
had
not
tried
a
scottish
ale
before
so
i
cant
compare
it
to
other
scottish
ales
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
foam
a
great
butterscotch
caramel
flavor
with
a
manly
finish
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
also
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
beer
again
and
again
picked
up
a
sixpack
for
9
at
ye
ole
pour
great
beautiful
looking
wee
heavy
that
has
an
awesome
strong
smell
that
gets
a
wow
out
of
me
taste
is
as
good
as
the
smell
absolutely
wonderful
beer
that
i
sucked
down
did
not
seem
to
be
8
overall
a
great
beer
and
when
you
consider
the
value
due
to
cost
it
is
as
good
as
it
gets
will
be
a
regular
buyer

dark

pour
with
a
dark
ruby
cast
massive
head
and
lasting
lacing
light
nose
of
malt
sweet
chocolate
biscuit
heavy
medium
bodied
with
normal
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
slick
the
taste
profile
is
every
flavor
of
malt
available
very
well
balanced
between
the
malt
variants
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
isnt
as
pronounced
as
founders
dirty
bastard
but
this
one
is
outstanding
the
finish
is
smooth
with
a
slight
alcohol
kick
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
that
lingers
definitely
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
flavorful
beer
great
balance
and
unique
drying
quality
from
the
smoke
and
hop
character
help
it
stand
out
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
oskar
blues
highly
recommended
on
the
whole
a
very
nice
wee
heavy
not
my
favorite
style
as
a
rule
but
i
can
tell
a
quality
example
when
i
taste
one
o
this
beer
is
now
easily
one
of
my
favorites
the
8
abv
is
a
perfect
balance
of
drinkability
and
strength
i
had
a
tough
time
figuring
this
one
out
its
very
good
but
i
dont
know
why
with
regard
to
the
particulars
theres
a
malty
smell
for
sure
but
then
i
cant
really
place
the
taste
its
a
bit
like
caramel
or
something
similar
in
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
great
and
i
dont
know
why
i
would
get
it
again
poured
from
a
can
not
too
much
of
a
head
color
is
dark
brown
mid
to
high
30s
srm
left
very
solid
lace
aroma
was
mildly
sweet
but
the
high
alcohol
is
apparent
and
you
definitely
enjoy
it
on
the
taste
no
bitterness
the
alcohol
leaves
a
warming
flavor
as
it
goes
down
and
almost
acts
as
a
topical
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
medium
viscosity
is
enjoyable
on
the
palate
as
it
lingers
great
scotch
ale
that
seems
stronger
than
the
8
it
claims
i
would
buy
again
and
can
recommend
to
anyone
wanting
a
wee
heavy
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
redmahogany
with
a
shortlived
tan
head
deep
rich
malty
nose
with
suggestions
of
candy
sugar
and
grapenuts
rich
enveloping
malty
palate
balanced
by
a
reserved
hop
bitterness
decent
belgian
lace
forms
the
abv
provides
warmth
and
is
noticeable
tastes
like
a
heavy
should
sweet
delicious
rich
and
satisfying
you
can
have
too
many
overall
it
has
been
awhile
since
ive
sampled
this
style
and
ive
always
enjoyed
them
even
though
i
rarely
opt
for
them
this
beer
is
reminiscent
to
liquid
caramels
and
i
love
it
i
would
have
liked
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
little
more
full
bodied
but
thats
a
minor
issue
for
me
now
that
oskar
blues
is
readily
available
in
my
area
i
will
be
purchasing
again
cheers
o
i
love
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
dark
flavorful
beer
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
similar
to
many
scotch
ales
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
of
malts
and
caramels
but
what
distinguishes
this
one
is
a
sweet
candylike
taste
and
smell
ideally
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
little
more
bold
and
maltforward
but
overall
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
described
as
a
light
stout
when
i
1st
tried
it
nitro
overall
a
very
good
nearly
outstanding
beer
ive
been
into
the
scotch
ales
lately
and
founders
dirty
bastard
has
set
a
standard
that
makes
beers
like
this
good
beers
pale
in
comparison
this
is
easy
drinking
and
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
burger
but
on
its
own
it
wont
blow
you
away
it
poured
a
deep
dark
mahogany
almost
like
a
cola
with
little
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
and
toffee
and
the
taste
continued
the
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
to
full
body
and
was
very
smooth
although
slightly
boozy
not
overly
complex
but
highly
drinkable
i
havent
had
a
scotch
ale
in
a
long
time
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
old
chub
although
it
did
get
a
little
sweet
to
me
at
the
end
very
rich
malt
profile
but
its
a
little
lacking
in
the
peat
character
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
scotch
ale
less
complex
than
most
a
bit
too
sweet
o
this
beer
is
a
complex
beer
that
may
take
a
few
to
figure
it
all
out
taste
is
similar
with
a
heavyduty
malt
bill
and
touches
of
spicysweet
bourbon
peat
leather
and
tobacco
and
the
high
alcohol
content
8
is
wellsubmerged
this
is
a
killer
scotch
ale
and
a
toptier
example
of
the
style
bravo
o
a
great
looking
and
smelling
brew
with
some
interesting
flavors
and
nice
feel
great
example
of
the
style
and
usually
try
this
great
brew
if
i
see
it
around
which
was
rare
here
in
ca
until
recently
also
to
me
this
was
dangerously
drinkable
and
had
to
slow
it
down
a
bit
very
enjoyable
brew
prost
o
pretty
great
scotch
lots
of
flavor
malty
and
it
was
a
good
value
too
overall
an
outstanding
beer
with
a
great
flavor
profile
must
add
scotch
ales
to
my
rotation
more
often
o
a
very
solid
wee
heavy
and
a
perfect
representation
of
the
style
o
its
neck
and
neck
with
dirty
bastard
an
excellent
beer
overall
quality
scotch
ale
but
not
quite
as
good
as
dirty
bastard
imo
although
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
a
can
is
awesome
for
backyard
fires
or
camping
trips
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
this
is
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
from
a
can
in
recent
memory
id
drink
this
again
for
sure
a
little
more
value
the
their
pil
i
had
the
other
day
o
great
brew
carbonation
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
still
really
well
done
and
tasty
becoming
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
and
this
is
definitely
near
the
top
of
the
list
artfully
brewed
with
the
balance
of
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
really
makes
this
one
a
gem
a
nice
little
warm
alcohol
added
nicely
to
a
slightly
darker
tasting
beer
makes
for
a
pretty
good
drink
poured
from
of
course
a
can
into
a
beer
mug
deep
slightly
cloudy
brown
color
beige
head
that
disappears
quickly
smells
of
coffee
and
caramel
taste
like
smokey
sweet
hops
with
a
nice
alcohol
overlay
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
poured
out
of
a
can
id
go
again
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
and
its
nice
to
try
it
in
an
aged
form
whether
fresh
or
aged
you
get
a
great
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
aroma
to
offer
i
wish
it
was
a
tad
more
unctuous
and
the
hophead
in
me
would
like
a
little
touch
of
hop
bite
no
matter
what
this
is
easily
the
best
widely
distributed
scotchstyle
ale
and
it
is
a
very
worthy
style
indeed
picked
this
up
from
target
for
about
8
50
six
pack
cans
poured
from
the
can
into
a
mason
jar
neither
of
my
big
bell
goblets
are
clean
seemed
the
next
most
appropriate
glassware
i
havent
had
this
since
last
winter
and
thought
it
was
black
but
this
actually
pours
more
of
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
tan
head
nose
on
it
is
pretty
impressive
heavy
dark
fruit
raisin
malt
jam
flavor
is
also
raisiny
jammy
sweet
lightly
hopped
and
a
little
alcohol
lingers
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
mediumthick
and
syrupy
leaves
some
stickiness
on
the
lips
i
will
say
as
it
warms
up
it
deteriorates
into
this
sort
of
malty
alcoholic
mess
but
just
put
a
good
chill
on
it
and
drink
promptly
im
actually
really
blown
away
ive
had
this
before
quite
a
few
times
actually
and
dont
remember
it
being
this
awesome
but
it
is
that
awesome
had
been
in
the
can
2
months
i
didnt
pick
up
of
any
aluminum
or
other
off
tastes
overall
decent
beer
definitely
sweet
but
kind
of
a
funky
aroma
almost
reminiscent
of
bile
maybe
slight
sourness
to
it
i
dont
know
what
it
was
but
the
smell
really
turned
me
off
however
it
tasted
much
better
thankfully
o
4

great
beer
obviously
recommended
by
many
if
firestones
ddba
is
your
favorite
this
could
be
a
daytoday
version
of
that
its
also
comparable
to

in
this
style
this
came
across
as
very
one
dimensional
and
not
particularly
diverse
but
still
rather
tasty
o
decadently
rich
satisfying
like
a
dessert
enjoyed
this
sidebyside
with
a
founders
backwoods
bastard
i
enjoyed
both
and
in
particular
liked
the
lower
abv
of
this
brew
with
still
plenty
of
mouthfeel
and
malt
flavor
i
didnt
miss
the
bourbon
character
either
impressive
back
home
from
a
trip
to
colorado
got
the
chance
to
pour
from
can
to
glass
nice
deep
mahogany
red
color
lovely
2
finger
off
white
foam
of
fine
bubbles
leaves
lots
of
fine
lace
behind
holding
the
glass
to
my
nose
brings
on
sweet
molasses
toffee
and
smokey
malty
grain
flavors
are
kill
for
the
style
caramel
smoked
almonds
chocolate
vanilla
bean
and
coffee
feels
creamy
and
thick
coats
your
whole
mouth
and
hangs
a
while
overall
i
love
this
scotch
ale
why
oh
why
did
i
not
buy
more
had
a
few
sips
from
the
can
and
wasnt
impressed
definitely
pour
this
into
a
glass
it
pours
with
a
nice
thick
3
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
one
finger
color
is
deep
caramel
like
a
typical
root
beer
the
taste
was
light
but
also
very
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
strong
alcohol
presence
on
the
end
that
made
surprised
that
its
only
8
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
usually
like
in
a
beer
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
didnt
like
better
as
is
warmed
up
and
despite
being
lighter
easy
to
drink
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
strictly
this
all
night
long
excuse
m
way
of
describing
the
beer
and
taste
i
use
words
and
sentences
that
make
sense
will
describing
what
a
beer
does
for
me
i
really
love
this
beer
just
delicious
strong
yet
easy
drinking
favorite
oskar
blues
beer
i
have
tried
o
big
malty
smoky
goodness
definitely
unique
and
what
i
would
consider
the
other
side
of
the
spectrum
from
ipas
pretty
much
no
hops
that
i
can
detect
and
for
someone
that
loves
ipas
this
was
a
great
change
of
pace
all
the
intensity
i
love
just
a
different
delivery
awesome
beer
picked
up

absolute
malty
with

happening

and
drink
was
naturally
a
solid
malt
backbone
with
smooth
lightly
smoked
toasted
tootsie
roll
poured
over
just
the
right
amount
of
select
hops
to
give
this
scotch
ale
a
medium
sweet
but
pleasjng
finish
impressive
if
your
first
go
at
a
scotch
ale
as
not
to
smoky
effervescence
died
very
soon
so
swallowing
is
quite
unimpeded
higher
abv
is
hidden
so
youll
quickly
feel
this
great
ale
good
anytime
poured
from
a
35ml

the

offers
notes
of
sweet

caramel
and
roasted

there
are
rich
notes
of
peat

roasted

and
sweet

this
is
a
big
smooth
complex
and
easydrinking
brew
overall
excellent
brew
not
sure
how
it
represents
the
style
but
there
isnt
too
much
scotchyness
its
a
little
more
stoutlike
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
in
almost
every
way
its
rich
mouthfeel
and
caramel
taste
profile
make
it
a
very
satisfying
experience
while
it
remains
very
drinkable
despite
the
8
00
abv
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
beige
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
with
hints
of
smokiness
on
the
palate
this
thing
is
a
malt
bomb
lots
of
roasted
malt
bread
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
slick
it
finishes
sweet
and
rich
very
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
wee
heavy
o
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
scotch
ale
certainly
not
a
complex
beer
but
inexpensive
widely
available
and
tasty
i
have
been
really
enjoying
my
scotch
ales
lately
and
thanks
to
cellarbrations
at
carlisle
i
get
to
sample
this
and
it
pours
a
dark
mahogany
hue
with
a
fluffy
yet
creamy
two
finger
head
that
stays
all
day
long
and
leaves
beautiful
clingy
lacing
around
the
rimthe
smell
is
abit
weird
its
half
bourbon
and
coke
mixed
with
herbal
hops
and
a
tinge
of
peatthe
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
which
suits
perfectly
and
has
tastes
of
dark
fruitsa
tinge
of
peated
maltssticky
toffeecaramel
and
finished
with
a
beautiful
neutral
finish
which
is
neither
bitter
nor
sweet
and
overall
apart
from
its
aroma
while
cold
as
it
does
pan
out
abit
when
warms
up
and
gets
easier
on
the
nose
its
quite
a
tasty
scotch
ale
that
i
could
session
on
given
the
fact
it
hides
its
abv
so
so
wellwill
make
sure
i
get
a
few
more
of
these
before
they
vanish
cheers
overall
it
was
very
satisfying
i
may
pour
another
one
and
see
if
i
can
gain
some
of
that
carbonation
back
from
a
less
heady
pour
in
which
ill
raise
the
mouthfeel
score
i
fear
ill
have
to
retire
this
glass
to
the
ice
tea
or
something
not
so
important
o
as
far
as
scotch
ales
are
concerned
this
ranks
in
my
top
three
alongside
robert
the
bruce
3fs
and
scotty
karate
dark
horse
this
was
a
very
sweet
beer
that
was
grainy
fairly
dry
and
lightly
fruity
its
not
my
favorite
style
and
you
could
definitely
call
it
a
wee
bit
heavy
body
depth
and
mouth
feel
is
fine
suits
the
beer
just
so
so
sweet
drinkability
i
was
pretty
disappointed
by
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
slowly
won
me
over
however
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
creamier
and
did
care
for
the
booze
final
thoughts
wow
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
been
able
to
honestly
give
a
beer
anything
over
a
4
0
rating
in
the
taste
category
i
was
lucky
to
pick
this
one
up
while
on
vacation
in
fl
and
cant
wait
to
visit
the
brewery
on
another
trip
later
this
month
its
my
opinion
based
on
what
ive
had
from
them
that
oskar
blues
delivers
some
seriously
good
beer
if
old
chub
never
gave
you
pause
in
your
local
beer
store
before
then
let
it
do
so
now
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
few
months
would
i
drink
it
again
of
course
a
solid
scoth
ale
overall
im
a
big
ob
fan
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
particular
one
even
as
scotch
ales
go
i
have
prefered
certain
others
considerably
more
fair
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
low
carb
right
below
chewy
4
00
rjt
o
old
chub
lives
up
to
the
hype
wow
this
was
a
great
beer
its
rich
and
flavorful
but
still
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
i
like
oskar
blues
but
i
was
still
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
a
good
one
for
a
hot
day
on
the
porch
very
enjoyable
scottish
ale
great
if
you
like
them
big
and
malty
o
different
ill
give
it
that
but
other
than
the
really
nice
nose
theres
nothing
about
this
brew
that
will
get
me
to
buy
another
sixpack
still
oskar
blues
gets
major
points
for
trying
to
nail
down
a
style
that
isnt
yet
another
hop
salad
ipa
wont
buy
any
more
but
glad
i
tried
it
overall
delicious
beer
for
a
12
type
of
sipper
o
true
to
style
rich
flavor
while
possessing
a
supreme
drinkability
given
the
complexity
i
love
it
it
is
a
fantastic
scotch
ale
smooth
and
easy
drinking
while
providing
tons
of
flavour
and
a
superbly
balanced
beer
experience
wish
id
bought
more
overall
drinkability
an
enjoyable
ale
i
see
why
it
is
a
cult
classic
but
i
dont
think
im
quite
in
the
cult
maybe
knocking
on
the
doorstep
the
stellar
carbonation
lends
a
creamy
texture
to
the
medium
body
that
complements
the
flavor
of
the
beer
quite
well
this
is
a
brew
where
the
whole
definitely
exceeds
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
flavorful
lively
and
sessionable
in
spite
of
its
moderately
high
abv
it
strikes
me
as
the
scotch
ale
equivalent
of
domaine
dupage
this
is
the
first
offering
ive
had
from
oskar
blues
and
i
must
say
im
impressed
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
decent
foamy
head
and
some
very
sporadic
but
distinct
lacing
nose
is
complex
combination
of
sweet
fall
spice
and
peat
flavor
is
charred
coffee
accentuated
with
bitter
licorice
and
sweet
molasses
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
i
think
the
flavor
is
a
little
underwhelming
but
a
solid
scotch
ale
thats
always
available
always
nice
to
have
a
malty
beast
in
a
can
quite
a
complex
and
tasty
beer
an
excellent
interpretation
of
a
scotch
ale
hits
all
the
high
point
of
this
style
id
buy
again
malty
bready
chocolate
caramel
dark
fruit
character
dried
prune
hop
bitterness
is
mild
slight
smoke
finish
body
is
full
thick
creamy
smooth
complex
beer
which
i
could
see
myself
drinking
again
occasionally
overall
good
and
complex
beer
drinkable
and
strong
will
definitely
buy
a
six
pack
when
i
am
in
the
mood
since
this
was
only
a
mixsix
overall
very
tasty
i
would
order
another
for
sure
i
had
it
with
a
steak
but
i
think
it
would
be
good
with
dairy
based
desserts
chicken
and
dumplings
meat
pies
good
country
cooking
overall
4
00
im
pretty
satisfied
with
this
for
a
scotch
ale
there
is
not
an
abundance
of
flavor
but
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
overall
a
big
chewy
treat
that
i
have
been
meaning
to
try
for
years
but
just
never
picked
up
a
good
brew
from
a
great
brewery
o
quite
a
nice
beer
i
do
like
scotch
ales
and
this
delivers
fully
oskar
blues
continue
to
prove
they
are
a
quality
brewery
which
i
would
love
to
visit
sometime
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beer
especially
if
you
like
the
style
or
would
like
to
try
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
some
nice
traditional
scotch
ale
flavors
to
go
with
some
smokey
peat
that
only
a
few
scotch
ales
i
have
tried
have
had
it
combined
both
those
aspects
and
makes
it
pretty
balanced
and
smooth
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
the
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
and
be
pretty
happy
with
that
and
i
cant
say
that
for
a
lot
of
scotch
ales
its
for
sure
more
drinkable
than
scotty
karate
and
dirty
bastard
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
and
the
balance
they
were
both
pretty
good
with
the
alcohol
was
hidden
better
than
almost
any
other
scotch
ale
i
have
tired
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
didnt
look
bad
at
all
but
a
little
more
head
would
have
been
appreciated
it
wasnt
that
big
of
deal
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
and
drinkable
scotch
ale
it
was
nicely
priced
and
it
was
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
i
can
see
this
showing
up
in
my
fridge
fairly
often
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
scotch
ales
i
think
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
so
far
its
my
favorite
beer
from
oskar
blues
and
it
gives
me
hope
that
theres
more
beers
from
this
brewery
that
i
will
like
dirty
bastard
is
still
my
favorite
scotch
ale
with
scotty
karate
coming
in
close
second
the
flavors
are
much
more
intense
in
those
beer
but
with
the
intense
flavors
comes
less
drinkability
so
it
was
nice
to
have
a
scotch
ale
that
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
spectrum
and
i
feel
like
this
one
would
be
my
third
favorite
of
the
style
good
job
oskar
blues
this
is
one
quality
scotch
ale
that
i
will
be
revisiting
12oz
can
deep
clear
ruby
with
a
foamy
mocha
head
rich
ringing
and
a
robust
looking
cascade
of
spotty
lace
smells
of
rich
sweetness
in
the
nose
with
toffee
brown
sugar
cocoa
a
dash
of
fruit
and
some
smoky
accents
this
is
nice
the
taste
pretty
much
matches
that
with
a
rich
smoky
sweetness
on
the
palate
that
includes
notes
of
caramel
cocoa
and
brown
sugar
there
is
also
a
light
herbal
bitterness
present
that
combines
with
the
roast
to
help
offset
some
of
the
sweetness
here
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bubbly
crispness
that
fills
up
the
mouth
there
is
some
warmth
on
the
tail
end
of
each
sip
but
this
is
otherwise
very
smooth
for
8
scotch
ales
are
admittedly
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
made
a
believer
out
of
me
in
this
instance
this
is
just
packed
with
flavor
and
very
drinkable
for
the
size
i
wont
be
ignoring
this
one
on
the
shelf
any
longer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
pours
a
deep
amber
color
and
has
a
light
white
head
that
quickly
fades
away
lacing
is
minimal
as
far
as
flavor
goes
it
is
malty
toasty
and
full
of
flavor
hop
bitterness
is
low
and
very
subtle
unlike
some
other
scotch
ales
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
overpowering
on
the
smokiness
or
stong
malt
flavor
of
other
scotch
ales
on
the
market
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
could
enjoy
any
time
of
the
year
very
well
done
a
pours
a
lively
dark
amber
nightshade
lacing
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
perimeter
s
roasted
malt
t
bbq
sauce
at
the
front
transitions
to
crispy
caramelized
chicken
skin
with
sesame
oil
soy
sauce
and
horse
barn
smell
burnt
marshmallow
and
cherry
cough
syrup
finish
mild
vanilla
spice
this
brew
is
stout
and
complex
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
want
after
a
long
day
of
whitewater
kayaking
at
flood
levels
nice
balance
overall
not
too
syrupy
or
carbonaceous
despite
the
fact
that
this
beer
takes
the
maillard
reaction
to
a
whole
new
level
overall
very
solid
scotch
ale
but
could
use
a
little
more
hops
or
smoke
to
combat
the
albeit
tasty
sweetness
old
chub
is
the
most
commercially
available
of
the
scott
ales
currently
it
is
not
the
most
harsh
of
all
scotch
ales
in
terms
of
actual
scotch
taste
but
it
blends
the
english
style
ale
very
nicely
with
the
scotch
flavor
one
of
my
favorite
oskar
blues
options
o
hits
heavier
than
the
8
listed
for
me
ive
had
two
out
of
the
sixer
i
bought
and
both
times
they
have
sent
me
looking
for
my
bed
if
i
can
find
a
nightcapper
like
this
that
scales
back
the
sweetness
itll
be
the
best
lights
out
since
shawn
merriman
stopped
dancin
oskar
blues
hasnt
failed
me
yet
old
chub
is
a
great
beer
not
much
like
founders
dirty
bastard
at
all
if
youve
had
that
i
find
that
dirty
bastard
is
more
caramely
old
chub
is
a
lot
of
sweet
dark
fruits
and
some
roasty
bitterness
near
the
end
really
a
great
beer
oskar
blues
keeps
showing
that
its
possible
to
brew
a
great
beer
and
put
it
into
a
can
im
more
of
a
stout
drinker
but
this
ranks
up
there
with
founders
dirty
bastard
it
would
be
better
to
bottle
it
since
i
only
tried
this
because
of
the
reviews
cans
tend
to
make
me
shy
away
o
nice
and
malty
yet
easy
drinking
nice
caramelchocolate
notes
o
my
first
of
the
style
overall
a
nice
and
tasty
sweet
beer
o
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
scotch
ale
this
has
a
great
balance
it
is
sweet
smoky
and
peaty
wonderful
one
of
the
best
canned
beers
around
a
classic
from
oskar
blues
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
slightly
full
moderate
carbonation
no
astringency
drinks
smooth
and
well
oskar
blues
old
chub
45
not
overly
hoppy
complex
malts
carry
it
excellent
fullness
and
mouthfeel
smooth
and
satisfying
o
im
a
hop
head
so
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
style
but
i
do
appreciate
very
malty
beers
i
was
impressed
by
the
pleasant
sweetness
this
beer
had
which
then
gave
way
to
a
nice
woody
smoky
profile
o
very
delicious
highly
drinkable
beer
reminds
me
of
a
cream
ale
would
recommend
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
tasty
smooth
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
ill
definitely
be
having
this
one
again
a
very
solid
beer
thats
satisfying
and
easy
to
drink
nice
color
sweet
smells
lots
of
complex
flavors
and
a
good
solid
mouthfeel
a
really
nice
spiciness
and
peppery
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
seem
like
its
8
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
will
have
again
oskar
blues
continues
to
make
some
fine
beers
and
especially
ones
in
the
can
im
really
starting
to
like
this
style
o
a
very
enjoyable
creamy
dark
beer
really
does
remind
me
of
a
guinness
on
steroids
very
similar
flavor
and
mouthfeel
only
much
better
extremely
enjoyable
o
it
is
a
flavorful
beer
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
watch
out
at

abv
this
scotch
ale
packs
a
highland
punch
i
paid
9
95
for
a
sixpack
its
rare
to
experience
such
a
pleasurable
blend
of
taste
and
potency
from
a
beer
in
this
price
range
it
became
too
burdensome
beer
is
good
god
is
great
and
people
are
crazy
this
is
a
great
site
for
the
erudite
and
probably
for
fuzzy
old
men
like
me
but
just
enjoy
beer
try
them
all
bitch
a
little
but
remember
if
you
die
tomorrow
you
will
never
have
drunk
them
all
thats
why
i
am
going
to
live
for
ever

pours
brown

a
ruby
hue
with
over
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
sourness
that
is
hard
to
place
the
body
is
thick
and
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
but
not
overdone
like
some
scotch
ales
a
very
subtle
smokiness
is
barely
detectable
but
present
nonetheless
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
but
it
is
not
harsh
at
all
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
out
there
im
no
expert
on
this
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
finest
americanmade
scotch
ales
i
have
had
it
has
terrific
body
feel
and
rich
malty
flavor
that
little
bit
of
booze
really
pushes
it
over
the
top
wonderful
beer
for
those
who
love
the
malt
someday
id
love
to
do
a
blind
tasting
of
a
few
of
these
beers
i
think
this
one
would
come
out
pretty
strong
o
decent
scottish
ale
my
beer
was
a
little
too
cold
and
the
flavors
really
didnt
come
out
until
it
warmed
up
a
little
my
take
caveat
im
still
looking
for
a
wee
heavy
that
i
like
the
smell
is
very
interesting
for
the
style
and
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
but
the
alcohol
content
seems
to
be
a
hindrance
to
the
taste
whether
it
was
intentional
or
unwitting
inclusion
of
unsavory
volatiles
i
imagine
that
this
would
be
better
at
6

man
that
sounds
blasphemous
overallcomments
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
aroma
and
flavor
profile
are
excellent
and
complex
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
slow
as
evidenced
by
its
full
bodied
filling
nature
seems
like
an
excellent
choice
for
a

o
good
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
have
to
say
this
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
the
other
best
of
the
style
i
think
would
have
to
be
dirty
bastard
old
chub
seems
smoother
and
less
peaty
than
the
bastard
never
had
a
scotch
ale
but
am
enjoying
this
now
leaves
an
interesting
aftertaste
which
is
different
than
anything
ive
tasted
before
not
real
strong
but
something
i
could
drink
a
few
of
on
a
hot
day
im
currently
drinking
this
from
a
can
so
i
really
cant
look
at
the
color
but
the
rim
is
caramel
color
overall
id
like
to
drink
this
one
again
thanks
overall
when
i
think
of
a
great
example
of
an
affordable
widely
available
scotch
ale
i
think
of
this
beer
and
founders
dirty
bastard
really
nails
everything
that
a
scotch
ale
should
be
note
this
is
a
review
from
my
notes
as
most
are
notes
predate
this
review
by
about
two
months
now
on
a
winter
walk
with
room
for
one
strong
powerful
sipping
beer
this
is
a
winner
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
scotch
ale
solid
mix
of
malt
flavors
and
scotch
notes
overall
this
is
a
winner
perfect
balance
and
flavor
make
this
an
essential
try
the
chub
has
now
made
it
to
my
regular
rotation
all
in
all
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
scotch
ale
and
may
be
near
the
top
of
the
heap
for
me
definitely
a
nice
easy
change
of
pace
i
rate
this
overall
as
a
great
beer
while
its
not
an
everyday
beer
it
is
great
to
have
in
the
fridge
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
oskar
blues
beers
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
check
out
old
chub
o
worth
it
in
every
way
price
taste
availability
it
handles
it
all
this
beer
is
like
a
buddy
you
have
from
high
school
you
dont
see
it
as
often
as
you
should
but
damn
do
you
love
it
when
it
comes
around
ill
be
buying
more
this
weekend
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
thick
and
heavy
drinking
beer
making
it
a
good
beer
for
a
chilly
ohio
night
with
the
kids
the
palate
is
just
a
little
warm
smooth
and
syrupy
but
fun
and
tasty
beer
to
drink
this
beer
deserves
its
ba
accolades
o
good
for
the
style
but
not
my
preference
very
sweet
too
sweet
o
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
out
there
very
enjoyable
almost
a
nice
sipping
beer
yet
one
can
easily
drink
a
few
in
a
row
good
brew
overall
impression
another
winner
from
oskar
blues
drinkable
easily
accessible
and
reasonably
priced
you
dont
find
that
in
most
of
the
wee
heavys
that
are
out
there
ill
be
back
for
sure
wow
thats
three
straight
good
beers
from
oskar
blues
company
pretty
impressed
i
recommend
it
if
your
looking
for
a
good
american
take
on
this
scottish
tradition
o
the
smell
and
taste
were
a
bit
one
dimensional
appearance
and
feel
were
quite
nice
though
o
wow
wasnt
expecting
this
out
of
a
can
a
very
good
scotch
ale
well
done
i
recommend
this
one
cheers
o
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
more
than
a
single
can
of
this
in
a
session
simply
because
its
meant
to
be
savored
rather
than
rapidly
downed
any
beer
that
bears
a
passing
resemblance
to
schlenkerlas
rauchbiers
is
a
great
thing
in
my
opinion
it
strikes
me
as
a
fantastic
cigar
beer
too
o
great
stuff
and
proof
that
oskar
blues
and
sixpoint
are
on
to
something
the
cans
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
on
a
regular
basis
an
old
favorite
of
mine
and
a
good
reason
to
give
canned
beer
due
props
an
absolutely
wonderful
fullon
malt
dominant
beer
with
a
styleproper
alcohol
balance
an
excellent
beer
in
a
convenient
package
good
for
stuffing
a
few
in
a
backpack
or
popping
a
can
open
and
pouring
a
proper
pint
while
watching
football
on
tv
d
reminiscent
of
robert
the
bruce
not
a
ton
of
depth
and
while
the
flavors
are
expected
the
combination
is
very
drinkable
pretty
easy
revisit
i
think
high
scores
overall
for
this
one
especially
considering
the
fact
that
its
canned
this
may
be
a
goto
brew
from
now
on
for
cold
weather
campinghiking
trips
im
bummed
it
took
me
this
long
to
give
it
a
try
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
am
going
to
go
buy
another
6
pack
and
put
it
in
the
back
closet
until
this
time
next
year
i
highly
recommend
aging
this
one
this
pours
a
dark
reddishorange
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
the
aroma
is
mild
but
has
hints
of
robust
and
grainy
scents
the
taste
is
pretty
delicious
as
you
take
in
a
complex
blend
of
malts
hops
and
yeast
the
texture
is
just
as
smooth
as
the
beer
is
flavorful
this
brew
is
just
as
the
description
says
a
great
celebration
of
malts
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
im
sure
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
a
good
scotch
ale
from
ob
definitely
holds
its
own
within
the
style
overall
excellent
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
balanced
well
and
plenty
of
flavor
has
the
classic
wee
heavy
flavor
with
the
added
cherry
flavor
that
works
well
very
enjoyable
and
worth
the
drink
definitely
a
good
drink
can
see
having
again
overall
delicious
wee
heavy
here
very
good
balance
incredibly
drinkable
notes
decent
beer
hits
the
notes
youd
expect
for
the
style
but
it
doesnt
really
wow
or
stand
out
good
but
not
great
beer
i
dont
mind
it
in
the
fridge
especially
for
106pack
for
an
8
scotch
ale
nice
example
of
the
style
traditional
and
well
executed
will
enjoy
again
o
easily
drinkable
decadent
overall
a
great
beer
o
scottish
style
is
one
of
my
favs
this
one
is
complex
my
favorite
thing
about
this
one
is
the
underlying
fruitiness
that
seems
to
play
really
well
with
the
caramely
malted
taste
very
happy
that
ob
has
finally
made
it
to
ohio
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
but
nothing
particularly
amazing
about
the
mouthfeel
id
like
it
if
it
were
a
little
less
carbonated
thicker
than
i
expected
to
the
nose
mouth
and
tongue
this
was
dominated
by
a
roasty
meatiness
and
some
sweetness
which
leads
to
a
fluttering
trace
of
sharp
light
soya
a
bit
sappy
too
but
the
sugar
cane
backbone
didnt
quite
hold
it
all
up
good
though
not
legendary
but
very
very
grateful
for
marty
and
andrea
for
supplying
this
so
i
could
share
o
a
good
showing
with
a
huge
lacking
the
mouthfeel
department
i
an
interested
to
try
the
oaked
and
vanilla
versions
of
this
one
i
feel
the
improvement
would
be
immense
o
im
not
as
adept
in
cask
ales
as
some
other
styles
but
this
is
tasty
im
a
big
fan
of
oskar
blues
so
i
had
to
try
this
one
in
fact
this
makes
me
want
to
venture
out
and
try
more
casked
ales
i
cant
speak
for
other
similar
beers
but
i
like
the
complexity
of
this
one
the
taste
and
smell
seemed
to
change
a
bit
from
start
to
finish
o
this
is
a
really
nice
scotch
ale
it
has
tons
of
sweet
rich
malt
perfect
for
the
style
the
hot
smoke
and
alcohol
at
the
finish
are
nice
complements
to
the
malty
sweetness
that
opens
the
taste
furthermore
it
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
and
body
with
8
abv
cheers
oskar
blues
o
its
a
decent
brew
just
really
wish
there
was
more
of
a
body
to
it
its
just
too
light
of
a
brew
for
me
to
really
get
excited
about
good
looks
overall
good
representation
of
the
scotch
ale
style
strong
aggressive
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
stays
within
an
acceptable
limit
id
love
to
try
it
out
of
the
can
some
day
really
good
scotch
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
had
up
there
with
skullsplitter
i
bought
a
6pack
of
these
and
i
will
enjoy
every
last
drop
overall
another
keeper
from
oskar
blues
nothing
otherworldly
but
definitely
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
tasty
and
enjoyable
will
purchase
again
flavor
close
to
the
nose
with
a
modest
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
again
a
bit
of
booze
lots
of
bready
chewy
malt
medium
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
that
dries
up
a
bit
but
not
completely
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
full
and
the
feel
is
smooth
and
rich
carbonation
is
medium
to
slightly
restrained
allowing
for
easy
drinking
tasty
but
somewhat
simple
malt
malt
and
more
malt
overall
fantastic
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
definitely
a
repeat
although
repeating
it
more
than
twice
in
one
sitting
is
slightly
risky
with
the
abv
o
an
excellent
beer
in
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
oh
and
it
ages
extremely
well
15
months
old
and
its
damn
tatsy
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
that
in
the
right
light
has
an
almost
reddish
mahogany
hue
about
it
theres
not
much
in
the
nose
on
this
onea
little
alcohol
and
hint
of
sweet
maltbut
the
flavor
is
jammed
with
syrup
caramel
malt
booze
and
a
little
smoke
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
buttery
but
doesnt
hang
around
very
long
but
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
finish
it
warms
inside
our
chest
making
us
long
for
the
fall
days
when
we
might
actually
need
the
few
extra
degrees
of
body
heat
overall
super
impressed
especially
coming
from
a
canned
beer
if
you
took
an
excellent
winter
warmer
and
mixed
it
with
a
supreme
doppelbock
you
would
have
yourself
an
old
chub
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
at
8
abv
the
alchol
is
hidden
very
well
great
beer
to
have
when
relaxing
and
want
something
to
sip
on
i
rank
this
one
up
there
with
three
floyds
robert
the
bruce
and
founders
dirty
bastard
at
8
abv
its
well
above
robert
the
bruce
and
just
a
little
bit
under
dirty
bastard
but
maybe
more
drinkable
than
both
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
behind
the
rich
robust
smokey
caramel
malty
goodness
that
is
the
old
chub
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
even
if
it
is
not
your
favorite
style
it
is
hard
to
say
anything
bad
about
old
chub
i
love
this
beer
and
am
so
glad
oskar
blues
came
to
chicago
very
tasty
good
beer
for
a
night
that
you
just
want
one
to
three
beers
o
tasty
and
filling
warm
brown
and
roasted
malt
gives
a
nice
deep
smoky
flavor
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
when
the
weather
turns
cold
o
this
is
a
very
good
wee
heavy
and
my
goto
for
one
of
my
very
favorite
styles
from
the
many
scotch
ales
ive
tried
it
seems
that
many
brewmasters
have
trouble
balancing
such
a
maltheavy
beer
so
as
to
make
it
drinkable
and
this
has
drinkability
in
spades
even
with
the
fairly
high
abv
one
of
the
very
best
that
doesnt
have
the
benefit
of
barrel
aging
o
this
terrific
brew
comes
from
a
can
amazing
an
absolutely
solid
beer
that
never
disappoints
a
goto
scotch
ale
for
me
overall
this
is
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
if
it
is
a
cold
day
outside
this
is
a
must
have
it
is
so
full
bodied
and
warming
that
it
chases
away
the
winter
cold
o
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
o
this
scotch
ale
is
quite
good
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
the
nose
could
have
been
better
but
this
was
quite
enjoyable
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
a
little
dangerous
because
of
its
smooth
nature
and
high
alcohol
content
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
little
mahogany
red
smell
is
a
little
lacking
because
of
the
lack
of
hops
but
very
warm
and
nice
taste
is
a
little
smoky
sweet
with
a
nice
coffee
and
caramel
note
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
little
thicker
than
most
overall
this
beer
adds
up
to
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
is
subtle
and
smooth
like
a
warming
winter
beer
and
yet
i
am
loving
it
right
now
in
a
georgia
summer
that
is
hard
to
do
overalldrinkability
due
to
the
high
abv
i
find
that
this
is
a
sipping
and
savoring
beer
with
one
being
enough
what
i
find
odd
about
this
beer
is
that
each
can
is
different
some
cans
are
wow
and
others
are
not
quite
the
same
i
almost
wonder
if
it
is
some
sort
of
temperature
issue
but
ive
tried
to
keep
the
cans
all
at
the
same
temperature
before
pouring
what
i
describe
is
usually
always
there
but
the
flavors
that
pop
out
are
strong
in
one
can
and
weaker
in
another
the
aroma
is
consistent
though
go
figure
so
not
highly
drinkable
but
good
not
sure
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
based
upon
this
can
but
maybe
the
next
can
will
have
me
crazy
about
it
again
interesting
and
worth
trying
though
o
overall
a
great
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
scotch
and
brown
ales
however
some
might
be
hesitant
to
spend
topshelf
money
on
a
6
pack
of
cans
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
its
pretty
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
fuller
on
the
swallow
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
i
think
its
easily
better
than
say
founders
dirty
bastard
moreover
i
find
this
to
be
the
best
beer
that
oskar
blues
produces
overall
finally
an
american
brewery
gets
this
style
right
i
was
skeptical
of
buying
beer
in
a
can
but
everyone
who
knows
good
beer
kept
telling
me
to
try
this
and
i
am
glad
i
did
smooth
and
silky
and
so
easy
to
drink
at
8
this
is
how
a
scotch
ale
should
be
i
agree
with
the
bros
to
put
this
one
in
a
glass
and
enjoy
cheers
overall
not
really
familiar
with
scottish
ales
but
this
one
is
good
will
have
to
get
more
accustomed
to
these
in
the
colder
months
instead
of
steamy
july
o
this
beer
is
full
on
malt
with
little
else
to
show
for
it
and
for
a
guy
whom
admittedly
enjoys
the
hops
over
everything
else
this
was
a
tough
beer
to
enjoy
overall
well
put
together
beer
that
for
people
who
arent
too
familiar
with
a
scotch
ale
this
definitely
shouldnt
be
your
first
once
you
are
used
to
it
or
at
least
a
real
beer
drinker
you
will
not
forget
salud
yooze
guys
are
busted
artificial
carbonation
purchased
the
perfect
pour
in
elkridge
maryland
one
of
my
new
favorite
scotchwees
after
being
introduced
to
it
by
a
friend
not
sure
if
i
want
to
share
this
sixpack
with
him
now
however
this
one
is
mine
to
drink
12
oz
can
pours
dark
amber
with
a
long
lasting
tanned
head
nose
is
of
caramel
peat
and
hints
of
sourness
piney
hops
and
chocolate
body
is
full
and
smooth
taste
is
caramel
chocolate
alcohol
earthy
hops
and
brown
sugar
finish
is
long
tangy
and
dry
nice
brew
to
sip
edit
i
tried
a
more
recent
batch
of
this
beer
and
the
diacetyl
problem
seems
to
have
been
fixed
or
was
it
merely
a
fresher
batch
i
sampled
with
the
diacetyl
not
having
the
timeopportunity
to
form
the
horrendous
experience
of
the
first
six
pack
makes
me
loathe
to
change
my
review
but
im
convinced
that
this
beer
does
seem
to
be
a
crap
shootif
you
get
lucky
and
get
a
hold
of
a
freshwellhandled
version
of
this
beer
it
can
be
quite
good
poured
from
glorious
can
into
tulip
this
nearly
dark
brown
bear
had
a
fine
creamy
almondcolored
head
of
medium
duration
the
nose
was
a
faint
caramel
chocolate
that
was
also
evident
in
the
flavor
although
i
felt
there
was
licorice
there
as
well
the
pallet
feel
was
like
velvet
with
little
hang
ill
have
another
serving
type
can
o
an
excellent
ale
had
some
strong
ale
qualities
at
a
lower
temperature
but
on
the
warming
really
defined
itself
as
a
scotch
style
ale
great
flavor
and
aroma
profile
o
pretty
good
drinkability
abv
is
somewhat
hidden
a
very
good
all
around
scotch
ale
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
ive
had
overall
one
fantastic
and
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
it
has
a
nice
smooth
flavor
yet
still
is
able
to
pack
a
punch
cheers
picked
this
up
in
buffalo
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
creamy
white
head
tastes
slightly
sweet
with
some
smoke
lingering
and
a
caramal
like
malty
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
there
is
no
hint
of
the
8
alc
what
so
ever
ive
had
very
few
scottish
ales
but
this
is
a
decent
beer
overall
od
too
smokey
for
my
taste
can
see
the
potential
but
sadly
it
was
masked
by
the
smoked
element
alright
just
held
back
ive
always
believed
this
brew
is
best
ice
cold
but
wanted
to
rate
it
as
it
should
be
served
theres
tons
of
noticeable
alcohol
but
its
placed
nicely
beneath
the
heavy
malt
a
very
nice
goto
brew
recommended
the
taste
is
big
as
well
really
over
the
top
which
i
like
it
does
get
tiring
after
one
or
two
though
by
far
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
had
to
date
o
solid
definitely
recommend
looking
for
a
delicious
malty
beer
check
it
out
overall
it
was
something
i
would
buy
again
but
only
if
better
options
werent
there
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
like
i
get
from
a
founders
dirty
bastard
scotch
ale
doa
o
a
great
scotch
ale
tasty
on
the
slopes
or
off
ontap
at
the
tasty
weasel
i
think
this
is
the
best
american
brewed
version
of
this
style
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
edge
when
held
to
the
light
creamy
ecru
foam
sits
on
top
firmly
and
never
leaves
thick
caramel
and
toffee
on
a
base
of
shortbread
and
toast
a
hint
of
char
adds
depth
along
with
a
fleeting
earthy
hop
flavor
balanced
on
the
finsih
leaving
old
chub
more
drinkable
than
the
overly
sweet
examples
out
there
this
one
is
loaded
with
big
flavors
but
manages
to
stay
smooth
from
start
to
swallow
oa
nice
scotch
ale
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
a
little
thin
adding
a
touch
more
bitternessgrassy
hops
would
made
this
a
perfect
brew
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
definitely
think
it
could
use
more
carbonation
medium
full
body
with
light
soft
carbonation
not
particularly
quaffable
but
a
decent
beer
ive
had
better
scotch
ales
and
if
im
in
the
mood
for
one
i
dont
think
ill
turn
to
old
chub
pour
a
thick
deep
brown
with
a
substantial
tan
head
smells
sweet
with
caramel
notes
the
taste
similar
sweet
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
a
very
excellent
representation
of
the
style
a
beer
thats
8
abv
only
10
for
a
six
pack
tastes
this
good
and
i
can
take
it
to
the
beach
count
me
in
this
was
the
right
price
at
a
little
dive
bar
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
go
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
its
drinkability
its
still
sweet
and
still
very
much
a
scottish
ale
but
the
sweetness
isnt
searing
and
the
mouthfeels
nice
moderate
clean
and
doesnt
mask
the
underlying
flavours
scotch
are
not
my
favorite
style
they
tend
to
be
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
this
one
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
sweet
with
a
nice
boozy
finish
to
round
out
the
sweetness
so
as
not
to
be
too
cloying
this
may
be
the
best
canned
beer
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
makes
me
want
to
get
the
required
thistle
glass
to
enjoy
it
properly
rich
and
sweet
this
beer
does
almost
everything
well
and
would
be
ideal
for
hiking
or
just
to
relax
with
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
didt
expect
this
to
be
near
this
good
will
purchase
a
six
if
i
can
find
it
again
at
world
market
overall
its
a
great
beer
theres
a
nice
flavor
profile
and
its
just
well
made
i
dig
it
overall
a
great
scotch
ale
hides
the
abv
pretty
well
and
is
very
flavoursome
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
nothing
really
stands
out
that
would
make
me
want
to
pursue
this
again
o
for
right
now
im
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
wont
write
it
off
until
i
have
a
fresh
one
but
feel
a
significant
lake
of
punch
in
this
one
hmmmm
i
can
see
myself
revisiting
this
but
it
wont
be
something
i
will
have
at
the
top
of
my
repurchase
list
be
sure
to
refrigerate
it
no
longer
than
an
hour
and
let
the
can
warm
up
for
about
10
minutes
o
an
exceptional
scotch
ale
although
this
is
one
of
the
first
i
have
tried
i
like
the
robust
malt
flavors
in
this
style
and
will
be
seeking
out
other
examples
to
try
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
and
relax
with
o
a
very
solid
scotch
ale
in
really
enjoy
the
flavor
profile
and
the
drink
ability
a
very
solid
brew
from
oskar
blues
overall
a
go
to
beer
from
oskar
blues
normally
is
reasonably
priced
even
at
the
bar
i
like
a
little
more
carmel
malt
in
my
scotch
ales
beautiful
deep
red
in
body
with
offwhite
head
aroma
of
light
raisins
chocolate
toasty
grains
and
light
cinnamon
starts
off
cinnamon
chocolate
toast
and
then
evolves
into
a
dark
fruit
tangy
sweetness
with
some
booze
lingering
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
good
it
is
not
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
besides
scotty
karate
i
would
say
it
is
second
the
only
thing
that
could
make
this
better
is
a
stronger
nose
d
given
the
availability
and
quality
of
this
beer
itll
be
hard
to
stay
away
from
it
in
the
future

taste
is

some

this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
pretty
nice
flavors
i
am
really
digging
the
slight
smoke
i
am
getting
after
each
sip
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
the
last
one
of
these
out
of
a
case
i
bought
and
i
am
enjoying
this
one
more
but
i
am
so
much
more
likely
to
be
reaching
for
so
many
different
styles
of
beer
it
is
a
scotch
ale
well
pulled
off
but
this
beeradvocates
tastes
lie
elsewhere
a
very
big
and
bold
beer
in
a
can
indeed
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
at
least
once
in
a
lifetime
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
as
you
could
ask
for
its
a
little
sticky
especially
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
and
the
carbonation
doesnt
make
a
big
deal
of
itself
o
enjoyable
scotch
ale
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
sweet
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
o
although
im
more
of
a
hophead
myself
i
can
appreciate
a
good
malty
beer
i
love
scotch
ales
and
this
is
a
solid
example
of
a
great
scotch
ale
i
highly
recommend
certainly
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sitting
as
i
said
im
not
super
familiar
with
the
style
but
based
on
this
am
interested
to
investigate
further
check
it
out
if
its
available
in
your
area
o
tasty
well
made
i
would
prefer
slightly
less
alcohol
but
still
enjoyed
it
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
one
delicious
sipper
the
body
is
smooth
and
coating
but
quickly
becomes
quite
sticky
as
the
beer
warms
the
carbonation
isnt
overly
noticeable
which
allows
the
body
to
present
the
flavors
very
well
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
dark
bloodruby
coloring
that
is
vibrant
and
lovely
a
thin
filmy
sparse
covering
over
the
surface
of
the
brew
with
a
slick
clear
looking
cling
along
the
glass
the
nose
is
super
malty
and
rich
with
a
boozey
undertone
and
a
roasted
overtone
flavors
are
bold
and
rich
on
a
full
robust
body
roasted
tangy
sweet
molasses
and
toffee
flavors
blended
amazingly
into
a
velvety
creamy
body
the
aftertaste
is
superboozey
with
a
caramel
rich
maltiness
on
a
bold
rich
full
body
the
finish
is
smooth
and
rich
with
a
slight
cloying
feel
that
is
cleaned
up
by
the
booze
delicious
representation
of
the
wee
heavy
style
deservedly
popular
beer
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
years
handy
cans
in
the
luggage
for
voyage
to
beer
deprived
lands
oa
love
it
gotta
get
more
and
will
deff
be
givin
some
out
to
the
boys
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
in
my
opinion
will
definitely
be
buying
this
one
again
and
thats
rare
for
me
the
way
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
compliment
each
other
is
its
strong
point
its
everything
youd
expect
from
an
american
craft
beer
companies
take
on
a
wee
heavyscotch
ale
x10
that
may
be
a
little
much
for
some
people
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
poured
from
can
to
pint
glass
while
at
moes
in
lionshead
vail
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
1
finger
offwhite
head
with
some
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweetness
from
caramal
malts
and
roasted
character
the
high
abv
is
also
prevalent
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
strong
malt
character
roasty
flavors
but
mostly
a
malt
sweetness
the
sweetness
is
very
overpowering
finishes
sweet
with
lingering
mild
bitterness
and
a
reminder
of
the
alcohol
not
pleasant
really
full
bodied
and
oily
in
character
rather
average
overall
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
this
can
i
found
it
hot
and
thick
in
sweetness
too
much
for
the
style
to
make
it
really
enjoyable
o
this
is
just
a
great
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
that
is
8
the
flavors
just
bust
on
my
palate
and
the
beer
never
really
gets
old
i
buy
this
beer
all
the
time
and
i
will
gladly
buy
it
again
it
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
light
brown
one
finger
head
there
wasnt
any
lacing
though
i
dont
usually
see
lacing
with
most
beers
at
that
bar
might
be
something
they
clean
with
it
smells
fruity
like
raisins
and
somewhat
like
black
cherries
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
dates
raisins
cherries
with
a
bready
malt
backbone
and
an
almost
peanut
butter
tinge
to
it
its
got
a
full
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
smooth
but
not
so
creamy
overall
i
cant
keep
my
hands
off
this
beer
at
8
its
pretty
dangerous
o
its
alright
but
as
it
is
the
third
beer
ive
had
from
oskar
blues
im
not
tremendously
impressed
with
their
stuff
so
far
too
bad
as
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
more
appearance
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thinner
dissipating
head
leaving
scant
lace
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
alchoholic
chocolates
in
raisin
wine

the
sweet
malt
raisins
and
a
slight
smoked
peat
note
with
alchohol

fallow

with
good

a
very
filling
beer
overall
the
second
excellent
scottish
ive
sampled
in
the
past
few
days
not
the
sexiest
of
all
styles
but
a
very
well
done
brew
for
the
style
overall
pretty
darn
good
very
malty
o
one
of
the
finest
scotch
ales
i
have
ever
tasted
o
overall
a
great
beer
that
shows
really
great
malt
depth
i
normally
drink
fairly
hop
forward
beers
so
this
is
a
nice
contrast
scotch
ale
is
a
style
i
couldnt
drink
too
regularly
but
once
in
a
while
its
great
another
good
beer
from
ob
d
considering
the
abv
this
goes
down
pretty
easy
at
the
same
time
the
sweetness
would
make
it
hard
to
drink
multiple
cans
in
one
night
good
but
not
exceptional
in
my
opinion
o
okay
tastes
a
little
bit
better
than
flat
cherry
cola
least
favorite
scotch
ale
i
have
had
overall
excellent
scotch
ale
i
love
how
its
almost
like
an
heavier
version
than
most
a
great
sipper
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
recommend
o
not
bad
but
i
like
robert
the
bruce
a
bit
more
finished
clean
an
kind
slick
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
making
this
ale
easy
to
drink
so
watch
yourself
other
than
that
the
best
canned
but
do
not
drink
out
of
the
can
scotch
ale
o
a
very
drinkable
scottish
ale
it
is
as
unique
as
they
come
but
also
quite
delicious
certainly
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
should
be
tried
by
any
scottish
ale
fan
very
bold
flavor
with
malts
and
barley
notes
highly
present
pours
with
a
small
amount
of
foam
head
but
dissapates
quickly
the
color
is
very
dark
brown
and
prefer
it
well
chilled
one
of
my
favorite
ales
i
have
found
because
of
the
very
bold
but
yet
mild
taste
it
has
the
ale
is
a
very
fine
example
of
what
a
dark
ale
should
be
poured
into
snifter
just
about
opaque
and
black
stoutlike
with
a
red
tinge
around
edges
deep
sweetness
on
the
nose
black
cherry
if
you
will
other
dark
fruit
just
a
tad
of
caramel
latte
and
cream
for
taste
a
bitter
sweet
burntness
a
slight
booziness
lots
of
caramel
malt
coats
the
palate
goes
down
smooth
and
creamy
i
almost
grabbed
ten
fidy
until
i
saw
this
and
being
a
scotch
ale
fan
had
to
try
it
at
this
price
doesnt
disappoint
but
i
prefer
certain
others
i
cant
get
this
stuff
in
ohio
so
it
looks
like
regular
trips
to
pa
are
in
order
definitely
a
great
sipping
beer
with
amazing
complexity
d
not
bad
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
love
the
whole
microcan
movement
and
pay
homage
to
oskar
blues
as
one
of
the
founders
a
really
nice
scottish
ale
i
will
certainly
have
it
again
sometime
pours
a
really
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
exactly
how
i
want
and
expect
my
scotch
ale
to
look
smells
unremarkable
except
for
a
nice
peatalcohol
aroma
wafting
from
the
glass
more
organic
mattery
than
smokey
but
alluring
taste
is
strong
for
one
thing
really
robust
malt
profile
and
alcohol
backup
woody
and
slightly
fruity
rich
and
mellow
this
is
a
fine
ale
indeed
one
of
oskar
blues
best
mouthfeel
is
just
right
a
little
undercarbonated
and
thick
but
thats
all
okay
in
this
style
could
imagine
this
one
going
off
the
charts
after
a
few
months
in
a
bourbon
barrel
solid
solid
beer
but
a
tough
session
o
this
is
something
i
definitely
prefer
over
bourbon
aged
beers
i
know
they
are
not
the
same
thing
but
they
have
a
similar
feel
this
is
something
definitely
worth
trying
o
an
average
wee
heavy
not
anything
outstanding
mo
thick
full
bodied
and
sticky
sweet
no
real
alcohol
burn
despite
the
abv
very
low
bordering
on
too
low
carbonation
nevertheless
this
was
an
excellent
scotch
ale
and
hands
down
the
best
offering
to
date
i
have
had
from
oscar
blues
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
found
this
well
suited
as
nightcap
beer
and
a
good
change
up
from
apaipa
style
o
overall
this
is
a
great
affordable
and
complex
beer
definitely
my
favorite
scotch
ale
so
far
oi
love
this
beer
usually
packed
in
the
trunk
of
my
car
at
all
times
for
ski
season
this
beer
has
hops
is
smokey
chocolatey
biscuity
deliciousy
scotch
ales
are
about
the
booze
and
at
8
this
beer
sneaks
up
on
you
perfect
for
cool
winter
nights
or
hot
tubing
thanks
to
the
can
overall
this
is
better
than
i
expected
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
caramelly
malty
beers
but
this
one
hit
the
sweet
spot
o
not
a
bad
wee
heavy
but
i
dont
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
i
still
have
another
5
cans
in
the
fridge
and
i
dont
imagine
ill
be
powering
through
them
any
time
soon
this
comes
to
me
in
a
pint
glass
dark
reddish
brown
with
no
real
head
however
as
i
drink
this
and
create
room
im
able
swirl
a
head
in
and
generate
a
nice
brown
head
the
nose
is
pretty
excellent
rich
and
complex
with
toffee
some
chocolate
dark
caramel
and
a
faint
hop
character
this
is
excellent
especially
as
it
warms
up
the
malt
character
shines
the
yeast
isnt
particularly
expressive
here
this
is
all
about
the
malt
and
thats
what
the
palate
demonstrates
too
opening
full
in
body
with
a
soft
creamy
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
blend
of
light
smoke
dark
caramel
chocolate
and
toffee
the
milk
chocolate
in
particular
works
nicely
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
mildly
sweet
on
the
finish
but
with
enough
of
dark
caramel
bitterness
a
firming
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
burnt
sugar
as
well
this
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
as
such
a
better
beer
than
the
barrel
aged
version
overall
each
beer
from
a
nitro
tap
pushes
me
further
away
from
the
gimmick
though
before
i
give
up
completely
on
the
idea
i
may
give
that
new
nitro
saturated
left
hand
milk
stout
in
the
bottles
a
try
o
a
great
beer
and
amazing
example
of
what
this
style
can
be
i
love
the
different
flavors
and
complexity
of
the
malts
and
nose
o
holy
shit
a
scotch
ale
i
actually
like
every
other
one
ive
had
before
this
ccbs
big
sound
sam
adams
scotch
ale
to
name
a
couple
have
been
gross
and
nearly
undrinkable
i
could
definitely
see
myself
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
robust
dark
ale
that
reminds
me
of
barleywine
the
alcohol
content
can
sneak
up
on
you
after
a
few
not
such
a
bad
thing
there
is
essentially
no
head
to
this
beer
the
color
is
quite
dark
almost
black
with
some
red
tones
it
is
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
but
this
probably
makes
it
easier
to
drink
more
than
one
my
first
impression
of
this
beer
wasnt
a
good
one
however
that
was
on
a
hot
day
tailgating
this
is
not
a
beach
beer
i
have
come
to
appreciate
more
though
as
the
weather
has
cooled
it
is
the
perfect
camping
beer
i
assume
that
is
why
it
says
pack
it
in
pack
it
out
on
the
can
anyway
i
would
give
this
beer
a
b
overall
i
will
definitely
drink
it
again
served
12
oz
can
poured
into
a
thinwalled
hofbräuhaus
pint
glass
overall
a
real
enjoyable
ale
in
my
opinion
i
like
scotch
ales
and
this
one
is
great
and
i
love
the
can
packaging
pick
up
a
few
at
local
beer
store
poured
into
duvel
glass
pours
a
deep
brown
color
creamy
and
frothy
head
that
lingers
smells
a
bit
of
chocolate
very
smooth
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
that
has
close
to
9
abc
but
in
a
good
way
smooth
clean
finish
a
great
beer
malty
and
sweet
a
big
beer
that
doesnt
hide
it
not
gonna
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
o
delicious
and
very
drinkable
o
i
wasnt
overwhelmed
by
old
chubb
its
bitterness
is
pervasive
and
a
bit
heavy
its
a
pleasant
drink
but
not
the
best
in
class
o
highly
drinkable
overall
really
solid
brew
from
oskar
blues
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
vs
something
like
dirty
bastard
but
its
a
great
after
dinner
beer
tasty
stuff
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
but
the
style
is
a
little
on
dimensional
for
my
taste
o
deep
robust
smooth
clean
big
perfect
always
love
a
chub
o
good
very
good
especially
in
a
can
but
not
quite
as
good
as
it
could
be
kudos
to
oskar
pours
a
nice
deep
reddishbrown
small
head
sticks
around
light
alcohol
feet
smells
of
malt
and
dark
candied
fruit
taste
follows
nose
medium
body
very
lightly
creamy
mouthfeel
solid
brew
decent
price
and
love
the
can
would
not
seek
out
like
a
lost
treasure
but
would
definitely
buy
again
this
is
a
magnificent
colder
weather
beer
for
me
from
a
guy
who
loves
his
ipas
this
is
a
great
malty
change
of
pace
one
if
the
better
examples
of
the
style
to
me
less
purely
sweet
and
nicely
complex
o
a
strong
satisfying
ale
great
tasting
and
full
flavored
could
definitely
drink
on
one
or
two
of
these
especially
on
a
cold
evening
excellent
very
smooth
alcohol
low
and
huge
malty
flavors
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
scottish
beer
o
this
is
just
a
great
beer
i
was
introduced
to
this
in
college
and
have
suggested
it
to
so
many
people
looking
to
explore
the
craft
world
it
is
accessible
to
the
noncraft
drinker
due
to
its
sweetness
and
unpredictable
nature
yet
complex
enough
to
leave
anyone
to
their
senses
enjoyed
many
times
and
i
hope
that
it
will
be
available
for
years
to
come
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
smooth
and
a
bit
thin
with
low
carbonation
its
not
an
aggressive
ale
and
gets
much
better
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
leaves
a
lingering
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
this
is
the
least
sweet
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
i
find
it
very
strange
the
smell
was
earthy
and
metallic
the
taste
is
distinctly
not
sweet
for
a
scotch
ale
an
astringent
taste
of
hops
is
also
present
only
very
light
but
it
seems
the
bitterness
is
not
primarily
of
roasted
malts
or
so
it
seems
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
it
even
seems
somewhat
oily
the
lack
of
sweetness
is
so
striking
considering
how
cloying
most
examples
of
the
style
are
its
hard
for
me
to
decide
if
i
like
it
since
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
im
going
to
have
to
go
with
no
its
not
very
good
its
not
sweet
enough
i
want
my
scotch
ale
to
be
sweet
not
a
dry
maltiness
drink
like
many
sweet
and
malty
beers
its
very
drinkable
but
also
like
many
sweet
and
malty
beers
high
abv
makes
it
dangerous
enjoy
this
as
you
would
a
fine
single
malt
one
that
you
happen
to
have
a
full
glass
of
old
chub
is
a
dark
brown
color
thats
quite
appealing
but
nothing
special
it
has
a
toffee
like
smell
with
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
strong
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
that
you
can
feel
all
the
way
to
the
stomach
goes
fantastic
with
heavier
meals
such
as
a
burger
or
pork
chop
and
is
of
course
a
great
sipper
well
this
puts
the
scotch
in
scotch
ale
it
does
without
going
overboard
with
all
that
islay
wankery
sweet
aye
cloying
nae
the
wood
smoke
peat
and
booze
all
in
their
relatively
minute
amounts
contribute
to
the
balance
in
this
offering
and
weirdly
make
it
all
work
chubalicious
so
i
have
to
sip
no
big
deal
o
great
beer
that
would
go
well
with
a
rich
dinner
i
would
probably
tire
after
about
two
beers
which
is
probably
good
for
as
high
as
the
alcohol
content
is
would
easily
overwhelm
a
lighter
food
dish
that
would
accompany
it
this
beer
is
great
strait
from
the
can
it
has
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
kind
of
sticks
to
the
tongue
and
throat
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
the
smell
does
nothing
for
the
beer
it
is
very
light
made
me
not
expect
much
from
this
beer
but
then
it
hits
your
mouth
and
wow
that
malty
sweetness
is
very
balanced
with
slight
boozy
overtones
but
they
fit
the
flavor
profile
nicely
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
poured
from
a
can
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
thought
it
was
very
solid
overall
this
may
be
the
single
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
a
can
and
the
lovely
fruit
estersespecially
the
surprising
cherry
tonesthat
dance
on
the
tongue
are
delicious
and
left
me
craving
more
as
a
whole
the
beer
is
quite
well
balanced
and
the
flavors
finely
nuanced
and
delicately
pronounced
even
better
the
beer
did
not
weaken
with
subsequent
sips
maintaining
its
deliciousness
throughout
the
can
excellent
fare
and
highly
recommended
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
especially
with
the
amount
of
alcohol
scent
and
content
cheers
dark
brownish
red
with
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
but
i
noticed
malts
and
molasses
as
typical
in
the
style
hops
are
subtle
flavor
of
dark
roasted
malts
caramel
smoke
and
whiskeylike
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
an
effervescent
mouth
feel
it
finished
with
a
lingering
taste
of
sweet
smoky
malts
and
tobacco
o
very
simple
scotch
ale
with
lots
of
sweets
hold
onto
these
for
at
least
a
year
before
drinking
mouthfeel
beer
has
a
slickness
to
it
that
really
give
it
great
drinkability
for
a
malt
forward
beer
while
still
being
full
flavored
and
not
watery
great
drinking
even
from
the
can
o
a
really
strong
example
of
the
scotch
style
and
you
couldnt
ask
for
better
beer
from
a
can
mouthfeel
was
a
little
flat
i
think
a
little
more
head
would
have
added
to
the
mouthfeel
and
softened
the
sweet
aroma
there
wasnt
much
of
a
hoppy
taste
which
is
part
of
the
style
i
believe
overall
i
think
id
buy
this
again
great
scotch
ale
thats
insanely
drinkable
overall
quite
a
different
interpretation
of
the
scottish
ale
imo
complex
brew
that
surprised
me
a
bit
was
ok
but
not
grade
a
in
my
honest
opinion
its
dark
rough
and
extremely
malty
it
has
became
not
only
my
favorite
scotch
ale
but
my
favorite
beer
overall
drinkability
superb
a
new
fav
of
mine
i
could
have
this
a
few
more
times
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
clarity
of
the
beer
was
nice
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
earthy
a
little
smokey
and
kind
of
sweet
like
caramel
the
taste
was
just
about
the
same
there
was
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
in
this
brew
and
just
a
touch
of
some
earthy
spice
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
had
a
medium
body
to
it
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
scotch
ale
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
friends
how
havent
tried
it
before
really
nice
stuff
0
im
not
a
big
scottish
style
ale
drinker
but
this
one
could
be
addictive
good
buy
overall
this
is
a
fine
tasting
complex
beer
if
it
looked
better
with
more
of
a
quality
head
i
think
it
could
be
a
world
class
wee
heavy
its
extremely
good
though
and
highly
recommend
overall
very
nice
beer
just
like
dales
pale
ale
the
earth
tones
of
old
chub
are
overwhelming
this
is
one
awesome
beer
o
this
beer
goes
perfectly
while
sipping
rye
or
a
highland
scotch
this
is
a
killians
for
a
beer
geek
o
very
good
for
style
and
one
of
the
very
few
choices
of
this
style
available
in
a
can
the
wee
bit
of
extra
hops
in
the
mix
was
appreciated
surprise
went
well
with
a
sweet
pastry
o
a
decent
example
of
the
style
i
must
admit
this
is
the
first
time
pouring
this
beer
out
and
i
have
to
say
i
actually
prefer
it
much
more
drank
straight
from
the
can
not
sure
what
that
says
about
the
beer
o
really
nice
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
with
a
great
taste
and
mouthfeel
winner
here
all
the
way
nice
notes
a
little
too
estery
for
my
taste
the
fruitiness
is
a
bit
too
forward
i
would
like
it
better
if
the
malt
tastes
had
a
chance
to
operate
without
the
fruity
distractions
the
smoked
malt
tastes
also
take
on
more
of
that
rauchbier
campfire
character
rather
than
that
peaty
smokiness
i
look
for
in
the
style
a
solid
brew
but
not
the
best
out
there
o
o
i
really
like
this
beer
one
of
favorite
wee
heavys
to
date
for
sure
appropriately
robust
malty
nose
full
of
toffee
caramel
and
sweet
chocolate
a
hint
of
smoke
so
small
that
it
goes
undetected
until
it
warms
for
a
bit
thickish
sticky
body
with
leafy
earthy
hops
and
a
touch
of
tobacco
cutting
through
the
sweetness
smoke
is
still
nothing
but
a
hint
a
dash
more
would
really
take
this
to
the
next
level
still
quite
tasty
with
enough
carbonation
and
bitterness
to
keep
things
moving
along
pretty
well
a
few
tweaks
away
from
the
next
level
but
an
easy
recommendation
one
of
the
first
canned
craft
beers
ive
had
and
it
was
great
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
has
all
of
the
makings
of
a
great
scotch
ale
but
does
not
break
through
in
the
individual
components
i
also
think
this
is
what
makes
it
more
sessionable
to
me
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
it
certainly
held
up
to
the
other
high
quality
offerings
from
oskar
blues
it
even
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
dogfish
head
raison
detre
but
without
the
alcohol
burn
i
cant
wait
to
have
one
after
ageing
for
a
year
or
two
this
is
not
the
most
amazing
wee
heavy
ever
in
fact
the
issue
for
me
is
that
it
is
more
akin
to
a
doppelbock
than
a
wee
heavy
with
all
the
bready
melanoidins
going
on
the
peat
is
a
nice
touch
but
it
doesnt
all
come
together
for
me
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
caramel
ruby
color
off
whitetan
head
the
head
stuck
around
for
the
entire
duration
of
the
beer
which
was
an
added
bonus
smell
was
very
malty
and
sweet
sugary
taste
was
beautiful
malt
bomb
here
candy
booze
fruits
some
grainy
aspects
awesome
beer
such
a
treat
overall
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
beer
had
a
really
great
balance
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
do
first
oskar
blues
reviewed
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
tad
underwhelmed
one
of
my
newerfound
favorite
styles
this
one
falls
into
the
second
tier
thanks
for
the
go
mammothbrew
d
relatively
inexpensive
at
my
favorite
store
for
under
2
per
can
in
a
mix
and
match
6er
this
is
a
great
friday
night
beer
to
go
along
with
a
burger
o
really
good
it
has
a
lot
of
flavors
its
a
sipping
brew
though
o
not
really
my
style
however
it
has
an
interesting
flavor
so
worth
a
try
overall
good
beer
but
at
the
price
i
will
pursue
others
this
is
another
scotch
ale
i
enjoy
and
yet
another
oskar
blues
beer
that
impresses
fuller
medium
body
higher
carbonation
slightly
prickly
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
i
usually
like
oskar
blues
but
this
seemed
a
bit
strange
to
me
although
the
alcohol
was
masked
well
for
the
style
a
satisfying
wee
heavy
though
i
would
give
the
edge
to
skullsplitter
or
old
dirty
bastard
d
this
beer
concludes
my
craftinacan
series
for
now
i
really
liked
this
beer
nicely
balanced
yet
very
complex
flavors
lie
underneath
i
will
surely
revisit
this
one
in
the
near
future
very
rich
and
full
flavored
they
do
a
good
job
of
making
it
taste
older
than
it
is
stale
but
very
full
if
that
makes
any
sense
a
great
beer
to
sip
slow
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
auburn
tones
under
light
and
thin
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
molasses
and
licorice
the
flavor
begins
with
dark
chocolate
followed
by
anise
and
molasses
with
a
bit
of
brandy
in
the
finish
strange
it
has
a
full
mouthfeel
with
some
alcohol
warmth
oskar
blues
old
chubwhile
a
good
example
of
the
style
is
a
soso
beer
not
recommended
dr
amazing
for
a
canned
beer
well
priced
high
abv
and
great
quality
worth
a
try
for
any
beer
advocate
pours
a
dark
amber
with
slight
head
and
no
lacing
dark
malt
with
caramel
overtones
little
hops
lots
of
roasted
malt
slight
sweetness
and
very
smooth
drinks
really
smooth
for
an
8
beer
very
good
and
great
change
of
pace
from
the
more
common
ales
pours
a
very
dark
red
smells
of
big
sweet
malt
flavor
plus
loads
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
loads
of
malt
i
catch
a
ton
of
vanilla
and
some
caramel
as
well
caramel
was
bigger
on
the
nose
than
in
the
taste
loving
this
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
slightly
carbonated
this
is
the
first
scottish
ale
i
have
enjoyed
im
usually
not
huge
on
the
style
but
this
is
nice
looking
forward
to
my
next
trip
to
ohio
to
stock
up
on
oskar
blues
beers
overall
a
sold
dark
beer
it
definitely
embodies
a
scotch
ale
best
part
was
the
smell
first
oskar
blue
beer
ive
had
o
great
malt
character
and
surprising
drinkability
overalla
great
change
of
pace
to
be
sure
rich
but
easy
to
drink
this
pretty
much
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
at
least
once
in
a
while
o
kickass
goto
canned
beer
overall
this
was
pretty
damn
good
i
love
the
feel
o
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
recommended
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
my
second
oskar
blues
beer
and
like
their
lineup
so
far
will
be
revisiting
this
time
time
again
definitely
a
standout
wee
heavy
o
reminds
me
of
my
own
scotch
ale
yummy
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
but
a
really
solid
one
goes
down
way
too
easily
very
smooth
for
an
8
abv
would
drink
this
again
no
problem
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
but
could
use
a
little
more
umph
in
the
flavor
department
still
overall
a
very
very
good
beer
o
first
scotch
ale
and
it
is
a
good
one
i
have
been
waiting
for
a
while
to
try
this
for
the
price
it
cant
be
beat
o
not
blown
out
of
the
water
but
a
nice
beer
id
get
it
again
this
was
a
lot
less
bold
and
complex
than
i
expected
and
wanted
however
it
was
pretty
darned
drinkable
and
i
wont
mind
drinking
one
again
d
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
both
for
the
style
and
in
general
it
proves
that
canned
beers
can
be
awesome
and
was
reasonably
priced
i
bought
the
single
can
for
a
buck
fifty
i
see
myself
buying
this
again
for
sure
and
it
seems
like
it
would
go
well
with
lots
of
meats
and
desserts
or
as
a
nice
sipper
alone
this
is
a
solid
beer
offering
in
a
can
and
again
another
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
here
in
ohio
not
my
favorite
but
it
just
might
not
be
my
preference
as
it
gets
good
ratings
by
everyone
else
i
guess
i
prefer
beers
with
a
little
more
hop
character
the
color
is
dark
brown
pretty
good
amber
head
which
nice
retention
the
smell
is
malty
caramel
not
very
strong
but
good
this
is
the
5th
of
the
6
pack
ive
tried
this
week
and
each
one
taste
better
i
guess
i
know
what
to
expect
now
no
real
bitterness
which
i
usually
prefer
there
is
a
malty
sweet
flavor
the
higher
abv
is
almost
completely
hidden
the
mouth
feel
is
good
medium
thickness
overall
a
good
beer
which
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
normally
this
malty
of
a
beer
is
a
turn
off
for
me
im
much
more
in
love
with
their
canned
stouts
though
6
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
would
defiantly
buy
in
the
future
i
would
like
to
thank
my
buddy
for
leaving
this
over
in
the
fridge
and
not
taking
it
home
i
would
have
a
hard
time
leaving
this
beer
somewhere
i
am
putting
this
on
the
homebrew
list
in
the
near
future
do
this
beer
is
simplistic
for
a
scottish
ale
or
wee
heavy
but
clean
likely
able
to
pass
for
an
average
doppelbock
it
would
benefit
from
an
additional
layer
of
earthiness
wood
or
fruitvegetable
complexity
to
add
interest
and
make
it
more
alelike
o
overall
very
good
an
accessible
yet
complex
scotch
ale
drinkable
tasty
and
filling
not
a
session
beer
goes
down
real
heavy
i
bought
this
beer
to
drink
on
a
somewhat
hot
summer
weekend
for
tailgaiting
purposes
and
it
really
was
just
too
strong
i
feel
like
i
made
the
wrong
choice
for
what
i
wanted
it
for
a
really
strong
taste
up
front
which
is
not
a
good
idea
on
hot
summer
days
the
abv
feels
and
tastes
more
than
8
00
ive
had
other
beers
that
are
a
higher
abv
that
are
much
more
drinkable
o
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
scotch
ales
for
sure
highway
78
comes
to
mind
very
drinkable
even
though
it
is
kind
of
sweet
goes
down
easy
and
not
boozy
at
all
o
overall
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
scotch
ale
i
dont
think
its
the
best
out
there
but
its
certainly
worthy
and
im
glad
i
found
a
six
pack
o
the
creamyness
of
this
brew
is
really
nice
pretty
good
taste
too
if
i
was
more
of
a
dark
ale
guy
this
is
a
really
nice
go
to
definitly
a
good
option
if
im
with
someone
who
prefers
scotchstout
brews
overall
i
still
remember
why
i
come
back
to
this
beer
its
just
a
simple
solid
easy
drinking
version
of
this
style
to
me
hv
nice
american
take
on
a
scotch
ale
enjoyable
but
also
rather
pricey
overall
a
flavorful
and
tasty
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
its
not
bad
but
seems
to
be
a
one
trick
pony
just
a
big
blast
of
caramel
malts
and
not
much
else
definitely
worth
a
try
highly
recommended
overall
a
wonderful
beer
another
great
one
from
oscar
blues
if
you
like
scotch
ales
i
think
youll
like
this
one
o
pretty
good
up
near
the
top
for
me
so
far
in
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
not
overly
complex
but
well
done
on
the
filling
side
a
definite
slow
sipper
this
pours
very
dark
brown
with
heavy
tan
head
and
little
lacingretention
i
smell
a
lot
of
malt
sugar
and
booze
the
taste
is
toasty
and
sweet
but
not
overpowering
i
am
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
i
was
expecting
more
chewspit
but
this
is
actually
rather
medium
and
drinkable
this
has
a
mild
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
that
adds
to
the
complexity
this
isnt
a
style
that
i
love
but
this
beer
is
a
solid
representation
for
sure
fairly
light
mouthfeel
that
is
very
drinkable
and
has
nearly
no
notice
of
the
alcohol
very
good
offering
o
this
goes
down
easily
but
unfortunately
does
not
have
the
scotch
flavors
ive
come
to
expect
in
wee
heavies
overall
drinkability
great
beer
strong
characters
with
great
balance
and
no
off
flavors
really
makes
this
beer
shine
nothing
overpowering
even
though
there
is
plenty
of
strong
malt
hop
and
alcohol
characters
two
inch
pillowy
off
white
head
from
an
aggresive
pour
cocacola
hue
with
just
a
touch
of
redness
and
a
faint
amount
of
small
fine
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
when
held
up
to
light
the
smell
is
supry
malt
sweetness
with
just
a
touch
of
hopschocolate
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
soy
sauce
some
sweet
bananna
at
termination
claerly
malt
forward
the
taste
is
similiar
heavy
bodied
mouthfeel
with
loads
of
malt
some
hops
soysauce
and
chocolate
at
the
finish
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
wo
alcohol
not
well
masked
would
purchase
again
at
this
time
o
a
nice
scotch
ale
tasty
maltyhops
it
was
good
overallgreat
first
impression
from
a
scotch
ale
heavy
malts
and
nice
sweetness
could
sip
on
a
6
pack
of
these
on
a
sunday
while
watching
sports
very
often
kind
of
like
a
good
brown
ale
with
smoke
added
with
pretty
much
no
hops
at
all
hard
to
believe
how
smooth
this
one
is
for
its
abv
scotch
ales
havent
always
been
my
favorite
but
this
is
very
very
good
overall
a
pretty
regular
scotch
ale
but
i
found
some
unique
flavors
in
this
one
it
was
also
pretty
intense
flavor
wise
finish
smooth
clean
and
sweet
extremely
drinkable
its
everything
a
scotch
ale
should
be
o
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
ive
been
weary
of
it
for
a
few
years
as
i
had
it
back
a
few
years
and
it
was
not
my
ticket
but
this
is
really
good
oh
how
the
palate
changes
i
suspect
many
overrate
this
because
it
is
in
a
can
and
you
cant
help
but
be
surprised
by
the
quality
coming
in
a
can
but
put
it
in
a
bottle
and
you
have
a
good
example
that
doesnt
exceed
expectations
o
not
a
big
fan
the
nose
is
pretty
simple
and
its
very
hard
to
pick
out
anything
of
note
and
the
taste
is
very
lackluster
and
one
dimensional
i
hope
all
scotch
ales
arent
like
this
o
when
i
had
this
cans
other
3
bros
i
remember
it
having
carbonation
hops
that
were
present
and
now
the
this
beer
has
evolved
quite
nicely
which
happened
on
accident
i
would
only
drink
this
again
if
it
were
1
year
or
older
my
preference
from
experience
nice
surprise
absolute
malt
grenade
and
the
color
of
the
head
is
my
favorite
amongst
any
nice
little
beer
when
your
in
the
mood
for
a
malt
bomb
i
prefer
this
type
of
beer
in
the
depths
of
winter
my
timing
is
clearly
off
but
i
wont
blame
the
beer
for
that
nice
representation
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
definitely
too
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
i
might
could
drink
two
in
a
sitting
but
that
would
be
difficult
the
flavors
are
complex
and
balanced
but
overall
the
sweetness
dominates
final
thought
oskar
blues
you
have
done
it
again
thank
you
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
earthiness
and
musk
of
tea
which
became
even
more
apparent
in
the
mild
astringency
of
the
mouthfeel
this
was
a
lighter
end
beer
but
it
had
all
of
the
nice
flavoring
of
a
scotch
ale
while
it
was
at
times
almost
too
light
it
retained
enough
flavor
and
kick
giving
a
tasty
and
unique
brew
oskar
blues
with
another
really
good
beer
this
scottish
ale
is
quite
sweet
there
is
a
malt
used
to
obtain
this
sweetness
and
i
dont
like
it
per
se
in
a
scottish
ale
i
would
like
to
taste
more
roast
and
earthy
tones
the
color
of
this
beer
was
quite
nice
dark
amber
with
thin
white
head
there
was
nothing
really
to
smell
the
taste
was
very
sweet
the
malt
used
was
loaded
with
molassis
or
brown
sugar
or
caramel
i
would
compare
this
to
the
malzbeer
served
in
brazil
mouthfeel
is
fine
just
to
sweet
for
me
o
a
true
meal
in
a
glass
like
a
loaf
of
cinnamon
toast
rich
and
satisfying
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
earth
and
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
taste
caramel
a
light
roast
and
a
small
presence
of
earthiness
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
caramel
like
aftertaste
hides
the
8
well
and
a
nice
small
earthiness
overall
fairly
good
scotch
ail
and
neat
that
it
is
in
cans
d
definitely
sweet
but
was
hoping
for
something
more
in
this
one
got
some
of
that
smoke
in
the
nose
but
not
on
the
palate
which
was
kind
of
a
let
down
if
the
abv
were
a
bit
lower
i
may
have
expected
less
complexity
but
thats
not
the
case
1327
d
im
not
the
type
to
take
alcohol
on
a
backpacking
trip
but
id
certainly
entertain
the
idea
of
keeping
a
cooler
nearby
for
these
on
a
car
camping
trip
this
would
be
great
with
smoked
meat
or
seafood
amber
with
golden
highlights
lots
of
lacing
this
brew
smells
fantastic
caramelized
malt
subtle
hops
the
flavor
has
sucha
nice
bite
and
balanced
complexity
between
the
malt
and
hops
alcohol
apparent
but
that
just
adds
to
the
effect
this
is
an
awesome
brew
i
applaud
the
use
of
the
can
which
protects
freshness
better
than
bottles
cant
wait
to
try
other
oskar
blues
offerings
d
old
chub
is
one
heckuva
canned
beer
while
dales
pale
will
be
my
favorite
from
oskar
blues
this
will
always
be
another
one
i
go
to
very
delicious
brew
o
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
at
only
8
and
change
for
a
sixer
its
a
good
deal
and
introduction
to
the
style
o
very
solid
beer
well
put
together
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
this
category
this
beer
pours
a
stained
mahogany
in
color
looking
like
a
coke
or
pepsi
with
no
head
it
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
thats
about
it
the
flavor
is
solid
very
sweet
and
of
caramel
molasses
brown
sugar
its
just
not
my
thing
it
is
extremely
smooth
pouring
from
the
can
its
velvety
soft
and
medium
in
body
this
is
a
solid
scottish
ale
in
my
opinion
but
there
isnt
anything
to
set
this
one
apart
fans
of
the
style
should
like
it
overall
a
good
beer
but
if
im
going
camping
backpacking
with
beer
id
prefer
dales
pale
ale
this
one
is
just
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
taste
od
cant
believe
this
is
8
abv
it
does
not
taste
like
it
theres
no
real
alcohol
presence
i
was
rather
disappointed
in
this
brew
from
a
taste
factor
but
its
a
great
looking
beer
maybe
its
better
out
of
the
first
beer
of
the
night
last
night
at
the
yard
house
dedham
as
my
premeal
drink
to
start
the
night
off
served
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
fluffy
white
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
smell
was
peaty
and
smoky
which
is
something
that
i
am
really
into
right
now
taste
was
also
a
winner
tons
of
malt
so
it
had
a
sweet
side
to
it
but
the
smokiness
gave
it
a
dark
side
and
both
sides
seemed
to
compliment
each
other
nicely
mouthfeel
was
thick
but
smooth
the
abv
was
present
but
was
appropriate
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
its
a
shame
that
its
taken
me
this
long
to
have
one
will
have
it
again
for
sure
poured
from
the
green
can
into
my
duvel
tulip
light
brown
color
and
nice
roasty
toasty
aroma
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
touch
of
hops
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
smoky
flavors
mentioned
in
the
literature
all
in
all
this
was
a
basic
scotch
ale
couldnt
tell
it
was
canned
cool
would
try
again
d
pleasantly
surprised
overall
with
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
i
actually
had
4
i
will
seek
out
the
cans
to
see
if
they
are
just
as
good
as
from
the
tap
a
fantastic
beer
especially
if
you
love
malt
do
no
alc
a
very
smooth
scotch
ale
really
solid
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
12oz
can
bought
at
mckinnons
in
salem
pours
a
crystalclear
copperbrown
body
with
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
toffee
caramel
chocolate
nut
smoke
all
waft
from
the
beer
toffee
caramel
nut
bread
hints
of
smoke
and
chocolate
in
the
flavor
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
full
carbonation
wow
id
definitely
call
this
more
of
a
scottish
ale
despite
the
claim
that
it
was
a
scotch
ale
on
the
label
but
i
dont
mind
as
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
lots
going
on
all
working
in
harmony
to
make
this
a
glass
full
of
awesome
winning
jd
pours
a
dark
dark
caramel
brown
holding
the
glass
up
to
the
light
you
can
see
small
pieces
floating
around
in
the
beer
almost
no
head
with
the
pour
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
snifter
while
swirling
the
smell
is
average
i
smell
a
hint
of
caramel
bread
and
malts
the
taste
is
good
taste
of
malts
and
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
not
much
carbonation
present
and
very
thin
this
seems
like
a
good
gateway
beer
into
the
wee
heavy
style
overall
a
good
wee
heavy
and
look
forward
to
drinking
more
in
the
future
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
ample
carbonation
drinks
fairly
good
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
im
sure
i
will
come
across
this
can
again
but
its
not
something
i
would
buy
o
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
i
have
tasted
very
easy
to
drink
on
a
snowy
early
spring
day
decent
but
get
the
oaked
and
you
will
be
allot
happier
this
brew
pours
a
stunning
ruby
red
color
with
lots
of
depth
creamy
offwhite
head
laced
pretty
well
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
has
a
underlining
woody
smell
that
pairs
with
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
palate
is
rich
and
complex
butterscotch
smokey
oak
and
earthy
hops
the
8
is
felt
but
not
at
a
overbearing
level
mouthfeel
is
full
and
silky
great
take
on
the
style
i
guess
this
could
be
described
as
the
limburger
of
beers
in
my
opinion
smell
is
like
sour
milk
but
if
you
can
get
past
that
it
has
a
complicated
caramel
malty
flavor
that
finishes
like
sugar
has
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
whiteish
head
its
pretty
smooth
not
overwelmingly
boozey
i
dont
see
much
besides
the
smell
hurting
drinkability
and
if
you
can
get
past
it
its
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
this
isnt
a
beer
i
need
a
6
pack
of
but
it
is
a
beer
i
can
have
one
or
two
of
and
very
much
enjoy
id
certainly
drink
this
again
possibly
pick
up
a
sixer
if
i
see
it
nice
little
taste
and
a
good
kick
of
booze
as
well
a
full
rich
tasting
beer
im
not
big
on
scottish
ales
but
this
one
went
nicely
with
my
meal
and
would
likely
go
very
nice
by
itself
another
complex
beer
from
oskars
that
i
will
have
to
focus
on
before
i
can
give
this
beer
justice
with
a
decent
review
until
then
pick
one
up
for
yourself
pours
a
murky
amberbrown
colour
with
thick
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
not
too
much
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
caramel
with
some
earthy
hops
flavour
is
quite
sweet
upfront
with
a
hint
a
smoke
towards
the
aftertaste
thick
mouthfeel
almost
smooth
this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
i
dont
know
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
d
old
chub
is
a
very
sip
worthy
beer
that
tastes
better
in
a
glass
rather
than
in
the
can
it
does
have
high
abv
that
could
make
one
regret
drinking
too
many
at
once
pours
a
hazy
dark
brownred
thick
tan
head
forms
tons
of
lacing
nice
retention
really
looks
nice
smell
is
wicked
sweet
very
malty
chocolate
and
toffee
some
roast
dark
fruits
some
dates
really
pleasant
taste
is
similar
very
sweet
and
malty
dark
fruits
heavy
toffee
nice
roast
cherries
balanced
and
not
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
nice
heavy
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
very
nice
beer

drink
355

very
dark

head
sweetish
aroma
of
brown
malts
and
caramel
very
sweet
and
malty
flavour
notes
of
caramel
chocolate
and
some
smoke
should
be
drunk
fairly
cool
else
the
sweetness
will
feel
cloying
d
great
balance
and
complexity
definitely
could
see
myself
going
through
a
sixer
real
quick
drink
one
step
behind
ten
fidy
as
my
favorite
oskar
blues
offering
its
slightly
creamy
balanced
and
deceptively
smooth
this
isnt
a
beer
that
could
probably
be
consumed
quickly
but
it
is
a
beer
that
could
be
sipped
through
out
an
entire
evening
an
excellent
after
dinner
beer
havent
had
this
since
they
moved
locations
still
that
same
delicious
scotch
ale
glad
i
revisited
may
have
to
do
so
more
often
prost
the
roasts
are
a
bit
much
on
the
palate
but
its
one
of
the
best
wees
ive
had
outside
of
one
brewed
in
scotland
nice
job
mmedium
to
full
body
minimal
amount
of
carbonation
leaves
a
nice
coating
in
the
mouth
very
smooth
d
not
the
easiest
drinking
beer
big
in
the
flavor
dept
but
at
the
cost
of
having
another
3
0
the
cpj
o
coined
as
a
session
beer
especially
due
to
canning
but
the
body
is
a
little
heavy
for
the
whole
sixer
another
great
example
of
why
im
so
addicted
to
this
style
d
i
usually
shy
away
from
this
style
preferring
the
less
sweet
ales
but
oskar
has
balanced
the
sweetness
with
a
malty
alchohol
flavor
nicely
d
not
really
one
is
good
per
sitting
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
its
going
to
be
around
for
awhile
its
more
of
a
sit
back
and
have
a
high
alcohol
beer
every
once
in
a
while
that
is
mediocre
probably
wont
get
around
to
drinking
another
of
these
until
all
my
palo
santo
is
gone
but
ill
prolly
be
buying
more
of
that
soon
on
tap
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
no
lacing
aromas
of
malt
caramel
and
alcohol
flavors
of
malt
booze
some
caramel
and
hints
of
smoke
a
mix
of
flavors
here
for
sure
sweet
and
creamy
warming
alcohol
taste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
overall
its
a
solid
brew
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
toes
the
line
of
being
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
d
the
drinkability
is
good
here
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
i
think
there
are
definitely
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
overall
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
and
id
get
it
again
overall
a
decent
ale
but
nothing
special
id
certainly
look
to
it
again
oscar
blues
scotch
ale
is
bunker
material
overall
a
great
example
of
a
scotch
ale
and
one
that
ill
surely
have
again
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
in
body
and
creamy
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
a
nice
maltycaramel
flavored
ale
d
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
this
dark
i
had
4
in
one
sitting
im
certainly
want
another
one
it
tastes
good
feels
good
and
i
want
to
crack
open
another
one
were
in
good
shape
d
i
could
easy
polish
a
six
pack
of
this
while
playing
poker
with
friends
or
even
playing
horseshoes
o
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
brew
that
exhibits
complexity
and
depth
its
richness
is
ideal
to
quaff
on
cold
winter
nights
or
days
and
its
big
booziness
is
bold
enough
to
ignite
the
furnace
of
your
soul
overall
a
good
beer
its
not
the
best
scottish
ale
ive
had
but
its
quit
good
especially
from
a
can
md
mediumheavy
body
with
a
definite
syrup
like
texture
very
low
volumes
of
carbonation
allow
an
increase
in
body
very
smooth
on
the
palate
as
well
alcohol
is
semihidden
thanks
in
part
to
the
overall
sweetness
of
the
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
easy
drinker
other
than
the
headache
overall
a
very
tasty
scottish
ale
with
lots
of
nice
malty
flavor
and
just
a
touch
sweetness
at
the
end
610
after
a
number
of
excellent
experiences
with
oskar
blues
this
beer
is
a
big
swing
and
a
miss
for
me
its
just
a
little
too
dull
and
boring
to
drink
again
this
is
my
first
oskar
blues
offering
and
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
them
drinkability
this
was
a
quite
satisfying
tasty
beer
that
went
well
with
the
spicy
food
i
was
eating
ill
remember
it
and
in
the
right
circumstances
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
order
it
again
this
beer
poured
great
and
it
was
very
easy
to
manipulate
the
head
smelled
great
and
sweet
malty
and
slightly
floral
tasted
very
much
like
the
other
scotch
ale
ive
had
founders
dirty
bastard
but
it
didnt
quite
have
the
big
flavor
profile
that
the
founders
had
the
style
was
spot
on
i
just
would
have
preferred
to
have
the
flavor
knob
turned
up
not
sure
what
it
was
about
this
one
but
i
had
trouble
finishing
it
off
and
thats
uncommon
for
me
theres
nothing
i
can
really
pick
out
that
i
disliked
aside
from
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
somehow
all
of
the
components
just
failed
to
mesh
im
not
going
to
get
into
too
much
detail
with
this
one
because
i
drank
it
all
day
during
the
nfl
division
championship
round
of
games
last
weekend
green
bay
beat
chicago
and
pitt
beat
the
jets
and
all
i
remember
is
that
i
fing
loved
it
in
a
can
but
still
drinks
expensive
rich
but
still
drinkable
all
day
so
i
definitely
plan
on
finding
some
more
to
always
have
around
the
house
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
it
isnt
too
heavy
or
too
sweet
its
just
great
md
i
havent
tried
too
many
scotch
ales
but
of
those
i
have
tried
this
one
has
by
far
the
best
body
similar
to
an
oatmeal
stout
to
me
and
mouthfeel
i
could
put
away
more
than
a
couple
of
these
away
in
one
sitting
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
i
will
always
support
a
micro
brew
brave
enough
to
stick
their
beer
in
cans
cans
are
a
hard
sell
for
the
uninformed
and
there
are
many
out
there
it
seams
after
reading
through
my
review
that
all
i
can
say
is
this
beer
is
sweet
i
kind
of
feel
like
the
guys
in
the
movie
dude
wheres
my
car
well
not
to
string
this
out
any
further
i
recommend
you
pick
up
a
sixocans
and
drink
down
this
nectar
my
local
beer
stores
are
selling
this
for
9
99
i
hope
you
get
as
good
a
deal
d
id
certainly
not
turn
down
more
of
these
but
to
my
mind
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
both
domestic
and
of
course
from
scotland
itself
m
d
a
viscous
medium
body
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
feel
like
the
belhaven
wee
heavy
which
is
certainly
a
compliment
poured
into
13
oz
tulip
very
attractive
rusty
red
with
a
nice
two
inch
white
and
sticky
head
very
nice
lacing
that
hangs
around
the
whole
time
a
malt
powered
smell
of
burnt
sugars
and
hints
of
plum
solid
taste
more
powerful
then
the
nose
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
thickest
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
hada
wonderful
winter
warmer
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
great
one
in
done
beer
that
would
be
perfect
after
snow
blowing
the
driveway
pours
from
the

beautiful

roasted
nuts
light
peat
smoke
and

tan
head
caramel
slight
smoke
peat
and
some
spice
fill
out
the
nose
medium
mouthfeel
caramel
smokiness
comes
to
mind
first
as
i
take
my
first
sip
i
havent
had
a
whole
lot
of
scotch
ales
so
my
experience
is
rather
minimal
with
this
style
but
it
is
fairly
easy
drinking
and
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
its
fairly
rich
and
the
flavor
really
comes
alive
as
it
warms
it
starts
with
an
almost
caramel
apple
start
with
some
smoke
that
then
transitions
to
a
lingering
bitterness
the
8
really
isnt
that
noticeable
minimal
lace
a
fullbodied
enjoyable
beer
d
very
drinkable
for
a
scotch
ale
definitely
will
enjoy
this
one
again
oskar
blues
old
chub
has
a
nice
dark
brown
colour
and
a
good
3
mm
head
that
fades
to
excellent
lacing
over
the
entire
upper
surface
of
my
pint
glass
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
some
sweet
caramel
overtones
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
hop
balance
up
friont
the
maltiness
is
the
dominant
flavour
though
with
some
sweet
toffee
too
the
finish
is
like
sweet
bitter
coffee
after
drinking
it
for
awhile
the
bitter
and
smokey
aftertaste
built
to
be
unpleasant
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
it
reminds
me
of
founders
dirty
bastard
except
for
the
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
from
the
scotch
ales
that
i
have
had
this
was
nothing
special
for
the
style
in
general
it
seemed
like
a
safety
attempt
at
this
style
they
could
have
done
more
with
the
body
and
definitely
a
bit
more
carbonation
if
i
were
captain
cookman
and
had
people
over
to
eat
bbq
or
something
id
get
another
6pack
of
this
to
pair
with
dinner
sometime
or
id
recommend
it
to
someone
else
who
is
both
captain
bbq
and
fond
of
hosting
people
unfortunately
im
private
hermit
so
i
will
likely
never
buy
this
beer
again
d
yes
its
drinkable
cheers
good
drinkability
just
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
lighter
than
other
scotch
ales
which
make
it
easier
to
throw
a
few
back
drinkability
was
good
as
this
bordered
on
being
too
sweet
but
did
not
cross
the
line
into
gross
sweetness
overkill
went
down
relatively
easy
considering
it
was
8
abv
and
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
d
good
d
oversweetness
prohibits
this
one
from
being
extremely
drinkable
but
i
never
got
sick
of
it
throughout
the
one
glass
that
i
had
still
would
not
opt
for
another
in
the
same
night
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
yellowish
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
tons
of
malts
tastes
of
tons
of
malts
a
malt
overload
and
some
toffee
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
beer
from
a
can
is
something
i
usually
avoid
unless
im
fishing
or
camping
but
this
beer
is
a
keeper
if
i
could
find
it
more
easily
i
would
keep
this
beer
around
all
the
time
a
definite
must
try
d
im
notoriously
not
a
fan
of
this
style
because
many
ive
tried
has
sort
of
a
dog
foodlike
aftertaste
that
i
usually
find
unpleasant
old
chub
had
none
of
those
things
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
pure
maltcandy
delight
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
scotch
ale
thanx
goes
to
d
kurtz
again
nice
surprise
i
heard
a
lot
of
good
about
oscar
blues
now
i
need
to
try
the
rest
notes
maybe
within
the
style
this
would
deserve
a
higher
mark
pretty
good
malty
offering
in
any
case
from
oskar
blues
drinkability
i
love
me
a
good
american
scotch
ale
a
good
smoked
beer
and
beer
from
a
can
this
one
combines
all
the
great
elements
ive
come
to
love
about
beer
the
beechwood
comes
through
beautifully
in
the
glass
on
this
one
and
the
big
malt
backbone
is
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
which
makes
this
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
the
8
0
abv
is
well
hidden
here
so
be
careful
with
this
one
an
excellent
beer
all
around
and
one
that
should
be
tried
by
all
maybe
its
the
style
but
this
isnt
a
beer
ill
be
revisiting
anytime
soon
it
just
seems
completely
lacking
umph
and
balance
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
the
nose
sweet
big
cloyingly
sweet
flavors
clash
with
each
other
there
is
some
caramel
chocolate
brown
sugar
toffee
and
just
a
hint
of
smoke
this
beer
has
the
potential
to
be
complex
and
flavorful
but
the
overwhelming
sweetness
seems
to
steal
the
show
mediumfull
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
almost
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
glass
this
beer
has
almost
no
carbonation
at
all
a
pleasantly
sweet
aftertaste
is
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
down
i
could
drink
these
endlessly
pours
a
deep
mahagony
color
with
a
creamy
white
one
finger
head
smells
sweet
and
carmelized
some
licorice
toffee
tastes
very
sweet
toffee
caramel
some
earthiness
the
lingering
creamy
caramel
is
the
best
part
low
carbing
highly
drinkable
very
smooth
i
pick
this
up
again
a
bargain
at
2
10
for
a
single
its
a
bit
strong
and
heavy
one
is
enough
i
love
scotch
ale
and
this
as
of
12272010
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
pours
a
great
very
dark
color
with
hues
of
amber
bleeding
threw
the
aroma
is
very
weak
but
is
a
lovely
fragrance
sweet
malt
power
threw
this
hint
of
aroma
taste
is
excellent
the
sweet
malt
and
main
charectoristics
of
scotch
style
ale
power
threw
the
alcohol
is
perfectly
hidden
but
not
to
much
this
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
when
i
can
afford
it
price
is
running
a
bit
high
on
oskar
blue
brews
in
my
area
as
of
late
and
has
halted
my
purchasing
of
them
for
a
bit
cheers
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
going
down
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
this
beer
has
nice
flavor
and
balance
for
the
style
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
it
struck
me
as
rather
similar
to
the
chocolate
bock
that
sam
adams
puts
out
but
inferior
to
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
amazing
one
of
those
beers
everyone
says
you
have
to
try
maybe
that
led
to
the
let
down
working
my
way
through
this
six
pack
d
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
a
light
orange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramrl
and
slight
bitter
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramal
chocolate
and
a
slight
hop
followthrough
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
i
can
say
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
out
of
the
can
or
ontap
now
excellent
flavor
going
on
here
without
a
doubt
with
a
good
aroma
to
followthrough
on
the
flavor
im
glad
that
ob
is
back
in
sc
again
to
stay
this
one
is
a
must
try
if
you
have
been
under
a
rock
for
quite
awhile
d
nicely
drinkable
scottish
ale
there
are
more
complex
beers
out
there
but
this
is
just
nice
this
is
a
very
good
american
version
of
a
wee
heavy
saddled
up
to
a
roarin
fire
and
kicked
back
a
few
for
the
late
nfl
games
lots
o
good
stuff
brewin
in
this
can
laddies
dhigh
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
and
because
of
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
in
a
night
especially
on
a
nice
cool
night
d
great
overall
brew
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
cant
really
notice
it
except
at
the
very
end
of
the
sip
i
really
like
this
nice
scotch
ale
best
scotch
ale
i
have
had
to
date
really
nice
flavor
profile
and
just
right
warming
alcohol
finish
could
drink
many
of
these
in
a
night
very
good
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
d
more
please
creamy
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
old
chub
is
a
relatively
heavy
beer
and
loaded
with
dynamic
and
somewhat
sweet
flavors
that
mask
the
alcohol
very
well
its
one
of
the
only
scotch
ales
that
i
can
drink
3or4or
5
of
in
a
sitting
good
price
i
snagged
on
for
a
build
your
own
6er
for
10
bucks
d
the
alcohol
affects
this
drinkability
a
bit
syrupy
but
still
very
yummy
this
beer
should
be
in
attendance
at
your
next
camping
trip
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
have
been
impressed
with
both
oskar
blues
beers
i
have
had
so
far
so
im
going
to
be
sure
and
pick
more
up
i
didnt
realize
this
was
8
because
it
is
far
too
drinkable
d
booziness
suffers
the
overall
sip
this
beer
very
complex
though
the
heaviness
and
syrupy
feel
is
a
bit
overwhelming
but
enjoyable
at
the
same
time
poured
from
a
can
dated
82110
into
a
pint
glass
overall
yes
do
yourself
a
favor
and
have
one
after
another
the
taste
is
sweet
upfront
with
lively
carbonation
and
flavors
of
toffee
chocolate
molasses
burnt
sugar
and
an
earthy
residual
sweetness
on
the
end
no
hops
to
be
found
as
this
beer
lingers
with
a
sweet
syrupy
finish
mouthfeeldrinkability
is
just
a
nice
scotch
kick
could
drink
alot
of
this
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
nose
is
caramel
and
a
slight
touch
of
earthy
hops
a
bit
of
toffee
and
slight
roast
there
as
well
the
taste
is
mostly
a
light
carameltoffee
flavor
with
a
bit
of
light
fruits
and
some
dry
hops
the
feel
is
nice
and
creamy
a
bit
heavy
but
not
overly
so
drinks
quite
well
and
is
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
d
not
too
experienced
on
the
scottish
ale
style
but
i
cant
complain
about
this
one
nice
flavors
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruits
i
just
wish
i
could
have
picked
up
more
on
the
nose
d
not
one
of
my
favorites
by
a
long
shot
little
disappointed
to
be
honest
overall
this
was
a
strange
beer
not
sure
if
id
buy
this
again
alcohol
was
more
evident
than
i
expected
but
not
too
bad
mostly
though
i
cant
really
see
any
reason
to
have
this
one
again
it
wasnt
unpleasant
but
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
mouthfeel
is
rather
heavy
and
chewy
but
very
smooth
with
little
carbonation
overall
a
high
drinkable
but
almost
too
sweet
scottish
ale
might
be
hard
to
consume
too
many
beers
this
rich
and
high
in
alcohol
but
certainly
more
than
one
could
had
especially
with
a
bit
of
food
to
cut
it
down
a
bit
overall
a
nice
scottish
ale
better
than
average
it
is
good
but
nothing
groundbreaking
there
are
better
scottish
ales
out
there
however
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
its
not
atrocious
many
like
it
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
this
one
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
made
a
pleasant
sipper
as
it
warmed
poured
from
can
into
ikea
beer
mug
dark
opaque
amber
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
brown
sugar
most
evident
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
smokey
profile
at
the
end
caramel
taste
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
slightly
bitter
carbonated
aftertaste
but
does
not
detract
too
much
from
the
smoothness
of
the
drink
not
a
bad
brew
could
have
used
a
few
more
of
those
darker
notes
but
its
an
enjoyable
malty
beer
overall
d
i
havent
tried
too
many
scottish
ales
but
this
is
pretty
good
8
isnt
too
high
but
should
still
be
noticeable
and
in
this
beer
it
is
not
sweetness
isnt
offputting
its
inviting
and
leaves
a
bit
of
mystery
in
the
flavor
for
the
next
sip
drinks
good
leaves
a
nice
warm
filling
in
your
tummy
overall
a
nice
and
flavorful
scotch
ale
really
clean
and
balanced
and
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
worth
trying
d
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
this
is
a
very
good
afterdinner
sipper
mediumfull
bodied
light
effervescence
smooth
and
chewy
all
malt
aftertaste
a
seriously
good
draught
needs
a
bit
more
nose
d
very
drinkable
it
hits
the
expected
notes
of
a
scottish
ale
pretty
tasty
beer
all
up
rich
and
heavy
and
with
some
robust
manly
flavours
that
will
put
hairs
on
your
chest
good
effort
d
i
can
handle
only
one
of
these
i
have
a
thistle
glass
in
my
collection
and
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
this
old
chub
is
decent
but
give
me
a
gubna
any
day
of
the
week
over
this
one
deep
brownish
red
with
a
light
beige
head
that
didnt
last
sweet
caramel
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
and
smooth
creamy
feel
sweet
caramel
flavors
in
the
beginning
smokey
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
a
coffee
flavored
finish
with
a
very
slight
alcoholic
hint
at
the
end
went
down
pretty
easy
ddespite
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
disappeared
rather
quickly
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
the
taste
stays
throughout
the
drinking
and
i
found
myself
excited
every
time
i
reach
for
the
glass
notes
this
is
my
first
oskar
blues
sampling
i
was
going
to
trade
for
this
but
i
just
noticed
whole
foods
in
la
jolla
started
carrying
the
whole
oskar
lineup
maybe
its
been
out
here
for
awhile
and
the
cans
were
just
hiding
from
me
so
far
so
good
ten
fidy
and
gubna
along
with
football
this
weekend
very
drinkable
for
the
smokey
and
roasted
character
another
fine
job
from
the
folks
at
ob
and
some
texasstyle
beef
brisket
would
both
play
off
the
malt
and
smoke
of
old
chub
overall
this
beer
is
perfect
nothing
at
all
can
be
slander
this
beer
abv
is
not
at
all
noticeable
and
i
could
drink
12
of
these
and
then
go
to
bed
but
you
get
the
idea
highly
drinkable
smoked
scotts
ale
id
like
to
try
the
bottled
variety
just
to
see
if
there
is
any
difference
however
i
would
buy
another
six
pack
of
the
cans
without
question
also
this
is
my
first
review
hopefully
ive
been
sensible
and
appropriate
notes
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
and
tasty
beer
dmaybe
its
not
my
style
a
bit
too
boozey
and
sweet
for
my
taste
definately
worth
a
try
however
dthis
was
decent
but
not
something
i
will
seek
again
especially
at
the
price
i
like
skullsplitter
and
the
wee
heavy
style
much
better
drinkabilityits
nice
its
just
so
damned
sweet
that
it
gets
cloying
after
awhile
and
you
need
to
pause
between
drinks
i
cant
imagine
that
this
is
a
historically
accurate
scottish
beer
but
it
sure
is
tasty
as
drinkable
as
an
8
scotch
ale
could
be
throw
a
few
of
these
with
some
dales
pale
on
your
camping
trip
overall
very
solid
beer
overall
im
drinking
at
the
wrong
time
of
year
but
this
would
be
an
excellent
winter
warmer
ill
be
buying
more
this
winter
db
scottish
ales
are
one
of
the
more
definite
styles
to
me
very
signature
in
their
flavor
this
separates
itself
from
other
examples
of
the
style
with
a
nice
roast
aspect
the
mouthfeel
and
sweetness
hold
this
one
back
for
me
it
gets
tiring
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
very
mild
maybe
a
hint
of
malts
not
much
there
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
a
hint
of
hops
good
flavor
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
mediumfull
body
slightly
chewy
some
creaminess
with
moderate
carbonation
malty
brew
with
wellhidden
alcohol
not
bad
fairly
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
certainly
but
i
feel
like
the
malt
flavor
is
a
little
nondescript
except
for
a
touch
of
bitter
chocolate
in
the
finish
may
need
to
try
a
different
batch
d
a
good
beer
large
in
alcohol
so
wont
be
drinking
a
lot
of
it
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
drinkability
it
hits
all
of
the
markers
i
expect
in
a
scotch
ale
massive
rich
roasty
malt
flavor
and
just
enough
hop
presence
to
keep
things
interesting
another
solid
beer
from
oskar
blues
exceptionally
drinkable
due
to
the
smoothness
and
perfect
blending
of
all
the
flavors
this
is
the
best
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
taste
is
excellent
full
and
complex
like
an
aged
wine
a
dry
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
sweet
caramel
goodness
up
front
not
too
smoothe
balanced
just
enough
by
the
tangy
fruit
flavors
plum
raisen
a
fine
complement
to
beef
or
cake
i
find
it
very
drinkable
but
not
for
the
light
of
heart
d
this
is
one
of
those
ob
brews
that
you
need
to
be
careful
around
higher
abv
and
a
clean
easy
drink
the
only
thing
that
slightly
brings
this
ale
down
is
the
presence
of
booze
in
the
aroma
not
too
much
but
a
little
less
and
total
100
well
i
feel
that
i
enjoy
the
aroma
and
do
not
wish
it
to
change
but
for
the
drinkability
5
d
best
example
of
a
scottish
ale
ive
had
and
its
in
a
can
d
the
alcoholy
sweetness
makes
this
a
sipper
and
a
bit
difficult
to
take
too
much
of
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
overall
ill
probably
get
this
again
but
not
if
id
go
with
dirty
bastard
before
it
every
time
d
a
nice
warming
sipper
a
beer
that
you
would
enjoy
1
or
maybe
2
of
but
thats
about
it
at
least
for
me
anyway
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
good
while
it
does
a
decent
job
at
hiding
that
8
abv
with
its
smooth
rich
flavor
profile
a
good
beer
i
probable
will
come
back
to
sometime
cheers
d
obviously
low
drinkablility
solid
scottish
ale
i
prefer
mine
to
be
just
a
little
less
chocolaty
though
as
it
seems
like
it
skirts
the
line
of
crossing
over
to
an
imperial
stout
that
said
ive
grown
the
scope
of
my
palate
and
learned
to
embrace
the
scotch
ale
i
recommend
you
try
this
beer
its
a
little
tough
to
compare
this
to
other
scottish
ales
as
it
is
bigger
than
almost
all
of
them
this
one
is
more
scotch
ale
than
scottish
classification
aside
its
an
excellent
maltforward
beer
call
it
what
you
will
its
tasty
this
is
exceptionally
creamy
and
drinkable
and
for
the
price
it
is
an
excellent
choice
d
excellent
scotch
ale
really
enjoyed
it
and
plan
on
enjoying
it
again
and
again
drinkability
man
this
is
easy
to
knock
back
drinkability
certainly
and
definitely
a
sipper
this
is
a
big
heavy
made
for
winter
time
beer
that
i
happen
to
be
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
just
because
i
have
the
craving
to
try
this
beer
again
which
i
havent
had
in
so
long
let
me
honest
with
you
this
is
a
reallly
goood
beer
if
your
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
this
is
a
must
try
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
good
beer
this
is
a
must
try
its
just
so
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
complex
and
the
sweetness
though
plenty
sweet
never
gets
unbearable
a
future
staple
for
me
thanks
to
jgasparine

about
a
half
inch

that
went
away
quickly
lacing
is
decent
aroma
is
pretty
nice
its
sweet
and

and
it
smells
like
caramel

peat
smoke
and
dark

it
tastes
like
caramel

chocolate
smokepeat
molasses
and
a
bit
of
dark

even
though
the

a
year
old
this
is
still
a
good

a
bit
syrupy
and
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
its
smooth
and
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
not
a
bad
beer
i
liked
it
overall
a
malty
brew
that
is
multidimensional
in
its
complexity
and
demands
to
be
contemplated
and
sipped
drinkabilitythis
is
a
terrific
scotch
ale
thick
and
rich
malty
and
sweet
as
you
drink
it
it
reveals
hidden
complexity
d
good
example
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
at
8
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
at
all
drinkability
this
was
a
really
good
scottish
ale
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
notes
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
before
and
tried
the
dales
pale
ale
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
and
very
drinkable
cheers
drink
this
poured
a
dark
brown
into
my
sam
adams
pint
glass
gave
two
fingers
of
head
that
left
behind
some
impressive
lacing
behind
with
each
sip
the
smell
was
extremely
malty
and
sweet
some
definite
caramel
and
chocolate
scents
in
there
taste
was
what
i
expected
from
the
smell
next
to
no
hops
had
a
very
sweet
malt
taste
with
chocolate
and
caramel
up
front
i
picked
up
a
nice
smoke
taste
on
the
backside
mouthfeel
was
full
and
very
smooth
i
would
never
have
guessed
its
8
this
just
became
my
new
stand
by
brew
this
sat
in
my
stomach
more
heavily
than
i
expected
considering
the
mouthfeel
it
isnt
too
boozey
considering
the
style
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
and
anytime
you
can
get
a
good
beer
in
a
can
it
is
a
win
drinkability
is
good
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
salud
i
can
see
how
someone
with
a
different
palate
might
like
this
but
its
not
for
me
i
dont
think
ill
be
coming
back
for
more
any
time
soon
poured
from
a
can
dark
brown
with
not
much
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
looks
well
carbonated
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
mild
sweet
slightly
raisin
smell
toasty
malt
taste
and
some
caramel
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
smooth
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
d
very
drinkable
the
sweetness
would
be
a
bit
wearying
over
time
but
its
very
smooth
for
its
strength
zero
alcohol
burn
and
pleasantly
warming
pours
from
the
12
oz
can
still
gotta
get
used
to
typing
can
instead
of
bottle
a
cola
colored
brown
with
a
light
tan
foamy
one
finger
head
that
rather
quickly
settles
into
a
thick
collar
i
cant
make
out
the
level
of
carbonation
because
its
impossible
to
see
how
many
if
any
bubbles
there
are
in
the
darkness
aroma
is
sweet
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
chocolate
the
1st
sip
is
a
rich
joyous
blend
of
caramel
coffee
semisweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
smoke
thrown
in
the
mouthfeel
is
of
notable
substance
bold
thick
but
not
overpoweringly
heavy
the
drinkability
is
almost
too
good
this
goes
down
dangerously
easy
for
a
beer
weighing
in
at
8
abv
overall
holy
haggis
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beautiful
brew
im
gonna
be
buying
quite
a
lot
of
this
in
the
near
future
bought
this
one
after
wanting
tontaste
some
real
craft
beer
from
a
can
pours
dark
brown
and
slightly
thick
some
carbonation
with
little
to
no
head
aromas
of
caramel
and
sweet
corn
hints
of
some
alcohol
starts
off
sweet
and
the
malts
really
start
to
take
presedence
there
is
some
hints
of
bubble
gum
and
caramel
popcorn
really
surprised
by
the
flavor
i
like
to
say
that
i
do
get
metalic
flavors
but
that
might
be
mental
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
finish
ends
with
a
great
coat
of
hops
and
malts
d
very
smooth
for
8
alcohol
is
well
hidden
one
could
down
a
few
of
these
pretty
easy
dat
8
percent
this
could
be
a
little
tricky
in
terms
of
making
a
session
beer
of
out
it
however
highly
recommended
i
cant
think
of
many
i
enjoy
more
from
this
style
there
does
seem
to
be
a
little
variation
from
can
to
can
which
may
lead
to
some
of
the
lesser
reviews
or
not
this
is
a
solid
brew
just
maybe
not
what
some
expect
from
the
style
very
drinkable
for
being
8
it
hides
it
well
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
quite
a
lot
d
really
not
a
great
offering
from
oskar
blues
i
would
rather
pick
up
a
can
of
gordon
or
ten
fidy
drinkability
wanna
get
toasty
and
spend
a
lot
of
money
drink
this
wanna
enjoy
a
scotch
ale
dont
drink
this
not
recommended
im
a
little
disappointed
this
has
been
the
only
oskar
blues
beer
ive
tried
that
i
havent
liked
poured
from
the
can
into
large
wine
glasstemp
at
about
40
nice
dark
colorgood
clarityhalf
finger
head
went
down
nice
and
smoothvery
rich
i
liked
this
one
alotgood
sipping
beer
alcohol
was
presentbut
not
overpowering
i
was
a
little
skeptical
of
it
coming
from
a
canbut
dont
let
that
fool
youyou
wont
regret
this
one
this
is
a
very
good
scotch
ale
has
all
the
malts
you
would
want
for
the
style
completed
by
a
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
impressive
stuff
would
love
to
session
this
brew
even
with
its
high
alcohol
level
d
this
is
definitely
good
didnt
have
huge
expectations
for
this
but
defintely
a
winning
good
scotch
ale
i
love
the
way
this
beer
tastes
brown
sugar
chocolate
a
little
dark
fruit
exceptionally
smooth
body
is
full
but
so
smooth
you
never
notice
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
strong
maltiness
to
it
with
just
the
slightest
bit
of
smokiness
this
beer
is
great
with
dinner
dessert
and
strong
cheese
in
my
opinion
d
quite
different
than
any
scottish
ale
ive
had
before
and
a
very
nice
surprise
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
an
8
beer
a
great
beer
to
remind
you
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
packed
with
hops
to
be
a
winner
first
beer
i
ever
had
from
oskar
blues
and
im
eager
to
have
more
old
chub
had
been
calling
my
name
for
a
while
but
i
have
to
admit
i
was
slightly
underwhelmed
it
was
good
but
definitely
wont
rank
among
my
top
scottish
ales
o
cant
say
its
my
favorite
scotch
ale
but
i
do
like
it
and
would
drink
it
again
this
like
many
other
flavor
rich
malty
ales
goes
great
with
one
my
new
favorites
achadinha
capricious
aged
goat
cheese
final
impressions
looks
and
drinks
like
a
cocacola
on
beeroids
without
the
high
effervescence
the
sweet
smokiness
is
reminiscent
of
a
lowland
or
speyside
scotch
a
beer
that
could
go
with
dessert
but
is
surprisingly
lighter
and
more
drinkable
than
expected
an
excellent
scotch
ale
but
on
the
sweeter
end
this
is
a
great
wee
heavy
in
a
good
looking
can
i
will
soon
seek
out
a
fresh
six
pack
as
i
bought
the
one
this
came
from
in
december
09
when
it
was
already
a
year
old
i
dont
think
age
harms
it
but
i
cant
tell
you
if
it
helps
it
thanks
to
the
threewisemen
for
enabling
me
to
experience
this
i
too
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
ob
brewery
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
theyre
going
to
make
next
can
or
bottle
this
stuff
is
really
good
here
comes
oskar
blues
and
one
of
their
mainstays
old
chub
it
is
a
delicious
ale
that
is
not
only
full
bodied
but
smooth
going
down
most
prefer
to
pour
it
into
a
glass
but
i
prefer
right
from
the
can
you
do
not
get
that
can
taste
but
you
do
get
the
great
taste
of
old
chub
i
grabbed
a
6
pack
today
and
it
came
in
its
usual
style
can
when
i
looked
at
the
6
pack
behind
the
one
i
chose
it
seemed
they
changed
the
style
of
the
can
i
did
enjoy
the
new
look
d
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
is
perfect
if
youre
looking
for
something
rich
and
creamy
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
feels
smooth
and
also
sticky
on
the
palate
very
sticky
sweetness
carbonation
is
spot
on
with
this
not
too
lively
just
about
perfect
great
drinkability
here
great
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
winner
in
my
book
just
have
to
remember
to
not
overdo
it
this
one
could
give
you
a
nasty
hangover
in
the
morn
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
and
has
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
tter
complaints
aside
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
im
quite
certain
that
ob
followed
the
scottish
way
and
fermented
on
the
cold
side
followed
by
a
nice
chilly
secondary
fermentation
to
clean
things
up
further
a
job
well
done
on
a
severely
underappreciated
style
cant
wait
to
try
this
in
a
can
could
easily
see
quickly
putting
back
a
sixer
of
this
good
drinkin
d
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
available
in
this
country
drinkable
a
nice
beer
but
one
that
doesnt
sit
well
once
purchased
the
cans
should
be
consumed
within
a
reasonable
time
period
as
they
tend
to
flatten
with
time
but
no
one
buys
beer
to
sit
around
do
they
well
do
they
this
is
such
a
great
beer
it
takes
the
style
and
ratchets
it
up
to
11
highly
recommended
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
and
sweet
feels
somewhat
sticky
very
drinkable
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
one
except
it
is
good
dreally
nice
beer
really
malty
with
a
decent
body
to
back
it
up
nice
to
see
that
this
isnt
cloying
or
too
sweet
d
the
8
isnt
really
well
hidden
here
but
it
goes
so
well
this
is
a
big
beer
and
i
really
enjoy
that
drinkability
is
quite
good
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
and
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
so
i
dont
expect
to
drink
it
a
lot
but
if
i
were
to
crave
a
scottish
ale
this
would
be
my
go
to
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
bit
of
peat
not
much
smoke
the
way
others
have
described
it
to
me
there
was
a
pronounced
sweetness
and
some
caramel
flavor
that
went
with
the
maltiness
and
peat
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
seemed
to
temper
the
slight
boozy
aftertaste
overall
a
pleasant
beverage
from
oscar
blues
another
hit
from
ob
this
was
served
with
a
college
guys
head
very
littleand
a
little
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
mahoganey
hightlights
aroma
is
standard
classic
scotch
ale
very
malty
a
bit
roasty
and
peaty
flavors
about
the
same
plus
lots
of
caramel
and
some
toffee
boozy
in
the
finish
good
body
and
carbonation
a
standard
for
scotch
ales
taste
is
very
smokey
but
not
over
the
top
and
still
very
drinkable
its
got
some
earthy
tones
and
nice
to
drink
super
rich
and
smooth
d
now
when
i
had
this
fresh
it
really
was
dry
to
finish
but
with
some
age
the
flavors
rounded
out
and
little
bite
was
received
by
the
abv
would
find
it
again
if
it
was
this
affordable
d
good
overall
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
en
mass
dits
a
nice
robust
beer
that
has
a
nice
warming
quality
its
not
an
everyday
or
more
than
one
a
night
beer
for
me
but
a
nice
beer
from
time
to
time
nothing
terrible
nothing
great
the
flavor
is
big
and
full
upon
first
contact
the
smoky
bit
of
heat
comes
at
the
end
and
extends
well
into
the
after
taste
the
main
flavors
are
a
mix
between
a
super
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
smokyslightly
hop
component
the
mouth
feel
is
full
and
thick
will
get
again
great
value
and
great
taste
taste
is
full
and
rich
in
malt
body
with
a
lingering
caramel
finish
and
a
bit
of
roast
not
much
for
variety
but
smooth
and
rich
enough
to
mask
the
abv
easily
flavor
improves
somewhat
with
warming
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
limits
the
potential
here
full
bodied
feel
though
without
much
texture
and
in
fact
kind
of
watery
again
firming
up
a
tad
with
warming
not
really
getting
this
one
another
oskar
blues
beer
with
a
malty
coverup
even
for
the
style
good
drinkability
for
the
high
abv
d
a
really
solid
brew
overall
the
nose
on
it
was
just
a
little
disappointing
but
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
d
strong
tastes
this
is
certainly
no
wimpy
beer
obvious
strong
huge
comforting
relaxing
and
fairly
complex
nothing
i
would
want
to
session
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
made
all
the
better
by
the
fact
that
its
in
a
can
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
its
a
onehitquit
kind
of
a
beer
d
an
awesome
beer
to
sip
on
really
complex
with
lots
going
on
this
is
probably
too
sweet
to
drink
all
night
but
most
scottish
ales
are
still
would
be
great
in
the
winter
id
love
one
of
these
after
skiing
poured
into
a
trappistes
rochefort
goblet
minimal
head
retention
which
is
an
off
white
and
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
rasins
dates
brown
sugar
malty
goodness
taste
is
similar
with
verly
little
hop
presence
but
not
cloying
carbonation
is
wonderfully
light
and
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
but
silky
smooth
taste
is
fantastic
and
similar
to
the
nose
with
no
hot
or
phenolic
surprises
very
straightforward
my
new
favorite
example
to
the
style
it
reminds
me
of
a
light
quad
without
the
belgian
yeast
peculiarity
imparted
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
heavenly
drinkability
is
pretty
high
i
could
throw
down
a
few
if
it
wasnt
for
the
very
well
hidden
8
abv
the
alcohol
doesnt
even
make
itself
known
until
you
feel
a
slight
warming
on
the
palette
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
tan
milkshake
head
that
melts
slowly
leaving
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
rich
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
brown
sugar
with
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
big
and
slightly
smokey
with
rich
carmelized
malt
and
an
earthy
teatobacco
like
bitterness
this
is
a
big
scottish
ale
for
sure
almost
more
of
a
wee
heavy
than
an
80
shilling
export
full
and
sticky
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
finish
a
tasty
brew
i
wish
i
had
another
one
a
very
well
balanced
ale
done
right
chocolate
and
spices
don
very
well
can
from
westy
in
camp
hill
dark
chocolate
pour
with
thin
head
sweet
almost
cordial
cherry
nose
palate
is
malty
caramel
some
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
medium
body
finishing
with
a
pleasant
alcohol
burn
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
d
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
thin
watery
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
a
one
and
done
i
drank
it
because
i
had
it
but
wont
be
buying
another
for
a
while
hoping
that
the
beer
i
got
was
just
an
anomaly
old
chub
is
an
exceptional
ale
that
almost
goes
down
a
little
too
easy
i
almost
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
upfront
so
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
so
much
of
this
oskar
blues
does
it
again
excellent
d
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
but
soooo
good
one
of
my
favorites
to
take
on
a
cold
camping
trip
to
keep
me
warm
anyway
its
a
decent
ale
for
the
style
quite
simply
not
for
mine
dfor
the
alcohol
content
pretty
damn
easy
i
would
say
3
is
a
good
number
as
its
one
of
the
few
oskar
blues
that
come
in
6
packs
that
ive
seen
3
is
perfect
you
get
two
enjoyable
nights
nice
ruby
color
with
very
few
bubbles
to
interrupt
the
display
i
dont
know
what
the
big
deal
is
about
the
head
i
poured
right
into
the
center
of
the
glass
and
got
a
mountain
of
foam
with
very
little
fuss
it
didnt
last
long
but
it
was
medium
dense
and
full
of
bubbles
despite
the
low
carbonation
raisins
prunes
apricots
caramel
and
pears
erupt
in
the
aroma
followed
by
the
distinct
tang
of
alcohol
then
a
slightly
smoky
smell
to
finish
and
that
pretty
much
sums
up
the
taste
too
except
the
hamfisted
alcohol
squashes
the
malty
fruity
flavors
its
not
too
sweet
not
very
dry
but
definitely
suffers
from
the
abv
i
like
what
ive
had
from
oskar
blues
but
if
they
toned
down
the
alcohol
on
this
beer
it
would
be
great
instead
its
merely
drinkable
this
beer
was
an
anomaly
im
torn
between
the
way
it
started
and
the
way
it
finished
first
i
would
give
the
advice
to
allow
this
beer
to
sit
and
warm
a
bit
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
transparent
reddish
orange
along
the
edges
perhaps
it
was
ruined
by
the
can
but
it
only
had
only
a
light
scotch
malt
and
inexpensive
alcohol
aroma
a
thin
mouth
feel
initially
it
filled
out
a
bit
when
it
warmed
the
alcohol
flavor
did
not
match
the
taste
and
so
reminded
me
of
a
steel
reserve
or
other
high
alcohol
cheap
beer
however
as
it
warmed
the
caramel
malts
came
out
a
bit
more
in
the
end
after
sitting
for
half
an
hour
the
strengthened
mouthfeel
and
slightly
more
complex
flavor
still
could
not
overpower
the
overbearing
alcohol
finish
i
really
like
this
just
wish
the
head
stuck
around
awhile
d
well
its
8
and
the
tart
sweetness
gives
pause
but
after
finishing
one
i
would
consider
another
a
thin
head
on
a
hard
pour
the
color
is
a
dirty
coffee
brown
minor
spots
of
sticky
head
3
00
s
strong
caramel
and
tootsie
roll
malt
overload
with
just
the
faintest
hint
of
citrusy
hops
4
50
t
like
the
nose
there
are
strong
caramel
malts
as
well
some
dark
chocolates
the
palate
also
provides
a
hefty
shot
of
raisins
alcohol
is
evident
but
is
not
disruptive
to
the
beer
hops
provide
just
a
nice
dollop
of
grapefruit
faintest
touch
of
smoke
4

m
the
heavy
malts
on
the
beer
provide
an
extremely
smooth
mouth
feel
and
provide
a
lingering
syrupiness
4
50
d
all
around
an
exceptional
beer
extremely
enjoyable
and
one
id
happily
drink
again
4
25
taste
was
similar
but
balanced
out
by
some
hop
bitterness
rich
and
balanced
strong
malt
and
caramel
richness
full
mouthfeel
really
nice
beer
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
very
full
bodied
and
delicious
beer
thats
almost
certainly
all
but
crossing
the
line
between
a
scottish
ale
and
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
and
no
bad
thing
ill
admit
though
that
this
is
only
my
second
scotch
ale
my
first
was
on
tap
at
portsmouth
brewery
in
new
hampshire
and
i
loved
it
that
beer
is
the
reason
why
ive
been
meaning
to
pick
this
one
up
in
fact
value
great
price
at
9
00
a
sixer
d
this
was
my
first
craft
brew
from
a
can
and
im
impressed
easy
to
drink
and
a
fine
scotch
ale
one
of
my
favorite
styles
a
wonderful
deep
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
with
light
carbonation
i
was
not
able
to
get
much
of
a
head
even
with
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
and
really
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
very
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
and
chocolate
aroma
mmm
very
presently
surprised
by
the
taste
very
malty
with
loads
of
caramel
and
some
chocolate
notes
also
getting
a
bit
of
dried
fruit
some
smokiness
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
this
beer
is
smoooth
and
believe
me
that
extra
o
is
not
a
typo
i
was
about
to
type
that
it
is
hard
to
believe
this
is
8
but
as
it
warms
a
bit
the
alcohol
really
comes
out
drinking
this
beer
is
an
experience
to
savor
and
enjoy
i
have
not
had
many
scotch
ales
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
so
far
a
nice
sipper
i
guess
the
can
makes
you
think
that
youre
in
for
a
less
substantial
beer
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
d
well
with
no
hops
detectable
to
hide
the
booze
i
will
have
to
claim
the
drinkability
comes
from
the
mix
of
malts
used
to
achieve
an
easy
drinker
well
balanced
and
a
truly
remarkable
war
between
the
sweet
and
the
boozey
finish
in
an
even
steven
tie
pours
a
dark
seemingly
murky
brown
with
some
dark
auburn
highlights
and
a
minor
bit
of
light
ecru
head
the
smell
is
piney
sappy
sweet
and
has
a
small
hint
of
breadiness
as
well
the
taste
holds
plenty
of
malty
sweetness
with
the
sap
and
pine
from
the
nose
coming
through
as
well
the
medium
body
is
lightened
a
bit
by
the
nice
amount
of
carbonation
allowing
this
brew
to
maintain
a
good
level
of
drinkability
i
have
had
this
on
tap
and
now
in
can
all
around
a
great
brew
on
a
side
note
this
beer
pairs
incredibly
well
with
colbyjack
cheese
give
it
a
try
d
very
drinkable
beer
its
strong
but
not
too
overbearing
on
the
palate
and
it
comes
in
cans
which
are
always
convenient
pours
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
smoke
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
dark
fruit
light
smoke
roasted
malt
and
some
chocolate
the
finish
is
slightly
fruity
with
some
smoke
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
also
appears
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
is
faint
medium
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
drinkability
quite
drinkable
i
had
had
old
chub
many
moons
ago
and
recall
it
being
rather
heavy
i
think
my
palate
simply
appreciates
bigger
beers
now
because
i
find
this
easy
to
drink
though
a
sixpack
might
admittedly
be
a
bit
much
overall
its
a
great
scottish
ale
and
it
comes
in
a
can
which
is
awesome
however
i
dont
think
it
surpasses
my
michigan
scottish
ale
favorites
from
founders
and
dark
horse
there
is
a
nice
smooth
creamy
feel
this
is
a
winter
beer
for
me
it
reminds
of
a
mellow
stout
d
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
that
for
some
reason
eluded
the
ratings
by
me
until
now
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
a
good
intro
i
would
think
for
the
style
the
sweetness
was
the
only
factor
that
would
keep
me
from
killing
a
sixer
of
this
well
that
and
its
not
in
indiana
old
chub
has
sweet
flat
and
warming
characteristics
similar
to
a
winter
warmer
however
it
does
not
have
a
lasting
impact
d
the
alcohol
never
shows
itself
on
the
palate
or
in
the
throat
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
did
feel
a
warming
sensation
in
my
stomach
the
8
shows
up
but
it
takes
a
while
good
beer
that
needs
to
be
consumed
close
to
room
temperature
to
be
truly
appreciated
thank
you
drizzam
you
are
a
very
nice
individual
d
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
the
8
abv
may
preclude
it
from
being
sessionable
but
it
is
certainly
highly
drinkable
another
excellent
brew
from
oskar
blues
a
top
notch
version
of
this
style
of
beer
conclusion
nice
example
of
the
style
one
i
was
definitely
stoked
to
finally
get
to
try
light
head
barely
gets
to
one
finger
dark
brown
color
gone
in
a
flash
no
real
lacing
no
foam
islands
mahogany
brown
in
color
mild
fogginess
to
it
more
copper
orange
around
the
rims
fruitcake
scented
nose
full
of
sweet
baking
spices
nuts
milk
chocolate
butterscotch
coffee
ice
cream
cola
only
sign
of
hops
might
be
that
it
texturally
stiffens
after
a
second
of
two
in
your
nostrils
fullbodied
layers
itself
like
syrup
on
your
tongue
if
the
carbonation
didnt
have
a
prickle
to
it
it
would
be
too
cloying
for
sure
brown
sugar
cola
caramel
butterscotch
ginger
cinnamon
honeyed
nuts
make
it
a
candidate
for
a
willy
wonka
product
more
floral
here
glazed
bread
impressive
in
that
it
maintains
a
full
throttle
appeal
throughout
however
nuance
and
contrast
are
not
strong
points
served
from
a
cellar
temperature
can
into
a
chalice
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
ruby
color
it
seems
darker
than
other
scottish
style
beers
ive
had
a
slight
head
of
tan
bubbles
disappeared
to
virtually
nothing
just
a
spiderwork
lacing
of
tiny
foam
in
the
center
of
the
surface
it
has
a
biscuit
and
caramel
aroma
but
it
isnt
too
potent
this
is
a
tasty
scotch
ale
loads
of
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
work
well
together
there
may
be
some
toffee
in
there
or
some
other
sort
of
noncandy
sweetness
but
i
cant
be
sure
it
has
a
light
smooth
finish
that
leaves
the
slightest
mouthcoating
the
evaporates
as
if
it
were
pure
alcohol
the
body
feels
pretty
heavy
at
first
but
it
seems
to
lighten
after
the
beer
first
hits
my
mouth
im
going
to
classify
it
as
being
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
may
be
a
bit
biased
as
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
could
drink
this
entire
six
pack
by
myself
on
top
of
that
each
sip
goes
down
so
easily
i
find
myself
reaching
for
my
glass
to
take
another
drink
without
even
thinking
about
it
im
glad
there
are
five
more
cans
to
drink
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
can
into
a
goblet
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
with
ruby
tones
when
viewed
in
front
of
a
light
next
to
no
head
smells
alcoholic
slightly
smoky
somewhat
toasted
carbonation
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
in
my
mouth
followed
by
smoked
bicuity
malts
and
dark
toffee
flavors
a
slight
metallic
taste
is
detectable
in
the
aftertaste
light
bodied
there
is
little
coating
and
very
little
aftertaste
but
overmuch
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
from
a
can
and
i
can
see
drinking
many
in
a
single
sitting
a
great
beer
and
definitely
not
for
the
weak
paleted
it
comes
in
a
can
which
is
convenient
for
many
reasons
when
poured
straight
into
a
16
ounce
mug
it
forms
a
nice
frothy
head
and
a
deep
amberrich
body
since
it
is
a
scotchstyle
ale
the
caramel
and
similar
sweet
flavors
compliment
the
high
alcohol
percentage
i
recommend
for
anyone
that
enjoys
feeling
a
nice
buzz
after
only
1
or
2
beers
even
for
the
experienced
drinker
highly
recommended
highly
drinkable
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
mouthfeel
thick
with
low
carbonation
good
for
sipping
leaving
a
lasting
taste
on
the
palate
i
was
really
surprised
by
old
chub
not
because
i
dont
like
oskar
bluesim
quickly
becoming
a
fan
but
because
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
and
rich
flavors
in
here
maybe
its
the
can
that
threw
me
off
either
way
this
is
a
great
beer
despite
looking
horrible
overall
i
never
really
got
into
this
style
before
but
i
think
im
gonna
have
to
give
a
few
more
a
try
overall
a
very
good
example
of
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
i
will
certainly
have
this
beer
again
and
suggest
you
add
it
to
your
regular
rotation
as
well
overall
this
was
another
nice
brew
from
oskar
blues
and
a
style
that
i
am
starting
to
really
enjoy
thanks
again
gar
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
for
what
i
was
expecting
and
it
really
rolls
off
the
tongue
quite
well
not
too
heavy
but
surprisingly
refreshing
d
good
drinkability
the
sweetness
doesnt
wear
on
the
palate
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
enough
to
make
this
one
slightly
dangerous
d
a
solid
beer
recommended
overall
i
really
like
this
i
havent
been
impressed
by
too
many
scottish
style
ales
but
this
one
is
fantastic
the
rumors
are
true
this
is
a
decent
beer
especially
coming
from
a
can
it
pours
nicely
and
had
a
great
amber
color
aroma
has
nice
hints
of
sweet
and
spicy
the
mouthfeel
is
well
rounded
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
easily
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
recommend
letting
it
fully
pour
out
into
a
goblet
or
tulip
glass
i
thought
it
kind
of
lost
its
gusto
about
halfway
through
the
glass
but
its
still
a
winner
d
for
8
in
a
can
this
stuff
is
dangerous
smooth
it
poured
into
my
glass
in
a
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
dark
ruby
color
to
it
slight
head
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
left
over
smells
of
vanilla
caramel
and
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
maltiness
up
front
with
peat
in
between
a
nice
example
of
the
scottish
style
a
decent
thickness
to
the
beer
almost
like
soda
syrup
but
not
quite
so
sweet
and
thick
definitely
could
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
no
problem
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
love
that
it
comes
in
a
can
very
impressed
with
this
a
good
beer
out
of
a
can
who
would
of
thunk
it
drinkability
very
nice
not
sessionable
to
my
tastes
but
not
all
beers
need
to
be
the
ontap
version
compares
well
with
the
can
but
patience
is
definitely
rewarded
as
warming
from
ontap
serving
temperature
is
definitely
needed
to
allow
the
smoky
peaty
maltiness
to
come
through
feel
is
great
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
even
at
8
abv
pours
extremely
dark
with
a
slight
amber
tone
to
it
head
starts
out
strong
then
fades
to
almost
nothing
smells
of
prunes
alcohol
figs
strong
malts
and
has
a
sweet
aroma
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
taste
is
exceptional
a
smoky
slightly
sweet
and
malty
concoction
that
ends
with
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
to
finish
mouthfeel
seems
medium
bodied
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
scottish
ale
that
packs
a
punch
with
the
abv
and
would
also
be
perfect
for
packing
along
on
a
multiday
hike
through
the
mountains
d
this
definately
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
i
dont
know
why
but
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
lighter
beer
with
some
noble
hoppage
haha
this
definately
isnt
that
but
its
very
good
none
the
less
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
my
first
scottish
ale
this
sets
a
nice
bar
for
other
scottish
to
stand
up
to
dark
deep
brown
with
reddish
garnet
hues
not
much
head
or
carbonation
very
sweet
malty
smell
alcohol
is
presant
with
not
much
hops
coming
out
thick
sweet
malted
milk
ice
cream
maltiness
some
caramel
toffee
bitter
chocolate
flavors
roasted
burnt
coffee
bitterness
shows
up
as
it
warms
there
is
a
hard
boozy
alchohol
bite
at
the
end
not
really
any
bitterness
from
the
hops
that
i
can
detect
its
the
malts
all
the
way
very
full
bodied
mouthfeel
maybe
not
the
best
flavors
ive
come
across
but
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
great
winter
beer
it
makes
me
want
to
crack
open
another
one
and
sit
outside
in
the
eight
degree
weather
i
think
i
might
d
i
like
it
and
it
comes
in
a
can
so
it
is
extra
drinkable
pours
dark
brown
appearing
nearly
black
in
the
glass
one
finger
of
tan
head
but
it
dies
down
fairly
quickly
leaving
just
a
ring
and
a
spot
of
lace
aroma
of
caramel
figs
brown
sugar
hazelnut
and
some
spiciness
tastes
of
caramel
and
nutty
malts
with
a
spicy
almost
clovelike
twist
figs
and
grapes
on
the
midpalate
and
a
spicy
cookielike
finish
body
is
somewhat
heavy
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
that
fits
overall
moderately
tasty
with
lots
of
spicy
nutty
malts
d
very
solid
scotch
ale
wish
this
was
available
locally
as
it
seems
to
be
a
great
value
extremely
drinkable
for
its
abv
drinkability
i
generally
dont
go
for
the
sweeter
beers
as
im
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
head
but
this
is
quite
good
its
sweet
but
not
to
the
point
where
i
feel
like
my
teeth
are
going
to
rot
out
of
my
skull
that
being
said
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
as
the
sweetness
would
just
get
to
me
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
if
you
like
the
sweeter
beers
but
even
if
that
isnt
your
thing
it
is
worth
a
try
dark
brown
with
rubymahogany
highlights
really
no
head
to
speak
of
i
did
pour
it
pretty
lacksidaisically
pretty
sweet
smell
of
bready
smokey
malt
and
caramel
just
an
inundation
of
sweet
malts
in
the
taste
you
get
a
little
smokiness
with
maybe
some
dark
dried
fruits
but
its
tough
to
discern
theres
some
boozy
alcohol
present
in
the
finish
as
well
it
was
odd
popping
open
a
can
with
little
apparent
carbonation
it
had
a
pretty
smooth
feel
and
appropriate
carbonation
but
fell
a
little
flat
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
i
will
admit
that
it
did
take
a
while
to
finish
though
ive
only
had
this
style
a
few
times
and
ive
never
been
a
real
fan
so
its
tough
for
me
to
judge
whether
or
not
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
oskar
blues
is
a
winner
can
or
not
this
beer
ages
very
well
and
obviously
in
the
packaging
travels
quite
well
an
excellent
example
of
sweeter
scottish
wee
heavy
style
this
and
skullsplitter
i
believe
are
particularly
great
strong
and
sweet
scottish
ales
solid
brew
but
not
outstanding
d
it
took
awhile
to
finish
and
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
see
where
others
would
like
this
ddefinitely
drinkable
good
beer
overall
sweetness
is
not
over
the
top
as
i
said
this
is
as
good
example
of
the
style
as
ive
had
before
just
not
particularly
a
style
i
seek
and
savour
thanks
to
biegaman
for
this
prechristmas
treat
i
enjoyed
it
with
the
hockey
game
going
on
in
one
room
and
my
wife
summoning
me
every
quarter
hour
to
bring
another
box
of
decorations
up
from
the
cellar
d
easy
to
sip
a
bit
too
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
i
will
look
for
again
perhaps
it
will
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
looks
like
coca
cola
and
like
nougat
apple
toastiness
the
palate
is
mildly
smokey
with
a
toasty
malt
a
bit
of
nut
and
a
bit
of
sour
apple
quality
malt
character
of
apple
pie
with
a
wonderful
body
that
give
the
beer
a
range
of
toasty
crust
sour
sweet
apple
and
herbal
nutmeg
nice
mix
and
a
wonderful
taste
out
of
a
can
overall
i
enjoy
this
greatly
i
have
not
had
a
significant
number
of
scotch
ales
but
this
demonstrates
a
great
level
of
complexity
on
the
nose
and
the
palate
with
an
excellent
balance
its
getting
rave
reviews
for
a
reason
so
drink
up
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
the
sweetness
of
it
just
covers
up
all
the
complexity
to
me
that
is
lying
underneath
i
can
still
tell
it
is
there
but
you
have
to
search
for
it
seems
like
some
people
are
crazy
over
this
one
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
while
not
bad
just
seems
like
this
could
be
better
moderate
to
full
body
pretty
sweet
really
good
full
flavor
on
this
beer
completely
covers
your
mouth
and
tongue
very
low
bitter
sweetness
up
front
drinkability
high
mouthfeel
high
second
taste
is
really
smooth
sweetness
backs
off
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
malty
beer
without
being
a
malt
bomb
overall
really
good
definitely
a
repeat
overall
this
is
another
great
brew
from
oskar
blues
nice
robust
flavor
that
lives
up
to
the
style
i
havent
had
too
many
scottish
ales
but
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
currently
my
favorite
i
have
to
try
more
from
these
oskar
blues
folk
so
far
they
have
not
disappointed
shower
the
people
you
chub
with
chub
reads
the
bottom
of
the
can
hilarious
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
amber
that
i
can
barely
see
through
the
head
was
a
very
nice
and
tight
tan
about
two
fingers
thick
smell
was
rich
and
malty
and
a
lot
of
chocolate
which
i
found
surprising
smells
thick
and
syrupy
like
a
scottish
ale
should
taste
is
rich
in
sweet
malts
and
chocolate
a
pretty
nice
caramel
presence
as
well
brown
sugar
lingers
on
the
tongue
taste
is
quite
nice
nice
and
thick
and
malty
on
the
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
only
accentuates
this
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
quite
filling
and
with
a
high
abv
this
one
may
be
dangerously
smooth
good
mild
scoth
ale
60
schillings
maybe
the
aroma
and
taste
improve
things
quite
a
bit
old
chub
smells
of
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
the
sweet
fruityness
from
the
aroma
carries
through
in
the
taste
with
flavors
of
dried
cherries
and
prunes
compared
to
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
not
so
boozy
initially
the
alcohol
is
certainly
there
however
and
the
alcohol
heat
comes
through
especially
as
the
beer
warms
despite
a
decent
mouthfeel
this
increasing
booziness
makes
this
one
a
sipper
for
sure
notes
an
excellent
scottish
style
ale
the
only
complaint
a
minor
one
is
that
the
alcohol
aftertaste
inhibits
the
drinkability
a
bit
overall
though
a
great
way
to
satisfy
any
malt
craving
pours
a
dark
ruddy
brown
some
nice
lacing
from
a
decent
head
later
no
head
the
aroma
makes
clear
this
is
a
thick
malty
beer
the
taste
is
just
lovely
thick
and
malty
toffee
and
chocolate
underline
the
malt
base
some
bitterness
after
the
middle
but
very
even
keeled
the
mouth
is
muscular
but
doesnt
amass
on
the
tongue
while
drinking
i
brought
this
back
from
a
trip
down
south
and
damn
i
wish
i
bought
more
this
is
a
great
beer
d
really
enjoyed
this
drink
especially
as
it
warmed
could
really
see
myself
working
into
the
rotation
since
it
comes
in
a
can
going
to
take
it
on
our
camping
trip
this
week
and
offer
it
to
the
guys
good
beer
d
its
becoming
more
cloying
as
it
goes
on
the
balance
from
the
bitterness
of
the
roasted
malts
hardly
makes
up
for
the
lingering
sweetness
of
the
malts
a
good
scotch
ale
though
one
is
enough
but
a
good
beer
for
a
maltlover
taste
also
is
clearly
a
wee
heavy
pretty
good
solid
character
drinkable
and
not
harshly
alcoholic
or
bitter
it
is
mostly
sweet
rummy
darkly
caramelised
prunes
and
other
fruit
a
bit
spicey
with
a
faint
toastyleatheryearthiness
underneath
ultimately
it
ends
up
being
a
bit
bland
and
onedimensional
in
character
with
a
smooth
but
dominant
sweet
rummy
quality
and
no
real
complexity
it
has
a
little
oiliness
but
reall
yht
body
is
rather
light
and
almost
watery
for
the
most
part
making
the
oiliness
a
sticktothebackofthetongue
margarine
character
which
is
not
entirely
successful
in
my
book
its
good
solid
but
not
at
all
great
nice
brew
overall
the
taste
was
very
nice
and
fairly
complex
the
body
does
seema
tad
watery
i
would
expect
more
fo
a
fullness
but
with
their

line
up
that
isnt

such

gotta
love
those
cans
higher
in
abv
but
this
one
is
a
drinkable
beer
again
i
say
what
a
nice
suprise
to
see
something
like
this
out
of
a
can
oskar
blues
once
again
shows
that
its
possible
for
good
beer
to
come
out
of
a
can
im
definitely
going
to
have
this
again
and
again
perhaps
next
time
with
a
biscotti
or
semisweet
pastry
it
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
it
could
have
been
a
little
chewier
for
my
preferences
not
oily
not
very
dry
on
the
backtaste
deceptively
drinkable
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
i
wasnt
aware
of
the
alcohol
content
until
after
i
drank
it
a
very
nice
scottish
ale
indeed
chewy
sticky
mouthfeel
lead
off
this
sweet
malty
ride
some
notes
of
burnt
caramel
along
with
a
touch
of
coffee
due
to
roasted
malts
slightly
bitter
finish
i
wasnt
sure
this
one
would
measure
up
to
the
hype
but
it
actually
exceeded
my
expectations
from
the
can
it
pours
a
garnetlike
brownish
shimmering
liquid
with
a
shallow
but
blanketing
tan
head
nice
lace
the
aroma
explodes
with
toasted
malt
caramel
and
toffee
smells
a
bit
of
wood
and
some
smoke
qualities
round
out
the
smell
the
taste
is
full
of
malt
but
not
too
sweet
its
exceptionally
well
done
toasted
malt
and
breadcrust
flavors
mingle
all
the
way
through
the
experience
and
into
the
finish
the
finish
is
lingering
and
full
of
roasted
character
very
clean
and
extremely
drinkable
overall
a
great
beer
far
superior
to
many
other
canned
options
especially
nonnitro
options
worth
trying
more
than
one
for
a
can
this
is
damn
good
i
have
had
cans
from
dg
yuengling
sons
as
well
as
slyfox
and
this
definety
rates
up
there
canwise
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
full
bodied
the
beer
is
even
slightly
chewy
this
is
a
dam
fine
malty
beer
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
didnt
have
a
clue
about
abv
of
8
i
wouldnt
drink
this
from
the
can
as
it
deserves
a
glass
its
the
middle
of
june
so
right
away
im
thinking
this
isnt
a
good
ale
for
the
summer
this
was
also
my
first
scottishstyle
ale
and
i
do
see
some
whiskey
similarities
in
the
palate
but
this
isnt
as
complex
its
pretty
much
smokey
chocolate
chestnutcola
colour
dark
and
clear
with
a
dark
tan
head
composed
of
fine
bubbles
plenty
of
lacing
and
decent
retention
even
after
the
foam
fell
to
a
ring
aromas
of
caramel
and
toffee
dominated
but
a
mild
chocolate
and
roast
completed
the
malt
profile
peat
and
charcoal
character
grew
as
it
warmed
and
were
very
well
balanced
with
the
malt
very
malty
and
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
with
low
bitterness
light
smokiness
and
dried
fruit
as
well
with
chocolate
growing
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
creamy
texture
with
light
alcohol
warmth
towards
the
end
a
solid
beer
all
around
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
this
complemented
my
dinner
very
well
bbq
brisket
ill
recommend
this
to
some
friends
who
enjoy
scottishstyle
and
smoked
beers
notes
someone
put
scotland
in
a
can
very
nice
beer
the
alcohol
doesnt
show
through
like
i
expected
this
could
be
a
very
dangerous
beer
to
drink
a
sixer
of
because
it
would
sneak
up
on
you
great
offering
and
its
availability
in
a
can
makes
in
even
more
interesting
poured
from
the
can
nearly
black
in
low
light
im
sure
it
would
appear
as
black
held
to
the
light
its
reddish
brown
the
red
gleaming
like
a
ruby
head
is
almost
brown
as
well
nose
is
a
wave
of
buttery
diacetyl
i
like
diacetyl
but
this
was
just
a
tad
too
much
theres
a
hint
of
caramel
sugar
but
its
lost
amidst
the
butter
taste
isnt
as
sweet
as
id
like
my
scottish
ales
i
get
a
bit
of
barely
sweet
caramel
butter
and
thats
about
it
i
long
for
more
in
the
taste
dept
since
i
love
this
style
the
lacing
all
the
way
down
is
a
nice
touch
though
its
heavenly
carbonated
but
the
bubbles
feel
almost
delicate
very
nice
it
glides
over
the
tongue
drinkability
isnt
so
high
even
though
im
far
from
scotland
i
can
find
better
alternatives
locally
for
this
style
good
beer
but
not
particularly
representative
of
the
style
overall
this
is
made
of
quality
but
it
is
just
too
sweet
for
my
likings
the
aftertaste
just
seems
sugary
body
is
damn
near
large
on
this
one
with
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
supporting
a
creamy
slick
dextrinous
mouthfeel
not
a
trace
of
the
8
until
my
second
can
when
i
get
unexpectadly
relaxed
and
docile
great
beer
in
a
can
let
the
revolution
begin
i
have
finally
found
my
camping
beer
overall
this
could
be
a
good
brew
if
some
things
were
changed
up
a
bit
i
have
a
can
of
dales
pale
ale
in
the
fridge
and
am
hoping
its
better
than
this
one
which
wasnt
bad
but
just
didnt
hit
the
mark
for
me
old
chub
is
a
malty
flavorful
beer
bitterness
is
just
a
minor
player
here
if
you
are
a
hophead
this
wont
make
your
top
ten
list
dont
let
the
can
scare
you
youre
pouring
it
into
a
glass
anyway
the
aroma
set
the
stage
for
some
serious
malt
assault
and
the
flavor
came
through
in
no
way
complex
it
used
the
kiss
method
to
deliver
a
sweet
maltbomb
experience
that
was
pretty
much
nothing
but
enjoyable
the
hops
were
there
as
behind
the
scenes
mitigators
and
did
their
job
admirable
it
went
down
hella
smooth
and
welcomed
an
encore
though
the
abv
is
quite
well
disguised
and
i
could
see
an
issue
for
the
uninitiated
it
may
step
off
the
reservation
a
bit
stylewise
but
its
well
worth
it
good
beer
in
a
can
this
is
a
trend
one
has
to
like
even
though
old
chub
isnt
as
good
as
dales
pale
ale
relative
to
style
its
still
the
best
scottishscotch
ale
that
one
is
likely
to
find
in
a
can
id
like
to
see
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
before
i
jump
on
the
old
chub
bandwagon
with
both
feet
but
if
i
was
a
camper
id
load
up
on
both
this
beer
and
dales
so
that
my
malt
moods
and
my
hops
moods
would
be
equally
wellcovered
i
am
kicking
myself
for
not
having
tried
this
before
i
will
be
stocking
up
on
this
stuff
at
every
chance
the
verdict
is
in
now
that
im
half
way
through
this
hands
down
the
best
scottish
ale
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
when
i
spotted
it
in
the
store
seeing
that
its
a
canned
scottish
ale
maybe
the
only
one
of
its
kind
taking
a
chance
on
a
six
pack
it
proved
to
be
decent
enough
not
the
best
but
not
bad
by
any
stretch
i
tried
it
both
from
the
can
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
glass
is
certainly
better
though
the
can
is
serviceable
the
nose
is
caramel
and
malty
as
might
be
expected
the
taste
of
roasted
malt
combined
with
a
little
smokiness
upfront
makes
for
a
nice
flavor
profile
but
it
ends
up
just
a
little
too
sweet
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
but
one
or
two
are
quite
agreeable
nice
coca
cola
color
and
malt
characteristics
pours
from
the
can
a
dark
brown
to
deep
red
color
with
a
smaller
tan
head
and
moderate
lacing
smokey
nose
with
a
bit
of
a
cocoa
edge
to
it
slight
scotch
alcohol
burn
taste
has
more
of
that
cocoa
powder
maltyness
in
it
theres
an
intensity
of
malt
flavors
up
front
lots
of
variation
of
chocolates
in
here
sweet
honey
bread
taste
and
dark
fruits
compliment
the
chocolate
an
earthy
hoppy
flavor
and
peat
smoke
slip
in
not
too
strong
but
they
add
another
element
to
the
flavor
profile
finish
is
a
bit
smoky
slightly
alcoholic
tasting
but
still
quite
sweet
and
more
caramelly
this
is
dessert
in
a
can
i
would
love
to
have
this
while
out
on
lake
michigan
or
golfing
overall
the
best
if
not
only
scottish
ale
in
a
can
for
a
canned
beer
this
is
phenomenal
i
think
this
beer
should
be
poured
in
a
glass
and
drank
good
sipping
beer
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
quite
a
bit
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
when
she
brought
me
a
20
glass
of
very
dark
ale
i
was
very
happy
i
think
that
the
smell
was
a
great
indicator
of
what
i
was
in
store
for
it
had
a
rich
coco
smell
with
a
very
earthy
undertone
when
i
drank
the
first
beer
i
thought
that
the
legs
where
very
nice
considering
the
low
carbonation
for
this
beer
as
i
drank
the
second
one
i
noticed
how
boozy
this
beer
is
i
had
just
started
my
second
when
i
felt
a
little
buzz
i
will
be
going
back
soon
for
another
d
great
for
heavy
sipping
i
went
back
to
the
pub
the
next
evening
and
ordered
another
old
chub
notes
a
high
quality
scottish
ale
available
in
a
can
if
berweries
more
breweries
were
willing
to
start
putting
their
products
in
cans
the
stigma
that
follows
cans
might
finally
start
to
wane
drinkability
was
pretty
good
a
nice
quality
beer
and
as
the
brewer
believes
if
you
put
a
good
quality
beer
in
a
can
youll
get
a
good
quality
beer
out
the
drinkability
is
impaired
somewhat
by
its
thickness
but
as
for
quality
this
one
is
a
new
favourite
the
8
is
nowhere
to
be
found
amid
the
rich
tones
of
this
brew
absolutely
stellar
i
cannot
believe
this
is
in
a
can
what
a
nice
suprise
to
find
a
craft
beer
in
a
can
other
than
a
nitrotype
ale
but
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
a
can
is
not
that
important
when
compared
to
the
quality
of
the
brew
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
deep
brick
red
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
sticks
around
until
the
end
of
the
beer
a
huge
aroma
of
roasted
malty
caramel
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
to
let
you
know
this
is
a
fairly
big
beer
great
flavors
youd
expect
from
a
quality
scottish
ale
sweet
smoky
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
a
tang
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
i
look
forward
to
bringing
these
on
campouts
drinkability
once
it
warms
up
this
beer
displays
all
of
its
complexities
very
nice
first
try
of
a
oskar
blues
brew

a
nice
rich
clear
burgundy
with
a
tight
creamy
slight
off
white
one

head
that
had
some
lasting
power
when
first
poured
the
aromas
seemed
muted
but
after
a
minute
nice
caramel
and
chocolate
infused
fruity
aromas
started
to
stick
out
with
a

of
smoke

the
style

my
opinionquite

caramelly

with

with

a
good
stab
at

there
was
always
a
thin
creamy
bit
of

all
thru

the
aroma

erupts
from
the

the
background
the
sweet

hug
the

your

while
the
roasted

bitterness
nips
at
the
sides
the
finish
is
a
nice
combo
of
easy
bitterness
and
a
smooth
smokey
note
tasty
good
to
see
another
craft
brew
in
a
can
though
tastes
of
brown
bread
and
molasses
dominate
making
the
brew
a
bit
overly
sweet
a
light
metallic
tang
and
slight
tealike
bitterness
is
no
match
for
the
big
sweet
malt
a
pleasant
rummy
fuminess
provides
a
nice
alcoholic
breath
well

the

pours
a

with
a
thick
frothy
tan

that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
complex

that
boasts
of
crystal

peated

it
has
a
sweet

aroma
with
a

nice
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth

goes

roasted

aftertastes
this
beer
comes
in
at
8
abv
but
it
hides
it
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
i
love
the
aroma
and
taste
it
has
just
enough
peated
malt
to
give
it
that
slightly
smokey
edge
but
it
is
dominated
with
sweet
crystal
and
chocolate
malts
so
easy
to
drink
ill
have
to
drink
more
i
saw
the
cans
and
i
couldnt
resist
suprisingly
good
very
full
and
rich
dont
fear
the
can
the
can
is
good
aroma
is
chocolate
malt
caramel
malt
and
you
definitely
detect
the
smoked
malt
dark
redbrown
with
a
thin
but
well
established
tan
head
huge
malt
flavors
chocolate
dominates
with
a
very
high
intesnity
flavor
followed
by
smokey
notes
and
a
touch
of
caramel
finish
is
clean
with
not
even
a
hint
of
the
8
alcohol
damn
fine
beer
it
poured
dark
brown
in
color
with
an
awesome
fullon
creamy
light
tan
head
thats
about
a
finger
and
a
half
deep
certainly
not
the
kind
of
head
i
would
expect
out
of
a
can
the
nose
is
also
exceptional
and
appropriately
forecast
the
complexity
of
the
beer
i
first
smell
some
intensely
sweet
butterscotch
notes
with
a
faint
cocoalike
background
the
mediumtoheavy
body
is
complimented
with
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
theres
a
wonderful
mix
of
flavors
here
a
pervasive
butterscotch
base
a
highly
creamy
maltiness
just
a
hint
of
decadent
dark
chocolate
notes
lingering
a
heavenly
mix
just
when
you
think
youre
done
an
awesome
peat
smoked
essence
flourishes
midbottle
it
finishes
with
a
muted
sweetness
and
a
juicy
caramel
aspect
that
leaves
you
quenched
and
thirsting
for
more
the
easiest
drinking
scottish
ale
ive
ever
encountered
sensational
d
very
easy
to
sip
i
still
would
not
drink
it
out
of
the
can
a
beer
like
this
needs
a
glass
no
matter
what
one
of
the
most
amazing
beers
in
a
can
id
easily
have
this
beer
around
all
of
the
time
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
a
can
without
a
doubt
received
from
zorro
in
bif
24
scots
wha
hey
i
was
so
eager
to
try
this
beer
as
it
came
in
a
can
id
always
heard
the
myth
that
beer
tasted
better
out
of
a
bottle
seemed
psychological
to
me
well
this
canned
beer
is
one
mighty
fine
tasting
product
the
appearance
was
a
brownish
burgundy
color
with
a
large
head
that
dissappeared
rather
quickly
the
smell
was
a
very
inviting
smoky
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
was
a
very
rich
maltiness
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
this
is
a
good
example
of
scottish
ale
rich
and
caramely
smooth
slightly
smoky
and
a
very
low
hop
character
if
it
wasnt
for
the
abv
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
well
made
and
recommended
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
can
yet
and
that
includes
all
those
nitro
imports
the
beer
is
very
dark
brown
almost
stoutlike
with
a
disappointing
head
but
after
that
its
great
the
aroma
is
strong
toffee
caramel
malt
and
toasty
with
some
hints
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
flavor
follows
that
up
perfectly
rich
and
robust
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
a
deep
malt
profile
and
a
lot
of
extraspecial
flavors
like
caramel
and
toffee
again
as
well
as
some
slight
dried
fruit
flavors
and
enough
bitterness
for
balance
given
that
this
should
be
a
sweeter
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
thick
awesome
as
i
smelled
this
ale
the
roasted
chocolate
smokey
nuts
and
some
floural
essence
is
very
present
maybe
honeydew
lilacs
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
sweet
up
front
with
chocolate
malt
that
penatrates
to
core
of
the
palate
then
a
small
hint
of
bitterness
rises
up
from
the
malted
chocolate
to
relax
the
palate
after
the
sweetness
and
finished
with
a
smokey
smooth
coating
on
the
throat
like
a
finely
made
bechemel
sauce
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
one
that
i
wish
i
bought
more
of
packaged
in
a
12oz
aluminum
can
that
wouldnt
look
out
of
place
in
the
cola
aisle
never
judge
a
book
old
chub
eh
sounds
more
like
a
actually
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
out
of
a
can
this
far
surpassed
my
expectations
i
was
expecting
something
bland
and
average
nothing
too
bold
what
i
got
was
a
beer
with
a
very
strong
malt
backbone
and
alcohol
kick
the
smell
was
just
as
you
would
expect
with
a
strong
scottish
style
a
little
smokey
big
malt
some
light
peat
and
an
alcohol
tinge
all
in
all
a
great
beer
its
definately
one
of
the
more
drinkable
of
this
style
dont
know
if
it
would
be
a
good
conversion
beer
but
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
give
to
someone
whos
looking
to
expand
their
palate
a
bit
i
just
wish
sc
would
get
rid
of
this
stupid
cap
law
so
we
could
get
it
down
here
translucent
dark
brown
with
a
large
off
white
head
sticky
bubbles
and
a
stubborn
18
inch
head
remains
smell
is
smoky
chocolatey
malts
with
a
little
raisin
or
prune
mixed
in
sweet
chocolate
and
mild
alcohol
throughout
the
taste
with
a
long
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
light
for
such
a
sweet
brew
drinkability
is
not
bad
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
session
work
gotta
try
one
poured
a
very
deep
brawon
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
massive
tannish
puffy
longlasting
head
beautiful
lacing
ont
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
a
complex
and
superb
moxture
of
caramel
chocolate
biitter
toffee
coffee
and
dark
fruits
figs
dates
very
nice
taste
is
roasted
malt
all
the
way
medium
sweet
as
it
should
be
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
it
touches
the
tongue
as
smooth
as
velvet
finishes
with
a
nice
mild
dryness
and
is
the
perfect
ending
for
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
i
would
almost
consider
this
to
be
more
like
a
wee
heavy
excellent
firstrate
beer
drinkability
and
overall
while
i
wouldnt
label
it
a
scottish
ale
this
is
a
killer
brew
whatever
style
you
give
it
its
a
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
go
for
this
not
the
daves
pale
ale
yes
craft
beer
in
a
can
smell
is
toasty
roasty
and
smokey
goodness
the
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malt
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
bitterness
of
the
the
roasted
malt
is
nicely
balanced
by
tons
of
sweetness
too
it
feels
nice
in
the
mouth
but
man
is
this
beer
drinkable
you
never
could
guess
its
8
like
dales
pale
ale
its
an
amazing
beer
from
a
can
very
very
nice
a
good
drinkable
scotch
ale
that
i
will
certainly
enjoy
again
the
finest
canned
beer
ive
had
but
that
doesnt
say
alot
when
compared
to
the
competition
good
stuff
and
i
have
to
give
credit
to
a
small
local
brewery
who
pushes
the
packaging
envelope
especially
considering
its
abv
12
ounce
can
pours
dark
as
molasas
amber
minor
tan
head
and
some
blotchy
lacing
left
behind
nose
is
richly
of
peaty
sweet
malt
this
is
a
rich
flavorful
scottish
ale
bold
full
flavor
and
tasty
fine
brew
indeed
out
of
a
can
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
velvety
smooth
with
a
long
soft
finish
well
worth
a
try
and
at
8
this
one
packs
a
punch
as
well
nicely
done
oskars
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
dark
tan
head
above
the
dark
deep
burgundy
brown
brew
head
fades
rather
quickly
to
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
with
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
dark
hearty
malts
with
a
smokey
peat
tinge
running
through
it
and
alcohol
apparent
taste
is
just
what
i
would
expect
from
a
scottishstyle
ale
smoke
and
dark
malts
upfront
a
grain
husky
heartiness
to
it
all
and
then
sliding
into
the
lightly
fruity
alcohol
notes
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
great
on
this
one
wow
this
was
in
a
can
poured
from
an
aluminum
can
transported
to
nyc
from
seattles
bottleworks
beer
store
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
dark
almost
opaque
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
recedes
to
almost
nothing
smells
like
maple
brown
sugar
tastes
like
more
of
the
same
toasted
brown
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
smoke
as
well
as
a
bit
of
tootsie
rolllike
cocoa
powder
slightly
dry
and
bitter
finish
but
malt
is
the
master
here
mouthfeel
like
the
dales
pale
ale
falls
a
bit
short
but
for
this
style
it
works
a
little
bit
better
another
impressive
canned
brew
from
oskar
blues
pours
from
the
can
with
a
tight
light
brown
head
settling
over
clear
dark
reddish
brown
liquid
the
nose
is
dark
chocolate
some
sweet
and
roasted
maltiness
behind
it
taste
is
heavy
on
sweet
maltmild
molasses
chocolate
light
hoppiness
and
some
alcohol
all
wrapped
within
a
viscuous
mouthfeel
finishes
slightly
smoky
delicious
mouthfeel
is
smooth
sweet
and
well
balanced
nicest
beer
out
of
a
can
ive
had
i
do
wish
for
a
touch
more
complexity
but
this
is
still
a
very
well
put
together
and
enjoyable
beer
can
obtained
from
liquor
mart
boulder
and
consumed
a
couple
evenings
later
poours
a
halffinger
light
tan
head
over
a
very
dark
redmahogeny
liquid
crystal
clear

dark
rich

and
chocoalte
tastes
potently
caramel
with
a
little
bit
of
sour
some
chocolate
and
dates
alcohol
sting
in
the
finish
that
persists
into
the
aftertaste
md
body
and
over
carbonated
nary
a
pfft
when
this
one
opens
sounded
like
there
was
no
carbonation
in
this
one
at
all
pours
a
very
dark
rubybrown
in
color
minimal
head
aromas
are
certainly
sweet
lots
of
caramel
sugary
toffee
maybe
some
dark
fruits
as
well
touch
of
etoh
some
smoke
complex
flavor
is
tasty
again
lots
of
sweetness
here
with
a
good
heath
bar
impersonation
bit
of
warmth
in
the
belly
at
the
end
thinner
than
expected
but
not
enough
to
turn
up
my
nose
who
would
ever
have
thought
a
canned
beer
would
get
a
4
in
drinkability
heres
a
good
beer
for
tailgating
before
the
football
game
screw
those
macors
in
their
plastic
bottles
i
am
running
out
today
to
stock
up
on
this
puppy
oskar
blues
old
chub
pours
a
clear
very
dark
mahogany
body
with
glimmering
ruby
highlights
beneath
a
full
head
of
creamy
tan
foam
that
slowly
dwindles
to
a
wide
collar
the
nose
suggests
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
roastiness
with
the
initial
whiff
and
then
some
darker
chocolate
and
a
mild
fruitiness
appear
its
full
bodied
and
creamysmooth
across
the
palate
with
a
restrained
carbonation
the
flavor
is
richly
malty
with
notes
of
chocolateflavored
toffee
caramel
a
hint
of
coffee
and
more
dark
chocolate
the
bitterness
is
restrained
but
firm
enough
to
balance
it
and
its
never
cloying
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
some
mild
roastiness
linger
in
the
finish
along
with
a
note
of
peatsmoked
malt
overall
it
may
be
a
bit
chocolatey
but
other
than
that
this
wee
heavy
is
dead
on
certainly
worth
trying
uf
delightfully
suprised
by
this
canned
beauty
1
finger
of
caramel
colored
head
on
dark
brew
with
a
faint
amber
glow
head
goes
down
to
a
thin
bubbly
layer
i
smell
chocolate
caramel
and
toasted
malts
carmel
sweetness
comes
out
first
with
a
little
bitterness
in
the
end
to
balance
after
it
warms
up
a
little
it
becomes
thick
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
rich
and
complex
yet
decently
smooth
this
is
a
winner
i
drank
this
one
on
a
boiling
hot
day
and
liked
it
i
imagine
id
appreciate
the
complexity
chocolate
coffee
and
on
and
on
more
on
a
cold
day
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
really
well
made
its
not
trying
any
smoke
and
mirror
tricks
by
overwhelming
drinkers
with
certain
tastes
its
kind
of
subtle
in
its
way
there
are
a
nice
amount
of
hops
for
such
a
rich
malty
beer
awww
just
try
it
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
this
is
an
excellent
american
rendition
of
a
strong
scottish
ale
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
im
impressed
with
the
smoked
maltiness
and
masked
abv
more
impressed
that
this
comes
out
of
a
can
over
all
a
fine
beer
best
ever
ina
can
will
have
again
a
ruddyfaced
amber
thinnish
froth
if
you
must
pour
that
doesnt
say
much
before
goodbye
this
is
a
malt
bomb
dried
fruit
caramel
jamcovered
toast
points
this
would
raise
my
kilt
once
but
i
wouldnt
dance
around
kicking
up
my
knees
over
it
bit
smoky
toasty
and
warming
almost
too
sweet
old
chub
in
a
can
this
would
be
really
nice
on
a
late
summer
camping
trip
loved
this
beer
drank
from
the
can
so
appearance
rating
is
dead
center
hey
they
went
to
alot
of
trouble
to
get
it
into
the
can
so
why
not
use
it
also
their
little
blurbs
on
the
can
lead
one
to
believe
they
intend
for
you
to
enjoy
it
from
the
can
hard
to
get
a
read
on
the
nose
through
the
little
hole
in
the
can
but
i
did
detect
some
sweet
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
incredible
chocolate
coffee
toffee
sweet
malt
syrup
not
really
scotch
ale
territory
in
my
opinion
but
hey
pleasantly
thick
in
the
mouth
almost
comforting
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
a
dangerous
trait
in
a
beer
with
8
abv
go
git
yo
self
some
at
first
glance
i
thought
whats
up
with
a
seemingly
upscale
scotch
ale
in
a
can
well
the
people
at
oskar
blues
pretty
much
pulled
it
off
pours
a
generous
lacy
head
that
caused
me
to
let
it
settle
in
before
draining
the
can
smells
very
very
malty
with
hints
of
raisins
and
plums
taste
is
very
deep
and
rich
like
the
best
scotch
ales
without
the
faintest
trace
of
hops
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
that
suprised
me
i
had
no
idea
whatsoever
what
think
of
this
stuff
when
i
first
saw
it
scottish
ale
from
the
usa
in
a
can
called
old
chub
what
in
bloody
hell
is
this
it
looks
decent
very
very
dark
red
in
colour
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
into
a
thin
haze
over
the
surface
of
the
liquid
the
smell
is
alright
i
suppose
a
little
malty
not
really
much
here
didnt
smell
like
much
of
anything
the
taste
however
is
fantastic
this
is
almost
a
smoke
beer
quite
malty
and
very
very
smoky
in
flavour
very
tasty
indeed
absolutely
full
of
smoke
flavour
and
the
mouthfeel
very
very
smooth
i
do
not
hand
out
5
0s
very
often
at
all
but
here
one
is
certainly
in
order
this
is
very
very
smooth
and
easy
going
brew
the
package
suggests
that
this
is
just
awful
i
mean
look
at
it
a
scottish
ale
from
the
usa
in
a
6pk
can
package
called
old
chub
for
heavens
sake
who
thinks
this
sounds
tasty
i
do
however
encourage
those
who
doubt
it
to
try
it
it
is
indeed
very
surprising
i
will
buy
it
again
this
certainly
isnt
the
most
interesting
of
heavy
malty
beers
the
taste
is
of
brown
and
caramel
malt
and
is
somewhat
sweet
there
is
body
to
it
but
the
process
of
drinking
from
a
can
makes
it
difficult
to
fully
appreciate
flavors
a
clean
aftertaste
leaves
only
a
hint
of
smokiness
and
a
desire
for
more
and
more
hmmm
maybe
this
is
perfect
for
camping
the
strangest
thing
about
this
beer
stranger
than
it
being
from
a
can
is
the
aftertaste
an
almost
acrid
sweetness
that
does
not
sit
well
with
me
i
was
only
able
to
finish
half
of
the
can
may
be
the
best
beer
ever
put
in
to
a
can
a
fine
scotch
ale
a
perfect
night
cap
on
a
cold
february
night
drinkability

this
is
a
thick
satisfying
ale
that
is
well
worth
the
1
49can
price
tag
i
wont
make
any
comments
about
swallowing
old
chub
all
night
long
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
this
is
more
than
a
gimmick
taste
is
of
rich
caramel
malt
and
then
the
chocolate
malt
takes
over
and
gives
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
as
it
finishes
smoky
smooth
and
creamy
something
is
not
quite
right
but
the
taste
is
fine
something
just
a
bit
haphazard
but
its
very
good
and
drinkable
the
best
canned
beer
ive
had
outside
of
youngs
chocolate
stout
in
the
nitro
can
drinkability
is
high
way
easy
to
drink
you
would
never
know
it
is
an
8
brew
from
the
taste
theres
a
definite
smoky
malt
to
the
aroma
and
something
that
reminds
me
of
peanuts
something
about
peat
smoke
is
reminiscent
of
boiled
peanuts
to
me
for
some
reason
theres
a
big
dose
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
with
the
peat
smoke
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
slight
bit
of
cocoa
a
bit
sticky
but
very
tasty
the
can
doesnt
make
any
negative
difference
overall
a
nice
wellbalanced
scottish
ale
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
in
a
can
tawnycrimson
bronze
in
hue
beautiful
color
depth
when
held
to
a
light
a
shiny
coppery
color
emerged
around
the
edges
a
foamy
beige
head
reached
two
fingers
in
height
on
a
slightly
harder
pour
than
normal
the
head
retention
was
good
as
it
took
a
long
moment
before
it
collapsed
to
a
soapy
cap
then
collar
the
subsequent
lacing
was
very
webby
unorganized
but
quite
prevalent
the
bouquet
had
good
potency
lovely
fruity
sweet
notes
upfront
but
the
closer
i
stuck
my
nose
to
the
glass
the
more
malty
the
beer
smelled
notes
of
smoke
chocolate
burnt
grains
as
a
whole
it
is
very
nice
inviting
the
palate
is
plenty
tasty
vague
smoky
and
burnt
malts
a
hint
of
sweet
fruitiness
a
fair
amount
of
roastiness
too
maybe
a
kiss
of
grassy
hops
at
the
finish
long
aftertaste
than
just
begs
me
to
eat
some
grilled
meat
i
like
the
taste
might
fine
it
isnt
that
complex
but
i
can
live
with
that
as
the
flavor
construction
is
well
thoughtout
and
nicely
balanced
i
never
would
have
guessed
this
had
an
8
abv
i
couldnt
taste
a
lick
of
alcohol
nor
did
i
feel
it

the
mouthfeel
was
very
ordinary
it
is
also
a
bit
undercarbonated
kind
of
slick
too
but
nothing
to
really
complain
about
this
is
highly
drinkable
i
cant
believe
a
beer
like
this
is
available
in
a
can
beer
drinkers
in
co
are
so
lucky
bastards
old
chub
is
labeled
as
a
scottishstyle
ale
maybe
a
scotch
ale
is
more
accurate
anyway
i
purchased
a
single
can
for
1
49
in
fort
collins
recommended
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
color
and
is
topped
by
a
good
light
brown
head
sticky
malty
candied
notes
waft
from
my
glass
as
i
pour
when
i
go
in
for
a
deeper
sniff
i
get
toasted
malt
notes
and
a
hint
of
roast
malt
at
the
end
wow
this
has
a
good
solid
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
rich
body
there
are
lots
of
malt
flavors
here
caramel
biscuit
quite
chewy
actually
perhaps
a
hint
of
roasty
smoke
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
also
subtly
fruity
with
notes
of
raisins
in
it
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
in
a
can
certainly
the
best
i
have
had
up
to
this
point
the
hop
perception
is
appropriately
quite
low
with
only
a
hint
of
balancing
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
damn
taste
for
any
beer
and
it
really
hits
the
spot
right
now
12
ounce
can
i
will
no
longer
shy
away
from
a
can
after
having
this
beer
cabonation
is
sparse
somewhat
light
in
flavor
chocolate
subtle
smokiness
sweet
malts
and
a
nice
hop
bite
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
until
then
finish
when
it
thins
out
and
becomes
watery
nice
flavor
profile
throughout
the
beer
nothing
great
but
totally
solid
the
second
canned
beer
from
this
great
colorado
brewery
and
as
it
sets
in
the
glass
a
quite
deep
sanguineous
color
with
ruby
high
lights
head
is
portly
in
size
creamy
in
texture
and
the
color
a
toothsome
light
tan
as
the
head
slowly
evaporates
a
fine
sheet
of
lace
develops
to
seal
off
the
glass
and
as
its
consumed
a
fine
set
of
irish
rings
is
left
behind
to
track
your
progress
sweet
malt
nose
hints
of
toasted
grain
fresh
crisp
and
quite
pleasing
to
the
olfactory
and
ocular
senses
start
is
sweet
nicely
malted
top
rich
and
pleasant
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
benignly
acidic
the
hops
delightful
in
their
spiciness
aftertaste
quite
dry
a
fine
representative
to
the
style
and
one
unfortunately
we
dont
see
much
of
here
in
the
west
nice
dark
rubybrown
with
a
finely
beaded

mildly
peaty

dotted

by
a
somewhat
sharp

and
bitter
chocolate
finish
very
mild
soft
mouthfeel
you
would
never
guess
that
this
is
a
8
0
beer
not
bad
at
all
but
id
probably
pick
up
the
dales
pale
ale
given
a
choice
of
the
two
it
was
what
i
expected
a
sweet
and
salty
wee
heavy
not
my
first
choice
when
i
want
the
style
but
definitely
will
come
back
to
this
when
i
want
something
decadent
poured
a
semiclear
reddish
brown
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
a
very
good
appearance
quite
true
to
style
scents
of
caramel
chocolate
sweet
berries
a
light
saltiness
and
hints
of
molasses
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
an
odd
scotch
ale
fruitier
than
many
but
with
caramel
present
as
is
usual
the
saltiness
is
an
interesting
addition
not
as
richly
malty
as
it
should
be
however
which
is
a
demerit
flavor
begins
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
molasses
and
a
noticeable
berry
presence
and
plum
and
dried
fruit
esters
with
an
extremely
light
saltiness
middle
continues
these
flavors
but
adds
a
light
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
finish
is
lightly
dry
with
notes
of
lightly
roasted
malt
and
bittersweet
chocolate
coming
to
the
fore
yet
with
the
aforementioned
flavors
also
still
present
in
lower
levels
and
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
apparent
aftertaste
is
light
roasted
malt
caramel
bready
malt
and
light
coffee
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
scotch
ale
at
a
light
level
with
a
bit
of
the
advertised
salt
and
a
lot
less
malt
than
is
typical
for
the
style
still
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
thick
feel
with
a
smooth
alcohol
present
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
good
light
end
scotch
ale
true
to
form
overall
this
is
an
okay
scotch
ale
the
flavor
could
use
more
work
and
the
aroma
is
good
but
not
as
good
as
some
still
pretty
good
taste
is
caramel
upfront
tart
cherries
in
the
middle
and
through
the
close
smooth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
isnt
as
easy
as
i
hoped
lacks
for
me
the
melding
of
flavors
maybe
itll
grow
on
me
as
i
finish
the
bottle
o
i
would
pass
on
this
it
tastes
artificial
great
beer
very
nice
variation
on
the
style
caramel
up
front
but
with
the
sea
salt
lingering
and
countering
the
sweetness
nicely
done
overall
this
is
so
tasty
could
be
a
good
dessert
beer
but
a
bomber
anytime
is
perfect
i
love
the
salt
and
caramel
perfect
amount
of
each
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
dessert
in
a
glass
type
of
beer
since
the
salted
caramel
is
more
of
a
complementary
addition
to
the
malt
still
solid
for
what
it
is
rock
solid
sweet
nose
minimal
head
lots
of
carbonation
the
sweet
caramelmalt
flavours
of
this
beer
are
greatly
appreciated
because
they
are
precisely
what
the
label
advertises
this
is
a
fine
beer
sessionable
in
spite
of
the
high
alcohol
content
this
tasting
is
part
of
my
own
personal
supplement
to
the
beer
advent
calendar
looking
forward
to
further
outstanding
offerings
sampled
on
tap
at
biercraft
on
crambie
street
vancouver
light
brown
to
red
brick
color
with
a
salty
malty
seaside
smell
without
the
fish
taste
of
caramel
and
toffee
maybe
slightly
over
carbonated
with
a
thick
body
hops
are
subtle
and
floral
in
keeping
with
the
style
expected
more
of
a
kick
considering
the
alcohol
percentage
but
goes
down
overall
very
too
smoothly
would
definitely
have
another
one
delicious
caramel
salt
thick
full
mouthfeel
warming
tastes
like
a
salted
caramel
on
tap
up
on
the
roof
at
whole
foods
gowanus
brooklyn
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
rich
flavor
is
that
malt
or
caramel
a
nice
combination
of
both
to
me
salt
i
did
not
get
the
salt
but
perhaps
it
was
an
essential
part
of
the
overall
deep
rich
flavor
profile
a
not
cloying
sweetness
too
that
meant
the
flavor
stayed
away
from
rich
deep
stout
or
porter
territory
although
the
body
did
approach
that
of
a
stout
d
this
was
a
really
nice
scotch
ale
with
scent
and
taste
just
as
advertised
the
body
was
ok
and
the
finish
was
smooth
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
not
quite
top
tier
but
still
a
solid
brew
this
is
a
malt
bomb
without
much
to
balance
it
out
the
malt
however
is
damn
tasty
this
is
a
delicious
scotch
ale
perhaps
the
only
the
problem
is
there
is
little
to
balance
it
out
but
the
salt
is
a
nice
interplay
d
as
a
lover
of
the
style
i
cant
help
be
be
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
offering
this
is
a
pedestrian
at
best
scotch
ale
other
than
the
aroma
this
one
is
sub
par
in
every
category
i
cant
recommend
and
wouldnt
partake
again
in
the
future
if
i
saw
this
one
sitting
on
the
shelf
o
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
full
in
body
compared
to
ther
beers
in
the
style
but
this
makes
it
comparatively
easy
to
drink
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
syrup
caramel
candy
and
toffee
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
toast
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
earth
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
caramel
and
toffee
presence
that
works
quite
well
with
the
base
beer
poured
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
from
a
22
oz
bottle
poured
from
the
bomber
into
an
english
pub
glass
a
deep
reddish
bronze
or
brown
brew
with
a
shocking
lack
of
head
upon
pouring
i
get
a
fleeting
inch
or
so
of
whitish
bubbles
that
disappear
almost
instantly
scottish
ales
are
not
known
for
good
head
retention
but
this
was
nevertheless
interesting
aroma
is
rich
and
sweet
tons
of
toffee
and
dark
fruit
raisin
date
and
maybe
a
hint
of
citruspiney
hops
foreshadowing
things
to
come
palate
was
where
this
brew
lost
me
a
little
immediate
effect
is
burnt
caramel
and
boozy
applepear
cider
with
some
vanilla
and
a
vague
salty
presence
coming
through
the
hops
are
leafy
and
resinous
making
this
brew
rather
medicinal
and
bitter
for
the
style
usually
i
dig
parallel
49s
hoppy
excesses
but
not
so
much
here
citric
and
fruity
is
the
main
sensory
impression
for
me
although
a
pleasant
malty
smoke
does
build
over
time
thinbodied
for
a
wee
heavy
and
comes
across
as
quite
fizzy
despite
the
absence
of
head
i
guess
all
the
gas
lurks
in
the
brew
finishes
wet
with
a
mixture
of
toffee
smoke
sour
fruit
and
pine
final
assessment
is
that
there
is
some
merit
but
id
pass
on
another
opportunity
i
am
looking
for
a
thicker
mouthfeel
and
a
richer
sweetness
with
this
style
this
beer
indeed
malty
but
there
are
too
many
fruit
and
hop
effects
going
on
here
that
detract
from
the
caramel
flavors
overall
interesting
take
on
a
scottish
ale
not
my
favorite
a
little
too
sweet
but
still
a
good
brew
poured
a
brown
body
with
good
head
and
lace
with
an
aroma
that
is
a
little
salty
and
dry
but
caramel
toffee
and
roasted
malts
come
out
taste
is
more
sweet
than
aroma
as
sweet
caramel
seems
to
coat
my
tongue
the
salt
aspect
is
there
i
guess
but
one
could
also
describe
it
as
a
hint
of
toffee
or
bitter
chocolate
and
theres
a
smoothness
to
this
beer
as
its
not
lightbodied
but
goes
down
lightbodied
all
right
not
a
complex
beer
but
one
that
interests
me
as
ive
not
had
too
many
sweet
beers
like
this
not
for
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
my
bottle
missing
a
lot
of
malt
and
toffee
richness
and
thickness
here
says
added
with
sea
salt
and
caramel
even
that
really
didnt
seem
to
help
in
the
flavor
department
it
is
however
a
much
lighter
scotch
ale
and
is
easy
drinking
but
nothing
really
exciting
in
the
realm
of
this
style
which
is
normally
rich
and
large
my
first
stab
at
a
parallel
49
beer
from
bc
pours
a
rich
clear
deep
bronze
with
a
thinner
but
well
sustained
slight
off
white
head
atop
there
is
alot
of
malty
things
going
on
in
the
nosefirst
off
i
pick
up
some
caramel
toffee
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
whiskeyyeah
you
can
tell
its
gonna
be
sweet
but
its
inviting
it
is
sweetvanilla
and
caramel
are
predominantlike
a
sweet
caramel
chewthe
saltiness
is
starting
to
come
into
play
after
i
swallow
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
very
well
could
be
the
best
dessert
pairing
beer
i
have
come
acrosseven
better
than
any
chocolate
stout
different
in
a
good
way
prost
lampertland
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
second
glass
was
better
than
the
first
an
excellent
replacement
for
dessert
whatever
about
adherence
to
style
or
gimmicky
flavors
this
is
just
darn
tasty
o
the
scotch
ale
aspect
is
a
little
overwhelmed
here
but
the
salted
caramel
aspect
is
so
tasty
that
all
is
forgiven
this
is
a
must
try
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
am
impressed
with
the
results
this
totally
works
and
holds
its
own
on
its
own
merits
im
normally
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
due
to
excessive
sweetness
however
this
has
easily
become
a
quick
favourite
and
one
worth
revisiting
i
was
expecting
a
whole
lot
more
on
the
salty
side
of
things
given
the
name
and
label
info
but
as
it
turns
out
this
is
more
of
warning
shot
across
our
collective
bows
for
the
inherent
and
insidious
pleasantunhealthy
duality
is
just
as
imperceptible
here
as
it
is
in
our
daily
grocerydrone
lives
anyway
this
is
still
a
pretty
tasty
albeit
sweet
scottishstyle
ale
moderated
by
the
aforementioned
social
conventions
nix
that
i
suggest
drinking
this
for
its
taste
and
nothing
else
overall
this
is
quite
good
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
o
i
hadnt
had
the
chance
yet
to
try
any
parallel
49
beers
until
the
black
christmas
and
this
is
only
the
second
i
was
able
to
find
in
store
that
said
it
came
recommended
and
it
was
suggested
it
would
be
a
good
post
dinner
dessert
beer
which
i
found
intriguing
as
a
wee
heavy
i
would
say
theyve
done
a
nice
job
with
the
style
and
i
would
say
theyve
taken
a
part
of
the
scottish
ale
slightly
alcoholicwarmingsweet
and
taken
those
characteristics
and
played
on
them
by
adding
the
sea
salt
which
is
noticeable
and
turned
this
into
a
delicious
dessert
style
beer
not
typical
of
this
style
everything
is
well
balanced
making
it
not
only
easy
drinking
but
making
sure
all
the
flavours
stand
out
i
can
see
why
people
are
giving
cudos
to
this
young
brewery
as
they
are
already
on
the
right
track
with
a
decent
offering
of
beers
out
there
worth
trying
especially
if
you
like
scotch
ales
and
goes
really
well
at
this
time
of
year
overall
a
unique
twist
on
a
scotch
ale
by
adding
sea
salt
a
very
tasty
beer
and
an
impressive
offering
by
parallel
49
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
the
store
shelf
these
guys
have
done
very
well
for
beginners
ive
had
very
good
luck
from
their
brews
and
cant
wait
for
them
to
tackle
some
of
my
favorite
styles
keep
em
coming
overall
well
as
advertised
its
definitely
a
salted
caramel
beer
very
nice
and
will
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
o
the
caramel
and
sea
salt
are
both
present
without
being
overbearing
which
is
really
nice
coming
from
something
that
easily
couldve
been
a
mediocre
novelty
beer
very
impressed
with
this
brew
from
parallel
49
as
i
have
been
with
everything
ive
tasted
from
the
boys
on
triumph
street
ill
definitely
pick
up
a
couple
bottles
of
this
before
theyre
gone
wow
this
beer
smells
like
a
salted
caramel
latte
from
starbucks
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
all
about
the
added
flavour
not
about
the
beer
what
i
mean
is
there
is
pretty
much
zero
beer
flavour
here
the
taste
is
entirely
dominated
by
an
outofthisworld
extremely
delicious
caramel
flavour
with
a
slightly
salted
aftertaste
the
caramel
is
rich
and
thick
with
hints
of
maple
brown
sugar
and
plum
the
finish
is
mostly
where
i
taste
the
salt
and
it
pairs
perfectly
with
the
caramel
i
suppose
what
is
making
me
rave
about
this
beer
is
the
intensity
of
the
flavour
i
was
expecting
a
scotch
ale
with
hints
of
salty
caramel
but
really
this
is
salty
caramel
with
a
hint
of
scotch
ale
beer
and
dessert
all
wrapped
up
in
one
great
bottle
o
really
well
puttogether
novelty
ale
its
not
something
id
drink
a
lot
of
but
id
be
really
happy
to
see
this
every
season
o
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
the
caramel
could
have
been
overdone
however
it
manages
to
enhance
and
highlight
the
brew
the
salty
flavours
are
represented
by
the
mineral
notes
like
adding
a
small
amount
of
salt
to
water
with
3
seasonal
releases
this
winter
all
good
as
well
parallel
49
is
my
choice
for
new
brewery
of
the
year
this
is
a
classic
wee
heavy
that
has
salted
caramel
added
the
colour
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
smooth
i
noticed
more
hops
than
usual
for
this
beer
which
helps
balance
out
the
caramel
notes
on
the
finish
the
salted
caramel
is
not
too
intrusive
but
rather
works
with
the
malty
midbody
great
cold
weather
beer
that
goes
so
well
with
bread
pudding
the
body
is
full
and
even
thick
even
as
a
heavy
carbonation
tries
to
cut
it
it
leans
cloying
but
the
crispness
helps
some
and
it
isnt
too
syrupy
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
wee
heavy
it
took
the
non
traditional
smoked
malt
aspect
and
i
didnt
mind
that
in
that
aspect
it
seemed
to
be
pretty
similar
to
dark
horses
scotty
karate
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
crisp
a
little
creamy
slightly
sticky
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
would
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
rule
out
drinking
two
but
that
would
be
my
limit
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
complexity
it
was
fairly
complex
for
the
style
and
i
liked
that
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
body
just
wasnt
a
little
thicker
but
in
the
end
that
wasnt
a
big
deal
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wouldt
mind
seeing
how
it
ages
i
would
recommend
giving
this
a
try
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
especially
if
you
like
the
wee
heavys
with
smoked
malts
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
think
it
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
from
this
series
that
ive
had
its
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
or
my
favorite
wee
heavy
but
i
would
say
its
just
a
notch
under
scotty
karate
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
good

all

great

and
very
smooth

for
the

a
very
enjoyable
offering
the
taste
however
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
wee
heavy
it
had
too
much
of
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
and
not
enough
barley
taste
i
have
had
a
lot
of
wee
heavys
from
other
brewers
and
this
unfortunately
doesnt
live
up
to
the
rest
samuel
adams
imperial
series
scotch
ale
inspired
wee
heavy
is
one
intriguing
brew
i
was
lucky
to
stumble
across
a
4
pack
recently
and
sampled
a
couple
and
put
the
others
away
to
age
them
to
try
again
later
the
beer
poured
a
very
darkamber
brown
with
a
modest
creamy
head
with
retention
and
some
lacing
as
well
i
found
the
taste
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
to
be
smokey
and
smooth
with
a
very
adequate
mouthfeel
and
enjoyed
the
peat
smoked
malts
as
well
i
found
the
high
abv
to
be
hidden
very
well
within
this
sweet
tasting
beer
overall
i
found
the
brew
to
be
very
intense
and
complex
one
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
well
done
samuel
adams
overall
decent
but
the
flavor
has
room
for
improvement
drank
this
one
straight
out
of
the
bottle
smells
of
smoked
malts
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
alcohol
the
taste
matches
with
a
very
smokey
flavor
with
subtle
sweetness
through
out
this
was
my
first
of
the
sam
adams
imperial
line
of
beers
and
i
definitely
enjoined
it
from
my
tasting
notes
it
poured
a
dark
burnt
amber
almost
opaque
with
a
thin
tan
head
it
had
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
burnt
chocolate
the
flavor
was
very
bold
and
intense
like
a
barley
wine
with
a
sharper
smoky
burnt
malt
flavor
with
the
sweet
malt
hiding
underneath
this
was
a
big
complex
beer
that
deserves
the
imperial
moniker
tasty
taste
strong
but
not
over
powering
complex
and
almost
perfect
for
me
regardless
if
you
dont
like
scotch
ales
which
until
now
never
had
any
that
i
really
like
that
much
this
is
my
number
one
beer
not
style
american
beer
has
come
a
long
way
and
this
is
a
shining
example
but
not
the
only
one
in
the
imperial
series
that
is
not
only
head
and
shoulders
above
any
american
beer
but
any
foreign
made
beer
also
also
a
great
example
of
a
beer
that
is
well
worth
the
its
price
final
thoughts
id
heard
good
things
about
the
sam
adams
imperial
series
and
it
seems
i
heard
right
theres
a
lot
to
like
about
this
beer
well
done
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
overall
while
this
is
not
the
best
wee
heavy
i
have
come
across
it
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
peat
and
a
bit
less
sweetness
but
this
is
still
quite
enjoyable
revisited
and
tweaked
in

very
dark
with
heavy
head
and
mild
carbonation
chocolatey
caramel
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
coffee
beans
burnt
toasted
coffee
and
caramel
taste
with
heavy
alcohol
flavor
its
a
10
abv
and
you
can
really
taste
it
really
burnt
taste
this
is
for
people
who
ask
for
their
hot
dogs
burnt
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
got
better
as
it
warmed
the
peat
flavor
was
a
welcome
strong
suit
as
it
is
in
any
ale
of
this
sort
not
shy
with
the
alcohol
content
but
works
well
within
the
style
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
big
peat
smoke
in
a
big
beer
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
a
great
job
by
the
brew
wizards
at
samuel
adams
with
the
high
abv
one
should
not
serve
this
beverage
to
amateurs
children
or
any
small
mammals
do
not
attempt
to
subdue
complicated
algebraic
problems
drive
long
distances
or
preform
liver
transplants
on
your
drinking
buddy
while
consuming
wee
heavy
just
a
suggestion
overall
this
is
a
kick
ass
brew
be
careful
it
combines
high
alcohol
with
high
drinkability
the
look
smell
and
taste
of
this
concoction
is
delightful
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
of
the
imperial
series
i
was
surprisingly
impressed
with
this
beer
its
smooth
tasty
complex
and
balanced
on
the
sweet
side
would
go
good
with
dessert
or
for
dessert
underrated
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
decent
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
full
and
strong
components
of
coffee
tea
sweet
and
fall
spice
smoky
coffee
with
some
bittersweet
licorice
and
dark
chocolate
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
m
thick
like
an
oatmeal
stout
very
silky
and
viscous
does
not
feel
hot
even
though
we
are
approaching
10
abv
fine
to
get
you
through
on
a
cold
night
but
not
enough
to
make
up
for
its
deficiencies
aroma
and
flavor
were
somewhat
disjointed
aroma
was
far
sweeter
and
dark
fruit
forward
than
the
flavor
which
was
much
more
savory
there
may
be
a
bit
too
much
going
on
here
the
smoke
and
dark
berry
flavors
collide
somewhat
strangely
overall
this
is
the
first
scottish
ale
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
to
except
the
description
and
according
to
that
it
seems
to
be
spot
on
i
really
like
this
style
however
it
was
a
bit
sweet
but
really
liked
the
roasty
caramel
taste
o
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
and
a
soild
scotch
ale
better
than
skull
splitter
and
dirty
bastard
but
it
doesnt
compare
to
scotty
karate
overall
this
is
my
first
wee
heavy
i
enjoyed
it
if
this
is
one
of
the
middle
of
the
roads
for
this
beer
im
excited
to
try
the
better
ones
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
14
in
head
that
held
its
own
for
a
while
lots
of
sugars
and
maltiness
on
the
nose
brown
sugar
dark
rum
some
chocolate
notes
this
is
a
beer
that
stays
with
you
as
the
taste
and
smell
lingers
for
some
time
and
im
not
too
sure
that
that
is
a
good
thing
for
me
it
is
a
bit
too
syrupy
and
chewy
and
the
intense
sugars
and
alcohol
tend
to
overpower
at
times
theres
a
faint
pine
and
peat
taste
and
a
hint
of
basil
but
these
get
lost
amongst
the
frontloaded
barrage
of
sugary
booze
overall
a
nice
smoky
brew
that
is
good
to
sit
back
with
and
sip
slowly
while
being
warmed
by
all
the
boozy
and
roasty
flavors
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bold
beer
by
sam
adams
takes
the
style
by
the
horns
and
really
amps
up
from
their
usual
selection
but
overall
a
decent
flavor
very
thick
chewy
and
mouth
coating
feel
nicely
carbonated
a
sipper
for
sure
not
bad
not
great
this
was
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
if
i
were
to
have
one
complaint
it
would
be
that
it
was
slightly
too
sweet
beyond
that
this
was
a
really
solid
beer
it
had
great
malt
character
and
for
the
abv
it
had
great
drinkability
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
o
after
aging
for
about
a
year
this
beer
becomes
a
top
tier
wee
heavy
the
first
bottle
of
the
fourpack
from
about
a
year
ago
was
an
absolute
fireball
the
overwhelming
alcohol
heat
blunted
everything
else
after
a
year
this
beer
is
still
very
boozy
however
the
booziness
now
blends
with
and
compliments
a
pleasing
yeast
combination
of
breadiness
and
a
little
clove
and
the
grain
provides
a
very
nice
richness
to
the
flavor
there
is
also
a
very
pleasant
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
earthy
hops
this
beer
is
in
the
top
tier
of
wee
heavies
but
it
is
somewhere
is
middle
of
that
top
tier
o
i
have
to
first
say
that
while
i
might
be
a
beer
snob
i
dont
discount
sam
adams
carte
blanche
some
of
the
beers
i
cut
my
teeth
on
were
sam
adams
and
i
dont
mind
their
beers
this
one
though
is
a
one
trick
pony
and
gives
into
an
unrefined
alcohol
taste
over
some
added
complexities
of
a
beer
worth
sipping
i
like
wee
heavies
their
my
session
beer
style
of
choice
this
beer
is
average
with
quite
a
few
others
that
represent
the
style
better
o
im
not
gonna
say
this
is
fantastic
but
its
not
far
off
subtley
smokey
amazing
caramel
sweetness
nicely
cocoa
bittered
deep
dried
fruitiness
so
why
did
it
take
me
this
long
to
try
this
one
well
done
sam
well
done
indeed
o
im
very
surprised
this
clocks
in
at
10
abv
theres
no
pop
or
heat
at
all
that
pushes
through
interesting
take
on
the
style
as
the
chocolate
notes
suggest
more
of
a
rich
cocoa
porter
and
the
fruits
suggest
more
of
a
belgium
strong
ale
than
the
weeheavy
scotch
ale
that
it
is
in
the
end
the
deep
rich
caramels
and
dried
smokey
fruits
define
the
glass
this
would
make
a
good
alternative
for
an
afterdinner
drink
it
also
reminds
me
of
a
deep
rich
dark
chutney
it
made
a
tasty
nitecap
but
its
definitely
a
smallquantity
sipping
libation
recommended
to
experience
especially
if
one
thinks
the
best
samuel
adams
can
do
is
the
boston
lager
the
corner
tavern
recently
added
beside
the
bud
taps
because
everyones
asking
for
a
craft
beer
these
days
poured

covington

a
deep

some
slight

and

strong

aromas
malty
peat
i
mean
like
the
single
malt
kind
taste
is
very
boozey
but
full
of
peaty
scotch
malts
it
was
harsh
at
first
but
the
flavor
profile
really
developed
still
harsh
but
nice
flavor
overall
a
good
wee
but
not
amazing
i
guess
its

they

and
then
add
in
any
notes
i
notice
as
i
finish
he
beer
after
my
first
taste
i
was
reluctant
to
try
it
again
for
mouthfeel
that
flavor
was
just
way
too
much
much
of
two
things
i
dont
enjoy
in
a
beer
was
a

me
poured

notes
perhaps
a

complex

flavorful
the
alcohol
shows
through
a
bit
in
the
flavor
but
defininately
warming
medium
to
heavy

with
decent
creaminess
a
nice
take
on
a
wee
heavy
not
bad
could
use
a
little
more
balance
descent
scotch
ale
this
is
my
favorite
scotch
ale
and
it
is
a
heavy
hitter
brownred
color
no
head
to
speak
of
let
it
get
warm
and
the
alcohol
really
comes
out
very
sweet
and
malty
with
warm
alcohol
on
your
tongue
nice
dessert
beer
have
2
and
you
will
be
really
buzzing
a
bit
pricey
at
10
bucks
a
4
pack
but
well
worth
it
when
you
get
out
of
college
and
start
making
the
big
bucks
i
wish
this
was
just
a
bit
weaker
and
more
fullbodied
if
it
was
sweeter
and
more
sticky
to
the
mouthfeel
this
could
have
been
really
good
for
now
ill
take
it
for
what
its
worth
and
thats
a
decent
interpretation
of
this
style
that
wont
offend
or
blow
away
anyone
very
decent
representation
dark
chocolate
body
with
a
little
attractive
lace
and
head
toffee
nutty
mildly
smokey
aroma
above
average
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
for
the
style
and
a
10
barleywine
complexity
brown
sugar
and
aging
of
a
few
seasons
helped
overall
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
i
see
that
the
brothersndidnt
necessarily
like
it
but
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
beer
is
it
the
best
wee
heavy
you
will
ever
drink
no
is
it
worth
buying
and
trying
absolutely
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
although
i
likely
wouldnt
buy
it
just
because
for
the
money
i
can
get
founders
just
as
easy
which
is
outstanding
anyway
a
good
beer
for
sure
give
it
a
shot
next
time
i
see
this
pass
overall
for
a
10
abv
beer
this
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
there
is
no
alcohol
taste
whatsoever
im
not
sure
on
the
availability
of
this
beer
but
if
you
see
it
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
overall
a
very
solid
wee
heavy
nice
malts
and
the
smoked
peat
elements
are
very
good
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
originally
reviewed
04102011
overall
a
really
good
beer
nice
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
really
hide
its
abv
the
booze
is
there
as
is
the
body
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
at
all
so
far
the
two
imperial
series
beers
ive
had
imperial
white
and
double
bock
have
missed
the
mark
due
to
an
excessive
amount
of
sweetness
lets
see
if
a
style
thats
a
bit
smokier
and
maliter
can
fair
a
bit
better
this
beer
pours
out
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
tiny
head
the
aroma
is
actually
quite
nice
its
sweet
but
nicely
tempered
by
a
strong
amount
of
smoked
malts
coffee
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
very
good
although
its
a
bit
strange
for
the
style
it
almost
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
stout
with
strong
coffee
roast
and
dark
fruit
flavors
the
bit
of
peaty
smoked
malt
does
send
it
a
little
more
to
the
scotch
ale
side
but
really
this
just
tastes
like
a
solid
imperial
stout
with
a
twist
the
mouthfeel
is
full
rich
and
creamy
this
beers
a
sipper
for
sure
you
wont
fly
right
though
this
one
all
said
its
a
solid
beer
though
i
enjoyed
it
although
its
not
necessarily
what
i
wanted
from
it
as
youd
expect
it
warms
really
well
and
by
the
time
i
was
23
done
about
30
minutes
later
i
was
sure
i
was
drinking
a
much
more
elite
beer
than
i
was
hey
maybe
the
abv
had
something
to
do
with
it
too
but
who
cares
if
the
style
scotch
ale
old
ale
barleywine
strong
dark
ale
is
to
your
liking
give
it
a
buy
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
quality
scotch
and
so
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
highland
malts
i
would
certainly
highly
recommend
diving
right
into
this
one
o
some
good
things
here
but
the
intense
syrupy
taste
is
just
too
much
many
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
o
sip
it
and
be
wowed
would
go
well
with
a
cigar
decent
with
cheddar
a
memorable
drink
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
the
alcohol
may
have
been
a
little
overbearing
but
it
was
tasty
all
the
same
rjt
o
pretty
nice
for
a
wee
heavy
quite
tasty
would
definitely
buy
again
poured
a
2
pretty
mocha
brownish
head
with
decent
life
the
body
is
dark
raw
umber
brown
almost
coffee
the
smell
is
far
milder
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
does
hint
at
rich
malt
to
follow
the
taste
is
where
this
really
shines
a
complex
rich
smooth
malt
my
only
complaint
is
its
a
little
yeasty
o
a
good
selection
picked
it
up
to
try
something
new
was
not
disappointed
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
o
excellent
sipper
and
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
well
worth
a
try
loved
the
peat
moss
flavoring
they
added
i
highly
recommend
this
whilst
eating
pork
loin
or
brussel
sprouts
this
wonderful
brew
not
only
is
delicious
but
will
lay
your
ass
out
throw
caution
to
the
wind
and
drink
a
four
pack
today
and
then
tomorrow
and
then
tomorrow
repeat
and
be
in
beer
heaven
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
with
beef
or
lamb
with
asparagus
and
garlic
mashed
potatoes
ill
admit
this
is
my
first
scotch
ale
but
even
so
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
holy
hell
this
is
a
big
beer
but
for
some
reason
it
doesnt
feel
quite
balanced
or
assembled
quite
right
its
probably
the
saltysweet
overload
on
this
one
that
holds
it
back
and
makes
me
feel
like
i
need
to
drink
loads
of
water
between
each
sip
but
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
intensely
flavorful
sipper
to
savor
slowly
across
an
evening
this
could
be
the
one
for
you
and
your
fine
smoking
jacket
fez
combo
to
enjoy
together
by
the
hearth
with
the
bear
skin
rug
full
bodied
thick
with
good
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
great
depth
of
flavor
the
one
is
pretty
easy
drinking
for
10
its
a
solid
beer
but
im
on
the
fence
as
to
whether
id
but
it
again
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
into
dimpled
mug
with
very
little
head
smells
of
raisins
plums
bread
and
malt
wow
another
big
flavored
full
bodied
beer
in
their
imperial
series
wee
heavy
indeed
velvety
thick
that
coats
the
tongue
with
the
aforementioned
sweet
raisin
and
plums
with
the
alcohol
fully
evident
that
warms
deep
with
a
smokey
peat
like
finish
another
big
beer
sipper
that
i
liked
more
than
the
dopplebock
in
the
series
as
i
thought
it
was
a
little
heavy
in
the
mouthfeel
for
that
style
it
seemed
closer
to
this
wee
heavy
which
is
a
thick
sweet
sipper
the
imperial
series
is
a
good
4pack
series
for
9
99
that
finds
its
way
into
more
mainstream
outlets
like
grocery
stores
overall
ok
based
on
reviews
and
style
i
thought
it
would
taste
different
not
a
bad
beer
but
too
one
dimensional
for
me
i
would
not
get
this
one
again
cant
say
this
is
really
that
great
of
a
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
strengthy
offering
from
samuel
adams
i
was
hoping
it
would
turn
out
better
than
my
opinion
of
their
other
beers
but
it
really
hasnt
it
seems
to
be
unique
for
sure
but
doesnt
touch
what
i
think
the
style
should
be
wouldnt
really
buy
this
again
i
think
o
very
nice
its
like
a
scotch
alestout
combo
appearance
is
quintessential
scotch
ale
very
dark
not
cloudy
head
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
full
molasses
and
suggests
a
sweetness
tastes
just
the
same
molasses
overload
and
a
little
sweetness
that
leads
to
a
good
roasty
malt
taste
the
balance
is
awesome
and
the
booze
is
allbutinvisible
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
fat
and
sticky
nice
warmer
10
its
just
what
i
expected
if
youre
looking
for
a
readilyvailable
scotch
ale
with
an
especially
big
kick
this
is
a
solid
one
overall
a
heavy
and
interesting
beer
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
before
id
probably
buy
this
again
beer
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
high
carbonation
the
soapy
head
dissipated
rapidly
scents
were
all
true
except
very
rusty
scents
came
through
making
it
somewhat
unappealing
some
nice
peat
on
the
nose
taste
is
decent
but
way
too
syrupy
the
sweetness
is
not
balanced
by
good
hop
flavor
it
is
too
cloying
and
not
something
i
will
go
back
to
the
boston
beer
company
has
always
defended
by
me
but
in
the
past
3
years
they
a
have
gotten
rid
of
most
of
their
more
enjoyable
styles
b
change
the
recipes
of
styles
that
were
great
5
to
7
years
ago
and
c
are
way
off
on
their
new
attempts
drinkabilityoverall
i
have
to
say
this
beer
feel
short
a
bit
from
the
last
time
that
i
had
tried
it
where
i
felt
the
peat
and
scotch
characteristics
were
far
more
pronounced
it
has
decent
balance
and
though
pretty
drinkable
you
can
definitely
notice
the
alcohol
while
this
beer
wasnt
bad
it
fell
way
short
of
my
last
tasting
and
on
this
tasting
just
simply
an
okay
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
its
strong
taste
doesnt
overwhelm
you
its
so
smooth
and
i
actually
feel
it
going
over
my
body
i
liked
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
very
little
head
very
dark
brown
with
a
constant
light
stream
of
bubbles
it
seems
more
mellow
than
stout
at
first
smell
is
very
uniquecoffee
vanilla
and
chocolate
mixed
smooth
on
your
tongue
sweet
with
a
coffeelike
aftertaste
that
become
syrupy
after
a
couple
gulps
the
sweetness
and
the
increased
alcohol
content
are
not
pleasing
reviewed
at
the
saucer
in
houston
on
draft
a
deep
rootbeer
brown
with
a
finger
of
head
sitting
on
top
that
fell
rather
quickly
to
just
a
ring
around
the
tulip
leaving
amazing
lace
the
nose
is
of
light
molasses
woody
earthy
tones
and
some
sweet
dark
fruits
in
the
back
the
taste
is
of
cooked
sugar
earthy
tones
are
dominant
a
scotch
influenced
mint
flavor
with
toasted
malts
absolute
malt
bomb
not
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
considering
the
10
as
it
warmed
it
became
almost
undrinkable
the
mouth
feel
is
very
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
as
long
it
avoids
approaching
room
temp
not
bad
not
great
and
will
never
drink
again
o
pretty
enjoyable
though
i
dont
think
id
ever
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
halfway
through
the
glass
and
i
feel
the
10
abv
kicking
in
seems
to
hit
all
the
style
points
as
well
worth
a
try
for
sure
all
the
flavors
come
across
too
heavy
and
dont
seem
to
mesh
well
i
will
cellar
the
rest
of
this
four
pack
to
see
if
it
improves
with
age
notes
the
imperial
series
hasnt
really
done
much
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
double
bock
but
the
other
entries
are
just
sort
of
good
but
not
great
theres
better
out
there
for
the
money
o
a
nice
drinker
really
helps
to
wind
down
at
the
very
end
of
a
very
long
day
bottle
poured
a
dark
caramel
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
caramel
malt
with
light
toffee
notes
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
caramel
malt
notes
with
some
toffee
notes
also
noticeable
i
cant
say
that
peat
notes
were
really
noticeable
or
played
a
big
role
in
the
flavour
profile
body
is
slightly
fuller
then
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
not
bad
overall
but
lacking
complexity
should
really
be
called
a
smoked
scotch
ale
other
than
the
abv
being
overthetop
its
not
bad
i
enjoyed
it
overall
i
believe
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
wee
heavys
i
have
had
to
date
nice
beer
boston
brewing
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
chose
before
this
one
its
still
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
medium
to
full
bodied
average
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
10
00
abv
and
there
is
a
sweet
and
smoky
aftertaste
i
like
sweet
beers
but
wish
there
was
some
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
otherwise
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
poured
out
as
a
very
dark
brown
color
the
head
was
a
decent
size
and
tan
in
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
loaded
with
peated
malts
and
some
caramel
sweetness
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
want
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
its
a
little
bit
on
the
burntsmokey
side
i
feel
like
the
flavor
mellows
the
more
i
drink
it
but
the
taste
wasnt
my
favorite
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
though
the
feel
was
oily
and
thick
there
was
a
good
level
of
carbonation
in
there
also
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
it
for
a
really
long
time
and
finally
had
the
chance
last
night
i
cant
say
that
it
was
mind
blowing
in
anyway
but
i
am
glad
that
i
finally
found
a
bottle
and
gave
it
a
shot
i
might
buy
it
again
if
it
were
on
draft
or
something
but
i
wouldnt
get
a
case
of
it
m
a
touch
sticky
andco2
moderate
with
the
abv
well
concealed
overall
drinkability
absolutely
fantastic
no
major
flaws
sum
is
better
than
the
parts
overall
this
is
a
huge
beer
with
a
giant
smokiness
which
is
really
too
much
for
the
style
that
said
its
a
smooth
smoky
malty
monstrosity
which
style
be
damned
i
personally
really
like
kudos
to
boston
beer
co
as
i
mtntioned
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
something
i
could
tolerate
its
sweeter
than
i
can
appreciate
but
overall
its
a
good
rendition
of
what
its
supposed
to
be
appearance
is
dark
no
really
dark
ok
this
is
brown
smell
is
smooth
with
hints
of
smoke
mouthfeel
sits
well
and
leaves
the
mouth
very
smoothly
taste
is
special
for
a
dark
brew
the
flavors
blend
well
and
leave
you
wanting
to
have
a
little
more
overall
for
an
wee
heavy
style
of
imperial
is
good
while
this
maybe
a
one
and
done
it
is
a
must
have
say
cheese
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
you
enjoy
a
good
scotch
ale
which
has
a
lot
of
malt
complexities
this
wee
heavy
pours
a
deep
caramel
brown
color
with
a
slight
creamy
head
a
muted
aroma
of
malt
peat
oak
and
a
tad
of
alcohol
creamy
on
the
palate
with
some
prickly
alcohol
that
alcohol
warms
the
chest
mostly
malty
flavors
mix
with
that
alcohol
to
provide
some
balance
sweetness
is
extensive
but
not
overpowering
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
this
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
which
doesnt
much
light
through
with
a
short
lived
tan
head
the
smells
are
very
malts
some
caramel
molasses
and
other
malts
the
feel
is
medium
to
thick
the
taste
seems
a
little
off
im
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
the
other
reviews
say
peat
there
is
also
some
alcohol
present
along
with
lots
of
excessive
malts
caramel
and
molasses
i
definitely
like
the
old
chub
more
than
this
o
a
tasty
wee
heavy
and
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
is
a
bold
beer
and
should
be
respected
as
such
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
at
first
this
seemed
like
a
less
balanced
version
of
the
style
which
i
somewhat
think
is
true
still
but
after
seeing
that
i
found
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
intensity
of
all
the
scotch
goodness
as
much
as
this
style
seems
heavier
to
start
this
seems
like
an
imperial
version
of
the
scotch
ale
o
this
is
a
nice
wee
heavy
another
solid
entry
in
sam
adams
imperial
series
o
i
want
to
like
this
but
it
is
a
bit
disappointing
dont
think
i
need
to
buy
this
again
i
would
say
slighty
full
bodied
moderate
carbonation
drinks
slighty
like
a
wine
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
two
inch
light
tan
head
that
hangs
around
awhile
leaving
some
attractive
lacing
smell
is
carmel
tobacco
dark
fruits
smoke
and
some
booze
taste
is
very
smoky
threw
out
carmel
bread
and
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
a
little
warming
booze
in
the
finish
body
is
really
nice
thick
but
silky
smooth
nice
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
for
its
high
abv
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
even
with
the
powerful
smokyness
quite
the
treat
this
has
a
burly
attitude
and
is
a
definite
slow
sipper
but
it
never
quite
veers
out
of
control
wellmade
wellplayed
well
worth
a
try
o
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
probably
reach
for
again
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
the
smokiness
for
which
i
give
it
some
props
overall
samuel
adams
wee
heavy
is
a
balanced
and
warming
sipper
with
an
enticing
smokey
character
while
the
palate
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
it
also
increases
the
drinkability
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
highland
whiskies
and
bold
contemplative
scotch
ales
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
in
particular
i
like
the
very
balanced
and
well
integrated
smoke
component
of
this
ale
very
drinkable
and
yes
i
would
like
another
taste
is
unique
at
least
for
me
and
quite
nice
some
spiciness
some
alcohol
malts
not
as
roasted
as
youd
think
for
being
so
dark
a
hint
of
smokiness
the
most
scotchlike
beer
ive
ever
had
the
other
scotch
ales
i
had
were
watery
and
tasteless
compared
to
this
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
there
was
a
small
tan
head
that
didnt
linger
or
leave
much
lacing
lots
of
malts
to
the
nose
caramel
dark
fruits
are
the
most
dominant
some
of
a
smoky
peat
aroma
also
the
taste
is
quite
good
subdued
malt
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
a
peatysmokey
taste
slight
hint
of
chocolate
full
bodied
a
bit
dry
to
the
finish
overall
a
surprising
beer
with
a
smoky
punch
not
bad
for
this
brewer
d
quite
enjoyable
strong
malty
flavor
has
notes
of
caramel
molasses
and
miso
it
pours
a
barely
translucent
dark
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
but
leaves
some
lacing
strong
flavor
has
an
overtone
that
mixes
molasses
with
caramel
but
is
only
slightly
sweet
there
is
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
toffee
thick
fullbodied
texture
has
a
little
fizz
and
leaves
a
malty
molasses
slightly
woody
finish
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
as
others
have
stated
a
welcome
additon
to
an
otherwise
overpriced
underwhelming
series
of
beers
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
some
amber
hues
12
head
with
very
little
hold
or
lacing
smells
of
malt
smoke
and
dried
fruits
taste
reflects
the
aroma
with
a
little
mineral
background
as
well
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
but
i
felt
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
not
a
bad
beer
but
couldnt
help
but
feel
with
a
little
tweeking
could
be
an
excellent
beer
a
welcome
addition
to
an
underachieving
series
by
sa
o
given
all
the
hoopla
over
riss
as
of
late
i
wanted
something
dark
and
strong
and
though
the
style
is
different
this
hit
the
spot
for
that
but
its
probably
not
something
id
have
more
than
once
a
month
o
nice
job
sam
adams
overy
good
nothing
exceptional
might
not
get
again
due
to
the
price
but
very
good
and
worth
this
try
overall
i
find
myself
buying
a
lot
of
imperials
but
i
actually
dont
care
for
them
this
is
a
very
nice
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
on
but
the
alcohol
is
high
even
for
an
imperial
for
my
tastes
i
have
had
plenty
of
imperials
that
are
able
to
mask
the
alcohol
content
better
than
this
one
beautiful
dark
mocha
brown
color
minimal
head
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
head
dissipates
quickly
but
nice
lacing
rims
the
glass
as
the
brew
disappears
the
nose
is
peatlike
almost
like
i
dropped
a
single
malt
depth
charge
into
my
glass
flavor
is
heavy
peatmalt
since
i
never
had
a
scotch
ale
i
was
taken
by
surprise
on
this
one
i
can
appreciate
the
style
but
would
be
hard
pressed
to
recommend
or
try
again
sorry
sam
dr
its
drinkable
for
the
abv
but
the
flavours
just
arent
present
with
enough
temerity
to
justify
another
purchase
a
dark
somewhat
cloudy
mahogany
colored
brew
with
a
fair
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
pretty
quickly
lacing
is
decent
the
smell
offers
blackberry
currant
malt
and
alcohol
with
a
subtle
smoked
peat
that
i
find
to
be
pretty
pleasing
overall
the
flavor
is
a
tad
elusive
upon
first
sip
malty
licorice
settles
in
after
a
moment
and
gives
way
to
a
warming
prune
brandy
idea
at
the
finish
second
sip
brings
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
perhaps
more
of
a
dark
cherry
hint
to
the
fruits
that
come
through
here
the
smoke
and
peat
i
detected
in
the
aroma
seems
to
disappear
in
the
flavor
of
this
heavy
bodied
thick
but
drinkable
wee
heavy
theres
a
fizzy
contribution
of
carbonation
that
almost
seems
in
contrast
the
velvety
feel
of
this
10
abv
brew
borders
on
a
resinous
feel
looking
at
the
history
of
this
brew
here
on
ba
i
was
expecting
something
more
of
a
train
wreck
here
but
i
can
say
i
liked
it
for
a
try
probably
could
have
done
without
the
entire
4pack
for
my
money
though
i
can
see
where
the
potential
here
just
doesnt
balance
out
while
you
can
detect
a
few
nice
ideas
it
just
doesnt
blend
and
i
seem
to
come
out
with
a
mere
sharp
malty
thing
that
just
doesnt
quite
hit
the
spot
other
than
a
little
alcohol
burn
would
have
profited
from
a
goodly
hunk
of
cheddar
very
very
good
its
reassuring
that
sam
adams
can
make
a
solid
beer
when
they
want
to
and
arent
complete
sell
outs
overall
glad
i
tried
it
but
this
is
probably
a
one
timer
for
me
this
beer
is
nice
enough
but
drinking
it
makes
me
want
to
crack
a
barleywine
i
had
been
impressed
with
their
scotch
ale
but
this
one
barely
compares
its
slightly
too
sweet
and
not
very
complex
overall
a
unique
ale
that
is
definitely
a
sipper
worth
its
weight
and
well
worth
the
price
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
at
ix
beerfest
in
cleveland
ohio
i
was
very
impressed
and
i
knew
i
needed
to
revisit
it
thanks
to
my
wonderful
wife
for
picking
this
out
for
me
on
a
whim
the
only
problem
i
have
is
that
i
want
to
drink
more
of
it
and
if
i
do
10
fail
o
way
too
sweet
and
the
smoke
was
just
sort
of
off
o
not
an
impulse
beer
at
a
bar
but
certainly
an
interesting
choice
at
a
reasonable
price
o
ive
somewhat
enjoyed
the
other
beers
in
the
imperial
series
but
id
have
to
say
this
one
has
been
my
least
favorite
the
high
abv
really
stands
out
in
this
smokey
malt
bomb
overall
an
ok
above
average
beer
a
little
too
thick
and
just
a
little
too
sweet
and
malty
there
are
better
scotch
ales
not
one
of
boston
brewerys
best
o
this
is
a
strong
beer
with
a
strong
malt
character
it
borders
cloyingly
sweet
and
you
might
want
to
share
it
with
someone
else
as
a
full
pour
is
probably
a
bit
too
much
that
said
a
lot
of
the
scottish
beer
character
is
here
but
a
bit
out
of
balance
the
alcohol
is
also
not
as
subtle
as
perhaps
desired
also
definitely
a
strong
presence
and
in
the
end
quite
tasty
i
used
to
follow
sam
adams
pretty
closely
but
havent
in
the
past
couple
years
so
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
new
imperial
series
beer
eventually
i
found
a
single
to
try
of
the
wee
heavy
i
like
it
it
is
sweet
without
going
overboard
not
a
whole
lot
of
peat
to
my
taste
buds
seemed
more
like
an
english
barleywine
to
me
as
long
as
it
tastes
good
its
fine
with
me
the
samuel
adams
wee
heavy
is
exactly
what
the
name
describes
a
wee
heavy
and
full
bodied
the
appearance
a
very
dark
opaque
amber
with
thin
to
no
head
which
was
slightly
ecru
in
color
the
scent
carried
a
heavy
peat
malt
the
taste
was
very
complex
started
very
light
with
good
hop
character
and
then
turned
malty
with
strong
earthpeat
tones
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
downgraded
due
to
the
strong
peat
flavor
and
full
body
due
to
higher
abv
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
worth
trying
overall
pretty
good
might
just
nab
the
attention
of
some
boston
beer
critics
i
will
say
i
have
had
much
better
wee
heavy
however
o
not
a
terrible
beer
tastes
good
and
gets
the
job
done
at
10
which
isnt
as
detectable
as
you
might
think
going
in
but
its
definitely
a
bit
of
a
malt
bomb
and
a
little
more
balance
could
go
a
long
way
with
this
overall
i
really
liked
it
i
will
have
it
again
some
time
o
a
disappointment
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
very
good
either
it
has
some
good
flavors
but
theres
just
too
much
too
many
malts
too
much
sweetness
and
too
damn
thick
o
a
very
sweet
beer
not
like
other
wee
heavies
with
a
lot
more
malt
syrup
and
body
here
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
good
clarity
but
little
head
smells
sweet
and
richly
malty
with
a
note
of
smoke
the
taste
is
even
more
pronouncedly
smokey
with
lots
more
sweet
dark
malt
on
the
back
end
a
bit
slick
in
the
mouth
and
a
bit
brooding
really
without
really
delivering
the
goods
just
decent
overall
a
decent
beer
but
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
and
is
an
easy
pass
if
i
ever
comes
across
it
again
overall
its
clearly
an
american
take
on
the
style
but
that
lends
even
more
charm
to
it
where
the
scottish
might
downplay
the
yeasty
fruitiness
samuel
adams
has
bumped
it
up
giving
it
quite
a
bit
of
additional
character
and
more
complexity
charming
to
say
the
least
overall
and
admitting
up
front
that
im
not
terribly
familiar
with
the
wee
heavy
style
i
think
this
is
great
beer
and
a
fantastic
addition
to
what
has
so
far
been
a
stellar
imperial
series
from
sam
adams
an
immensely
flavorful
daring
finely
crafted
brew
alcohol
is
well
blended
and
peat
is
strong
but
not
overbearing
but
rather
one
dimensional
more
and
more
it
becomes
very
subtly
complex
nicely
balanced
flavors
and
easy
drinking
i
had
this
with
inglorious
bastards
1970
i
should
have
had
a
german
beer
d
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
wee
heavies
but
this
is
a
decent
big
beer
really
complex
flavors
make
this
an
interesting
brew
to
sip
and
enjoy
overall
very
well
balanced
with
lots
of
big
bold
yet
complex
flavors
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
an
alternative
for
an
imperial
stout
this
beer
really
is
an
enigma
the
frontend
taste
is
really
too
much
to
overcome
too
bad
because
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
darn
good
but
i
wouldnt
drink
again
i
really
liked
this
brew
i
would
buy
it
again
and
recommend
it
pours
out
a
mahogany
with
a
tan
head
than
has
decent
carbonation
along
with
nice
retention
and
really
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
consists
of
apple
caramel
smoke
and
oak
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
licorice
followed
by
some
caramel
and
apple
and
than
finishes
off
with
some
sweet
maltness
smoke
and
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
on
the
lips
tongue
and
palate
and
finishes
dry
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
nice
when
wanting
a
beer
with
an
unique
taste
but
with
10
alcohol
might
want
to
be
careful
with
how
much
you
drink
at
one
time
tastes
better
than
it
smells
and
smells
better
than
it
looks
decent
brew
though
a
bit
heavy
for
a
wee
heavy
this
is
more
like
a
sweeter
old
ale
but
darker
still
if
youre
big
into
sa
then
give
it
a
try
for
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
their
brewery
this
beer
wins
some
major
bonus
points
with
me
because
of
my
love
for
peaty
scotch
i
usually
take
a
scotch
ale
to
actually
mean
a
scottish
ale
but
in
this
case
scotch
is
the
more
applicable
term
my
only
complaint
is
the
occasional
banana
presence
i
dont
get
it
on
every
sip
but
when
i
do
it
is
somewhat
offputting
its
like
a
little
bit
of
belgian
yeast
slipped
into
the
beer
during
fermentation
it
adds
a
little
too
much
sweetness
to
the
beer
if
sam
adams
could
dial
back
the
sweetness
a
bit
and
escape
the
banana
notes
this
beer
could
achieve
the
nirvana
of
the
peaty
scotch
goodness
in
the
drinkable
form
of
beer
in
its
current
form
however
while
it
is
an
interesting
flavorful
enjoyable
and
powerful
beer
its
flaws
prevent
it
from
achieving
true
greatness
o
delicious
a
welldone
scotch
ale
one
of
sam
adams
best
taste
there
is
a
slight
roasted
bitterness
but
not
much
it
is
fairly
sweet
with
an
almost
nutty
flavor
i
pick
up
a
little
on
the
smokiness
but
it
is
not
too
pronounced
to
me
this
is
a
greatly
crafted
beer
even
so
it
is
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
the
beer
style
almost
demands
this
sweetness
overall
pretty
good
a
bit
too
strong
for
sweet
its
enjoyable
for
wee
fans
would
be
way
to
much
for
average
drinker
im
a
fan
of
weesso
i
would
enjoy
one
and
be
done
worth
drinking
sampled
on
july

2011
it
shows
a
semiopaque
mahoganybrown
ruby
red
hued
tone
loads
of
scottish
malts
up
front
with
a
but
of
smokiness
tickling
the
nostrils
on
second
whiff
the
body
is
heavier
in
texture
than
some
but
also
pretty
smooth
the
10
abv
is
noticeable
more
in
the
taste
than
in
the
aroma
so
it
makes
me
think
of
an
english
strong
ale
more
than
anything
else
o
color
me
impressed
it
is
sort
of
like
a
wee
heavy
done
bamberg
style
and
it
is
really
a
successful
concoction
on
all
levels
the
only
knock
i
really
have
is
that
it
is
a
really
big
beer
and
very
fullflavored
so
its
drinkability
is
diminished
d
blending
scotch
and
smoked
wood
flavor
isnt
my
bag
but
the
flavor
was
unique
and
enjoyable
for
the
tasting
id
have
one
and
pass
on
the
next
one
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
great
body
and
full
flavor
along
with
abv
taste
is
exceptionally
malty
again
but
with
a
bit
of
oakiness
biggest
concern
is
the
lack
of
fruitiness
and
brown
sugar
otherwise
an
enjoyable
beer
body
is
full
and
thick
definitely
a
positive
for
the
style
o
a
decent
wee
heavy
and
quite
available
so
thats
nice
o
a
nice
scotch
ale
the
alcohol
was
a
tad
hot
but
overall
it
is
a
quite
flavorful
full
bodied
beer
worthy
of
a
try
pours
a
two

hooksett
nh
almost

aged
wee
heavy
i
like
it
but
can
see
how
some
will
not
o
not
bad
not
a
huge
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
its
pretty
decent
although
somewhat
expensive
na
zdravje
i
love
this
pretty
much
everything
i
want
in
the
style
which
is
my
favorite
plenty
of
peat
smoke
malt
and
not
over
the
top
sweet
which
is
a
big
problem
with
american
version
i
dont
understand
the
lower
scores
here
something
i
would
highly
recommend
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
i
appreciate
what
sam
adams
was
trying
to
accomplish
and
their
tribute
to
the
style
with
a
twist
but
i
simply
did
not
care
for
the
flavor
honestly
this
beer
just
doesnt
agree
with
me
i
find
its
a
little
hot
and
spicy
on
my
throat
as
it
goes
down
this
makes
it
difficult
to
write
too
much
more
about
this
effort
from
sam
adams
ive
three
left
so
ill
come
back
after
i
give
it
another
go
as
they
say
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
odd
it
has
almost
a
light
syrupy
like
effect
i
think
from
the
more
mild
carbonation
combined
with
the
sugars
its
not
the
best
sa
ive
had
but
its
very
unique
and
its
not
the
priciest
beer
in
the
craft
brews
section
so
if
this
sticks
around
its
not
as
painful
getting
a
decent
scotch
ale
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
for
a
fair
price
an
aboveaverage
wee
heavy
but
sweeter
than
what
i
would
like
othis
is
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
it
definitely
is
a
little
too
sweet
but
the
smoked
flavor
is
really
good
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
need
another
one
onice
balance
of
ingredientsmeets
the
style
to
a
tee
goes
good
with
the
venison
chop
i
had
along
with
this
one
overall
a
nice
surprise
pours
deep
mahogany
color
with
light
tan
head
that
is
thick
at
first
then
settles
to
a
thin
rim
layer
nose
is
rich
with
roasty
malt
smoky
malt
and
baked
desserts
on
the
palate
the
smoked
malt
is
quite
a
whollop
on
the
palate
dark
caramels
toffee
and
leads
to
a
roasty
dry
finish
aftertaste
of
toffee
smoky
flavors
just
lingers
and
lingers
what
a
savory
beer
the
flavor
is
much
improved
good
chocolate
notes
with
a
heavy
alcohol
influence
theres
some
bitterness
that
is
likely
from
hop
rather
than
black
patent
malt
as
there
is
no
coffee
flavors
the
alcohol
is
very
present
perhaps
on
the
high
side
rich
bodied
but
not
quite
syrupy
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
snifter
a
deep
very
dark
ruby
black
color
clear
with
ample
dark
tan
head
some
lacing
the
head
dissipated
slowly
and
remained
relatively
strong
throughout
initial
smell
was
malty
biscuity
with
some
smoke
noticable
the
aroma
that
stood
out
to
me
was
a
slight
floral
note
after
the
other
aromas
faded
some
alcohol
smell
as
well
taste
is
malty
with
smoke
and
some
alcohol
present
feels
good
very
smooth
almost
creamy
and
full
bodied
warming
sensation
from
alcohol
present
oiliness
present
as
well
overall
while
i
enjoyed
the
beer
it
was
a
less
aggressive
wee
heavy
than
i
have
had
in
the
past
drinkability
is
outstanding
for
such
a
big
beer
i
have
been
mostly
disappointed
by
most
of
the
sam
adams
imperial
series
beers
but
this
one
didnt
disappoint
took
me
long
enough
but
i
finally
found
a
single
bottle
o
this
round
here
im
always
wary
of
the
new
stuff
no
matter
how
tempting
they
may
appear
it
pours
a
solid
rubyhighlighted
brown
topped
by
a
lovely
finger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
light
smoke
candi
sugar
light
roasted
malts
honey
and
light
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
bolder
expression
of
these
elements
with
the
smoke
really
coming
forward
edging
the
toffee
with
a
nice
toasted
character
some
mild
notes
of
plum
figs
brown
sugar
molasses
and
black
grapes
add
some
variety
to
the
proceedings
it
all
works
nicely
if
borderline
cacophonous
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
feel
that
borders
on
the
lightly
chewy
overall
a
very
nice
brew
possibly
the
best
of
sas
imperial
series
do
at
10
you
probably
wont
be
enjoying
to
many
of
these
at
one
time
smoky
roast
that
is
a
bit
weeheavy
on
the
alcohol
10
even
per
style
but
thankfully
is
weeheavy
on
flavor
making
this
an
enjoyable
treat
in
limited
fashion
and
overall
a
experience
worthy
of
its
imperial
standard
labeling
another
great
beer
in
the
imperial
lineup
i
am
seriously
getting
impressed
with
their
releases
finish
heat
pulls
up
front
on
the
back
then
lingers
to
a
roosted
malt
with
a
little
stickiness
on
the
back
taste
is
creamy
sweetness
upfront
a
peek
of
chocolate
int
he
middle
and
closes
with
the
alcohol
power
and
cherry
notes
almost
acrid
alcohol
aftertaste
coupled
with
numbing
lingering
sensation
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
the
close
just
isnt
nice
and
drinkability
is
okay
too
harsh
for
me
overall
food
pairing
meat
potatoes
ham
sausages
biscuits
lamb
strong
cheeses
overall
an
ok
scotch
ale
i
like
the
style
and
this
brew
borders
the
drinkability
with
the
sweetness
while
it
hides
the
ten
abv
id
repeat
bye
if
i
need
to
otheroverall
i
havent
had
many
imperial
stouts
but
it
this
was
noticeable
lighter
than
they
were
in
everything
except
color
despite
having
an
abv
of
10
it
doesnt
taste
like
that
much
overall
the
smoke
and
peat
overpowered
this
one
not
so
drinkable
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
and
dumped
this
one
for
a
beer
this
is
pretty
decent
although
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
but
i
believe
it
is
a
pretty
poor
interpretation
of
the
style
if
i
was
given
this
with
no
introduction
id
have
to
say
it
was
trying
to
be
a
rauchbier
honestly
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
am
really
surprised
at
this
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
is
the
scotch
ale
so
i
dont
know
how
this
sibling
could
have
been
so
off
when
i
opened
the
bottle
i
saw
the
ultradark
red
i
welcome
of
scotch
ales
along
with
the
tan
cap
the
aroma
by
itself
was
almost
enough
to
knock
me
back
into
my
chair
thick
with
whiskey
and
caramel
the
taste
is
similarly
robust
with
the
whiskey
being
the
main
characteristic
blending
in
caramel
and
maybe
some
pine
and
melon
the
body
is
overly
thick
for
the
style
theres
an
alcohol
sting
that
lingers
midtongue
that
i
find
distracting
in
summation
this
brew
is
overengineered
having
more
ingredients
and
complexity
than
necessary
it
was
good
to
try
but
i
dont
see
myself
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
one
smelledtasted
like
malts
and
scotch
on
the
one
hand
i
suppose
that
is
what
should
be
expected
of
this
style
on
the
other
it
was
a
bit
over
the
top
and
wasnt
overly
drinkable
if
i
am
going
back
to
this
category
for
the
same
money
ill
go
for
founders
dirty
bastard
each
and
every
time
i
was
disappointed
here
because
i
really
like
most
of
sam
adams
lineup
maybe
with
some
age
this
would
improve
overall
sam
adams
might
be
the
biggest
craft
brewery
but
they
are
still
putting
some
consistant
great
flavors
into
their
beers
well
this
one
at
least
pretty
solild
scotch
ale
thanks
benny
onot
a
very
attractive
beer
nor
is
it
very
aromatic
the
tsate
is
fine
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
not
bad
this
is
not
a
style
that
i
drink
often
so
i
have
few
scotch
ales
to
compare
the
body
is
creamy
and
full
bodied
thick
cloying
and
syrupy
woody
tones
in
the
finish
heavy
indeed
quite
cloying
a
tssty
overboard
sweet
malt
bomb
burning
sipper
if
you
can
ride
this
bull
keep
your
tounge
in
check
for
the
burn
probably
more
enjoyable
before
drinking
too
many
others
it
can
easily
put
you
on
your
ass
deep
dark
redbrown
beer
with
caramelcolored
head
almost
the
color
of
cola
but
even
darker
smells
earthy
and
of
caramel
and
florals
smoky
caramel
and
peat
flavor
sweet
sassafras
and
fruit
as
well
very
thick
and
creamy
no
harshness
from
the
high
alcohol
content
as
a
highly
flavored
barley
wine
i
think
its
great
my
second
time
tasting
a
bottle
it
may
not
be
on
the
style
button
but
its
exremely
drink
i
mean
sippable
poured
into
a
squat
snifter
this
is
a
very
dark
almost
black
beer
with
a
substantial
dense
head
atop
it
the
nose
has
features
a
nice
peatiness
however
theres
not
much
malt
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
its
a
tad
hot
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
bit
better
alcohol
is
present
but
not
as
as
warm
as
i
had
feared
however
it
lacks
the
malty
complexity
of
a
good
wee
heavy
its
drinkable
but
rather
onedimensional
o
a
solid
american
example
of
the
style
something
im
glad
is
made
year
round
and
available
in
four
packs
ill
be
having
this
again
overall
i
like
it
but
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
much
and
the
alcohol
would
definitely
limit
too
much
in
any
one
sitting
and
i
probably
wouldnt
put
one
away
to
age
due
to
the
already
massive
sweetness
rich
flavors
of
dark
malt
hints
of
root
beer
smoke
and
leather
subtle
peat
smoked
malt
mild
bitterness
moderate
mouthfeel
a
bit
watery
slight
warming
from
the
abv
could
use
more
body
tasty
overall
but
lacking
a
bit
i
complexity
and
body
o
great
for
sipping
4
d
a
definite
sipper
of
a
wee
heavy
the
10
abv
packs
a
pretty
good
punch
slightly
above
average
with
a
stellar
mouthfeel
i
remember
the
oldoriginal
bottled
at
least
sa
scotch
ale
i
believe
it
was
better
but
its
been
more
than
a
few
years
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
but
it
is
quite
weak
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
a
harsh
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
silky
texture
and
appropriately
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
will
probably
not
drink
again
it
is
one
dimensional
and
the
alcohol
is
poorly
integrated
very
deep
mahogany
in
the
glass
that
goes
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
a
light
the
head
is
a
khaki
tan
full
of
fine
bubbles
that
settle
relatively
quickly
and
then
lace
a
bit
smell
is
of
caramelized
sugar
smoky
and
deep
peated
malt
is
there
as
well
as
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
black
malts
the
taste
is
of
black
coffee
and
dark
malts
the
alcohol
is
very
upfront
in
this
beer
and
maybe
a
bit
too
much
so
im
not
getting
as
much
of
the
caramel
that
i
would
expect
from
a
wee
heavy
as
this
beer
tends
towards
the
dry
end
of
the
spectrum
this
beer
is
pretty
lively
in
the
mouth
the
finish
is
a
bit
prickly
as
a
combination
of
higher
carbonation
than
im
used
to
for
this
style
and
the
alcoholic
hotness
leave
a
lasting
tingle
this
is
a
good
beer
but
maybe
not
great
i
guess
im
just
partial
to
the
wee
heavy
that
i
make
which
tends
to
be
a
bit
less
alcoholic
and
a
touch
sweeter
with
a
higher
caramel
focus
and
as
im
missing
those
characteristics
i
cant
rate
this
example
very
highly
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
mahoganyalmost
burnt
caramel
khaki
colored
head
aroma
has
caramel
peat
and
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
with
some
light
hop
bitterness
and
great
peaty
smoke
medium
bodied
with
slick
texture
smooth
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
poured
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
tasty
and
technically
on
point
but
not
as
deep
and
complex
as
the
great
wee
heavys
the
aroma
was
a
bit
hot
but
otherwise
the
flavor
was
a
tight
mix
of
bready
fruit
like
jam
on
dark
toast
with
caramel
and
fruit
i
appreciated
that
it
wasnt
too
thick
or
sweet
but
was
also
surprised
that
the
abv
hit
double
digits
quality
sippernight
capper
pours
a
dark
almost
bloodlike
color
nice
little
head
to
it
aroma
is
of
figs
or
dark
fruit
taste
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
10
abv
and
the
alcohol
can
definitely
be
detected
the
dark
fruit
really
comes
through
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
a
wee
heavy
though
there
isnt
the
usual
smokiness
in
it
i
would
relate
it
to
more
of
a
belgian
or
strong
ale
almost
a
little
bit
of
a
rough
finish
but
for
the
most
part
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
savor
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
by
any
means
and
they
missed
the
style
a
little
bit
but
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
o
a
good
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
if
the
mood
for
a
good
wee
heavy
struck
but
not
one
ill
be
getting
everyday
pretty
good
i
like
that
it
has
that
peatlike
quality
but
if
you
are
going
to
do
it
it
should
be
all
out
and
this
one
plays
it
a
little
safe
fantastic
beer
and
i
suspect
it
ages
well
ill
check
back
after
a
couple
of
years
not
bad
not
great
ive
been
kind
of
disappointed
in
the
sam
adams
imperial
series
it
almost
seems
like
they
shouldnt
even
bother
if
they
are
going
to
play
their
imperial
beers
safely
o
i
should
know
better
than
to
expect
great
beers
from
sam
adams
and
this
one
confirmed
my
expectations
unfortunately
this
beer
lacks
character
and
flavor
profile
maybe
cellaraging
this
one
might
do
it
some
good
overall
skip
this
and
the
10
for
this
6pack
in
fact
samuel
adams
scotch
ale
is
way
better
than
this
but
they
no
longer
offer
that
in
6
packs
my
rule
of
thumb
pass
over
samuel
adams
beers
because
they
are
average
at
best
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
peat
smoke
dark
fruit
and
some
toffee
the
flavor
is
more
complex
than
the
aroma
i
get
a
lot
of
peat
smoke
cherries
grapes
plums
toffee
and
some
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nicely
balanced
wee
heavy
where
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
very
drinkable
overall
this
imperial
wee
heavy
lacks
in
refinement
but
makes
up
for
it
in
depth
of
character
and
being
approachable
despite
its
massive
abv
its
warm
snuggly
and
feels
good
i
will
drink
this
one
again
but
it
wont
be
my
first
choice
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
deep
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
small
tan
head
dissipates
slowly
smell
is
very
malty
and
sweet
i
swear
i
smell
leather
hints
of
burnt
sugar
smoke
taste
is
sweet
with
all
of
the
aromas
accounted
for
in
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
with
the
syrupy
malt
and
smoke
then
leaves
a
long
lingering
mild
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
seems
typical
of
the
sam
adams
imperial
series
to
be
a
bit
hot
with
alcohol
very
little
hop
presence
to
be
found
pretty
good
scotch
ale
there
are
others
better
but
sam
usually
has
good
not
great
brews
oa
nice
scotch
ale
from
bbc
id
buy
this
again
overall
pretty
good
a
decent
wee
heavy
and
im
glad
to
see
a
wee
heavy
that
actually
is
wee
heavy
not
a
measly
6
5
kinda
thing
it
does
get
a
bit
of
boozy
phenols
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
herbal
hops
but
that
goes
with
the
style
overall
pretty
good
full
mouthfeel
sticky
almost
syrupy
tiny
bubble
carbonation
creates
a
nice
balance
alcohol
warmth
is
present
poured
a
nice
thick
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
initial
decent
head
and
a
bit
of
initial
decent
lacing
some
nice
thick
malty
scents
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
little
toffee
but
not
near
as
much
aroma
as
one
would
expect
from
a
thick
wee
heavy
decent
taste
nice
thickness
in
the
malt
some
caramel
and
toffee
just
a
hint
of
peat
a
bit
of
nice
earthy
hops
at
the
end
but
overall
nothing
very
upfront
mostly
just
a
thick
beer
with
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
it
goes
down
alright
but
doesnt
hide
the
10
abv
at
all
id
drink
another
if
given
one
but
there
are
much
better
scotchscotchstyle
ales
out
there
that
arent
any
more
expensive
careful
pour
yielded
a
small
but
dense
creamy
colored
head
that
dissipated
slowly
the
color
below
is
certainly
dark
but
slightly
red
in
tint
against
light
smell
isnt
very
significant
just
a
subdued
earthiness
that
jives
well
with
the
flavor
the
taste
itself
is
quintessential
of
a
basic
wee
heavyearthy
peatiness
a
bit
of
spice
and
an
overall
fullbodied
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
between
the
strong
flavors
and
high
alcohol
it
is
exactly
what
is
expected
grade
a
purchased
at
stoneys
11
99
per
4pack
at
first
i
could
not
place
the
taste
then
the
scotch
ale
flavor
came
through
very
strong
not
as
strong
as
the
other
sa
imperial
series
have
been
but
a
very
good
very
drinkable
beer
got
mine
4pack
for
10
99
at
the
mo
a
complex
brew
with
lots
of
malty
and
barley
notes
overall
i
love
the
balance
the
integration
of
peatsmoked
malt
and
maybe
even
the
overall
flavor
but
i
cant
get
past
that
i
want
this
beer
to
have
more
and
that
what
i
want
it
to
have
is
so
common
among
beers
of
this
style
ill
probably
even
buy
this
again
but
i
imagine
that
ill
still
think
the
beer
isnt
quite
reaching
its
potential
a
nice
nice
beer
here
a
few
months
of
age
would
help
mellow
the
alcohol
and
improve
the
overall
beer
in
my
opinion
right
now
though
this
is
a
beer
that
is
right
on
for
the
style
and
a
good
all
around
beer
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
maudite
tulip
pours
slightly
darker
than
cola
with
a
creamy
half
inch
khakicolored
head
that
dissipates
in
the
center
and
disperses
towards
the
shoulders
head
eventually
settles
into
a
thin
band
and
some
strands
of
lacing
are
evident
during
the
tasting
but
no
legs
nose
suggests
dark
fruit
and
a
slightly
earthy
character
as
well
as
some
malty
sweetness
taste
is
much
bolder
and
robust
than
suggested
by
the
nose
a
smokeyearthypeaty
character
intersperses
itself
in
throughout
the
malty
backbone
and
the
dark
fruit
peaks
through
towards
the
front
and
middle
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
but
closer
to
medium
with
a
lively
almost
prickly
carbonation
that
lightly
burns
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
and
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
a
really
nice
wee
heavy
probably
my
favorite
from
the
sa
imperial
series
so
far
id
love
to
see
what
a
couple
years
does
for
this
brew
nice
and
sweet
without
going
overboard
and
dangerously
drinkable
overall
i
think
this
is
an
ok
brew
e
for
effort
some
elements
about
it
are
worthwhile
while
others
i
could
do
without
but
ultimately
it
just
doesnt
rise
to
challenge
some
of
the
better
scotch
aleswee
heavies
out
there
thick
and
rich
body
chewy
lots
of
potent
sweetness
that
finishes
dry
and
has
a
very
boozy
taste
through
the
whole
thing
its
not
bad
and
definitely
worth
trying
but
honestly
i
was
expecting
something
more
refined
and
complex
some
of
the
flavors
are
so
overpowering
that
its
hard
to
discern
much
beyond
them
highly
enjoyable
drinking
experience
regardless
this
is
definitely
a
brew
to
warm
up
a
bit
pour
into
a
goblet
and
then
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
disappoint
and
the
peat
smoke
is
interesting
enough
to
keep
your
attention
for
at
least
one
beer
maybe
two
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
coffee
roast
and
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
coffee
alcohol
and
a
small
presence
of
a
dry
peet
earthiness
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malt
and
small
alcohol
like
aftertaste
a
bit
hot
from
alcohol
but
a
nice
roast
you
may
want
to
stash
it
away
for
3
months
or
so
and
try
it
again
it
will
only
reveal
the
true
character
within
o
not
a
terrible
effort
but
doesnt
have
the
elegance
or
balance
of
something
like
traquair
or
skullsplitter
which
are
malty
beers
for
sure
but
remain
immensely
drinkable
and
the
sugar
does
not
go
over
the
tops
a
decent
wee
heavy
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
very
solid
malt
presence
and
a
touch
of
peatsmoke
very
malt
driven
needs
a
bit
more
earthy
flavors
to
it
to
date
i
havent
been
blown
away
by
and
of
the
sam
adams
imperial
series
wee
heavy
doesnt
change
that
having
said
that
its
not
bad
beer
it
could
easily
be
improved
with
a
stronger
nose
and
less
of
a
sweet
sugary
flavor
maybe
a
little
less
alcohol
too
it
holds
up
pretty
well
otherwise
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
beer
fits
in
well
with
the
rest
of
the
imperial
series
overall
this
is
great
beer
sweet
but
good
im
going
to
enjoy
the
4
of
em
thanks
to
mike
d
for
hooking
me
up
with
a
free
bottle
poured
into
my
sam
adams
double
bock
glass
dark
brown
almost
black
color
pretty
thick
white
head
and
a
great
amount
of
lacing
smell
had
a
mild
campfire
aroma
to
it
i
liked
the
flavor
a
lot
actually
it
had
a
thick
peaty
smoky
flavor
along
with
a
smooth
dark
chocolate
flavor
also
reminded
me
more
of
a
smoked
beer
than
a
wee
heavy
maybe
sa
went
a
bit
overboard
with
that
element
mouthfeel
was
on
the
cloying
side
due
to
the
sweetness
but
it
had
an
overall
enjoyable
body
for
a
10
beer
it
went
down
fairly
smoothly
i
liked
it
because
it
was
a
smoked
scotch
ale
a
unique
take
the
bottle
recommends
some
aging
so
that
would
be
an
interesting
path
to
take
if
i
were
to
get
more
of
this
beer
o
i
was
a
little
hesitant
to
try
the
sam
adams
specialty
beers
as
i
tend
to
stick
to
the
micros
but
this
is
actually
pretty
good
a
nice
beer
good
for
sipping
but
can
sneak
up
on
you
very
quickly
overall
definitely
a
good
beer
i
like
this
alot
more
than
the
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
o
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
sam
adams
overall
this
beer
would
be
perfect
for
a
cold
day
and
is
quite
tasty
i
actually
like
this
one
a
little
better
than
their
other
scotch
ale
which
though
is
good
this
has
a
little
more
umfph
to
it
which
makes
it
more
enjoyable
only
thing
i
would
change
would
be
the
overall
smoke
flavor
to
make
it
more
prevalent
but
was
happy
i
seeked
out
this
beer
o
overall
a
bit
different
then
what
i
was
expecting
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
smoky
traits
but
i
think
in
this
beer
it
is
appropriately
leveraged
against
the
malty
sweet
nature
i
was
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
im
not
likely
to
revisit
its
not
bad
its
just
not
going
to
be
worth
10
99
a
four
pack
do
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
snowy
day
a
heavy
hearty
beer
that
is
a
major
malt
bomb
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
the
only
real
downfall
for
this
beer
is
the
metallic
element
that
is
present
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
and
the
fact
that
the
smoke
isnt
nearly
as
present
in
this
beer
than
in
their
scotch
ale
which
was
my
favorite
part
of
that
beer
and
in
the
style
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
decent
wee
heavy
definitely
not
my
favorite
but
it
has
potential
after
a
year
or
2
i
think
this
beer
might
really
surprise
some
people
kind
of
astonished
how
good
this
was
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
authentic
no
but
fine
all
the
same
of
the
smoky
domestic
wee
heavies
ive
sampled
this
could
possibly
be
the
best
and
whats
strange
is
that
if
you
close
your
eyes
taste
blind
you
could
almost
mistake
it
for
a
russian
imperial
stout
of
course
the
nature
of
the
peatsmoked
malt
versus
more
of
a
roasted
malt
in
an
ris
gives
it
away
its
malt
characteristics
are
quintessentially
of
a
caramelly
scotch
ale
for
what
it
offers
well
done
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
colalike
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
one
finger
head
that
leaves
lacing
as
it
settles
into
a
modest
collar
hard
to
gauge
the
carbonation
level
of
a
beer
to
dark
to
see
through
aroma
is
of
sweet
smoky
malt
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
the
smoked
peat
described
on
the
label
the
aroma
of
alcohol
is
also
present
the
way
it
would
be
in
a
single
malt
scotch
1st
sip
brings
everything
promised
on
the
nose
caramel
toffee
smoky
peat
and
alcohol
there
is
a
silky
smoothness
on
the
tongue
with
a
solid
mouthfeel
light
hints
of
the
smoke
alcohol
linger
on
an
otherwise
clean
finish
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
a
beer
with
such
a
big
abv
wallop
but
these
are
obviously
sippers
not
chuggers
overall
another
very
good
offering
from
boston
beer
company
an
increasingly
underappreciated
brewery
imho
although
i
cant
understand
why
future
outlook
best
sam
adams
product
ive
had
in
some
time
probably
time
to
try
out
some
of
their
other
imperial
line
that
ive
passed
on
for
awhile
extremely
dark
mahogany
color
smallsized
head
dissolves
to
an
even
thinner
lacing
lots
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
peppery
alcohol
syruplike
mouthfeel
the
palate
is
grazed
by
some
gritty
crispness
massive
malt
sweetness
is
almost
cloying
and
the
hint
of
peat
smoke
nearly
pushes
it
over
the
edge
bitterness
from
the
modest
hopping
cant
even
break
through
yet
theres
some
oily
herbal
flavor
in
the
middle
sweetness
sticks
even
when
the
warming
spicy
alcohol
hits
the
palate
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
but
the
excessive
sweetness
throws
it
off
balance
a
bitstill
worth
a
try
the
whole
imperial
series
lacks
finesse
but
while
this
one
is
the
type
of
bruisin
ale
that
is
going
to
hit
you
with
the
alcohol
and
peated
malts
that
you
should
expect
in
a
wee
heavy
in
this
case
think
the
heat
of
a
single
malt
with
the
peated
malt
roasted
dark
caramel
notes
found
in
this
beer
pours
nicely
into
an
allagash
chalice
deep
ruby
brown
almost
black
if
your
sitting
in
the
shade
you
really
have
to
hold
this
one
toward
the
light
flavor
first
off
the
booze
really
coats
the
sides
of
my
cheeks
and
the
backend
of
the
palate
when
im
able
to
cope
with
the
booze
level
i
come
up
with
dark
roasted
malts
almost
coffee
astringency
dark
roasted
peat
smoked
malts
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
complex
for
sure
even
a
bit
of
sherry
tartness
full
bodied
a
bit
of
heat
cinges
your
nose
hairs
but
overall
a
complex
beer
to
share
with
good
friends
im
going
to
hold
on
to
a
couple
of
these
beers
and
wait
for
the
pearl
to
form
do
very
strong
but
doesnt
overpower
i
feel
like
they
didnt
do
enough
for
the
style
i
could
have
used
it
having
more
smoke
still
a
very
good
strong
beer
a
deep
red
almost
black
color
with
a
head
that
doesnt
show
up
until
the
end
of
the
pour
but
remains
there
thinly
for
a
while
afterwards
smells
of
some
strong
sweet
malts
and
booze
and
generally
tastes
similar
reminiscent
of
my
dads
scotch
collection
in
fact
its
boozy
and
sweet
like
a
much
less
strong
peaty
highlands
scotch
i
bet
it
would
age
well
also
very
complex
with
some
sweet
malts
that
complement
the
alcohol
and
scotchlike
mouthfeel
booziness
threatens
to
overwhelm
the
taste
buds
and
does
so
when
i
taste
scotch
but
this
manages
to
fit
fairly
well
in
beer
form
i
think
this
is
the
strongest
scotch
ale
ive
tried
and
i
like
the
idea
of
the
higher
abv
mimicking
the
scotch
mouthfeel
rather
than
only
the
taste
good
beer
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
first
poured
the
sa
wee
heavy
it
had
a
very
rich
deep
dark
reddish
brown
hue
it
poured
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
that
quickly
dissipated
my
initial
nosing
struck
me
that
it
did
not
smell
very
far
off
from
several
scotch
whiskies
i
have
nosed
the
maltiness
comes
through
with
a
subtle
smokiness
that
became
more
evident
as
the
brew
warmed
slightly
the
initial
taste
is
the
sweetness
of
malt
but
not
overly
sweet
wee
heavy
is
surpisingly
easy
to
knock
back
given
its
higher
abv
and
i
could
be
in
for
some
trouble
it
was
very
nice
and
almost
chewy
on
the
palate
and
the
higher
alcohol
content
did
not
translate
into
that
boozyiness
that
can
sometimes
get
in
the
way
of
the
other
flavors
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
that
will
never
dissapoint
this
beer
pours
a
thick
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
its
way
down
the
aroma
is
complex
with
hints
of
roasted
barley
peat
and
smokey
fruit
the
taste
starts
with
some
hints
of
figs
and
smoked
peat
then
finishes
with
a
caramelly
roasted
barley
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
starts
a
little
harsh
with
overcarbonation
but
finishes
with
a
velvety
feel
overall
a
good
scotch
ale
this
beer
has
great
character
and
deep
flavors
the
alcohol
was
screaming
through
this
beer
it
had
nice
low
level
bitterness
there
was
no
hiding
it
it
actually
develops
levels
of
flavors
but
was
on
the
verge
of
taking
them
over
cheers
a
nice
brew
i
find
myself
almost
utterly
lost
now
when
grading
american
wee
heavy
im
not
much
for
grading
to
style
if
a
beer
is
good
its
good
but
when
american
breweries
say
wee
heavy
and
scotch
ale
i
expect
traquair
bellhaven
orkney
yet
they
never
come
too
close
to
those
brews
which
i
love
i
think
ive
given
up
on
finding
an
american
equivalent
poured
the
bottle
into
a
glass
a
decent
amount
of
foam
was
formed
the
beer
has
a
dark
amber
look
to
it
the
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
this
beer
has
many
layers
of
flavor
the
first
to
hit
the
tongue
is
malt
with
a
rich
almost
chocolate
flavor
the
finish
leaves
with
a
lasting
enjoyable
flavor
would
be
good
as
an
after
dinner
drink
cheers
good
stuff
and
should
be
readily
obtainable
if
it
remains
a
regular
part
of
the
series
md
soft
even
creamy
on
the
palate
nice
mouthfeel
minimal
carbonation
overall
a
good
brew
i
would
be
interested
to
try
this
side
by
side
sam
adams
scotch
ale
a
bit
creamy
on
the
mouth
but
none
to
thick
at
all
to
keep
this
from
being
crazily
drinkable
for
a
10
percent
abv
beer
d
easy
as
hell
for
a
10abv
a
great
addition
to
the
imperial
series
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
reddishamber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
light
lacing
the
aroma
has
sweet
malts
hints
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
sweet
toffee
hints
of
smoke
no
alchohol
the
body
is
full
decent
carbonation
a
very
nice
beer
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
10
brew
dextremely
drinkable
leaves
behind
a
great
after
taste
possibly
the
best
beer
sam
adams
brews
havent
had
the
rest
of
their
imperial
series
but
this
could
be
there
best
offering
i
wouldnt
put
this
beer
in
any
other
category
but
for
a
wee
heavy
i
found
it
too
tilted
toward
the
hops
a
very
nice
beer
once
you
know
what
to
expect
drinkability
its
a
bit
strong
for
repeated
drinking
and
not
very
complex
but
not
bad
tasting
either
the
drink
ability
is
there
surprisingly
has
much
more
drink
ability
than
the
other
imperial
beer
by
sam
gotta
have
more
saw
this
one
on
the
singles
shelf
today
at
the
whole
foods
and
figured
it
was
cheaper
than
the
four
pack
so
anyways
it
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
color
with
a
big
2
fingers
of
light
brown
foam
aromas
of
plums
raisins
and
burnt
sugar
on
the
palate
fairly
full
bodied
and
phenolic
with
plums
raisins
brown
sugar
and
peat
smoke
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
one
dimensional
and
a
bit
disappointing
after
the
complex
aroma
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
winter
night
1312
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
deep
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
smallish
khaki
head
dissipates
like
the
bubbles
atop
a
diet
soda
smell
is
very
malty
and
sweet
hints
of
burnt
sugar
melanoids
and
peat
smoke
dominate
my
nostrils
taste
is
sweet
with
all
of
the
aromas
accounted
for
in
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
hits
with
the
peat
and
smoke
then
leaves
a
long
lingering
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
seems
typical
of
the
sam
adams
imperial
series
to
be
a
bit
hot
with
alcohol
very
little
hop
presence
to
be
found
i
fear
that
if
one
were
to
wait
for
the
alcohol
to
die
down
you
would
be
left
with
a
sweet
cloying
mess
of
a
beer
sweet
syrupy
mouthfeel
full
body
light
level
of
carbonation
this
one
is
only
ok
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
epic
this
is
what
a
scotch
ale
should
smell
like
it
has
a
wonderful
burnt
toffee
scent
along
with
a
huge
peated
malt
aroma
the
smokey
character
is
really
nice
the
taste
is
also
quite
good
it
has
a
solid
malt
flavor
of
burnt
toffee
and
crystal
malts
as
well
as
a
big
smoked
malt
taste
im
really
diggin
the
bold
smokey
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
one
of
best
beers
sam
adams
has
ever
put
out
why
go
mainstream
hit
me
with
the
smoke
and
keep
it
coming
what
a
delicious
beer
the
feel
was
not
too
heavy
it
did
have
a
bit
of
a
bit
but
went
down
well
and
had
little
aftertaste
a
good
beer
for
an
experimental
beer
serving
type
bottle
this
brew
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
for
10
and
i
wish
i
had
stashed
a
few
more
bottles
as
they
are
probably
just
about
perfect
right
now
this
one
is
just
too
old
it
hasnt
held
up
well
o
this
was
a
nice
beer
for
being
5
years
old
i
havent
had
it
fresh
but
i
imagine
its
right
around
its
peak
right
now
but
could
maybe
hold
up
for
a
couple
more
years
for
6
you
cant
go
wrong
i
may
go
back
and
pick
up
a
couple
more
4
25
o
very
interesting
and
quite
sweet
scotch
ale
that
i
actually
find
myself
enjoying
despite
its
heavy
fusel
character
overall
i
enjoyed
this
the
high
alcohol
and
complex
flavors
make
it
a
bit
of
a
challenge
on
the
palate
but
it
a
good
way
for
sure
put
the
keys
away
and
give
it
a
try
o
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
monster
the
10
wacks
you
in
the
face
definitely
a
sipper
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
outstanding
reminds
me
of
an
alcoholic
fruit
roll
up
good
stuff
a
little
surprised
this
is
ranked
so
low
the
appearance
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
and
pretty
murky
not
much
head
the
money
is
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
super
solid
taste
nice
sweet
caramel
goodness
with
an
appropriate
hit
ness
dark
fruits
and
all
way
good
the
feel
is
also
nice
creamier
than
expected
feels
really
good
in
the
mouth
overall
highly
recommended
my
bottle
was
aged
two
years
so
that
might
make
a
difference
if
you
can
get
a
bottle
then
sit
on
it
and
drink
it
later
pours
a
murky
brown
apricot
copper
colora
thinner
slight
off
white
head
settles
into
a
frothy
mass
fruit
and
caramel
toffee
mainly
in
the
nosequite
alcoholic
big
chewey
and
yes
alcoholic
on
the
palatecutting
through
the
alcohol
is
dark
fruit
and
more
cramel
toffee
with
a
big
hit
of
that
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
all
the
way
down
this
feels
all
of
10
but
its
made
to
sip
and
savor
and
its
great
for
thati
like
it
overall
only
saw
now
a
few
days
after
i
tasted
it
that
the
abv
is
10
in
no
way
is
that
apparent
great
pick
overall
nicely
done
one
needs
to
like
a
bitobooze
and
expect
it
in
this
quaff
again
nicely
balanced
and
not
one
characteristics
outweighs
the
other
only
wish
it
were
in
my
area
as
i
would
definitely
git
mo
of
the
weee
william
o
good
example
of
the
style
o
overall
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
not
the
best
scotch
ale
but
definitely
one
that
i
would
purchase
and
enjoy
again
o
a
pretty
decent
scotch
ale
overall
not
terribly
complex
and
a
bit
boozy
but
still
enjoyable
thanks
to
merc7186
for
this
one
taste
is
very
sweet
toffee
and
bitter
slight
hop
flavor
but
the
characteristic
scotch
flavors
are
present
but
not
overwhelming
nice
brew
id
love
to
age
this
for
a
while
o
this
beer
is
excellent
and
with
nearly
a
year
on
it
its
drinking
so
well
cant
wait
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
in
a
few
weeks
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
scotch
ales
ive
had
scorched
caramel
up
front
becomes
fruitier
and
sweet
and
caramelier
slight
woody
tannic
bitterness
around
the
edges
whiskeyish
peaty
notes
near
the
finish
woody
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
lots
of
lingering
caramel
and
fruit
mediumfull
body
with
a
softly
carbonated
feel
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
slight
haziness
to
it
not
much
of
a
head
is
noticed
after
an
aggressive
pour
good
carbonation
is
seen
smells
slightly
sweet
with
toffee
and
caramel
plenty
of
malts
on
the
nose
bready
doughs
also
come
through
as
it
warms
taste
is
great
nice
sweetness
with
candy
up
front
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
great
very
good
scotch
beer
straight
forward
draught
willimantic
brewery
served
in
a
snifter
there
was
no
head
or
lacing
with
this
one
it
was
a
ruby
tinged
brown
color
the
aroma
was
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
some
caramel
sweetness
and
maybe
some
oak
the
taste
is
very
good
very
smooth
some
sweet
citrus
dark
fruits
and
some
caramel
and
smokiness
a
three
hour
boil
wow
worth
waiting
for
this
was
a
delicious
brew
thanks
andy
for
sharing
dont
judge
this
brew
by
its
appearance
theres
lots
of
love
in
this
fine
brew
overall
this
was
a
good
scotch
ale
but
not
anything
amazing
or
worthy
of
seeking
out
if
you
can
get
something
similar
easier
alesmith
and
traquir
still
make
the
best
examples
of
the
style
one
domestic
one
imported
but
i
see
no
reason
to
seek
this
wet
willy
out
over
any
of
them
which
i
can
locate
much
easier
pretty
solid
beer
although
not
without
flaws
i
see
theres
a
bourbon
aged
version
of
this
which
would
be
awesome
because
this
beer
seems
like
a
great
candidate
for
barrel
aging
o
really
solid
beer
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
is
nice
id
drink
this
again
no
problem
this
is
not
a
fantastic
scotch
ale
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
it
really
needs
to
be
consumed
slowly
apparently
it
is
10
abv
but
i
wouldnt
have
been
shocked
learn
it
was
15
seriously
its
boozy
but
in
a
pleasant
way
originally
reviewed

cost
7
99
for
a
four
pack
o
a
nice
scotch
ale
very
tasty
and
surprisingly
easy
drinking
for
10
would
certainly
drink
this
one
again
pours
a
reddishbrown
with
some
mild
bubbles
forming
it
appears
sitting
on
this
a
year
has
hindered
the
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
sugary
fruits
bready
malt
herbs
and
some
ethanol
the
flavor
profile
follows
the
nose
caramel
and
toffee
with
toasted
multigrain
bread
and
sweet
sugary
fruit
the
booze
in
this
guy
is
not
bashful
but
never
overpowering
given
that
this
is
a
year
old
the
carbonation
has
faded
making
the
feel
a
little
thin
overall
this
has
some
nice
qualities
but
i
will
need
to
try
this
fresh
to
review
this
adequately
consider
this
a
rough
draft
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
below
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
of
the
style
it
showed
some
very
good
malty
caramel
flavors
to
it
but
didnt
become
overly
sweet
very
flavorful
and
tasty
beer
overall
pours
a
murky
coppery
amber
with
lots
of
sediment
moderate
cap
off
offwhite
head
minimal
retention
scent
is
a
fantastic
blend
of
buttery
toffee
brown
sugar
sweet
caramel
glazed
roasted
nuts
kiss
of
smoke
and
earth
lightly
juicy
and
resinous
hops
taste
follows
suit
with
a
wonderfully
blended
and
complex
flavor
profile
that
evokes
just
about
every
positive
quality
consumed
in
the
style
toffee
caramel
roasted

vanilla

lightly

fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
smooth
with
some
heft
as
it
goes
down
light
bite
at
end
of
sip
overall
a
true
winner
in
and
out
of
the
style
and
one
id
have
over
and
over
again
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
im
being
generous
with
a
3
0
overall
rating
but
at
the
same
time
i
dont
think
its
bad
should
i
ever
see
this
on
tap
ill
give
it
another
try
overall
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
not
a
beer
i
expected
to
enjoy
this
much
o
enjoyable
but
wish
it
had
a
stronger
aroma
the
sweet
caramel
and
honey
notes
really
gives
this
beer
a
scottish
feel
to
it
alcohol
wood
and
some
fruit
just
add
to
the
complexity
way
to
go
nebco
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
strong
and
welldisguised
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
odvery
happy
to
try
it
i
love
nebco
perhaps
my
favorite
new
england
brewery
this
is
by
no
means
in
the
same
tier
as
gandhibot
or
imperial
stout
trooper
but
i
did
enjoy
it
lots
going
on
here
scotch
ale
is
my
favorite
style
and
this
beer
rocks
but
it
is
only
here
like
brigadoon
for
an
instant
love
this
beer
overall
obviously
higher
on
the
abv
than
the
average
scotch
ale
this
is
full
boozy
and
enjoyable
not
one
of
the
styles
i
really
get
into
but
i
enjoyed
my
glass
overall
this
is
a
sipper
and
is
a
lot
more
oaky
than
i
could
ever
have
imagined
a
solid
sipper
that
is
different
from
other
scotch
ales
that
i
have
tried
one
per
sitting
but
i
would
revisit
this
one
well
done
though
a
bit
thin
taste
wise
non
abrasive
and
a
good
sipper
dangerous
as
the
abv
is
well
masked
o
this
is
quite
amazing
probably
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
tastes
more
like
a
barleywine
actually
will
definitely
buy
again
o
overall
a
really
good
scotch
ale
with
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
toffee
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
alcohol
in
the
nose
and
might
consider
aging
one
if
i
got
more
would
like
to
have
again
o
a
solid
scotch
ale
not
sure
if
the
age
mellowed
it
or
what
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
overly
sweet
and
definitely
not
overly
boozy
at
all
i
would
drink
this
again
d
oh
this
is
good
a
bit
of
a
booze
bomb
that
is
a
definite
sipper
the
typical
wee
heavy
goodness
is
dialed
back
a
notch
while
the
booze
is
dialed
up
still
very
rewarding
im
quite
glad
that
i
opted
to
pick
up
a
2nd
bottle
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
2
snifters
light
amber
pour
big
white
head
the
aroma
was
caramel
alcohol
sweet
caramel
the
flavor
was
sweet
alcohol
notes
caramel
malts
the
finish
lingered
the
beer
was
medium
to
full
bodied
good
carbonation
a
solid
beer
but
not
best
in
class
overall
yeesh
just
an
odd
odd
brew
though
not
ever
in
an
enjoyable
sense
and
certainly
nothing
i
would
ever
identify
as
a
scotch
ale
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
lingering
finish
this
is
definitely
a
little
on
the
hot
side
but
delivers
a
nice
offering
of
flavors
to
go
with
the
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
big
malty
sweet
sipping
beer
i
needed
to
split
this
with
more
than
2
people
this
coming
year
ill
buy
a
few
to
lay
down
to
mellow
it
out
8
500ml
bottle
its
a
fair
price
overall
yet
another
tasty
brew
from
nebco
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
heading
into
this
one
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
drinking
this
in
late
june
i
actually
enjoyed
it
and
would
probably
prefer
something
darker
and
more
robust
during
the
colder
months
however
this
would
be
most
enjoyable
in
the
spring
or
fall
months
it
was
a
bit
boozy
at
first
but
that
was
fine
with
me
and
it
wasnt
too
syrupy
sweet
either
it
was
a
very
creamy
scotch
ale
despite
all
the
myriad
of
flavors
going
on
in
there
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
that
will
likely
be
cracked
at
some
point
in
the
fall
would
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
whirl

o
not
quite
to
the
style
but
damned
complex
nonetheless
ach
youll
love
it
you
cheeseeating
surrender
monkeys
o
a
nice
beer
but
not
my
favorite
within
my
favorite
style
pours
a
murky
deep
burnt
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
light
lacing
with
fair
retention
aroma
is
boozy
sweet
of
vanilla
cherries
and
hints
of
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
fairly
carbonated
taste
is
sweet
slightly
boozy
nutty
of
vanilla
and
malty
overall
tasty
but
a
bit
light
on
the
scotch
ale
taste
really
cool
bottle
to
enjoy
this
one
was
right
up
my
alley
overall
this
may
not
be
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
out
there
but
it
is
very
solid
worth
a
try
drink
still
a
very
tasty
brew
and
a
welcome
extra
nice
sweet
turn
on
the
style
to
make
it
nebco
unique
would
like
to
have
again
reasonably
tasty
but
very
strong
both
in
flavor
and
in
alcohol
content
not
the
best
example
of
its
style
but
if
there
are
no
other
scotch
ales
available
you
wont
be
too
disappointed
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
with
a
thin
head
its
smell
hits
w
liquor
right
away
scotch
of
course
there
is
also
sweetness
from
brown
sugar
vanilla
upon
taking
a
sip
the
taste
has
caramel
nuts
wood
more
scotch
mf
is
medheavy
a
good
scotch
ale
although
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
nebco
drinkability
complex
and
interesting
would
be
the
simple
way
to
describe
wet
willy
great
foundation
of
dark
fruit
and
caramel
upon
which
the
oak
chip
aging
is
put
on
display
what
makes
this
beer
so
successful
is
that
it
achieves
a
balance
the
oak
isnt
a
commanding
factor
and
does
not
pull
your
attention
away
from
the
rich
malt
flavors
a
great
warming
libation
on
a
cold
spring
night
o
overall
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
really
stands
out
as
a
must
have
again
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
with
the
malt
just
winning
out
in
the
battle
against
the
hops
a
bit
of
a
different
impression
of
the
style
i
could
have
this
again
without
a
problem
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
not
an
especially
good
beer
they
need
to
tweak
this
recipe
some
really
this
is
the
third
disappointment
of
the
night
thin
dull
simple
id
rather
have
a
beer
knock
me
for
a
loop
in
a
daredevil
attempt
at
somthing
rather
than
this
boring
i
am
sorry
to
report
dalcohol
very
apparent
after
a
few
drinks
but
it
is
10
a
nice
malty
taste
but
could
only
have
one
per
sitting
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
slightly
hazy
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
complex
maybe
sherry
and
flavor
is
sweetish
sherry
different
scotch
ale
expecting
more
dark
fruit
high
abv
is
hidden
not
cheap
7
99
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
while
it
is
a
decent
beer
i
dont
really
like
heavy
malt
without
a
heavy
caramel
taste
for
a
scottish
ale
everything
is
there
just
lacking
in
the
area
that
makes
it
a
true
wee
heavy
still
a
good
brew
however
mouthfeel
is
good
its
mediumfull
bodied
and
has
a
strong
bitter
finish
the
alcohol
level
is
good
and
doesnt
bite
you
even
though
it
makes
itself
noticeable
good
carbonation
level
i
guess
its
the
grapeskin
mentioned
earlier
but
there
is
a
slight
sour
feel
to
it
i
find
it
pretty
drinkable
but
more
of
a
sipper
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
big
letdown
and
i
still
cant
seem
to
find
an
american
brewery
who
can
nail
this
style
like
the
country
of
its
origin
d
for
10
abv
and
a
ton
a
flavor
this
stays
fairly
drinkable
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
but
it
all
stays
really
nice
and
balanced
lots
of
sweetness
but
again
it
stays
very
enjoyable
and
avoids
getting
cloying
i
liked
it
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
other
reviewers
drinkability
lacks
the
layers
of
malt
and
some
of
the
sweetness
that
one
finds
in
the
best
examples
of
the
style
still
this
is
quite
a
decent
stab
at
a
wee
heavy
d
every
sip
i
take
brings
a
new
life
to
this
beer
and
i
learn
something
new
so
ill
enjoy
it
all
the
way
through
highly
recommended
this
is
a
wicked
cool
brew
d
at
the
abv
and
the
big
flavors
not
the
session
beer
drinkability
this
was
a
letdown
very
peculiar
with
the
heavy
fruit
esters
and
leafy
bitterness
again
my
mind
conjures
up
peach
vodka
and
flat
tonic
water
if
you
gave
me
this
beer
and
asked
me
to
guess
what
it
was
i
certainly
wouldnt
have
guessed
scotch
ale
not
enough
of
that
classic
caramelized
malt
character
that
typifies
the
style
didnt
hate
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
reaching
for
more
too
boozy
for
all
night
and
not
dark
or
heavy
enough
to
treat
like
a
true
sipper
but
definitely
something
to
visit
d
solid
all
around
bold
and
flavorful
yet
nothing
really
stands
out
good
representation
of
the
style
if
not
a
bit
safe
oh
well
its
still
quite
good
a
pretty
disappointing
offering
from
new
england
the
secondary
flavors
e
g
alcohol
dark
fruit
malt
sweetness
etc
just
never
developed
instead
what
is
left
is
a
rather
bland
onenote
offering
with
some
flavor
flaws
along
the
way
definitely
worth
the
78
dollars
pours
kind
of
murky
dark
amber
with
a
thing
layer
of
white
foam
that
vanishes
almost
right
away
toasty
malt
aroma
with
slight
caramel
sweetness
and
a
slightly
fruity
aroma
the
flavor
is
really
malty
with
a
kind
of
sweet
slightly
fruity
flavor
and
a
caramel
finish
the
feel
is
good
with
a
nice
medium
body
and
soft
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
its
kind
of
boozy
with
a
warm
finish
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
each
scotch
ale
i
come
across
is
a
bit
different
but
each
is
enjoyable
wet
willy
uses
less
roasted
malt
and
more
caramelized
sugars
compared
to
what
i
am
use
to
the
flavor
is
a
pleasant
departure
from
my
norm
wet
willy
managed
to
catch
me
off
guard
more
than
once
each
time
leaving
me
pleasantly
surprised
i
like
this
beer
i
would
advise
checking
it
out
d
very
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
scotch
ale
taste
starts
sweet
a
peek
of
tart
fruitiness
in
the
middle
citrus
hops
to
a
vanilla
alcohol
close
aftertaste
lingers
of
earthiness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
maybe
a
bit
lacking
in
carbonation
with
reasonable
drinkability
as
well
could
be
a
bit
better
for
me
but
still
and
enjoyable
brew
d
highly
drinkable
thanks
to
the
subtle
flavors
and
smooth
characteristics
could
never
tell
this
was
a
10
abv
brew
cant
wait
to
buy
another
bottle
of
this
i
was
told
by
a
distributor
that
only
50
cases
of
this
is
made
i
am
unaware
of
the
validity
of
this
cloudy
and
copper
in
color
fingersized
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
i
cant
really
smell
much
on
it
maybe
a
bit
of
smoke
remarkably
smooth
for
a
10
scotch
ale
and
dangerously
drinkable
carameltoffeeboozy
flavors
cheers
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
for
the
high
abv
this
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
love
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
to
light
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
peat
caramel
and
a
small
roast
in
the
taste
dry
peat
dry
caramel
and
a
small
sweet
earthiness
a
small
bite
but
mainly
smooth
and
a
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
earth
and
almost
sweet
pear
in
the
aftertaste
nice
small
fruit
and
nice
dry
caramel
and
malt
quite
nice
to
me
thus
seems
a
bigger
bodied
more
rounded
backwoods
bastard
a
fascinating
beer
well
balanced
but
quite
bold
and
unique
it
tastes
like
a
bit
like
a
brown
or
strong
ale
aged
in
whiskey
barrels
well
worth
seeking
out
i
am
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
check
out
after
some
cellar
time
d
i
didnt
realise
this
was
packing
10
until
i
took
my
first
sip
and
made
the
realization
that
this
beer
is
strong
and
they
made
no
effort
to
hide
that
fact
good
show
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
10abv
seems
low
on
this
one
not
entirely
tough
to
drink
but
definitely
a
sipper
that
wont
leave
you
wanting
more
in
one
sitting
anyway
overall
a
very
nice
brew
lots
going
on
but
balanced
out
well
d
this
is
a
very
inviting
scotch
ale
from
a
drinkability
perspective
the
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
help
balance
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
which
results
in
a
clean
finish
each
sip
encourages
another
drinkability
is
good
very
solid
example
of
the
style
with
more
body
this
would
be
really
good
theres
plenty
of
body
here
with
lightish
carbonation
a
good
feel
and
good
drinkability
once
i
got
used
to
the
taste
ive
decided
me
likes
d
great
dessert
beer
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
not
harsh
just
pleasantly
warming
and
flavors
definitely
arent
detrimental
bad
part
is
that
the
flavors
are
kind
of
weak
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
worth
the
premium
price
tag
for
me
this
is
a
definite
success
by
new
england
taking
a
style
that
i
dont
typically
care
for
that
much
and
making
it
a
delightful
sipper
i
say
sipper
because
i
know
the
abv
but
if
it
wasnt
on
the
label
i
would
never
guess
it
the
way
it
drinks
thats
a
testament
to
how
smooth
and
balanced
it
is
a
really
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
savor
on
a
cool
evening
db
a
malty
butter
bomb
quite
unique
and
filled
with
diacetyl
i
really
dont
mind
it
but
i
could
see
some
people
ripping
this
apart
very
impressed
by
the
fact
that
it
is
single
malt
must
have
a
beast
of
a
yeast
caramel
and
ruby
colored
with
a
beige
head
that
settles
out
quickly
very
low
aroma
of
caramel
and
metallic
note
flavors
of
caramel
and
toffee
some
vanilla
a
bit
woody
maltiness
is
offset
with
firm
bitterness
finishes
with
some
grassy
hop
notes
and
mild
phenols
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
slick
but
finishes
tingly
slight
warming
of
the
cheeks
tasty
beer
but
not
too
complex
was
expecting
more
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
feels
viscous
and
almost
gluey
in
the
mouth
reminiscent
of
the
feel
of
a
roggenbier
that
has
a
huge
portion
of
rye
in
the
grain
bill
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
brew
i
like
it
but
it
is
outside
the
box
right
now
it
is
safe
to
say
that
it
is
a
bit
hot
and
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
and
blend
the
flavors
once
the
boldness
of
the
hops
and
alcohol
chill
out
there
could
be
a
spectacular
scotch
ale
hiding
within
this
was
a
strange
and
interesting
take
on
a
scotch
ale
butter
taste
will
probably
be
over
the
top
for
some
but
i
enjoyed
it
for
the
most
part
skål
as
is
probably
clear
from
everything
above
nebco
impresses
me
with
their
brewing
skills
once
again
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
i
could
drink
quite
a
lot
of
this
500ml
bottle
pours
a
murky
as
hell
light
brown
medium
sized
head
lots
of
lacing
interesting
aromas
of
booze
and
caramel
apple
taste
is
only
slightly
boozey
caramel
and
malt
flavors
nice
warming
alcohol
taste
almost
has
a
barleywine
characteristic
to
it
but
maybe
im
crazy
this
beer
does
a
nice
job
of
balancing
the
10
abv
but
not
being
abusively
boozey
worth
picking
up
all
in
all
this
is
definitely
a
booze
heavy
brew
this
is
characteristic
of
the
style
however
it
is
not
very
well
hidden
here
this
is
good
to
try
if
you
like
to
taste
the
heavy
booze
flavors
in
your
beer
if
you
like
more
balance
maybe
not
your
best
choice
the
drinkability
is
definitely
a
sipper
although
i
can
easily
see
myself
consuming
more
than
one
d
a
coldweather
sipper
category
scotch
ale
for
sure
the
10
abv
is
big
bold
and
very
noticeable
has
the
warming
sensation
of
a
glass
of
scotch
with
the
sweetness
and
bitter
touch
to
endear
a
good
highabv
brew
for
the
malthead
looking
to
stave
off
the
winter
months
a
while
longer
d
as
far
as
flavorscentmouth
goes
this
is
an
excellent
very
enjoyable
beer
with
many
characteristics
of
scotch
unfortunately
the
high
abv
is
going
to
keep
me
from
drinking
more
than
two
of
these
bummer
cheers
d
extremely
drinkable
didnt
even
realize
this
was
so
high
in
abv
felt
and
tasted
like
it
was
about
half
of
that
great
flavors
mix
for
a
great
beer
pours
reddish
amber
with
a
small
loose
white
head
fades
to
a
ring
and
than
nothing
aroma
is
of
butterscotch
oak
and
whisky
taste
is
powerful
lots
of
caramalized
malt
notes
toffee
whisky
and
rye
notes
as
well
as
some
oak
very
toasty
and
slightly
hot
pretty
nice
thick
full
bodied
beer
that
envelops
your
whole
mouth
this
beer
fresh
is
a
little
hot
i
expect
it
to
get
better
with
age
d
i
dont
drink
many
scotch
ales
but
this
was
delicious
shocked
to
see
this
at
11
very
smooth
not
unlike
a
good
scotch
split
this
with
a
few
people
who
all
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
i
did
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
now
to
find
bottles
this
is
a
very
good
scotch
ale
plenty
of
flavor
and
balance
as
nothing
dominates
anything
else
the
oak
is
just
right
as
well
as
the
sweet
malt
scotch
ales
is
really
not
my
style
but
this
one
i
like
ive
had
some
that
are
tough
to
get
down
but
this
is
certainly
not
one
of
those
this
should
be
out
in
bottle
in
a
couple
of
weeks
a
few
will
be
headed
to
the
cellar
very
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
brown
mahogany
color
with
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
the
nose
brings
forward
some
pretty
nice
aromas
of
caramel
butterscotch
dark
fruits
sweet
bread
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
taste
brings
out
similar
characteristics
but
everything
is
a
tad
bit
harsh
and
slightly
taken
over
by
alcohol
good
body
with
decent
carbonation
though
still
a
bit
hot
im
anxious
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
note
rated
to
the
style
overall
id
say
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
though
d
a
sipper
through
and
through
but
i
am
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
try
this
pour
is
a
cloudy
rubyamber
stickysweet
bourbon
nose
the
taste
is
similar
with
butterscotch
candy
brown
sugar
vanilla
toffee
and
caramel
body
is
a
little
sticky
as
well
they
didnt
do
too
much
to
cover
up
the
alcohol
as
it
is
certainly
present
and
noticeable
overall
by
far
my
favorite
of
this
style
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
toffee
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
toffee
and
a
lot
of
sugar
the
beer
is
extremely
sweet
and
doesnt
have
any
alcohol
or
peet
character
to
it
like
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
style
have
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
for
all
those
who
picked
up
barrelwood
notes
this
is
aged
on
oak
chips
pours
a
kind
of
copper
color
looks
clear
but
the
last
bit
of
the
bottle
drops
in
a
cloud
of
haze
that
settles
trhough
the
head
is
loose
and
maybe
maxes
at
1cm
dies
quickly
but
the
beer
seems
well
carbonated
the
smell
has
caramel
and
sweet
booze
but
i
also
sense
a
kind
of
tealike
smell
in
there
a
little
wood
and
vanilla
come
to
the
nose
as
well
but
you
cant
escape
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
smell
tastes
the
same
sweet
caramel
with
just
a
little
hint
of
booze
its
kind
of
like
a
whiskey
and
coke
or
something
but
with
a
lot
more
on
the
coke
end
though
not
quite
as
sweet
as
straight
cocacola
the
wood
provides
a
nice
bit
of
body
with
a
creamy
feel
and
a
taste
of
vanilla
the
kind
of
leafy
tea
taste
comes
in
with
a
little
wash
in
the
end
the
sweetness
is
nice
but
is
held
in
check
by
a
slight
sharpness
of
booze
a
fairly
nice
tasting
scotch
ale
though
i
would
like
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
beer
well
i
guess
it
does
have
a
little
age
on
it
in
the
form
of
maybe
some
slight
smoke
or
some
roastiness
the
carbonation
is
sharp
and
biting
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
it
calms
down
considerably
about
halfway
through
at
least
at
my
pace
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
overall
an
interesting
beer
one
that
i
really
liked
though
id
like
to
know
what
it
was
like
when
it
was
released
to
compare
to
what
i
had
the
body
is
in
between
medium
and
full
good
enough
but
i
expect
near
perfection
in
my
scotch
ales
drinkability
is
solid
a
nice
sipper
in
a
social
atmosphere
but
not
complex
enough
warrant
much
concentration
when
drinking
alone
d
im
ok
with
just
this
one
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
i
could
anticipate
the
fruity
esters
becoming
overpowering
past
one
bottle
thanks
again
jeremy
i
wish
i
could
appreciate
this
one
more
i
grabbed
two
bottles
of
this
yesterday
at
the
barrel
aged
imperial
stout
trooper
release
at
the
brewery
color
is
lighter
than
expected
ruby
red
with
about
one
finger
of
white
heading
lots
of
yeast
can
be
seen
floating
around
as
well
the
nose
is
immediately
noticeable
with
big
blasts
of
caramel
vanilla
and
dark
stone
fruit
more
of
the
same
from
the
taste
with
more
of
an
essence
of
scotch
and
peat
flavors
coming
through
all
of
these
flavors
are
very
bright
and
in
the
forefront
with
a
bit
of
smoke
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
moderate
to
heavy
alcohol
presence
is
definitely
there
but
does
not
hinder
the
drinking
experience
at
all
it
actually
adds
some
complexity
although
a
sipper
this
one
is
immensely
drinkable
and
damn
tasty
also
the
label
reads
inspired
by
the
mistshrouded
shores
of
lochadam
we
offer
this
handcrafted
scotch
ale
to
you
our
friends
all
i
can
say
is
thanks
right
back
for
an
awesome
brew
drinkability
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
its
definitely
a
bit
more
complex
than
most
scotch
ales
and
the
oak
is
a
welcome
addition
i
think
id
really
like
to
try
more
from
new
england
brewing
but
just
havent
had
the
opportunity
thanks
much
aliza
may
have
a
bit
too
much
scotch
flavor
as
mentioned
above
reminds
reviewer
of
a
slightly
watered
down
scotch
would
perfer
a
little
more
noble
hop
and
grain
profile
may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
also
enjoyable
offering
personal
preferance
may
not
have
been
met
however
quality
offering
here
d
surprisingly
drinkable
and
coy
willy
will
take
you
out
to
the
tool
shed
behind
the
school
and
mess
you
up
really
good
beer
overall
and
one
im
glad
i
have
a
few
of
ill
share
another
bottle
soon
with
friends
glad
this
will
be
made
again
this
year
also
md
smooth
and
creamy
but
a
bit
thin
as
it
gets
closer
to
room
temp
still
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
this
beer
will
probably
be
the
one
that
really
lets
me
figure
out
this
style
like
i
want
to
be
able
to
overall
this
was
a
solid
scotch
i
enjoyed
what
the
barrels
did
to
this
style
the
abv
didnt
show
at
all
making
this
dangerous
i
highly
recommend
this
one
great
for
the
style
plus
drinkable
a
winner
possibly
the
very
definition
of
a
wee
heavy
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
its
release
again
its
rich
and
sweet
on
the
tongue
but
the
sweetness
is
balanced
nicely
by
woody
tannins
butterscotch
toast
and
dates
again
along
with
a
slight
twang
of
more
citrusy
fruit
the
body
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
slightly
syrupy
but
well
carbonated
for
the
style
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
guess
that
this
is
barrelaged
as
the
malt
character
is
very
bourbonlike
it
finishes
bittersweet
a
little
slick
with
a
hint
of
earthiness
light
hoppiness
and
oaky
tannins
linger
on
the
palate
this
one
really
surprised
me
its
very
good
edit
looking
back
at
this
it
doesnt
seem
this
beer
is
barrel
aged
but
damn
if
i
didnt
pick
it
up
hmmmm
my
previous
review
was
st
arnold
divine
reserve
8
which
i
called
one
of
the
better
wee
heavys
i
have
experienced
if
this
wee
heavy
is
1
that
one
is
2
of
those
i
have
had
final
thoughts
a
pretty
nice
tasting
beer
heavy
malts
lots
of
brown
sugar
toasty
flavors
lots
of
smoked
malt
pretty
high
on
the
alcohol
but
feels
much
less
than
10
a
little
too
sweet
but
otherwise
a
tasty
beer
overall
this
one
was
hands
down
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
i
have
had
in
longer
then
i
can
remember
i
would
be
honored
to
try
this
again
and
would
put
it
up
against
anything
else
in
the
style
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
touch
of
smokiness
as
well
as
a
strong
spicy
and
hop
forward
flavor
oily
buttery
body
with
some
caramel
malt
caramel
candy
butterscotch
toffee
and
butter
i
guess
this
is
whats
called
diacetyl
very
different
but
not
my
thing
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
in
fact
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
would
absolutely
enjoy
this
beer
however
it
is
a
young
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
mild
120
min
ipa
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
drink
it
again
unless
it
was
aged
a
couple
of
years
great
drinkability
for
the
style
abv
but
needs
more
malt
depth
to
be
all
scotland
d
a
very
well
done
beer
the
drinkability
was
dangerously
high
this
beer
saved

from
boredom
in
the
beer
wasteland
that
is
cheyenne
wy
thanks
again
jason
d
10
abv
are
you
kidding
me
this
beer
goes
down
dangerously
smooth
overall
wet
willy
is
a
fantastic
brew
that
is
a
must
try
highly
recommended
holy
moly
lots
of
barrel
aged
bourbon
in
the
aroma
and
i
likey
and
the
quaff
is
all
bourbon
malt
and
a
hint
of
smoked
peat
whoo
boy
this
is
one
loaded
up
power
brew
biggest
scotch
ale
ive
ever
enjoyed
im
a
lucky
guy
to
be
able
to
have
sampled
this
fine
brew
pours
a
nice
cloudy
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
bourbon
notes
slight
spicy
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
very
good
bourbon
notes
with
some
slight
spicy
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
potent
little
sucker
lol
thanks
wayne
not
too
drinkable
in
my
book
i
am
surprised
by
the
high
scores
here
to
be
honest
needless
to
say
this
is
a
sipper
a
big
ole
boozy
beer
that
doesnt
mess
around
its
about
the
wood
and
booze
with
the
sweetness
trying
its
best
to
balance
things
out
i
havent
decided
if
it
succeeded
or
not
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
duvel
tulip
poured
a
murky
plum
color
with
a
quarter
inch
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
frothy
band
and
a
slick
of
foam
zero
lacing
on
this
one
nose
reveals
dark
fruit
caramel
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
old
ale
some
bourbon
and
perhaps
a
malted
peat
quality
incredible
taste
and
complexity
not
really
what
i
would
consider
a
scotch
ale
though
maybe
an
american
strong
caramel
booze
vanilla
and
bourbon
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
lightly
carbonated
that
slightly
coats
the
tongue
this
is
one
tasty
brew
however
the
9
39
price
tag
is
tough
an
incredible
sipper
nonetheless
there
is
no
denying
the
scotch
ale
it
will
own
your
taste
buds
amen
to
that
i
have
had
my
share
of
wishy
washy
scotch
ales
the
smoked
peat
is
present
in
both
the
aroma
and
palate
finishing
actually
pretty
smooth
i
picked
up
vanilla
and
herbal
traits
as
well
in
the
palate
as
it
went
down
oh
so
easy
at
10
this
is
a
big
boy
to
handle
i
could
probably
drink
two
in
a
night
and
be
happy
with
that
drinkability
is
an
odd
category
when
reviewing
beers
that
are
noted
for
their
strong
or
unique
flavors
so
i
left
it
at
4
as
i
could
drink
this
anytime
it
is
offered
now
please
release
the
bottles
pours
an
amber
carbonless
color
the
aroma
is
very
boozy
the
taste
is
also
very
strong
in
the
scotch
department
at
1st
the
beer
is
almost
overwelming
but
after
a
few
sips
it
mellows
out
a
little
bit
still
very
strong
for
a
scotch
ale
slightly
cloudy
medium
copper
color
with
modest
a
white
head
and
average
lace
it
has
a
strong
herbal
almost
minty
peppery
aroma
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
mild
herbal
with
a
background
of
honey
and
sweet
wheat
a
hint
of
scotch
without
a
heavy
alcohol
dominance
this
is
incredibly
smooth
and
more
drinkable
than
most
wee
heavies
new
england
has
a
very
different
and
highly
enjoyable
brew
here
cant
wait
to
have
another
pours
a
foggy
orangish
brown
the
nose
is
perfumed
and
floral
flavor
is
vanilla
and
wood
is
there
as
well
very
smooth
slightly
sweet
silky
slick
feel
low
but
noticeable
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
smooth
wee
heavy
that
carries
some
great
character
with
it
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
with
some
southwest
style
mexican
food
roasted
malt
whisky
barreled
coffee
peat
slight
caramel
red
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
a
nice
clean
easy
drinker
this
seems
like
it
may
be
a
good
beer
to
convert
bmc
drinkers
to
craft
overall
impression
nice
offering
a
good
choice
for
the
first
snowfall
of
the
season
excellent
sam
adams
brew
here
something
id
like
to
see
around
in
the
fall
but
i
believe
it
is
only
available
throughout
the
spring
samuel
adams
doesnt
just
provide
a
superficial
glimpse
of
the
scotch
ale
style
as
many
brewers
do
they
provide
you
with
a
bona
fide
example
that
is
indistinguishable
from
the
immemorial
ales
of
scotland
while
it
doesnt
take
the
style
to
the
same
extremes
as
other
american
micros
id
still
consider
this
one
of
my
favourite
examples
this
side
of
the
pond
poured
in
snifter
o
probably
the
most
easydrinking
sessionable
version
of
a
scotch
ale
ive
had
not
the
best
one
but
a
really
solid
rendition
overall
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
that
is
nice
for
all
the
floavor
you
get
from
a
lower
abv
version
of
the
style
i
tend
to
like
this
style
and
there
are
others
out
there
that
i
would
choose
over
this
that
said
it
is
probably
one
of
the
first
ones
i
will
claim
out
of
the
sam
adams
variety
packs
note
i
thought
the
taste
was
really
good
especially
since
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
smell
conclusion
this
like
almost
everything
brewed
by
the
boston
beer
co
is
a
well
crafted
moderately
complex
tasty
beer
i
think
it
holds
true
to
the
original
style
and
tastes
quite
good
good
flavor
especially
warm
feel
is
too
easy
for
a
scotch
ale
it
finishes
cleanly
and
unfortunately
the
flavor
backs
away
and
disappears
too
quickly
an
easily
accessible
scotch
ale
love
the
use
of
fruit
and
the
way
the
alcohol
compliments
it
like
that
of
wine
nice
brew
for
the
sampler
packs
like
its
counterpart
the
irish
red
its
a
well
sam
adams
view
on
the
style
i
would
love
to
see
this
distributed
more
its
very
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
stay
thirsty
my
friends
not
as
much
caramel
aroma
as
i
expected
a
little
chocolate
a
little
roast
a
very
small
hint
of
smoke
the
flavors
are
slightly
more
bold
in
particular
the
smoke
is
stronger
lending
a
touch
of
meatiness
overall
though
its
lacking
in
both
sweetness
and
robustness
fairly
thick
but
not
exactly
coating
a
tasty
enough
beer
but
somewhat
frustrating
in
its
tameness
d
this
wasnt
bad
but
not
terribly
impressive
below
average
scent
and
not
very
clean
or
delicious
taste
not
difficult
to
drink
but
not
overly
enjoyable
either
there
are
lots
of
better
scotch
ales
out
there
overall
a
good
solid
rep
of
the
scotch
ale
clan
pours
a
reddish
amber
thick
head
lacing
smells
peaty
smokey
but
clean
taste
has
a
smoky
bite
to
it
balanced
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
on
the
end
acidic
quality
to
it
works
clean
mouthful
but
bitterness
lingers
overall
a
very
nice
wee
heavy
from
sam
adams
never
would
have
thought
to
give
this
brew
a
try
but
with
the
sam
adams
variety
pack
its
great
not
to
have
to
spend
on
a
full
6
pack
of
something
that
may
be
a
bust
this
brew
is
great
i
could
enjoy
year
round
pours
a
pretty
solid
looking
one
finger
creamy
head
that
is
sticking
around
pretty
well
and
is
giving
good
lacing
the
body
is
dark
dark
red
with
a
fair
amount
of
brown
in
it
lots
of
carbonation
maybe
too
much
we
will
see
overall
this
looks
really
good
the
head
is
very
impressive
if
it
werent
for
the
carbonation
this
would
look
perfect
it
for
sure
smells
like
a
scotch
ale
deep
malt
smell
with
a
molassesmaple
syrup
smell
it
smells
solid
doesnt
smell
like
there
is
much
wrong
with
it
does
it
smell
amazing
no
but
good
the
flavor
on
this
is
a
little
disappointing
its
not
a
bad
flavor
or
anything
just
really
boring
its
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
even
a
little
creamy
but
its
just
not
that
complex
and
its
lacking
in
flavor
you
get
that
molassesmaple
syrup
taste
and
that
deep
malt
taste
but
the
flavors
are
just
dumbed
down
a
bit
all
around
there
isnt
really
anything
wrong
with
it
no
offensive
flavors
or
anything
its
just
boring
not
complex
and
not
enough
flavor
its
that
simple
the
carbonation
is
better
than
i
though
it
would
be
not
too
much
and
the
body
overall
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
decent
kinda
a
toss
up
between
it
not
having
enough
good
flavor
but
at
the
same
time
being
light
because
of
that
lack
of
flavor
overall
its
a
good
beer
just
very
average
in
the
creativity
category
and
flavor
category
overall
a
somewhat
bland
take
on
the
scottish
ale
style
i
would
drink
it
if
offered
but
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
again
poured
a
dark
copper
burgandy
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
smells
of
malt
smokey
peat
tasted
of
malt
then
earthy
hops
with
a
hint
of
caramel
subtle
nutty
pecan
carbinated
a
little
too
much
for
me
but
nothing
too
excessive
overall
a
smooth
offering
from
sa
came
in
a
sample
12
pack
and
worth
a
try
the
smoky
edge
here
is
a
nice
flavor
and
kind
of
unexpected
for
me
another
solid
offering
from
sam
adams
the
mixed
packs
are
pretty
much
a
must
buy
a
few
times
a
year
this
is
way
better
than
i
expected
i
was
expecting
a
weak
overly
sweet
mess
but
this
was
good
i
love
all
the
smoke
in
this
beer
it
gives
it
a
real
unique
flavor
this
scotch
ale
pours
out
as
a
reddish
copper
colored
beer
with
a
decent
tan
head
on
it
that
settles
by
mid
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
a
on
the
sweet
side
with
some
possible
caramel
malts
there
is
a
very
light
aroma
of
peat
or
some
kind
of
earthy
tone
to
it
the
taste
is
decent
this
beer
is
big
on
malts
and
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
hops
in
it
its
mostly
a
slightly
roasted
sweet
earthy
brew
its
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
pretty
easy
to
put
a
few
down
d
easy
to
finish
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
the
almost
session
strength
beer
i
wish
they
sold
this
in
six
packs
id
be
all
over
it
overall
i
was
very
exicted
to
try
this
beer
when
i
picked
up
the
sampler
pack
but
was
kinda
let
down
i
was
kinda
let
down
and
i
love
sam
adams
d
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
not
sure
if
its
the
style
or
interpretation
almost
surprisingly
where
this
beer
lacks
in
aroma
it
more
than
makes
up
for
in
flavor
this
beer
comes
in
with
a
medium
to
full
bodied
but
big
smoky
flavor
caramel
malts
and
even
some
light
earthy
hops
show
through
for
excellent
balance
in
the
extensive
smoky
finish
soft
and
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
make
it
an
easy
drink
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
necessarily
consider
this
my
style
o
ive
always
loved
this
one
and
look
forward
to
getting
to
it
whenever
i
go
through
a
sa
variety
pack
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
metallic
twang
a
light
body
and
mellow
carbonation
a
decent
beer
thats
tastes
alright
but
just
is
a
little
off
base
for
my
palate
preference
ok
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
thin
bad
sam
adams
scotch
12ozs
into
hopnog
pint
pours
a
beutiful
ruby
shade
with
a
light
tan
14
head
that
drops
quickly
smells
great
loads
of
the
usual
crystal
malt
pinch
of
chocolate
malt
slight
hint
of
smoked
malt
and
a
very
soft
touch
of
hallertaus
taste
is
earthy
sweet
and
smokey
a
very
enjoyable
wee
that
stands
out
in
its
own
class
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pair
this
brew
with
a
few
strips
of
bacon
uncured
ham
chops
ect
anything
that
can
match
its
subtle
smoke
will
prove
itself
to
be
a
great
reward
cheers
ive
never
had
a
scotch
ale
below
7
this
does
it
well
the
super
butterytoasty
feel
makes
it
feel
a
little
typicalsam
adams
for
me
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
a
mainly
clear
dark
copper
colored
brew
small
tan
head
slight
chill
haze
scent
is
mainly
caramel
malts
just
a
bit
of
hops
pretty
malty
taste
some
bittering
elements
some
candy
sugar
notes
pretty
full
bodied
with
a
soft
feel
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
something
is
holding
it
back
a
bit
overall
impression
big
miss
too
much
artificial
smoke
character
and
not
enough
true
scottish
ale
character
overall
not
the
biggest
sam
adams
fan
but
i
will
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
this
is
a
fairly
solid
scotch
ale
the
maltiness
works
well
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
give
this
beer
a
try
if
you
have
whatever
sample
pack
this
came
from
cheers
o
possible
session
if
ontap
somewhere
overall
the
most
sessionable
scotch
ale
ive
had
so
far
very
good
but
not
quite
as
complex
as
others
ive
had
this
is
also
the
only
one
with
a
distinct
peat
flavor
so
thats
good
if
that
is
what
you
like
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
make
this
pretty
drinkable
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
i
like
my
scotch
ales
to
be
a
bit
more
malty
still
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
and
one
that
fits
well
in
sams
seasonal
mix
i
like
sam
adams
scotch
ale
as
a
scottish
ale
with
the
likes
of
robert
the
bruce
i
do
not
feel
it
quite
fits
in
the
same
category
as
a
founders
dirty
bastard
or
dark
horse
scotty
karate
overall
a
good
version
of
a
scotch
overall
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
with
their
special
releases
im
starting
to
reconsider
my
opinion
of
sam
adams
a
nice
dark
but
not
cloudy
beer
reminds
me
of
stained
oak
in
appearance
it
took
me
a
while
to
figure
out
the
taste
i
drank
half
the
stinking
bottle
before
i
could
put
a
label
on
it
it
reminds
me
of
hay
or
grass
mind
you
it
doesnt
taste
bad
just
kinda
grassy
the
smell
is
very
similar
to
boston
lager
so
much
so
that
it
bothers
me
a
little
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
its
fairly
thin
not
too
much
but
not
really
thick
either
overall
i
like
it
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
out
and
buy
a
case
of
it
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
this
beer
started
out
promising
but
fell
to
earth
fast
too
bad
as
i
was
initially
veyr
impressed
with
it
seems
carbonated
and
a
bit
oily
astringency
lingers
theres
a
slight
bitterness
of
english
hops
with
its
herbaltea
flavor
addition
carbonation
is
pushing
it
on
the
high
end
and
the
body
is
far
to
chunky
enough
easy
drinking
but
far
from
the
vanguard
of
the
style
this
beer
was
a
deep
amber
color
with
good
head
and
great
lacing
there
was
a
distinct
smoky
malty
smell
with
a
little
sweetness
to
it
as
well
to
a
large
extent
it
tastes
like
it
smells
earthy
and
smoky
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
i
thought
sa
scotch
ale
was
quite
good
but
seeing
as
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
perhaps
i
have
nothing
else
to
judge
it
against
final
notes
sweet
and
smoky
whats
not
to
like
one
of
sams
better
brews
i
think
finish
malts
and
grass
with
a
little
stickiness
on
the
lips
o
sam
adams
is
as
sam
adams
does
this
isnt
going
to
wow
to
many
people
but
it
is
a
good
brew
which
deserves
to
be
tried
out
d
i
would
have
liked
to
describe
this
unique
beer
better
but
i
was
at
a
loss
of
words
it
has
a
very
interesting
taste
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
would
suggest
you
try
it
d
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
very
drinkable
though
and
not
cloying
in
any
manner
i
dont
like
scotch
ales
that
are
too
heavyhanded
in
the
malty
sweetcaramel
department
it
is
funny
how
beers
can
be
distinct
yet
still
have
a
brewery
character
to
them
this
one
does
that
and
pushes
the
style
boundaries
a
bit
but
above
all
it
is
an
undeniably
fine
drinking
beer
12
oz
into
a
snifter
let
me
preface
this
by
saying
i
am
in
fact
a
big
fan
of
the
style
not
this
beer
ill
try
to
be
constructive
but
this
one
is
fairly
bad
this
style
is
supposed
to
have
a
lot
of
malt
depth
but
its
pretty
much
all
in
one
layer
to
my
taste
buds
and
has
a
slightly
unpleasant
astringency
this
was
purchased
out
of
a
sample
pack
and
id
never
buy
this
on
its
own
especially
not
now
it
has
some
characteristics
of
scotch
ales
but
is
not
as
impressive
as
the
standard
bearers
of
the
style
im
not
sure
what
it
is
about
sam
adams
they
seem
to
get
their
lagers
and
pilseners
done
with
flying
colors
quite
good
brews
but
ive
never
to
this
day
had
a
top
quality
ale
from
them
smell
is
sweet
rich
malt
some
peat
notes
a
little
nutty
taste
is
roasty
and
peaty
some
malt
sweetness
some
smoke
and
a
finishing
dryness
and
wood
flavor
the
body
is
medium
with
active
and
fine
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
silky
and
smooth
beer
overall
an
interesting
brew
though
the
uniqueness
of
the
peat
wood
and
smoke
flavors
would
limit
my
intake
to
one
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
deep
mahogany
with
a
thick
white
foamy
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
in
the
beginning
followed
by
sweet
malt
and
some
hints
of
ripe
fruit
full
smooth
body
earthy
hops
and
smoky
malt
are
balanced
on
the
palate
with
some
hints
of
ripe
fruit
long
dry
finish
nice
ale
an
alright
scotch
ale
on
the
whole
though
its
a
bit
heavy
handed
with
the
peat
smoked
malt
making
for
a
somewhat
onedimensional
beer
overall
grade
b
d
i
like
this
i
enjoy
the
peat
smoked
malts
used
in
scotch
whiskeys
and
the
bit
of
a
kick
at
the
end
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
had
a
lot
to
offer
in
terms
of
depth
and
substance
and
it
was
drinkable
and
accessible
top
10
beers
ive
had
in
the
last
month
da
good
beer
you
can
get
the
sense
of
what
the
start
of
making
the
new
imperial
serials
wee
heavy
is
from
the
wee
heavy
seems
to
be
this
beer
ratcheted
up
a
notch
or
two
d
very
drinkable
nice
flavors
and
balance
without
being
too
heavy
the
smoky
flavors
are
nice
and
not
too
overpowering
really
nicely
balanced
not
very
heavy
i
would
consider
this
to
be
a
lighter
bodied
beer
well
balanced
and
carbonated
that
sits
well
and
drinks
well
certainly
drinkable
and
sellable
in
my
honest
opinion
id
like
to
see
this
in
some
6rs
rather
then
some
of
the
other
brewmaster
collections
out
there
another
good
one
from
bbc
do
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
was
there
even
with
the
hints
of
peatsmoked
malts
props
to
bbc
for
this
offering
would
probably
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
if
offered
d
id
love
one
of
these
on
cask
in
february
d
very
high
lots
of
flavor
without
killing
the
palate
and
a
manageable
abv
for
a
session
i
love
scotch
ales
but
most
american
brewers
seem
to
try
and
go
over
the
top
with
this
style
and
quite
frankly
they
are
awful
sam
adams
hasnt
done
that
and
they
deserve
a
lot
of
credit
i
would
definitely
buy
this
in
droves
if
it
was
offered
in
6
packs
i
would
drink
it
again
but
probally
just
in
the
sampler
packs
couldnt
see
me
buying
a
pack
of
just
this
beer
d
very
drinkable
beer
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
a
fine
brew
the
peated
malts
do
produce
a
distinctive
addition
to
the
taste
but
not
where
it
dominates
the
flavour
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
didnt
particularly
like
this
to
be
honest
that
metallic
taste
was
just
offsetting
would
not
seek
out
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
near
white
finger
plus
of
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
strongly
malty
in
nature
but
there
are
nice
hints
of
cinnamon
and
strong
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
not
good
i
rather
enjoyed
the
caramel
flavoring
with
an
almost
nutty
background
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
the
style
i
expect
a
more
syrupy
body
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
one
of
the
better
beers
that
sams
produces
deep
and
dark
copper
color
with
a
thin
whispy
head
smells
a
little
medicinal
with
a
fermented
cherry
note
as
it
warmed
scents
of
oak
and
smoked
malts
become
more
apparent
giving
it
a
unique
and
pleasent
nose
the
palate
is
pretty
nice
dark
fruits
smoked
and
caramel
malts
and
a
subtle
woody
oak
flavor
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
silky
this
brew
grew
on
me
quite
a
bit
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
high
being
fairweather
fan
of
scotch
i
actually
could
have
stood
to
have
this
be
a
little
stronger
ill
seek
more
in
this
vein
perhaps
with
even
more
of
a
scotchlike
umph
pours
a
supremely
clear
dark
honeyamber
a
tannish
head
patches
to
the
glass
looks
good
already
smell
and
taste
are
definitely
smoky
peaty
malts
mostly
an
underlying
sweetness
balances
things
out
nicely
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
tart
a
lot
of
complexities
going
on
in
this
beer
perhaps
my
favorite
wee
heavy
to
date
like
smoked
meats
and
cheddar
in
a
bottle
and
scotch
verdict
recommended
for
the
maltheavy
lovers
theres
little
to
argue
about
with
this
brew
its
genuinely
saddening
to
see
the
better
sam
adams
selections
relegated
to
mere
cameo
appearances
in
the
seasonal
boxes
this
may
have
been
one
of
the
better
brews
i
have
had
of
sam
adams
a
claim
that
grows
more
definitive
by
the
day
if
it
was
available
in
a
larger
quantity
i
would
get
it
in
lieu
of
lesser
desirables
if
you
can
spare
the
13
for
a
12
pack
it
should
be
a
winner
for
most
a
4
13
d
a
decent
brew
i
think
id
have
another
true
to
style
d
better
than
the
irish
red
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
very
good
full
ritch
flavor
beer
would
highy
recommend
i
am
a
scotch
drinker
and
a
big
fan
of
islays
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
it
can
definitely
be
sessioned
shame
there
are
only
2
in
the
spring
variety
pack
drinkability
not
for
the
brew
pounding
type
this
is
definitely
a
heavy
beer
thought
very
satisfying
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
offerings
along
with
old
fezziwig
and
chocolate
bock
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
if
i
could
so
im
coming
off
a
vacation
cruise
where
all
they
had
was
mostly
americanmexican
balony
beer
i
was
jonesin
for
something
with
some
taste
and
body
ooohhh
yes
had
two
bottles
of
samuel
adams
scotch
ale
chillin
in
the
fridge
soldiers
from
a
recent
mixed
pack
what
a
cure
for
the
beer
blahs
baby
this
beer
has
a
great
malt
flavor
its
dark
amber
color
and
white
head
give
way
to
perfect
lacing
as
i
drink
down
this
wonderful
libation
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
excellent
session
no
question
could
drink
this
all
night
long
enjoy
my
friends
its
complexity
works
against
it
here
i
think
its
a
bit
too
sophisticated
to
drink
much
of
d
another
easy
drinker
from
the
sam
adams
spring
seasonal
multipack
overall
a
pretty
decent
example
of
a
scotch
ale
i
bought
the
spring
mixer
for
this
beer
specifically
and
dont
regret
doing
so
solid
example
of
the
style
and
very
approachable
yeah
its
not
old
chub
but
its
not
8
either
a
bold
sessionable
wee
heavy
one
of
sam
adams
more
robust
regular
offerings
love
that
peat
i
pretty
much
bough
the
sam
adams
spring
released
in
february
btw
mixer
just
for
this
beer
its
as
good
as
i
remember
it
pours
a
sharp
red
color
with
a
one
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
strong
malt
in
the
aroma
but
a
bit
weak
smelling
overall
taste
is
much
stronger
with
toasted
malt
and
a
very
smokey
taste
overall
with
a
bit
of
nut
and
a
bit
of
a
woody
taste
mouthfeel
is
excellently
carbonated
and
full
bodied
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
also
a
very
gulpable
beer
very
good
overall
im
very
impressed
d
just
above
average
drinkablility
goes
down
easy
for
a
while
but
eventually
slows
me
down
a
bit
i
like
it
a
lot
but
id
only
have
one
in
a
night
d
yeah
this
is
very
drinkable
a
good
taste
interesting
not
heavy
not
high
abv
overall
the
light
carbonation
and
smooth
malt
profile
make
this
brew
easy
to
drink
this
pours
copper
with
a
small
white
head
disappearing
to
almost
nothing
with
a
little
lacing
on
the
nose
its
a
mixture
of
sweet
caramel
and
a
smokiness
underneath
that
i
didnt
get
the
peaty
seawater
iodine
notes
that
someone
else
mentioned
which
to
me
would
be
a
positive
in
the
mouth
its
the
caramel
that
comes
out
first
with
a
medium
but
somewhat
cloying
feel
carrying
down
the
slight
smoke
later
on
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
id
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
i
seem
to
remember
last
years
version
being
better
than
this
after
skimming
a
few
of
the
most
recent
reviews
the
peated
malt
seems
to
have
come
off
a
lot
more
strongly
to
my
palate
than
to
most
others
who
tasted
it
maybe
my
palate
is
just
more
sensitive
to
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
beer
would
be
much
improved
by
dialing
down
the
peated
malt
just
slightly
d
the
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
for
me
this
is
a
bit
light
for
a
scotch
ale
but
i
could
and
would
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
better
than
a
number
of
other
sam
adams
brews
however
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
one
perhaps
id
have
been
a
little
more
happy
with
the
purchase
if
i
didnt
buy
their
spring
sampler
pack
specifically
to
get
to
this
brew
great
drink
ability
not
much
alcohol
although
it
is
full
bodied
but
still
very
drinkable
notes
recommended
pretty
big
flavor
and
the
smokiness
was
delicious
d
this
a
a
decent
brew
the
balance
was
good
the
only
negative
was
the
slight
soapy
flavor
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
notched
at
oct
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
caramel
malts
bread
and
earth
taste
is
a
boozey
caramel
with
some
earthiness
to
it
large
amount
of
malts
one
of
the
better
beers
of
this
mix
12
pack
american
originals
good
amount
of
flavor
and
lower
abv
make
it
rather
drinkable
good
beer
di
had
a
difficult
time
getting
through
this
one
the
tastes
really
get
to
me
if
i
had
any
cookable
food
in
my
bachelor
apartment
i
wouldnt
have
finished
this
beer
and
wouldve
kept
it
for
marmalade
it
came
in
the
variety
pack
so
i
have
one
more
left
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
it
d
i
generally
like
scotch
and
scotch
ales
but
i
didnt
find
this
one
especially
drinkable
two
finger
head
with
spider
web
lacing
fades
o
pencil
thin
head
low
carbonation
amber
color
smell
is
very
sweet
like
1
percent
milk
mixed
with
cereal
slight
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
touch
of
hops
at
the
finish
same
with
taste
but
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
could
drink
these
all
the
time
if
i
really
had
to
and
im
picky
about
malty
beers
so
this
one
gets
a
tip
of
the
hat
from
me
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
plain
and
simple
scotch
ale
its
not
going
to
blow
anyone
away
with
it
brute
strength
or
melt
your
digestive
tract
with
its
intense
alcohol
it
will
though
give
you
a
great
indication
of
what
a
flavorful
malty
and
multidimension
scotch
ale
can
be
and
this
one
does
the
job
very
admirably
as
with
most
sam
adams
beers
ive
tasted
yet
there
are
a
few
more
to
go
in
the
variety
pack
this
brew
is
balanced
and
slightly
reserved
this
very
easily
could
have
been
a
malty
syrupy
or
smoky
overload
they
scale
it
back
just
a
touch
so
that
nothing
gets
too
far
out
of
hand
this
is
something
i
like
and
dislike
about
sa
but
in
this
case
i
like
it
another
blizzard
another
variety
pack
this
participant
pours
a
clear
sunrise
garnet
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
creamecru
froth
the
smell
is
kind
of
a
letdown
as
there
aint
much
happenin
here
despite
the
glasss
best
efforts
some
faint
caramel
does
manage
to
come
through
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
does
better
bringing
in
some
toffee
some
minor
pine
some
mild
coffee
a
tinge
of
dark
chocolate
and
an
allusion
to
light
orange
peel
a
light
haze
of
peat
smoke
hovers
over
the
proceedings
the
body
is
a
heftyfeeling
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
chewy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
scotch
ale
not
the
best
ive
tried
but
a
highly
drinkable
one
regardless

d
very
drinkable
i
dont
taste
many
home
runs
from
sam
adams
samplers
but
this
is
one
ive
been
enjoying
this
beer
for
many
years
in
the
various
mixpacks
that
boston
beer
company
releases
its
always
a
highlight
for
me
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
md
could
drink
it
all
night
long
its
a
tricky
body
tastes
full
but
on
the
tongue
is
a
medium
ale
mouthfeel
packs
a
nice
creamy
and
almost
chewy
full
body
feel
especially
for
something
under
6
abv
overall
scotch
ale
is
probably
one
of
bbcs
better
representations
of
all
the
various
styles
they
try
this
style
overall
really
needs
more
love
from
the
craft
beer
scene
d
not
very
drinkable
the
smokiness
of
it
prevents
it
from
being
a
solid
session
beer
overall
a
pretty
bold
expression
im
impressed
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
they
went
further
with
it
than
you
might
expect
them
to
drinkability
one
of
samuel
adams
better
one
off
beers
i
can
see
why
they
dont
put
this
in
six
packs
anymore
this
beer
is
awesome
for
a
ale
drinker
like
me
but
people
used
to
sas
regular
profile
of
beers
might
get
thrown
off
by
the
flavors
here
i
find
the
smoke
flavors
very
authentic
and
the
malt
backbone
thick
and
viscous
yet
not
overbarring
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
decent
session
beer
even
though
23
of
these
would
be
enough
in
one
sitting
glad
to
see
this
one
back
in
the
spring
mix
pack
i
truly
missed
this
beer
m
d
pretty
smooth
good
balance
good
carbonation
needs
to
go
with
certain
foods
and
cannot
have
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
pours
a
clear
amberred
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
very
malty
with
hardly
any
hop
profile
i
also
get
a
lot
of
caramel
and
some
brown
sugar
with
cinnamon
taste
is
surprisingly
smokey
very
smokey
ive
never
had
a
scotch
ale
with
this
much
smokiness
to
it
it
has
a
nice
balance
with
the
malts
and
caramel
flavors
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
leaves
the
lining
of
the
mouth
with
a
nice
crisp
feeling
drinkability
is
high
tasty
scotch
ale
d
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
a
little
too
slated
on
the
smokypeat
end
of
things
but
over
all
enjoyable
a
decent
beer
nothing
too
remarkable
but
one
of
the
better
attempts
at
a
scotch
ale
here
in
the
us
and
better
than
a
few
imports
too
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
hue
still
appeared
bright
though
good
clarity
the
smell
came
off
strong
kind
of
bitter
with
a
flowery
aspect
the
taste
really
stood
out
the
smoky
taste
was
strong
it
wasnt
too
heavy
though
accompanied
by
a
malty
woody
taste
overall
was
a
good
balance
between
the
woody
smoky
and
sweet
goes
down
easily
especially
with
a
meal
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
i
tend
to
think
that
the
sam
variety
packs
are
kind
of
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
certainly
a
hit
i
will
seek
it
out
again
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
two
finger
head
looks
really
good
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
smell
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
im
getting
mostly
earthy
malts
as
i
sip
this
tastewise
this
doesnt
stand
out
very
much
to
me
its
good
enough
like
most
sam
adams
beers
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
having
said
that
its
going
down
nicely
and
quickly
as
i
type
this
the
mouthfeel
is
good
theres
really
nothing
to
complain
about
here
its
paired
well
to
the
style
a
touch
more
body
wouldnt
hurt
the
drinkability
is
absolutely
superb
it
goes
down
very
easily
coats
the
throat
perfectly
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
great
scotch
ale
that
i
wish
were
in
wider
distribution
this
is
a
great
one
for
sure
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
wee
heavy
style
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
another
of
this
is
a
very
meaty
brew
ive
had
scotch
ales
before
but
were
much
more
stronger
this
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
due
the
sacrifice
of
alcohol
but
it
does
quite
well
when
compared
with
other
scotch
ales
really
impresses
with
this
beer
that
i
hijacked
from
my
friends
house
out
of
a
sampler
12
pack
that
another
dinner
guest
brought
pours
out
a
deep
copper
almost
mahogany
color
smell
is
somewhat
faint
but
upon
big
sniff
i
am
detecting
some
smokey
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
mildly
bitter
and
mostly
peaty
smoked
scotch
malts
the
beer
has
that
characteristic
peatdirt
taste
of
the
funky
scotch
malts
slightly
phenolic
and
vaguely
astringent
tasting
too
all
by
products
of
this
malt
dont
get
me
wrong
the
beer
still
smells
and
tastes
very
clean
almost
lagerlike
in
some
ways
it
sounds
like
this
beer
is
sort
of
a
mess
but
in
reality
is
a
nicely
balanced
rich
and
flavorful
slightly
smokey
beer
i
bet
this
beer
would
be
killer
with
some
good
bbq
ribs
or
even
some
chicken
it
is
just
that
drinkable
and
easy
on
the
tastebuds
for
someone
like
me
who
gets
nausea
even
just
thinking
of
smoked
beers
though
i
have
yet
to
really
try
i
love
bbq
so
what
am
i
so
afraid
of
d
extremely
drinkable
the
smoke
taste
is
very
enticing
and
makes
you
want
more
which
is
very
possible
with
the
5
4
id
love
to
session
this
but
unfortunately
it
only
come
in
2s
with
the
mixed
pack
incredibly
drinkable
pours
a
luxurious
shade
of
red
to
copper
with
very
light
tan
to
offwhite
head
beautiful
appearance
as
usual
with
a
sam
adams
beer
nose
does
have
the
identifiable
smoked
quality
along
with
some
appetizing
caramel
notes
glad
it
isnt
a
big
bitch
slap
in
the
face
of
smoke
like
other
craft
wee
heavies
out
there
nice
balance
of
roasty
smoky
and
sweet
malt
flavors
on
the
palate
just
simply
a
delight
to
imbibe
refreshing
and
very
very
drinkable
drinkability
not
a
big
fan
of
the
bitterness
and
it
is
filling
but
still
better
then
some
very
tasty
brew
here
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
red
ales
andor
scotch
ales
very
nicely
done
boston
beer
company
another
slam
dunk
head
was
consistent
when
poured
into
a
class
from
the
bottle
stayed
with
the
beer
till
the
end
carmel
flavors
and
overall
very
smooth
unique
idea
with
the
scotch
whiskey
malt
it
is
noticeable
in
the
scent
and
less
so
in
the
taste
i
do
enjoy
the
variety
packs
sam
adams
has
been
offering
as
of
late
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
it
is
solid
this
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
tough
to
drink
many
of
these
though
drinkability
not
bad
overall
good
taste
low
abv
certainly
not
founders
dirty
bastard
but
then
again
it
is
also
a
bit
cheaper
so
depending
on
your
sway
its
a
decent
choice
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
and
no
lacing
nose
brings
through
quite
a
few
notes
with
caramel
slightlyburnt
toast
and
a
slight
peaty
character
some
light
dark
fruit
characteristics
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
mostly
caramel
and
some
dark
toast
medium
feel
with
good
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
booze
drinkability
is
pretty
good
and
a
pretty
good
low
alcohol
example
of
the
style
sam
adams
delivers
once
again
with
this
tasty
scotch
ale
it
pours
a
golden
brown
with
a
thick
head
of
foam
that
sticks
around
well
beyond
the
first
sip
it
has
a
bold
taste
with
an
almost
nutty
taste
to
it
a
good
tasty
beer
with
a
pizza
but
not
exactly
a
summer
cookout
beer
in
my
opinion
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
had
a
deep
rich
carmel
color
with
a
inch
of
nice
creamy
head
on
it
then
a
nice
lace
around
the
edge
it
has
a
nice
smell
of
carmel
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
beer
hits
the
tongue
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
it
has
a
nice
bitter
taste
to
it
it
has
a
little
carbination
but
not
to
much
great
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
d
very
decent
id
readily
buy
it
again
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pretty
richly
flavored
to
me
i
see
myself
having
a
few
on
a
mild
to
cool
evening
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
sam
adams
cheers
d
this
is
easy
to
drink
a
low
abv
makes
this
scotch
ale
a
worthy
choice
drinkability
damn
good
id
certainly
like
to
sip
on
these
all
night
abv
is
solid
at
5
4
and
although
i
feel
like
im
drinking
something
a
lot
stronger
it
doesnt
hit
nearly
as
hard
very
interesting
and
stays
fresh
notes
not
a
bad
beer
but
didnt
really
impress
me
past
the
appearance
pours
a
brownish
amber
like
color
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
followed
by
some
good
lacing
and
light
carbonation
chocolate
malty
taste
that
was
also
a
bit
nutty
smell
was
the
same
probably
one
of
the
better
samuel
adams
beers
ive
had
would
drink
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
smooth
and
drinkbable
while
still
carrying
some
weight
to
it
one
of
the
beers
i
wish
was
offered
all
year
by
the
brewery
and
not
just
in
the
brewmasters
collection
a
good
domestic
version
of
the
style
but
misses
big
on
tradition
not
overly
smokey
not
big
bodied
or
big
alcohol
but
a
tasty
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
multiples
they
stuck
with
their
tradition
and
their
target
market
a
real
play
it
safe
scotch
ale
ive
had
better
but
this
is
good
one
if
you
are
new
to
the
style
or
want
to
have
more
than
one
without
getting
kicked
in
the
face
by
alcohol
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
still
a
substantial
mouthfeel
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
sam
adams
at
its
best
whiskey
lovers
will
like
this
one
anyone
will
appreciate
it
this
is
a
good
brew
although
not
the
best
scotch
ale
i
have
tried
what
it
lacks
it
huge
flavor
looks
and
mouthfeel
it
makes
up
in
drinkability
as
this
can
be
sessioned
a
good
solid
brew
i
may
well
have
to
rereview
after
having
a
few
more
of
the
style
this
one
likely
seems
a
wee
light
to
make
a
proper
wee
heavy
weve
always
been
fond
of
this
brew
even
though
it
doesnt
hold
its
own
against
many
of
the
other
americanbrewed
scotch
ales
that
are
double
its
size
that
said
its
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
most
drinkable
scotch
ales
combine
it
with
some
herbcrusted
grilled
pork
chops
and
broiled
stuffed
apples
drinkability
is
pretty
great
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
although
a
little
light
on
the
abv
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
good
flavor
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
availability
as
i
had
looked
for
this
beer
for
a
while
and
it
seems
to
only
be
found
in
the
variety
box
would
be
good
as
a
sixpack
taste
not
quite
as
good
as
mcewans
but
reminiscient
and
durable
not
were
exceeding
expectations
peat
and
smoke
are
detectable
but
far
from
overwhelming
not
your
standard
sa
beer
nicely
unique
smoke
sweet
and
peat
not
too
many
like
that
lots
to
think
about
and
find
throughout
this
beer
not
necessariy
the
easiest
or
cheapest
beer
to
drink
drinkability
is
good
this
is
the
lightest
scotch
ale
i
have
had
and
one
i
could
see
drink
a
few
at
a
time
drinkability
a
great
beer
sam
adams
really
hit
this
one
on
the
head
i
wish
that
this
one
was
more
available
outside
the
mixed
packs
definitely
worth
a
try
yet
another
good
brew
from
samuel
adams
really
good
stuff
not
big
in
terms
of
flavors
but
there
is
enough
to
satisfy
here
apparently
this
is
hard
to
find
this
beer
has
introduced
me
to
the
scotch
ale
genre
well
done
sam
adams
md
mouthfeel
is
good
a
tiny
bite
from
what
seems
like
alcohol
even
though
the
abv
isnt
there
to
back
it
up
very
good
drinkable
beer
that
is
full
flavored
and
good
for
a
spring
evening
this
beer
is
really
quite
good
it
has
a
wonderful
aroma
to
it
and
though
it
looks
just
average
when
poured
out
it
has
a
splendid
taste
and
a
rich
flavorful
mouthfeel
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
these
with
no
problem
its
too
bad
they
dont
release
this
more
widely
or
i
would
be
first
in
line
to
buy
it
in
mass
quantities
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
tan
head
good
retention
and
some
lacing
evident
aroma
has
nuttiness
and
is
dominated
by
a
peaty
smoke
that
obscures
most
of
the
malt
notes
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
peaty
malts
with
plenty
of
smoke
followed
by
some
nuttiness
and
a
light
tart
and
bitter
raisin
finish
body
is
moderate
not
as
thick
as
a
wee
heavy
would
typically
be
but
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
the
style
so
it
works
carbonation
is
high
but
not
excessively
so
it
avoids
that
pitfall
interesting
beer
actually
comes
across
as
a
smoke
ale
more
than
anything
i
would
call
this
a
smoked
brown
ale
probably
fairly
tasty
though
im
not
sure
how
often
the
boston
beer
company
brews
this
one
but
ill
be
back
for
more
whenever
i
can
find
it
this
beer
features
a
complex
flavor
which
is
excellently
balanced
and
just
put
together
very
well
i
didnt
find
it
as
overpowering
as
some
other
scotch
ales
that
ive
had
so
its
appeal
is
probably
pretty
universal
get
yourself
one
of
these
if
you
havent
already
done
so
drinkability
i
was
sad
to
see
this
one
gone
too
bad
its
fairly
hard
to
come
by
ok
scotch
ale
but
dirty
bastard
has
me
absolutely
spoiled
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
boston
lager
glass
a
crisp
copper
with
a
decent
diminishing
khaki
head
that
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
dominated
by
burnt
caramel
malts
with
slight
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
dark
malts
burnt
caramel
cocoa
and
dried
fruits
a
pleasant
malt
bomb
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
scotch
ale
one
i
could
certainly
see
drinking
again
drinkability
overall
another
good
offering
from
sam
adams
deep
amber
in
color
has
a
thick
white
head
with
good
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
is
of
malt
mostly
with
hints
of
a
scottish
smokiness
the
flavor
is
full
of
malt
and
lingers
this
finishes
with
a
roasted
oak
flavor
all
around
a
great
scottish
ale
the
hints
of
scotch
and
oak
are
subtle
but
apparent
however
the
malt
is
the
star
here
from
reading
other
reviews
i
guess
you
cant
get
a
12
pack
of
this
that
sucks
hey
jim
koch
hook
it
up
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
clear
redamber
with
an
offwhite
creamy
head
with
great
retention
and
excellent
lacing
slight
smokey
aroma
smokey
peat
taste
that
is
very
enjoyable
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
and
very
slight
bitter
finish
not
relly
like
scotch
ales
ive
enjoyed
at
all
but
still
very
good
sucks
that
you
have
to
buy
the
lame
brewmasters
collection
to
try
it
sa
does
not
need
to
add
their
lager
or
ale
to
these
collections
and
the
noble
pils
and
coastal
wheat
have
been
heavily
pushed
on
their
own
wish
sa
had
more
diverse
collections
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
flavors
somewhere
in
between
a
scotch
ale
and
a
winter
warmer
sweet
malts
blend
with
a
nice
biscuity
bready
yeast
flavor
reminds
me
just
a
bit
of
av
winter
solstice
even
tasting
a
little
bit
of
spice
flavors
hints
of
peat
and
smoke
hop
bitterness
does
not
go
completely
unnoticed
on
the
finish
its
a
bit
thin
and
somewhat
astringent
near
the
end
not
smooth
but
yet
easy
to
drink
one
of
sam
adams
better
concoctions
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
every
once
in
a
while
if
they
made
it
available
that
way
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
gets
a
little
harsh
as
it
warms
i
really
like
this
one
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
just
a
hint
of
red
to
it
smell
is
malt
and
smoke
taste
is
also
malt
and
smoke
to
me
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
porter
mouth
is
fine
and
drinkability
is
good
id
drink
these
all
evening
very
nice
beer
drinkability
nice
everyday
scotch
ale
with
an
emphasis
on
peat
smoked
malt
d
drinkability
is
very
good
the
balance
between
the
phenolic
sharpness
of
the
smoky
malts
the
sweetness
of
the
biscuit
malts
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
all
hops
or
all
malts
characters
that
are
more
prominent
these
days
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
as
well
d
style
wise
its
fairly
smooth
and
not
a
show
stopper
i
would
drink
more
than
one
and
price
is
good
too
works
nice
in
a
variety
pack
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
six
pack
or
more
when
i
poured
this
out
of
the
bottle
it
had
surprisingly
little
head
a
dark
beer
that
had
a
unique
smokey
smell
i
found
the
appearance
and
smell
to
be
only
slightly
above
average
the
taste
was
better
than
the
smell
with
a
very
rich
and
long
lasting
flavor
it
was
smooth
to
drink
and
i
enjoyed
this
beer
however
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
frequently
which
probably
has
to
do
with
how
unique
of
a
taste
this
beer
has
value
excellent
in
the
mix
12
pack
format
da
very
drinkable
beer
but
its
stronger
malt
tastes
may
turn
some
people
who
are
not
a
fan
of
the
syle
off
of
the
beer
overall
but
as
a
scotch
ale
fan
i
find
this
very
refreshing
and
would
gladly
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
but
probably
not
all
night
though
poured
into
snifter
reddish
caramel
color
with
creamy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
has
a
great
smokey
smell
with
some
sweet
malt
and
rich
caramel
very
nice
smell
taste
was
fine
but
slightly
watery
i
thought
you
could
taste
the
caramel
some
wood
notes
smoke
sweet
malt
and
a
kiss
of
hops
but
overall
nothing
really
jumped
out
too
much
mouthfeel
let
me
down
i
felt
it
was
a
little
too
thin
a
little
on
the
watery
side
overall
though
a
great
beer
good
offering
from
sam
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
smell
slightly
smoky
malty
and
sweet
with
caramel
and
molasses
taste
was
malty
up
front
going
to
sweet
then
smoky
slightly
hoppy
finish
good
beer
very
drinkable
nothing
special
just
a
good
beer
southampton
scotch
ale
is
a
more
extreme
interpretation
of
this
style
much
more
interesting
though
this
is
more
drinkable
d
not
a
beer
youd
want
to
play
a
drinking
game
with
but
definitely
a
beer
that
you
could
session
with
while
watching
a
sporting
event
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
definitely
one
to
sip
on
i
would
have
been
fine
with
half
of
one
of
these
maybe
its
just
not
a
style
i
find
all
that
quaffable
it
could
be
the
intensity
of
flavor
from
a
beer
thats
of
a
modest
abv
the
finish
seems
to
linger
forever
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
however
the
brewmasters
collection
is
a
pretty
good
value
and
worth
picking
up
for
those
who
havent
a
little
lighter
than
id
like
for
the
style
but
drinkable
d
no
problems
drinking
this
all
night
unfortunately
it
just
seems
a
little
tame
compaired
to
many
other
examples
of
the
style
im
going
to
say
right
here
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
brews
one
of
their
more
challenging
offerings
and
it
reminds
me
of
an
islay
scotch
but
not
so
much
that
id
rather
just
have
the
scotch
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
im
still
waiting
for
the
brewer
to
produce
a
twelve
pack
of
these
exclusively
d
a
solid
scotch
ale
which
doesnt
surprise
me
at
all
sa
usually
does
such
a
good
job
of
representing
a
style
it
was
very
easy
for
me
to
drink
the
2
bottles
i
got
in
the
mix
pack
overall
try
it
its
different
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
of
course
this
beer
is
copper
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
the
beer
produces
a
mega
foamy
head
with
generous
amounts
of
lacing
to
it
the
nose
is
good
extremely
malty
and
sweet
smelling
smells
of
caramel
with
afternotes
of
toffee
and
a
hint
of
smokeyness
the
taste
is
good
a
very
malty
brew
you
can
really
taste
the
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
as
well
as
malted
barley
slight
smokeyness
again
from
what
i
gather
is
the
peat
malts
in
the
flavor
followed
only
by
a
slight
taste
of
the
hops
but
not
very
strong
hopes
are
more
noticeable
in
the
mouthfeel
than
the
taste
the
back
of
the
bottle
sums
it
up
the
best
in
two
words
sweet
smokey
the
mouthfeel
is
truely
exceptional
for
a
beer
with
so
many
different
malts
it
has
a
well
balanced
smooth
and
creamy
feel
with
just
enough
of
a
bitter
finish
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
truly
remarkable
along
with
everything
mentioned
this
beer
has
excellent
drinkablility
i
poured
this
beer
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
amber
colored
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
was
gone
quickly
this
beer
has
minimal
lacing
this
beer
barely
had
a
smell
but
their
was
a
hint
of
smokey
malt
this
beer
has
a
light
smokey
malt
and
hop
taste
the
mouthful
is
crisp
and
carbonated
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
have
again
i
saw
it
had
some
good
reviews
but
i
dont
understand
this
beer
did
not
have
much
flavor
in
my
opinion
i
wish
i
had
something
more
to
say
about
it
but
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
the
sweetness
is
balanced
nicely
and
it
doesnt
become
cloying
like
some
maltheavy
beers
i
enjoyed
this
its
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
experimenting
more
with
the
style
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
its
much
more
adventurous
and
bold
than
i
expected
from
samuel
adams
dont
get
me
wrong
they
make
great
beer
but
i
really
like
what
theyve
done
with
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
clear
brown
with
lots
of
carbonation
action
and
a
nice
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
aromas
are
very
malty
almost
roasty
like
a
much
darker
beer
taste
is
maltforward
and
layered
with
a
strong
woodiness
and
toffee
flavors
this
beer
is
crammed
with
taste
im
a
big
fan
d
this
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
that
goes
down
smoothly
and
could
easily
be
followed
by
a
second
bottle
i
also
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
but
am
not
sure
i
would
go
to
lengths
to
find
it
i
hadnt
had
in
several
years
and
i
do
like
it
better
than
i
remember
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
same
category
that
i
would
place
before
this
one
d
this
beer
tastes
good
but
is
is
kind
of
lacking
in
flavor
and
character
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
scotch
ale
and
an
excellent
beer
in
the
sam
adams
lineup
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
ever
so
slightly
of
old
fezziwig
but
better
pretty
good
beer
its
clean
malty
and
smooth
but
fails
to
really
distinguish
itself
as
a
scotch
ale
aside
from
the
slight
smokiness
unique
but
not
great
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
dark
auburn
red
color
very
large
white
head
good
looking
beer
so
far
smelled
a
lot
like
peat
smoke
first
sip
was
mostly
foam
and
you
can
almost
taste
that
scotch
whisky
flavor
the
next
sip
more
liquid
and
the
flavor
was
a
bit
more
subdued
but
that
heavy
smoky
flavor
was
there
throughout
my
only
wish
was
that
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
body
to
it
that
would
make
this
brew
fantastic
very
drinkable
with
a
low
abv
and
intense
flavors
one
of
the
more
underrated
and
unknown
sa
beers
on
the
market
my
perfect
pour
glass
was
filled
with
is
brew
the
color
of
very
dark
copper
topped
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
but
had
little
carbonation
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
the
taste
of
malt
and
caramel
was
a
nice
blend
with
a
spicy
touch
to
it
it
was
rather
smooth
and
finished
with
much
enjoyment
it
has
a
dark
redamber
color
with
a
beige
head
that
dies
to
a
collar
relatively
fast
aroma
is
a
combination
of
tea
and
breadmalts
taste
is
similar
to
semisweet
tea
there
is
some
caramel
in
there
some
smokeyness
malts
and
hoppy
finish
decent
thickness
not
too
much
carbonation
i
would
definitely
buy
a
pack
of
this
alone
d
a
good
scottish
ale
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
sa
scotch
ale
is
a
nice
take
on
one
an
interesting
beer
i
think
its
starting
to
fade
but
time
has
done
some
interesting
things
to
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
a
solid
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
character
not
overly
strong
and
a
nice
session
beer
overall
a
very
tasty
malt
driven
ale
i
can
drink
again
and
again
doesnt
weigh
me
down
pours
a
deep
amber
with
less
than
a
finger
head
that
dissolves
fairly
fast
after
a
couple
sips
there
is
barely
a
translucent
film
across
the
top
of
the
beer
despite
the
lack
of
the
head
it
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
has
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
very
pleasant
also
can
smell
hints
of
smoke
and
maybe
something
to
the
effect
of
pete
taking
a
sip
you
can
taste
a
bit
of
smokiness
as
well
and
a
slight
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
very
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
and
carbination
is
perfect
one
delicious
brew
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
d
really
good
beer
sa
makes
some
great
looking
beers
that
taste
great
too
overall
i
was
a
bit
put
off
the
the
taste
i
think
this
beer
has
the
potential
for
being
very
good
if
the
metal
component
werent
so
overwhelming
i
will
try
this
again
another
year
and
see
if
this
reduces
pours
a
very
light
brown
color
with
an
one
and
a
half
finger
off
white
head
to
it
there
is
decent
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
and
smokey
earthy
malts
at
the
back
end
the
taste
is
of
smokey
malt
with
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
being
faint
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
the
drinkablity
is
good
the
abv
is
average
so
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
drinkability
drinkability
my
favorite
from
the
brewmasters
pack
a
solid
selection
for
six
packs
in
the
future
its
alright
but
really
doesnt
come
close
to
some
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
wow
a
new
barraiser
for
sam
adams
this
is
to
them
what
black
forest
lager
is
to
saranac
for
me
a
singularly
fantastic
beer
that
rises
above
their
normal
lineup
by
a
good
bit
very
drinkable
the
abv
is
under
control
im
not
much
on
the
style
and
had
low
expectations
going
in
to
the
one
it
might
be
the
most
drinkable
scotch
ale
i
have
ever
had
drinkability
this
very
complex
beer
is
meant
for
sipping
and
basking
in
the
brilliance
of
this
great
beer
it
is
a
shame
that
they
only
sell
it
in
a
12
bottle
multipack
drinks
very
well
body
is
a
little
lighter
than
some
scotch
ales
but
it
drinks
solidly
drinkability
ok
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
but
it
is
not
a
staple
for
me
dark
amberbrown
in
color
little
to
no
head
no
discernable
nose
clean
attack
and
finish
with
a
mild
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
of
creaminess
is
tempered
by
a
slight
bite
this
beer
is
pretty
pedestrian
for
its
type
but
its
a
convenient
way
for
folks
to
try
the
type
since
it
comes
in
the
sampler
packs
offered
by
samuel
adams
there
are
better
versions
of
the
style
and
worse
versions
out
there
at
less
than
6
abv
its
almost
sessionable
would
without
question
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
available
in
sixers
prost
drinkability
scotch
ales
are
among
the
best
drinkers
in
my
opinion
and
sam
adams
is
no
exception
it
is
a
mild
take
on
the
style
but
a
good
one
i
dont
have
an
incredible
wealth
of
knowledge
involving
scotch
ales
so
i
hesitate
to
be
too
harsh
ill
try
a
few
more
and
perhaps
reevaluate
notes
i
had
to
buy
a
whole
pack
to
get
just
two
of
these
but
it
was
worth
it
this
is
one
of
sam
adams
best
brews
we
should
all
email
them
to
see
if
we
can
get
this
to
come
back
fulltime
very
drinkable
if
you
like
this
sort
of
beer
its
a
decent
beer
but
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
if
offerred
one
i
certainly
wouldnt
refuse
smooth
and
drinkable
with
a
pronounced
dry
finish
poured
from
the
bottle
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
fastfading
finger
of
brown
head
both
smell
and
taste
contain
a
lightly
spicy
malt
flavor
and
a
little
caramel
sweetness
with
the
taste
having
a
stronger
lasting
spice
the
taste
reminded
me
a
bit
of
sas
holiday
porter
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
me
and
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
sticky
all
around
a
very
average
but
drinkable
scotch
ale
that
i
enjoyed
but
wont
necessarily
seek
out
in
the
future
drinks
alright
could
probably
only
have
a
couple
in
a
night
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
but
does
have
an
extra
amount
of
carbonation
is
really
easy
going
down
and
is
one
of
the
better
beers
brewed
by
samuel
adams
and
is
quite
tasty
d
good
interpretation
of
the
scotch
style
that
is
quite
drinkable
for
its
flavor
i
enjoy
this
beer
my
first
scotch
style
ale
and
its
got
me
intrigued
id
probably
never
want
to
drink
six
of
these
even
in
the
time
period
of
a
few
months
but
the
two
that
came
in
the
mixed
12
pack
are
more
than
manageable
glad
to
finally
try
this
beer
clear
coppery
dark
amber
with
a
fluffy
eggshell
cap
of
foam
lots
of
lacing
mostly
chunkystyle
with
good
head
retention
malty
aroma
notes
of
caramel
and
sugary
sweetness
plus
the
added
bonus
of
wellbalanced
peat
and
smoke
character
i
certainly
didnt
expect
that
low
bitterness
with
caramel
and
malt
sweetness
that
didnt
end
up
cloying
peat
was
more
subdued
in
the
flavour
but
made
its
presence
known
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
decent
texture
average
carbonation
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
with
some
peat
character
a
pleasant
surprise
but
seems
more
of
a
scottish
than
scotch
ale
to
me
feel
is
velvety
smooth
and
carbonation
is
adequate
very
drinkable
and
just
a
really
great
beer
overall
a
perfect
drinker
right
here
d
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
enjoy
it
this
beer
opens
up
really
well
ida
wanted
a
bit
more
on
the
body
but
the
amalgam
of
flavors
is
riveting
d
pretty
pleasant
beer
that
goes
down
nicely
drinkability
drinkability
is
good
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
d
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
but
not
all
night
an
enjoyable
brew
none
the
less
overall
this
is
another
staple
from
sam
adams
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
d
the
pungent
and
almost
sour
tastes
combined
with
breadiness
and
relatively
low
sweetness
dont
help
here
it
also
tastes
higher
than
its
5
4
alcohol
taste
is
not
near
as
burnt
or
peaty
as
i
remember
which
i
loved
then
but
like
even
better
in
that
its
not
so
bold
as
expected
seems
more
balanced
actually
sweeter
than
i
remember
but
again
love
that
it
is
a
sweetness
i
dont
mind
it
is
fairly
counterbalanced
by
some
other
bite
i
cant
place
neither
thick
nor
watery
its
got
a
nice
mouthfeel
a
bit
creamy
but
that
carbonation
again
provides
a
nice
counterbalance
again
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
at
all
but
its
quite
good
and
very
drinkable
not
a
session
brew
id
drink
two
of
these
alone
or
maybe
three
with
a
grinder
or
pizza
or
just
about
anything
crunchy
salty
spicey
think
ill
get
out
some
of
that
cheddarhorseradish
pub
cheese
tub
out
and
dip
pretzels
i
think
it
will
be
a
good
blend
with
the
scotch
ale
i
would
write
more
about
this
brew
but
i
think
my
two
sentences
sum
things
up
it
is
a
decent
brew
that
is
a
scotch
ale
the
problem
is
that
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
scotch
ale
if
you
dont
like
bold
brews
youll
probably
love
this
version
of
scotch
ale
overall
drinkability
is
good
and
sessionable
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
sam
adams
line
sad
that
its
only
seasonal
but
hey
smell
is
of
malts
and
slightly
smoky
notes
taste
follows
through
not
overwhelmingly
forward
but
rather
a
pleasant
subtlety
that
would
lend
this
heavier
brew
great
to
a
hearty
meal
bubbles
are
balanced
and
play
with
the
bear
and
not
against
the
palate
forming
a
nice
smooth
finish
with
minimal
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
the
malt
flavors
stand
out
in
this
one
good
balance
another
solid
offering
from
samuel
adams
but
there
are
better
scotch
ales
out
there
d
very
drinkable
version
of
a
scotch
ale
more
flavor
would
help
things
along
a
bit
but
its
still
a
decent
brew
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
produced
by
bbc
a
very
good
session
scotch
ale
good
overall
flavor
with
some
american
bitterness
to
boot
not
as
full
flavored
as
traditional
scotch
ales
but
i
could
easily
drink
six
of
these
in
a
session
nice
creamy
texture
smooth
carbonation
nice
example
pouring
and
oh
oh
foaming
over
slurp
up
some
frothy
head
mmm
smoky
does
this
beer
have
smoked
malt
i
just
read
the
neck
label
it
must
be
the
special
peat
malt
which
was
used
it
is
delicious
it
certainly
tastes
like
it
well
the
head
anyway
deep
amber
color
with
foamy
soft
offwhite
head
very
nice
smooth
aroma
some
sweetness
peatiness
great
flavor
like
i
said
smoky
and
peaty
great
malts
smooth
and
luscious
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
they
seem
to
make
for
me
flops
or
homeruns
this
is
a
homerun
i
guess
this
is
representative
of
the
style
but
not
something
i
like
only
other
beer
of
this
style
i
have
tried
was
old
chub
and
only
tried
it
once
years
ago
havnt
been
able
to
bring
myself
to
try
a
whole
one
yet
maybe
this
style
is
great
to
some
people
but
not
to
me
could
be
an
aqquired
taste
i
guess
the
woody
aftertaste
just
turns
me
away
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
over
the
clear
brownish
copper
brew
head
recedes
at
fast
clip
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
malty
slightly
smoky
taste
follows
along
but
i
find
myself
wanting
to
use
slightly
over
and
over
slightly
sweet
to
start
slightly
smoky
slightly
hoppy
at
the
close
wish
it
wouldnt
be
so
nondescript
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
continue
the
trend
of
being
pretty
good
this
is
not
something
that
id
buy
the
12pack
for
but
it
holds
its
own
drink
ability
is
great
it
goes
down
smooth
is
only
slightly
thick
and
the
alcohol
isnt
even
noticeable
it
was
35
degrees
here
when
i
had
this
but
i
will
get
it
again
as
soon
as
it
is
warm
out
downside
id
that
the
inky
way
to
get
it
is
in
samper
pack
lot
of
malt
flavor
with
caramel
notes
has
a
fairly
strong
roasted
flavor
and
an
almost
winelike
warming
at
the
end
light
dose
of
hops
finishes
very
dry
overall
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
ill
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
wish
i
could
get
this
stuff
by
the
case
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
will
drink
one
more
bottle
since
it
was
in
the
12
pack
but
wont
seek
it
out
again
smell
is
rich
with
smoky
peaty
malts
and
reminds
me
of
a
bock
beer
in
a
sense
given
the
sweet
nose
hoppy
sweet
when
agitated
like
many
sam
beers
i
dont
pick
up
any
hops
until
mid
glass
when
i
can
give
it
a
good
spin
and
even
then
the
hop
profile
is
inconsistant
taste
follows
with
a
simple
sweetness
and
a
moderate
carbonation
level
light
in
flavor
light
in
abv
yet
a
bit
too
syrupy
does
offer
a
bit
more
smoke
on
the
finish
which
supports
the
feel
a
bit
but
limits
the
drink
a
decent
offering
from
sam
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
but
there
is
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
d
excellent
my
personal
favorite
sa
offering
it
should
be
a
crime
that
they
dont
offer
this
in
612
packs
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
like
some
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
a
bit
smoother
and
flavorful
than
some
of
my
other
favored
scotch
ales
perhaps
not
as
drinkable
as
olde
burnside
ten
penny
and
not
as
authentic
as
belhaven
but
very
tasty
and
a
brew
sam
adams
would
be
wise
to
brew
for
6
and
12packs
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
flavors
are
clean
and
nothing
is
overpowering
a
good
beer
to
introduce
drinkers
to
the
component
of
smoke
in
beer
over
all
very
tasty
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
smokier
doppelbock
very
drink
able
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
pours
a
clear
brown
color
offwhite
head
big
bubbles
good
lacing
somewhat
lasting
very
malty
aroma
some
sweet
light
fruit
like
green
grapes
and
some
dark
fruit
like
plums
malty
sweet
taste
sweet
nutty
aftertaste
somewhat
bitter
interesting
and
good
flavor
somewhat
smokey
flavor
surprisingly
good
nice
session
beer
mfd
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
once
again
sam
adams
has
produced
a
nice
brew
and
decided
to
only
include
it
in
sampler
packs
d
pretty
good
i
will
get
tired
of
the
smoke
eventually
but
for
now
its
great
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
bbq
great
beer
maybe
im
just
not
a
scotch
ale
person
but
i
didnt
like
this
beer
color
started
off
nice
reddish
brown
pour
smoky
peat
moss
kind
of
smell
the
barrel
aging
taste
that
comes
through
with
the
malt
was
largely
unsatisfying
like
someone
had
spilled
some
bourbon
in
my
beer
for
me
the
drinkability
wasnt
there
i
can
see
sampling
this
one
in
a
2
oz
taster
to
appreciate
the
style
but
not
more
than
that
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
very
good
one
either
i
hope
sam
adams
keeps
this
one
going
though
because
i
do
have
a
craving
for
one
every
once
in
awhile
kudos
samuel
adams
you
did
it
again
overall
good
balance
this
beer
is
a
good
choice
to
sip
and
enjoy
a
smoky
like
brew
this
is
a
big
brew
dominated
by
malt
flavors
and
aromas
rich
and
full
bodied
slightly
sweet
this
challenging
beer
is
not
for
everyone
a
high
original
gravity
hop
bitterness
and
peat
smoke
character
yield
a
robust
and
a
smooth
balanced
ale
for
the
consumer
of
rich
and
complex
ales
i
really
like
this
one
definitely
one
of
my
favored
sam
adams
selections
although
i
dont
know
it
is
not
more
readily
available
on
draught
here
in
boston
regardless
this
ale
pours
a
good
body
full
of
amberdark
brown
hues
with
a
fluffy
full
head
the
aroma
is
a
lovely
roasted
malt
with
bread
honey
smooth
mild
yet
with
a
more
complex
floral
malt
than
what
you
would
expect
although
it
lacks
a
smokiness
that
you
might
expect
there
is
a
hint
of
scotch
in
the
nose
which
brings
out
more
might
i
have
another
pours
a
deep
amber
with
moderate
light

my
first
experience
with

enjoyable
beer
now
i
am
going
to
enjoy
the
2nd
one
cheers
taste
nice
balance
of
malts
and
hops
some
smokey
character
as
well
poured
into
a
24oz
mug
and
it
was
beautiful
a
dark
beer
with
a
wonderful
aroma
of
heavy
scents
of
barley
and
hops
tastes
even
better
with
an
almost
burnt
aftertaste
which
i
love
it
is
a
heavy
dark
beer
while
not
incredibly
filling
would
definitely
buy
again

samuel
adams
scotch
ale
from
boston
beer
company
pours
a
brown
reddish
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
malty
caramel
and
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
sweet
malt
really
comes
through
in
the
first
sip
this
beer
starts
sweet
and
finishes
dryly
with
some
earthy
flavors
such
as
smoke
wood
and
tobacco
a
well
made
beer
that
i
wish
was
more
readily
available
to
me
ive
only
seen
it
in
the
12
and
24
pack
brewmasters
collection
here
in
the
alabama
jungle
brew
on
patriot
brew
on
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
finish
this
beer
is
okay
for
a
scotch
ale
i
was
hoping
for
more
a
malt
in
the
beer
but
hey
it
is
a
samuel
adams
drinkable
the
aroma
prepares
you
for
something
different
than
what
you
get
in
the
taste
making
for
a
very
interesting
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
brown
color
with
a
small
yet
dense
head
which
dissipates
into
a
slight
cap
the
aroma
is
of
light
roasted
malt
some
grape
wine
notes
perhaps
a
touch
of
butter
not
much
of
if
at
all
peat
or
smoke
presense
the
taste
is
of
a
nice
malt
base
not
too
thick
or
roasted
definitely
pick
up
on
the
smokepeat
flavors
not
too
powerful
but
noticable
some
tea
like
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
the
feel
is
moderate
a
little
chewy
but
is
cut
by
the
active
carbonation
finishes
with
a
slightly
dryastringent
bitterness
perhaps
a
touch
thin
for
the
style
while
the
feel
may
be
a
touch
thin
it
leads
to
some
good
drinkability
not
very
heavy
in
the
feel
or
in
the
smoke
flavor
which
would
allow
you
to
drink
more
than
2
if
that
was
available
im
very
disappointed
that
i
only
have
one
i
wish
i
had
at
least
a
six
pack
da
very
drinkable
one
as
its
flavor
is
pleasant
and
its
goes
down
easy
i
finished
one
and
immediately
cracked
open
the
other
damn
them
for
only
giving
me
2
solid
puffy
beige
head
on
a
quite
dark
nutbrown
colored
beer
both
odor
and
character
is
reminiscent
of
a
british
pub
ale
but
a
nice
caramel
flavor
and
sweetness
contribute
to
an
agreeable
offset
for
my
western
palette
a
hearty
drink
a
nice
wellbalanced
entry
beer
into
the
beer
world
of
the
british
isles
i
am
revising
this
review
i
tried
this
two
years
ago
and
was
not
a
big
fan
but
my
taste
have
been
refined
smile
since
then
i
would
say
that
i
do
like
this
i
personally
like
sas
boston
ale
more
but
this
is
pretty
good
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
and
sam
adams
proves
again
they
have
easy
to
get
and
yet
tasty
beer
drinkability
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
brews
in
my
opinion
and
one
i
was
pretty
surprised
and
pleased
with
actually
they
pretty
much
nailed
the
style
spot
on
and
though
nothing
here
is
grounbreaking
or
mindblowingly
awesome
its
a
solid
allaround
beer
tasty
low
in
alcohol
aromatic
nice
to
look
at
it
recommended
good
robust
red
ale
that
pours
with
a
good
finger
width
head
then
reduces
to
good
keeping
lacing
great
taste
of
a
scotch
and
oak
barrel
flavor
malted
ale
low
hops
tasting
as
it
just
leaves
a
aftertaste
of
one
that
is
associated
with
a
good
quality
scotch
d
good
drinkability
exellent
mix
of
flavors
that
leads
to
a
high
level
of
enjoyment
d
this
is
a
damn
good
scottish
ale
and
i
have
to
admit
i
was
surprised
by
that
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
little
watery
for
the
style
robust
flavors
like
smoke
need
a
burly
body
to
match
and
this
beer
doesnt
have
it
definitely
more
wee
than
heavy
other
than
that
this
beer
is
tasty
and
clearly
one
of
sam
adams
best
when
it
comes
to
scotch
ale
it
would
have
been
great
if
mr
koch
had
gone
the
craft
beer
route
rather
than
the
appeal
to
the
widest
range
of
beer
drinkers
route
if
this
stuff
was
easier
to
find
i
might
be
tempted
to
buy
a
sixer
now
and
again
just
for
a
change
of
pace
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
the
flavor
really
improved
as
it
warmed
d
this
beer
is
good
and
would
go
well
with
a
cigar
or
some
smoked
meat
like
i
said
earlier
this
is
almost
too
smoky
to
be
a
scotch
ale
but
it
is
good
nonetheless
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
pretty
good
i
never
had
a
scotch
ale
before
and
i
guess
i
just
expected
a
little
more
you
should
definitely
let
this
beer
sit
for
a
little
bit
to
allow
the
flavors
to
come
out
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
ipas
that
i
have
been
hooked
on
now
we
shall
get
into
the
meat
and
potatoes
of
the
review
the
taste
who
wants
smoked
beef
jerky
or
perhaps
a
cigar
those
sound
good
with
this
beer
the
smokey
flavor
is
big
theres
a
subtle
fruitness
buried
in
the
smoke
nope
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
expecting
a
malt
bomb
but
its
all
good
this
is
one
of
the
first
scotch
ales
i
have
ever
tried
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
the
smoky
flavor
was
hard
to
get
used
to
but
it
kinda
grew
on
me
and
felt
it
added
a
good
touch
of
flavor
to
the
beer
other
than
that
it
tasted
a
little
bland
but
still
very
much
drinkable
this
led
me
to
try
many
other
scotch
ales
d
good
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
beer
2
from
the
mixed
12
pack
ive
had
most
of
these
sam
adams
brews
before
but
didnt
review
them
the
scotch
ale
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
brewery
nice
sweetness
and
smoke
and
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
nice
light
creaminess
to
this
one
and
a
low
carbonation
makes
this
a
very
nice
beer
not
a
skullsplitter
or
a
founders
but
a
good
solid
scotch
ale
nonetheless
very
good
i
havent
had
too
many
scotch
ales
but
this
one
is
great
very
smooth
and
drinkable
dont
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
finished
it
and
wished
i
had
more
very
good
beer
i
hope
to
find
it
in
cases
or
six
packs
but
some
of
the
posts
here
lead
me
to
believe
that
might
not
be
possible
feel
is
silky
with
carbonation
to
match
easy
to
drink
but
only
two
at
a
time
d
a
very
good
very
drinkable
beer
from
sam
adams
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
by
them
i
just
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
it
in
a
sixer
this
beer
poured
a
beautiful
garnet
color
with
a
light
tan
head
perfect
for
the
style
smell
is
mostly
malts
and
again
suits
the
style
well
the
taste
is
where
i
cant
quite
figure
out
what
is
going
on
interesting
but
all
the
flavours
dont
seem
to
balance
out
there
is
a
toasted
bitterness
i
enjoy
but
its
not
offset
by
the
maltiness
of
the
brew
the
lingering
aftertaste
of
this
brew
is
very
good
bitter
peaty
and
very
nice
i
wish
i
could
find
a
6
of
this
im
going
to
buy
it
again
just
to
figure
it
out
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
if
you
want
a
beer
that
tastes
like
whisky
go
for
it
good
for
a
couple
of
pints
but
the
character
and
strength
of
the
flavour
would
make
it
difficult
to
session
d
for
me
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
of
sam
adams
releases
very
good
overall
doesnt
touch
belhaven
wee
heavy
in
my
view
but
very
good
still
d
a
lot
of
complexity
here
definitely
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
interacting
i
like
this
one
a
lot
something
to
discover
with
each
sip
but
certainly
not
inaccessible
by
any
means
had
this
brew
the
other
morning
23sep08
with
bacon
and
eggs
top
shelf
with
that
combination
and
only
strengthens
my
belief
that
this
is
a
great
dinner
beer
mouthfeel
is
great
on
this
very
smooth
and
easy
drink
a
nice
beer
all
round
well
played
sam
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
in
the
sam
adams
catalog
wasnt
expecting
much
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
6172004
the
only
other
scotch
ale
ive
had
before
this
one
was
the
mcewans
and
i
hated
it
so
i
came
in
thinking
id
hate
this
one
too
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
nice
deep
amber
appearance
to
it
topped
with
a
nice
head
that
left
a
great
amount
of
lacing
a
smooth
rich
smoked
malt
taste
to
it
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
almost
like
a
combination
of
their
boston
ale
and
a
real
good
brown
ale
i
may
be
way
off
but
thats
what
it
tasted
like
to
me
its
a
different
taste
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
as
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
from
the
sam
adams
lineup
a
shame
that
it
is
not
produced
for
sale
other
than
in
the
brewmasters
mix
i
wold
buy
it
on
its
own
regularly
scotch
ale
feels
and
drinks
just
great
this
is
tasty
rich
and
full
bodied
a
nice
treat
from
the
sampler
heavy
aroma
very
malty
and
somewhat
bitter
with
a
good
hearty
breadiness
dirty
copper
pour
good
light
tan
head
and
ample
lacing
creamy
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
flavor
is
grand
full
of
thick
malts
with
well
balanced
hops
there
is
a
real
nice
smoky
taste
that
sets
this
beer
apart
as
i
sip
i
can
also
detect
the
smoke
in
the
aroma
every
once
in
a
while
sammy
breaks
through
with
another
great
recipe
heres
one
of
them
d
good
flavor
but
a
bit
astringent
overall
an
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
pairs
well
with
chili
drinkability
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
in
the
sam
adams
line
good
scotch
taste
on
this
beer
without
it
being
overly
harsh
or
overdone
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
i
think
its
a
solid
example
for
what
a
scotch
ale
should
taste
like
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
tint
the
smell
is
fairly
sweet
with
some
malt
and
perhaps
some
caramel
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
rich
malt
with
some
very
candylike
butterscotch
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
a
decent
thickness
this
beer
might
be
difficult
to
pair
with
some
foods
but
isnt
a
horrible
brew
to
grab
to
cool
down
and
relax
overall
this
is
good
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
beautiful
amber
color
nice
full
head
lacing
on
glass
sweet
tones
on
first
check
then
nice
subtle
smokey
aroma
wonderful
full
flavor
sits
on
you
palette
not
a
great
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
geat
for
cooking
use
as
a
marinade
for
bbq
d
an
excellent
mild
sweet
beer
to
spend
an
evening
with
pours
out
a
orangish
ruby
color
with
an
ok
head
looks
alright
the
aroma
is
bready
and
smoky
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
has
similar
flavors
is
a
little
boozy
and
seems
earthy
quite
sweet
but
with
a
strong
bitter
finish
its
a
little
soapy
but
with
decent
thickness
in
the
mouth
as
do
many
sam
adams
offerings
it
went
down
well
but
there
are
certainly
better
scotch
ales
out
there
recommended
pours
a
deep
bronze
color
with
a
large
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
a
nice
lacing
nice
smokey
smell
with
a
mediumtofull
body
nice
full
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
palette
nicely
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
brews
goes
great
with
grilling
and
bbqed
food
a
nice
amber
color
lies
beneath
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
has
some
smokey
malts
behind
some
really
sweet
caramel
or
toffee
the
taste
has
better
balance
with
a
big
malt
structure
hiding
the
sweetness
fairly
well
a
medium
body
is
a
bit
cloying
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
just
a
bit
out
of
balance
aftertaste
is
peppery
with
bits
of
toffee
and
caramel
this
finishes
lots
of
residual
sweetness
and
slightly
bitter
not
really
my
taste
but
i
can
enjoy
the
quality
of
a
good
beer
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
and
worth
trying
if
youre
into
the
style
nice
brew
overall
drinkability
i
had
two
in
amixed
12
pack
which
is
the
only
way
i
think
i
have
seen
this
for
sale
at
least
around
here
i
want
more
i
would
really
enjoy
to
just
sit
back
an
consume
a
six
pack
of
this
one
evening
got
this
along
with
6
other
brands
in
a
variety
pack
from
costco
this
one
had
a
redbrown
color
with
a
decent
head
i
was
expecting
a
unique
taste
but
i
got
a
taste
that
was
similar
to
some
canadian
brews
ive
had
the
smell
was
a
fruity
smell
with
some
sugary
lacing
this
is
a
good
brew
and
i
look
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
pack
thick
and
a
bit
oily
sticks
to
the
mouth
not
a
choker
but
sticky
and
heavy
quite
nice
its
really
a
pleasant
beer
bursting
with
sweetsmoky
flavors
repeats
are
most
welcome
md
slightly
bitter
definitely
not
sweet
and
the
glue
taste
kinda
hurts
the
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
my
favorite
to
enjoy
i
have
definitely
had
better
scotch
ales
and
probably
will
not
pick
this
one
up
again
best
before
november
notched
on
the
label
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
translucent
amber
in
appearance
with
reddishbrown
highlights
luscious
offwhite
head
was
barely
contained
in
the
glass
went
from
the
stripe
surrounding
the
bowl
up
to
the
lip
of
the
glass
leaving
behind
lots
sticky
white
lacing
good
head
retention
eventually
dissipated
into
a
thin
consistent
layer
of
foam
fair
amount
of
lacing
with
decent
adhesion
during
the
tasting
lots
of
sweet
malt
perhaps
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
nose
as
well
as
a
subtle
smoky
quality
flavors
are
consistent
with
the
nose
however
sweetness
is
less
pronounced
and
a
nice
earthypeaty
flavor
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
round
out
some
of
the
flavors
decent
drinkability
for
the
style
although
i
personally
wouldnt
have
more
than
two
in
a
session
sam
adams
scotch
ale
has
the
coolest
of
the
sam
adams
labels
because
of
the
plaid
other
than
that
the
beer
pours
a
very
nice
dark
amber
with
a
1finger
offwhite
head
it
smells
of
sweet
chocolate
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
hits
hard
with
smoked
flavor
and
roasted
grainy
chocolate
this
is
followed
by
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
astringency
i
think
i
also
detected
some
alcohol
flavor
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
fullbodied
though
not
real
high
in
alcohol
the
richness
and
somewhat
harsh
graininess
make
this
closer
to
a
sipping
beer
than
i
would
have
expected
got
this
one
out
of
a
friends
fridge
pours
a
nice
looking
smooth
dark
amber
color
with
a
mild
offwhite
head
solid
lacing
nose
is
fairly
mild
for
the
style
mostly
toffee
malt
with
a
hit
of
hops
too
some
oak
in
there
taste
is
likewise
although
the
oak
sort
of
mutates
into
a
fairly
untasty
bacon
flavor
a
fair
bit
of
bitter
hops
melding
with
oddly
notsweet
roasted
malt
really
not
a
very
good
flavor
feel
is
solid
no
complaints
overall
though
the
flavor
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
not
gonna
recommend
this
one
one
of
the
worst
sam
adams
ive
tried
so
far
drinkability
5
4
is
rather
lower
for
a
scotch
ale
making
this
unique
offering
a
bit
more
sessionable
d
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
excellent
very
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
overall
this
is
an
excellent
offering
from
sam
adams
i
wish
they
sold
it
in
six
packs
definitely
recommended
this
is
now
my
second
favorite
behind
the
irish
red
now
why
dont
they
offer
this
in
six
packs
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
more
of
an
indoor
or
cooler
weather
drink
great
thick
creamy
head
layered
lacing
upon
dissipation
tanned
brown
orange
bark
in
color
too
malty
yes
the
peat
is
present
and
welcome
but
too
malty
sweet
the
smokiness
is
offset
too
harshly
with
the
sweet
maltiness
which
leads
to
a
bloody
character
in
the
taste
its
a
good
beer
all
in
all
but
for
what
their
intent
was
it
didnt
seem
to
come
out
as
eloquently
as
probably
desired
bonus
points
for
using
good
peat
to
smoke
the
malts
ill
stick
to
my
laphroaig
ardbeg
and
lagavulin
if
i
want
any
good
peatsmoke
notes
in
a
drink
as
a
afternote
the
warmer
this
beer
gets
the
smokier
it
gets
more
of
a
liquid
smoke
saltiness
and
not
a
natural
smokiness
d
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
not
quite
as
big
as
a
smoked
porter
but
feels
similar
definitely
worth
trying
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
may
seek
it
out
in
sixers
as
i
wonder
how
it
would
sit
for
awhile
drinkability
while
there
are
some
nice
elements
there
are
just
a
few
too
many
distractions
and
flaws
to
this
as
a
top
tier
scottish
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
ruby
tones
and
just
a
whisper
of
offwhite
head
aromas
are
rich
and
malty
some
slight
fruity
raisin
like
notes
toffee
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
peat
on
the
palate
malty
sweetness
fills
the
mouth
but
it
is
backed
up
my
plenty
of
hops
perhaps
more
than
necessary
a
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
flavor
comes
through
but
not
as
much
as
there
should
be
the
finish
is
dry
and
exudes
that
spicy
smoky
peat
character
the
smoke
is
certainly
balanced
and
the
amount
i
think
is
great
overall
theres
some
lack
of
malt
and
caramelization
but
it
is
a
decent
scottish
drinkability
always
happy
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
notes
this
malt
bomb
is
amazing
so
smokey
it
should
have
smokey
the
bear
somewhere
on
the
label
its
such
a
perfect
fall
and
winter
beer
i
wish
this
one
would
return
to
at
least
six
pack
form
that
would
be
incredible
cheers
d
at
only
5
4
abv
this
is
one
of
the
lightest
scotch
ales
ive
had
but
thats
what
makes
it
supremely
drinkable
especially
since
not
a
wisp
of
style
was
lost
by
keeping
the
abv
low
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
without
worry
that
im
going
to
get
supremely
hammered
as
i
would
if
i
were
drinking
most
other
scotch
ales
wonderful
and
tragic
that
i
believe
this
beer
cant
be
bought
in
6packs
anymore
only
in
the
brewmasters
collection
12packs
shame
i
cant
buy
a
6
pack
my
only
complaint
is
the
availabilty
i
wish
this
beer
were
released
all
year
round
or
at
least
in
carriers
by
itself
instead
of
only
2
in
the
brewmaster
12pack
sidenote
the
rest
of
the
12
pack
is
also
very
good
taste
is
malty
upfront
with
a
buttery
smooth
feel
to
it
a
bitterness
lingers
in
the
back
rich
but
not
overly
syrupy
appearance
hazy
brown
with
a
three
finger
tan
head
that
stuck
around
quite
well
smell
malt
fruit
sweetness
and
some
smoke
taste
some
smoke
up
front
malt
seetness
followed
by
a
nutty
dryness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
mediem
body
and
mediem
carbonation
drinkability
not
bad
a
good
representation
of
the
style
its
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
winter
evening
like
this
one
just
dont
serve
to
cold
d
this
is
a
decent
scottish
ale
not
really
strong
enough
to
be
considered
an
accepted
scotch
ale
it
drinks
well
enough
however
i
think
it
could
use
more
subtly
in
the
smoked
peat
flavor
nonetheless
its
a
good
american
version
of
the
style
even
if
my
tastes
lean
towards
the
examples
from
scotland
d
a
very
drinkable
scotch
ale
and
with
a
nice
low
abv
could
session
on
this
all
night
drinkability
average
an
ok
beer
nothing
more
d
decent
session
beer
not
my
fav
sam
beer
d
very
drinkable
in
the
right
session
perhaps
with
a
steak
or
bbq
dish
recommended
a
bulky
bland
tasting
scotch
ale
that
is
really
hurt
by
the
alcohol
presence
some
poor
flavors
lack
of
balance
and
little
resemblance
to
the
style
pours
a
browncopper
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
quite
malty
taste
can
best
be
described
a
buttery
diacetyl
and
quite
sweet
with
very
little
presence
of
hops
easy
drinking
with
a
dry
and
slightly
smoky
aftertaste
a
pleasant
addition
to
the
sam
adams
12pack
its
not
as
fullbodied
as
im
used
to
for
a
scotch
but
the
dry
finish
is
a
definite
plus
for
all
its
deficiencies
this
is
nevertheless
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
taste
buds
so
much
that
a
few
more
wouldnt
be
welcome
solid
solid
solid
theres
really
nothing
more
to
say
except
solid
pours
a
deep
burnished
copper
with
a
nice
creamy
light
tan
head
with
awesome
stickiness
and
retention
leaving
plenty
of
lacing
aesthetically
an
unusually
pleasing
brew
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malts
as
is
to
be
expected
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
malty
sweetness
cookie
and
toffee
notes
a
hint
of
diacetyl
butteriness
and
a
nice
little
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
i
could
definitely
session
this
very
enjoyable
im
a
big
belhaven
fan
and
this
compares
favorably
very
solid
version
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
wee
heavy
its
not
that
strong
but
its
definitely
a
very
good
scotch
ale
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
personally
to
drink
a
ton
of
them
great
for
a
sitting
though
and
pairs
well
with
a
lot
of
foods
d
would
drink
this
any
time
any
where
if
sold
in
a
sixer
would
no
doubt
be
near
the
top
of
my
list
but
will
be
content
as
long
as
i
can
continue
to
find
the
brewmaster
12
pack
d
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
flavor
is
interesting
and
well
balanced
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
its
a
shame
you
have
to
buy
a
12pack
to
get
two
of
these
i
enjoyed
this
brew
the
carbonation
in
this
beverage
is
noteworthy
the
abundance
of
which
contributed
to
the
foamy
head
with
so
many
malts
and
hops
combined
so
skillfully
i
am
looking
foreword
to
sampling
this
again
i
dont
recomend
this
im
sure
a
scottish
person
would
be
insulted
by
this
horrible
brew
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
wee
bit
of
bitterness
too
much
for
this
reviewer
detracting
somewhat
from
my
final
ratings
yet
all
in
all
this
is
tasty
and
worth
grabbing
there
is
a
nice
complexity
that
hopefully
a
more
skilled
reviewer
can
unravel
and
it
finishes
fairly
well
despite
the
accumulating
bitterness
good
show
m
round
almost
creamy
a
bit
of
a
butter
oiliness
to
it
through
the
finish
quite
easy
to
take
a
nice
big
mouthful
swish
it
around
and
swallow
it
all
back
one
of
the
better
choices
from
the
selection
of
adams
brews
ive
had
this
is
definitely
a
sometimes
love
sometimes
hate
kind
of
beer
when
in
the
right
mood
it
would
hit
the
spot
whilst
at
other
times
it
would
be
tough
to
even
finish
the
pint
i
call
this
campfire
beer
smoky
and
peaty
in
both
taste
and
finish
its
a
brilliant
dark
red
color
and
exhibits
a
bready
soylike
nose
but
that
complex
smokypeatiness
is
what
really
defines
this
one
one
of
the
better
sams
but
make
sure
you
work
yourself
up
for
the
commitment
d
in
my
opinion
this
beer
emphasizes
roast
character
a
little
too
much
for
a
scotch
ale
but
otherwise
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
style
the
only
issue
that
interferes
with
its
drinkability
is
a
strange
soapy
note
that
fades
in
and
out
of
the
finish
d
it
is
a
ok
scottish
ale
but
i
would
never
call
it
a
wee
heavy
i
probably
wont
bother
to
get
it
again
dvery
flavorful
and
thick
keeps
the
drinkability
to
a
minimum
for
mebut
all
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
brew
beatiful
rich
amber
color
with
a
admirablelight
tan
head
that
never
seems
to
disipate
till
its
all
gone
moderate
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
great
aromas
of
malty
butterscotchiness
and
notes
of
caramel
a
little
sweet
in
the
nose
tastes
smooth
and
balenced
with
both
sweetness
and
twanginess
a
bit
milder
than
mcewans
offering
watered
down
in
comparision
but
this
is
not
exactly
a
bad
thing
as
it
adds
to
the
ease
of
drinkability
strong
maltiness
upfront
that
front
that
fades
to
a
smooth
buttery
and
creamy
finish
quite
pleasent
as
mentioned
feels
a
little
watery
in
the
mouth
and
a
bit
slipery
quite
a
drinkable
brew
all
in
all
and
would
definately
be
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
brewmasters
collection
done
of
the
better
scotch
ales
out
there
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
winter
bbq
beer
or
super
bowl
chili
beer
excellent
d
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
the
balance
between
the
malty
taste
and
the
smoky
aftertaste
makes
it
a
great
beer
to
drink
overall
a
surprinsgly
good
beer
from
sa
i
did
not
expect
this
one
to
be
anything
like
it
was
and
actually
thought
it
would
be
kind
of
bland
rather
complex
and
comes
through
strong
on
its
own
a
beer
i
would
definitely
look
for
again
especially
because
i
dont
find
too
many
of
this
style
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
ever
had
from
sa
and
would
make
me
consider
buying
the
brewmasters
collection
for
it
if
i
had
a
craving
just
got
two
bottles
in
the
2007
brewmaster
collection
the
one
with
the
irish
red
that
i
have
yet
to
try
poured
one
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
had
very
little
head
natch
and
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
small
lace
patches
left
on
glass
this
label
doesnt
say
triple
malt
like
the
picture
on
this
site
but
they
are
there
smell
is
rather
malty
with
some
caramel
picked
up

i
didnt
pick
up
much
else
you
can
taste
the
roasted
malt
immediately
and
it
gives
this
rather
fullbodied
ale
it
doesnt
look
like
a
traditional
heavy
ale
a
mildly
dry
backbite
i
think
the
malts
overpower
this
ale
a
tad
but
you
can
still
pick
up
some
earthy
tones
i
dont
know
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
this
is
one
of
those
instances
where
i
am
not
thoroughly
impressed
w
a
beer
yet
i
cant
really
find
anything
negative
to
point
out
i
will
probably
cellar
the
other
brew
and
i
would
recommend
this
yet
there
is
a
part
of
me
that
is
probably
being
pessimistic
because
it
isnt
a
real
scottish
ale
drinkability
very
good
nice
balance
of
caramels
and
roasted
malts
here
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
drinkable
scotch
ale
it
is
pretty
good
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
the
ale
is
a
clear
dark
brown
capped
with
a
rocky
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
light
covering
and
leaves
heavy
sheeting
and
semirings
as
it
descends
the
nose
is
nearly
all
sweet
malts
some
toffee
and
notes
of
banana
esters
not
too
heavy
or
dark
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
full
of
similar
malty
sweetness
with
lots
of
caramel
light
toffee
the
fruity
notes
are
absent
from
the
taste
and
the
smokiness
comes
through
distinctly
but
not
unbalanced
bitters
are
very
low
and
more
of
a
bite
comes
from
medium
levels
of
carbonation
midhigh
mouthfeel
slightly
sweet
and
smokey
aftertaste
with
lingering
roasted
notes
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
mouth
as
light
tingling
on
the
tongue
but
not
in
the
nose
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
this
scotch
ale
has
a
nice
malt
complexity
with
a
subtle
smokiness
its
a
shame
that
it
is
only
available
in
the
variety
pack
as
i
would
have
enjoyed
having
more
than
two
of
them
in
my
fridge
d
very
tasty
and
impressive
scotch
ale
sessions
limited
by
abv
hands
down
of
of
the
best
brews
under
the
sam
adams
label
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
that
didnt
last
but
nice
lacing
this
beer
has
a
very
earthy
smell
with
hints
of
smokiness
i
think
of
a
mossy
damp
field
when
getting
a
whiff
of
this
beer
the
taste
matches
the
smell
this
is
a
very
earthy
flavored
beer
with
a
strong
smoky
flavor
the
beer
has
moderate
carbonation
and
is
fuller
in
body
there
is
a
malty
after
taste
once
you
break
through
the
overwhelming
initial
hit
of
must
this
was
one
of
6
in
a
samuel
adams
variety
pack
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
on
its
own
not
my
pint
of
beer
but
as
all
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
nice
reddish
brown
color
like
a
wet
irish
setter
not
much
head
good
lacing
smells
like
the
cork
from
a
bottle
of
good
scotch
along
with
hoppyness
and
smokey
malt
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
smell
and
a
bitter
and
sweet
taste
kind
of
rich
and
heavy
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
this
is
a
good
two
beers
before
bed
kind
of
beer
sams
scotch
ale
pours
a
light
cola
color
with
a
malty
frothy
head
interestingly
there
is
a
profound
bamberg
beechwood
smokiness
in
the
flavor
profile
of
this
brew
whats
interesting
is
that
this
smokiness
is
barely
perceptible
in
the
nose
in
the
mouth
are
flavors
of
wellroasted
malts
beechwood
smoke
and
sweet
malts
perhaps
lacking
the
foundation
and
body
of
some
of
the
top
notch
scotch
ales
this
version
makes
up
for
this
departure
by
providing
us
with
uber
drinkability
and
a
very
enticing
flavor
profile
from
this
original
scotch
rauchbier
ale
i
would
imagine
this
brew
would
firmly
plant
a
smile
on
those
who
enjoy
this
type
of
brew
as
i
do
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
taste
of
roasted
malt
a
little
smoke
and
hop
bitterness
leaves
this
a
very
balanced
brew
it
feels
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
a
beer
that
probably
could
be
helped
by
a
slightly
higher
abv
i
think
this
is
sam
adams
most
impressive
beer
i
had
the
lowest
expectations
for
this
beer
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
oelergud
drinkability

very
good
drinkability
very
smooth
and
an
easy
drink
the
only
thing
lacking
in
my
opinion
was
maybe
a
bit
more
abv
which
might
have
helped
it
be
a
little
bit
warmer
a
great
beer
besides
though
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
sam
a
complex
malt
profile
coupled
with
a
bit
of
hop
finish
makes
this
a
keeper
a
dark
reddish
brown
is
what
poured
out
wow
that
smell
was
strong
a
strong
presence
was
immediately
felt
the
taste
was
even
more
powerful
bold
and
malty
the
drink
sweetly
and
warmly
stays
on
the
tongue
but
this
drink
is
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
great
almost
perfect
the
taste
does
shine
through
it
has
an
almost
smoky
flavor
to
it
with
heavy
malts
and
a
not
too
penetrating
aggressiveness
i
would
recommend
this
beer
its
a
good
style
representation
3
out
of
the
sampler
12
was
the
scotch
ale
it
poured
a
deep
reddish

w
a

a

some

i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
not
too
many
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
light
brown
head
that
leaves

on
my
glass
has
a
nice
smell
to
it

malts
stand
out
the
taste
is
good
with
hints
of
malts
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
if
i
ever
see
it
again
good
tatse
and
smoothness
overall
this
was
easily
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
to
date
it
was
the
most
full
and
in
my
opinion
the
best
crafted
that
i
have
seen
very
sweet
for
a
scotch
ale
but
that
was
actually
a
plus
here
perfect
one
for
dinner
as
it
was
just
full
enough
that
it
accentuated
flavors
great
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
every
time
i
see
it
it
just
gave
me
a
really
good
feeling
to
be
trying
this
one
i
highly
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
you
can
you
will
definitely
not
regret
it
drinkability
is
great
for
a
weeheavy
these
brews
tend
to
be
oversmoked
which
makes
this
one
a
milder
exception
to
the
rule
another
wellcrafted
brew
from
the
guys
at
the
boston
beer
company
cheers
dinkability
this
beer
is
delicious
and
would
go
well
with
a
nice
cigar
id
have
a
few
cheers
d
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
great
feel
and
characteristic
smokiness
from
peat
that
is
really
distinctive
my
last
to
try
from
the
brewmasters
selection
beautiful
pour
deep
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
head
in
the
sam
adams
glass
unbelievable
smoked
flavor
tastes
im
drinking
a
glass
of
pipe
smoke
not
a
bad
thing
really
very
smokey
but
in
a
wonderfully
unique
and
smoooth
way
also
very
very
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
in
there
too
geez
this
is
a
complex
brew
the
most
of
the
selection
and
one
to
be
savored
search
your
palette
or
however
you
spell
it
and
youll
find
alot
of
different
stuff
dancing
around
on
your
buds
very
nice
and
highly
recommended
not
for
the
faintofheartbeerdrinker
though
since
its
very
deep
and
complex
smooth
and
yummy
afterdinner
brew
with
a

cheers
and
saaalute
my
ba
friends
part
of
a
sa
mixed
12
da
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
first
scotch
ale
ive
had
it
took
a
bottle
or
two
before
i
became
a
fan
but
now
i
love
it
sam
adams
version
has
a
very
nice
coloring
an
excellent
rich
deep
dark
aroma
and
a
wonderful
peatysmoky
finish
my
favorite
american
brewed
scotch
ale
so
i
suppose
it
should
be
called
a
scotch
style
ale
huh
this
was
my
first
scotch
aleand
if
the
rest
are
as
good
or
better
bring
em
on
i
got
this
in
a
sam
adams
mixed
12
pack
and
enjoyed
it
the
most
i
drank
the
two
that
came
in
the
12
pack
with
a
punch
cigarand
afterwards
was
wishing
i
had
found
a
12
pack
of
just
these
i
will
be
looking
around
for
more
in
my
area
but
im
not
going
to
hold
my
breath
nice
and
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
beer
this
brew
came
in
a
boston
beer
mixed
twelve
pack
poured
in
to
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
head
and
nice
retention
aroma
produced
smoky
characters
chocolate
and
an
overall
roasted
personality
flavor
is
not
unlike
a
rauchbier
in
its
smoky
tastes
however
they
are
not
nearly
as
pronounced
as
in
that
style
other
flavors
i
picked
up
were
of
smoky
peat
caramel
and
brownies
mouthfeel
is
light
as
far
as
i
can
tell
for
the
style
the
malt
has
been
bigger
in
others
i
have
tried
but
it
might
make
this
an
even
more
drinkable
offering
not
a
bad
beer
from
sam
adams
brewery
it
surprisingly
went
very
well
with
a
dill
pickle
samuel
adams
scotch
ale
was
a
brownamber
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
nice
beige
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
malty
and
a
little
sweet
with
dried
fruit
and
a
hint
of
smoke
the
taste
was
malty
a
bit
fruity
a
peat
character
and
good
balance
with
sweetness
upfront
and
a
little
bitterness
towards
the
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
was
somewhat
creamy
drinkabity
was
good
this
is
another
fine
ale
from
the
boston
beer
company
i
love
this
beer
and
got
it
with
the
samuel
adams
mix
pack
i
only
wish
that
they
could
make
it
more
accessible
i
liked
this
beer
and
probably
would
buy
more
a
dark
brown
liquid
with
a
thick
tan
head
good
lacing
smell
is
more
subtle
than
i
would
anticipate
with
such
a
dark
and
bubbly
brew
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
raisin
touch
of
malt
the
feel
of
this
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
you
get
a
mild
malt
and
brown
sugar
taste
mix
with
a
dry
almost
licorice
quality
after
a
few
minutes
you
start
to
smell
and
taste
some
butterscotch
which
eventually
becomes
a
prominent
flavor
very
nice
a
nice
carbonation
went
down
real
easy
for
a
heavyish
beer
this
is
a
scotch
ale
that
i
would
think
most
beer
lovers
would
like
if
not
love
nice
job
sam
md
so
smooth
creamy
all
the
way
through
as
soon
as
i
took
the
first
sip
i
knew
i
could
enjoy
it
all
night
but
too
bad
it
isnt
available
more
ive
never
seen
it
in
a
6pack
although
ive
heard
they
are
available
this
was
part
of
the
mix
12pack
and
is
definitely
the
most
enjoyable
beer
along
with
the
black
lager
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone

this
is
a
session
ale
for
the
ages
definitely
one
of
the
darker
tasting
scotch
ales
ive
tried
it
embraces
the
bitter
silty
peated
side
of
the
malts
instead
of
the
sugary
side
its
nice
balanced
not
boring
and
a
stunner
to
look
at
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
especially
if
you
prefer
the
not
so
sweet
style
could
pair
beautifully
with
a
number
of
cheeses
of

definitely
recommended
pours

maltiness
in

a
nice
rich
ale
chewy
sweet

not
cloying
and
very
firm

finishes
a

dry
with
little
aftertaste
one
of
sas
best
brew
in
my
opinion
bought
it
as
part
of
a
12
pack
brewmasters
special
d
a
very
interesting
and
drinkable
beer
but
one
i
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
d
its
pretty
drinkable
take
the
carbonation
down
a
few
notches
and
it
would
be
much
better
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
terrible
one
gulp
and
i
spitted
it
out
and
dump
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
down
the
drain
it
tasted
like
liquid
vynal
the
flavor
was
just
like
the
way
vynal
smells
do
they
have
vynal
tanks
again
peat
just
totally
dominates
the
taste
still
some
hints
of
fresh
darker
fruits
black
cherry
red
currant
and
hints
of
flowers
problem
is
this
really
lacks
in
depth
and
balance
mouthfeel
is
also
thin
for
this
style
a
good
solid
beer
but
not
best
of
category
this
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
mixed
case
and
i
always
like
to
save
the
best
for
last
cheers
drink
goes
down
pretty
smoothly

it

seeking

enjoying
almost
as
much
as
the

this

off

could
pass
as

rather
dump

served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
smoky
roasted
malt
raisins
and
caramel
it
tastes
the
same
way
but
very
peatysmoky
and
malty
it
also
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
too
its
smooth
and
good
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
id
definitely
drink
it
again
cheers
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
like
sweet
alcohol
to
me
very
subtle
smoke
flavor
throughout
the
beer
nice
malt
balance
drying
but
at
the
same
time
resfreshing
not
overpowering
some
caramel
sweetness
but
balanced
out
by
a
slight
bitter
tinge
well
balanced
really
nice
to
see
a
larger
brewery
brewing
this
kind
of
style
definitly
hit
the
mark
with
this
one
pours
a
jewellike
translucent
brown
with
highlights
like
dried
amber
sticky
head
that
leaves
lacing
in
spite
of
its
small
size
the
aroma
is
quite
smoky
and
also
features
some
molassesy
sweet
malts
dusty
dry
nut
aroma
sneaks
in
as
it
warms
on
the
palate
theres
a
sharp
twang
of
bitterness
first
off
then
a
sweet
smoky
oaky
warmness
at
the
center
the
finish
dries
out
a
bit
as
those
earthy
hop
tastes
return
medium
bodied
not
very
thick
for
the
style
with
pretty
understated
carbonation
overall
this
is
only
ok
imo
its
too
smoky
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
of
fruity
and
nutty
complexity
it
has
a
touch
of
astringency
in
the
mouthfeel
and
feels
a
bit
sticky
on
my
teeth
its
not
bad
or
anything
just
flawed
a
really
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
got
it
in
the
brew
masters
variety
box
a
nice
box
with
some
really
good
beers
give
it

you

nonetheless

it

on
the
full

this

was
a

of

flavor
oicked
up
teh
dark
fruit
more
than
the
smoke
and
the
mouthfell
was
slightly
tingly
and
somewhat
bittersweet
the
finish
was
on
the
bitter
side
and
of
medium
duration
both
of
what
i
have
found
to
be
the
case
in
most
scotch
ales
not
a
bad
beer
d
very
strong

beer
not
for
the
faint

one
of
my
favorite
beers
from

as
an
aftertaste
only
poured
a
clear
darker
reddish
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
which
left
a
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
fairly
rich

sweet

i
liked
the

nuff
said
big
malt
flavors
but
mixed
with
a
smokey
flavotr
as
well
the
smokiness
is
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
a
well
amde
a
tasty
beer
but
it
could
be
a
bit
smoother
with
a
bit
more
work
this
one
could
be
a
really
nice
beer
but
its
not
there
yet
served
in
a
bulb
a
medium
pour
produces
a
twofingered
tan
head
which
collapses
into
a
rocky
formation
in
a
few
minutes
lacing
is
quite
good
adhering
very
firmly
to
the
surface
of
the
glass
in
a
latticelike
formation
dark
garnet
in
color
and
brilliant
to
the
eye
the
nose
is
very
compelling
with
notes
of
peatsmoked
malts
dominating
tangy
dark
malts
and
sweet
biscuity
pale
malts
bright
and
lively
on
the
first
sip
with
a
pleasant
roundness
to
the
malt
profile
coming
to
the
fore
finish
is
actually
compelling
as
well
beginning
with
lingering
biscuit
notes
before
giving
way
to
a
partway
tangy
partway
peaty
finish
theres
a
nice
touch
of
oily
viscousity
here
too
fruity
and
a
bit
boozy
at
one
moment
yet
hardly
sweet
tangy
light
almost
crisp
notes
of
ripe
dark
fruits
and
berries
particularly
those
that
balance
sweet
with
tart
cranberry
a
little
bit
buttery
with
a
bit
more
alcohol
in
the
aromatics
hop
bitterness
is
very
well
defined
yet
works
in
tandem
with
the
carefully
blended
malt
profile
besides
has
anyone
heard
of
a
hoppy
scotch
ale
this
may
be
a
bit
lighter
than
i
prefer
for
the
style
but
no
doubt
this
was
formulated
with
an
appeal
to
the
more
casual
drinker
than
scotch
loyalists
either
way
theres
no
missedstep
in
the
execution
of
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
too
smokey
for
some
it
works
for
me
a
fine
rendition
overall
purchased
brewmasters
collection
sampler
set
and
the
scotch
ale
was
one
of
the
choices
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
decent
head
has
a
strong
smoke
taste
as
well
as
hints
of
subdued
fruits
i
will
say
that
the
first
bottle
of
the
scotch
ale
that
i
tried
was
not
all
that
appealing
on
second
taste
i
have
discovered
that
this
is
a
pretty
complex
brew
with
some
nice
subtle
flavors
i
now
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
beer
the
mouth
is
just
thick
enough
im
on
the
fence
if
this
one
is
a
session
beer
or
not
but
it
sure
is
tasty

i
am
not

its
ok
purchased

deep
amber
color
decent
head
settles
quickly
forming
light
collar
not
overly
carbonated
smells
mossy
and
woodsy
tastes
slightly
sour
as
you
might
expect
a
scotch
ale
to
taste
and
finishes
very
smooth
not
too
bad
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
pours
a
deep
reddish
amber
color
with
a
solid
half
inch
head
and
good
carbonation
aroma
was
quite
malty
and
biscuity
taste
was
of
sweet
malts
smoke
tobacco
and
light
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
and
had
a
smooth
character
drinkability
was
good
for
a
scotch
ale
though
you
expect
something
a
little
more
substantial
and
heavier
still
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
ale
i
just
wish
i
could
buy
a
sixer
of
it
and
not
one
of
those
mixed
12
packs
the
ale
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
fluffy
half
inch
head
faint
malty
aroma
that
dives
into
a
rich
complex
malty
flavor
that
has
some
roasted
malts
hops
that
bites
slightly
on
the
back
end
to
balance
the
sweetness
this
is
a
full
bodied
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
the
malt
profile
is
rather
interesting
i
wish
we
could
have
this
in
six
packs
in
nashville
because
our
scotch
ales
are
few
and
far
between
12
oz
bottle
the
beer
is
a
very
deep
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
full
coating
over
top
the
brew
is
fairly
clear
and
there
is
a
lack
of
visible
carbonation
in
it
i
like
how
this
one
sits
in
the
glass
the
nose
is
caramel
a
little
buttery
and
light
with
peaty
smoke
the
butteryness
seems
to
dominate
a
bit
and
is
not
what
i
really
wanted
to
find
taking
a
sip
i
find
a
more
pronounced
peaty
smoke
than
the
nose
would
tell
me
the
caramel
is
really
nice
behind
that
adding
a
mild
sweetness
and
a
very
good
malt
base
the
butteryness
is
not
present
in
the
flavor
which
really
helps
pull
this
one
together
for
me
there
is
just
a
hint
of
a
mild
hop
bitterness
that
fills
out
the
finish
of
this
one
it
is
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
lightish
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
one
outside
of
the
buttery
aromas
that
are
in
there
this
one
is
solid
all
in
all
it
is
a
decent
interpretation
of
a
scotch
ale
however
if
you
want
something
great
and
are
in
the
western
new
york
area
rohrback
makes
an
incredible
scotch
ale
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
thin
creamy
looking
head
the
smell
is
primarily
of
sweet
malt
but
the
smokiness
is
also
quite
prevalent
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
a
roasted
character
to
it
very
smoky
and
sweet
with
ambercaramel
malt
almost
no
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
chewey
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
easy
full
of
taste
this
one
is
worth
a
try
d
like
i
mentioned
a
great
sessional
scotch
ale
if
thats
possible
but
its
just
not
a
genuine
s
a
and
doesnt
have
nearly
the
depth
of
most
its
the
drinkability
and
the
balance
thats
game
here
so
its
a
sam
adams
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
pretty
good
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
mediumheavy
body
and
lower
carbonation
well
at
least
for
sam
adams
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
it
is
a
complete
let
down
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
scotch
ale
and
well
this
shouldnt
be
classified
as
one
there
are
definitely
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
if
youre
looking
to
try
a
scotch
ale
dont
look
here
overall
a
decent
beer
and
certainly
one
of
sas
better
beers
though
not
better
than
triple
bock
double
bock
or
any
of
the
super
specialty
offerings
like
millennium
or
utopias
it
definitely
beats
the
hell
out
of
standard
sam
offerings
like
boston
lager
however
its
far
from
overwhelming
like
i
said
average
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
and
may
order
it
definately
on
of
my
favs
even
with
the
roasty
taste
sampled
from
a
variety
12pack
which
by
the
way
is
quite
enjoyable
a
little
dry
on
the
tongue
most
likely
from
the
triple
malt
no
dont
get
me
worng
i
love
the
malty
aspect
of
beers
but
this
ends
up
being
a
little
too
much
lots
of
smoke
and
bark
root
i
think
whats
missing
is
the
heavy
abv
that
i
accustomed
too
witht
this
style
witht
the
low
abv
it
ends
up
being
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
you
give
to
your
cousininlaw
that
doesnt
drink
craft
beer
regulary
not
a
bad
offering
certinaly
wont
be
purchasing
a
12pack
of
it
though
longneck
into
a
standard
pint
produced
a
12
inch
light
tan
head
and
was
deep
red
in
color
took
a
while
for
the
head
to
fade
and
it
did
leave
some
lacing
aroma
was
dominated
by
malt
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
scotch
or
whiskylike
smell
taste
was
very
malty
and
caramellysweet
up
front
with
some
light
roast
this
was
balanced
by
a
nice
earthy
hop
presence
and
finished
peaty
with
a
whisky
feel
a
mediumbodied
brew
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slight
alcohol
warming
this
maltbolstered
brew
is
heavy
and
complex
and
it
is
probably
better
in
smaller
amounts
or
as
the
end
of
a
session
one
is
enough
for
me
d
this
is
not
a
brew
to
sit
down
and
drink
several
at
a
time
as
there
are
several
malt
flavors
to
analyze
because
of
the
variety
of
malt
flavors
present
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
brews
to
analyze
as
its
complexity
is
awesome
it
might
be
argued
there
are
too
many
malt
flavors
going
around
but
when
this
beer
is
served
at
the
right
temperature
they
taste
damn
good

poured

the

is

being
mostly
of
the
malts
the
taste
is
of
malt
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
an
interesting
brew
from
sam
adams
not
something
that
i
could
drink
several
of
in
one
sitting
but
definitely
one
worth
experiencing
the
scotch
ale
pours
dark
redbrown
with
a
nice
rocky
slightly
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
smoky
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
little
alcohol
taste
is
dominated
by
the
maltiness
the
smoke
is
still
there
mouthfeel
is
good
somewhat
full
some
creaminess
drinkability
is
good
as
well
this
beer
is
a
treat
after
a
long
cold
day
i
could
easily
polish
off
the
two
that
were
part
of
the
samuel
adams
mixed
12
pack
but
i
dont
think
i
will
ill
try
another
and
save
the
other
scotch
ale
for
another
time
i
will
seek
this
beer
out
again

luv
it
would
luv
this
in
a
sixer
but
que
sera
sera
this
was
a
decent
ale
but
a
poor
representation
of
the
style
i
felt
colour
was
a
brick
red
colour
with
a
thin
khaki
coloured
head
loads
of
co2
and
fair
head
retention
average
at
best
smell
was
a
bit
weak
malt
is
about
all
i
get
from
this
taste
too
leaves
alot
to
be
desired
there
is
a
grain
malt
presence
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
as
far
as
any
really
noticeable
flavour
profiles
they
simply
arent
there
not
impressed
mouthfeel
is
fair
and
the
overall
drinkability
or
functionality
of
this
ale
is
decent
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
in
fact
i
would
likely
drink
this
again
especially
with
food
i
simply
think
this
is
a
very
poor
attempt
at
brewing
a
wee
heavy
holy
shit
the
best
sa
brewmasters
beer
ive
ever
had
i
am
sad
i
have
to
buy
a
whole
mix
pack
just
to
get
two
of
them
but
oh
well
this
beer
has
a
great
head
an
retention
the
smell
leaped
up
to
me
as
i
poured
the
taste
is
a
balance
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
sort
of
a
licoriciness
it
clings
incredibly
well
and
was
the
easiest
to
drink
scotch
ale
ive
had
to
date
the
best
sa
beer
that
ive
ever
had
the
peat
character
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
and
gives
this
ale
a
distinctive
taste
even
among
scottish
ales
it
is
not
as
smoky
as
i
expected
just
peaty
the
emphasis
is
on
malt
complexity
rather
than
sweetness
which
is
still
fairly
substantial
an
intriguing
scottish
ale
from
the
sampler
pack
pours
a
light
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
off
white
creamy
head
very
good
head
retention
and
lace
nice
malty
robust
and
slightly
smoky
aroma
caramel
flavors
combine
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
not
as
robust
as
i
would
have
liked
medium
body
with
slightly
lower
carbonation
pretty
good
pours
a
deep
garnet
color
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
that
disappears
alomst
completely
after
a
minute
or
so
smells
of
of
peat
smoked
malts
with
woody
scents
mixed
in
tastes
great
peat
smoked
malts
dominate
here
but
some
dark
fruit
flavors
are
also
present
here
good
mouthfeel
maybe
a
bit
thin
in
terms
of
body
but
has
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
make
for
a
creamy
and
delicious
brew
great
drinkability
at
only
5
4
abv
and
with
the
somewhat
lighter
body
this
is
a
good
brew
that
id
call
sessionable
a
very
tastey
beer
makes
the
mouth
watercould
drink
this
untill
i
could
drink
no
more
very
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
with
a
modest
head
that
dissipates
quickly
caramel
malty
aroma
that
is
pleasant
to
the
nose
smooth
initial
taste
leads
to
a
somewhat
astringent
finish
my
first
scotch
ale
and
to
me
not
one
of
the
better
samuel
adams
offerings
to
my
taste
this
one
has
a
good
aftertaste
that
will
remind
you
of
what
youre
drinking
stand
up
open
yer
mouth
and
enjoy
this
fine
brew
from
one
of
our
founding
fathers
cheers
overall
a
very
tasty
scotch
alewee
heavy
i
really
liked
the
smokiness
overall
quite
good
and
very
drinkable
looking
forward
to
the
other
varieties
i
have
in
the
on
deck
circle
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
scotch
ales
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
nice
fairly
mild
in
flavor
but
a
good
drinking
beer
recommended
i
hereby
raise
the
taste
rating
1
5
points
355ml
bottle
not
bad
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
sweets
my
tastes
must
not
be
able
to
detect
the
deepness
bbc
is
trying
to
produce
i
think
they
have
decent
other
beers
has
a
higher
alcohol
content
than
i
would
have
imagined
i
think
they
may
be
spreading
themselves
too
thin
with
all
these
spceialty
beers
this
has
alot
of
characteristics
in
common
with
big
ass
porters
and
stouts
but
is
somehow
more
drinkable
maybe
due
to
the
lighter
body
and
slightly
less
powerful
flavors
ive
got
so
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
far
deep
robust
complex
well
balanced
whats
not
to
like
i
can
wait
to
drink
the
other
one
this
wonderful
brew
alone
makes
buying
the
whole
mixed
12er
worth
every
penny
a
good
one
from
sa
and
id
like
to
be
able
to
get
this
in
a
six
not
just
the
mix
pack
mfdthe
mouthfeel
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
incredibly
drying
on
the
tounge
and
also
slightly
watery
this
wasnt
the
most
drinkable
brew
either
i
would
only
have
1
or
2
not
the
tastiest
scotch
ale
i
have
had
but
i
guess
it
doesnt
matter
since
you
only
get
2
in
their
newest
samplr
pack
a
decent
scotch
ale
not
as
strong
as
most
scotch
ales
but
man
theres
some
tasty
maltiness
going
on
here
i
really
like
the
peaty
overtones
too
why
cant
we
get
this
in
6packs
its
a
damn
shame
adam
d
high
very
nice
a
great
beer
easy
to
throw
back
in
quantities
poured
a
deep
rich
amber
with
pretty
weel
sustained
off
white
head
leaving
seperate
sheets
of
lace
behind
as
it
it
eally
never
sttled
completely
big
malt
driven
aromas
brown
sugar
and
dried
fruit
aromas
dominate
dried
cherries
really
show
thru
along
with
the
before
mentioned
brown
sugar
alot
like
the
aromas
the
flavors
start
out
with
a
big
brown
sugar
character
melding
into
a
pruneyraisin
flavor
finish
somewhat
dry
but
not
earthy
just
an
ubrupt
finish
to
the
sweetness
i
think
a
very
well
made
scottish
style
ale
deeply
malty
and
packed
with
flavorgive
boston
beer
company
credit
for
this
one
there
are
many
out
there
that
dont
come
close
to
this
one
i
havent
had
any
other
beers
of
this
style
but
i
certainly
wasnt
expecting
the
smoky
flavor
however
the
more
i
drink
it
the
better
it
enhances
the
overall
drinking
experience
i
suppose
if
i
smoked
this
would
be
really
good
beer
to
have
with
a
cigar
for
years
this
has
been
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
while
it
still
is
i
would
say
it
only
is
because
sams
quality
has
declined
across
the
board
i
bought
the
twelve
pack
that
it
comes
in
a
couple
of
months
ago
for
the
sole
purpose
of
getting
two
scotch
ales
they
were
not
anything
like
the
ales
i
fell
in
love
with
years
ago
thinking
i
might
have
got
a
bad
batch
ive
bought
two
more
of
these
very
mediocre
twelve
packs
within
the
past
two
weeks
i
dont
think
ive
just
bought
three
bad
batches
this
beer
lacks
the
zing
it
once
had
the
qualities
that
i
once
admired
the
delicate
balance
of
smoke
and
malty
sweetness
have
either
been
carelessly
overdone
or
removed
from
the
formula
in
there
place
is
an
unimpressive
tanginess
and
a
confused
jumble
of
flavors
obviously
sam
adams
is
going
for
quantity
over
quality
i
just
wish
theyd
give
this
new
ale
a
new
name
because
it
is
not
the
sam
adams
scotch
ale
that
i
had
grown
so
fond
of
an
average
offering
at
best
which
is
sad
because
it
is
just
about
the
best
ale
that
sam
adams
is
offering
these
days
how
shall
i
assign
drinkability
to
this
the
bitterness
is
too
much
for
the
style
as
a
different
very
malty
beer
style
this
is
a
truly
exceptional
altbier
that
is
among
the
best
as
just
beer
this
is
a
good
one
with
an
assertive
bitter
snap
i
will
just
say
that
this
is
a
good
beer
drinkability
good
in
small
quantities
i
would
get
tired
of
this
beer
because
of
its
bitterness
but
it
has
a
very
solid
taste
and
considering
the
price
i
dont
think
anyone
would
regret
getting
this
brew
this
is
probably
the
my
least
favorite
scottish
ale
ive
tried
but
still
enjoyable
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
scotch
ale
flavors
are
balanced
and
complex
i
didnt
expect
anything
like
this
from
sam
adams
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
just
shy
of
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
helps
bring
the
taste
forth
the
beer
has
a
nice
smoky
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
drink
overall
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
this
one
again
a
great
beer
from
the
boston
beer
company
its
to
bad
it
cant
be
purchased
on
its
own
anymore
notes
this
would
be
2
on
my
list
of
sam
adams
regular
type
offerings
solid
and
although
it
wont
be
a
regular
in
my
stable
of
brews
at
home
if
i
see
it
out
and
about
ill
partake
for
sure
nice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
stronger
beer
with
a
nice
feel
this
is
a
winner
not
an
everyday
brew
but
for
a
scotch
ale
a
decent
offering
a
very
dark
amber
almost
brown
body
with
a
thick
frothy
head
head
retains
itself
for
a
lengthy
amount
of
time
a
sweet
smoky
aroma
malty
sweetness
mixed
with
a
slight
smokiness
in
the
taste
as
well
mediumbodied
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
my
style
but
all
right
every
now
and
again
quite
drinkable
it
is
a
strong
beer
but
not
overly
strong
with
a
very
palatably
smooth
draft
closing
notes
this
is
a
fine
example
of
what
sam
adams
does
best
they
make
very
drinkable
and
approachable
beers
in
a
particular
category
this
is
one
of
their
best
this
is
just
an
all
around
great
session
beer
overall
an
easy
to
drink
scotch
ale
probably
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
someone
whose
never
had
one
before
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
smells
smoky
and
burnt
almost
sweet
and
very
inviting
taste
is
burnt
with
mostly
bitter
and
malty
characteristics
aftertaste
is
the
same
but
the
bitter
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
a
good
balance
in
flavor
as
with
most
sam
adams
beers
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
interesting
and
definitely
worth
trying
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
probably
will
buy
more
i
would
enjoy
this
one
much
more
on
tap
i
believe
not
something
id
purchase
in
the
future
for
years
this
was
my
favorite
of
all
the
sam
adams
beers
until
it
disappeared
from
the
market
in
texas
in
1999
i
got
this
one
from
a
24beer
sampler
an
excellent
beer
a
bit
watery
and
i
wish
it
had
more
of
a
body
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
id
buy
this
one
again
but
not
often
dark
bronze
color
creamy
offwhite
head
smoky
slightly
roasted
malt
character
woody
mildly
chemical
aftertaste
mediumbodied
could
use
a
bit
more
heft
dissapointed
it
doesnt
gain
really
any
character
as
it
warms
tastes
nearly
the
same
between
fridge
temp
room
temp
was
nice
to
try
but
didnt
bowl
me
over
will
wait
until
i
find
this
ondraft
before
i
sample
it
again
edit
in
reading
over
other
reviews
of
this
beer
it
seems
that
either
the
consistency
varies
greatly
or
people
are
tasting
something
very
different
i
may
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
and
see
if
its
any
better
than
what
ive
had
this
time
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
amberish
brown
but
see
through
held
a
good
head
the
whole
time
i
drank
it
not
just
on
the
pour
the
smell
was
very
clean
lightly
roasted
malt
taste
is
good
smooth
and
balanced
malt
and
the
mouth
feel
was
really
pleasant
a
good
balance
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
several
of
these
beers
in
one
sitting
it
didnt
seem
really
heavy
so
it
will
not
fill
you
up
too
much
over
all
great
beer
and
a
great
style
of
beer
da
very
good
sipping
beer
would
have
another
but
would
probably
stop
after
2
a
nice
ale
that
is
damn
good
i
must
say
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
a
nice
heavy
mouthfeel
i
would
have
thought
it
was
stronger
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
then
one
or
two
but
its
really
holds
up
well
for
5
4
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
fun
starts
with
a
good
sniff
a
sweet
smoky
odor
almost
like
a
burned
caramel
it
has
a
similar
taste
with
a
grainy
background
some
hoppiness
also
a
smooth
feel
to
it
and
fairly
substantial
too
a
good
beer
to
drink
but
not
too
many
in
a
single
sitting
pours
a
nice
amberish
dark
brown
with
a
nice
sticky
14
head
with
average
retention
and
sticky
lacing
smell
is
malt
heavy
sweet
the
forementioned
caramel
and
a
tad
bit
grainy
the
taste
is
a
complex
malt
dominated
chewy
taste
i
also
get
some
dark
fruits
plums
maybe
and
a
bit
of
an
oak
taste
wonderfully
complex
but
i
wish
the
hops
were
more
noticable
feels
thick
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
bite
on
the
back
end
drinakble
but
not
to
session
seems
more
of
a
desert
beer
to
me
or
one
to
sit
by
the
fire
with
a
good
book
and
sip
nice
dark
amber
maple
syrup
colored
clear
thin
but
intricate
lacing
creamy
head
very
visually
appealing
big
brown
sugary
sweet
malted
nose
very
wee
heavy
with
a
touch
of
additional
sweetness
the
smoked
malts
come
through
more
in
the
flavor
mirroring
the
taste
of
jinx
with
a
bit
more
sweet
and
buttery
malt
presence
the
lower
ratio
of
peat
smoke
in
the
malt
bill
shows
here
providing
something
a
bit
more
drinkable
and
accessible
to
the
boston
lager
drinking
public
still
a
little
thick
and
sweet
and
personally
id
like
more
smoke
to
it
a
nice
achievement
nonetheless
a
nice
fireside
sipper
could
be
that
ive
had
few
other
smoked
beers
since
then
so
im
skewed
as
far
as
my
memory
goes
this
is
in
the
upper
tier
of
sammys
bootled
efforts
widely
available
to
us
poor
masses
outside
of
the
north
east
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
color
is
a
deep
brownmahogony
the
smell
is
a
malty
caramel
like
scent
the
taste
is
a
little
overpowering
not
as
bad
as
others
of
this
style
though
it
has
sweet
backnotes
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
affected
a
bit
by
the
tangy
taste
but
again
not
as
much
as
others
of
this
style
the
drinkability
i
could
drink
one
of
these
every
now
and
then
but
not
every
day
an
average
beer
that
i
would
not
mind
having
again
this
is
quite
delicous
wish
i
could
find
it
on
its
own
pours
very
dark
brown
not
much
of
a
head
on
this
tastes
very
malty
caramel
slight
hops
even
to
me
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
not
what
i
was
expecting
though
its
extremly
slight
but
perfect
in
its
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
best
part
is
i
can
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
another
great
beer
from
the
boston
beer
co
it
has
a
great
head
that
holds
well
the
color
is
a
little
murkey
brown
it
has
a
great
complex
smell
one
can
dectect
both
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
even
more
complex
than
the
smell
hops
and
malts
are
once
again
present
but
there
is
also
a
definite
bitterness
smokey
malts
are
present
along
with
some
woody
flavoring
the
beer
has
a
good
body
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
can
bring
something
totaly
different
to
ones
palate
i
think
the
beer
could
do
with
a
little
more
alcohol
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
indeed
outstanding

individual
flavors
and
the
hops
balance
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
quite
smooth
without
a
doubt
the
best
sam
adams
ive
tried
to
date
whether
it
is
true
to
the
scotch
style
or
not
a
thin
tannish
foamy
head
over
a
dark
nutty
brown
clear
beer
smoky
roasted
malt
aroma
with
hint
of
nuttiness
lurking
in
the
background
tasted
nutty
slightly
bitter
and
smoky
a
burnt
aftertaste
and
a
hint
of
residual
sweetness
this
beer
is
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
scotch
ale
is
weighty
in
my
opinion
so
i
dont
think
id
drink
one
after
another
after
another
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
session
beer
pours
out
a
deep
crimson
with
a
smallish
but
nice
almond
colored
head
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
strong
malts
caramel
and
a
notable
nutty
scent
tastes
of
big
malts
and
a
nice
strong
hop
balance
finishes
slightly
dry
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
but
not
a
distraction
in
any
way
very
drinkable
but
not
something
to
make
a
long
session
with
recommended
for
people
who
are
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
rather
subdued
it
is
sweet
and
buttery
the
taste
sweet
with
no
detectable
hops
still
it
is
not
overly
sweet
there
are
also
some
buttery
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
no
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
and
mildly
creamy
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
better
wee
heavys
available
in
my
area
a
nice
dark
amber
colorbut
the
head
was
a
little
on
the
smallish
sideone
finger
a
real
spice
and
hop
smellvery
aromatic
a
strong
hop
and
spiced
filled
flavor
this
leaves
a
very
nice
malty
after
taste
a
mediumheavy
feel
that
means
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
more
than
a
couple
a
very
good
offering
from
sam
ill
try
this
again
poured
out
a
nice
dark
red
brew
with
a
2
finger
headvery
nice
nice
malt
sweet
smell
if
i
could
place
it
i
would
say
smell
of
black
licorice
taste
is
decieving
at
firstsweet
up
front
then
a
nice
tight
dryness
in
the
finish
mildly
hoppedhops
show
up
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
an
ok
brew
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
pours
a
beautiful
dark
red
amber
with
a
nice
twofinger
head
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
malt
tastes
is
sweet
malt
with
a
little
smokiness
very
interesting
and
good
theres
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
not
much
also
leaves
a
slight
smokey
flavor
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
mediumbodied
and
easy
to
drink
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
and
toffee
smells
the
aroma
is
nice
and
distinguished
in
that
it
stands
out
after
several
sips
the
taste
is
nicely
malted
with
a
caramel
and
toffee
chewiness
there
is
also
a
nice
balance
of
hoppiness
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
tasted
from
sam
pours
a
deep
red
amber
semiclear
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
holds
a
foamy
cap
to
the
end
and
produces
some
patchy
lacing
smell
is
faint
burnt
malt
and
sweet
esters
a
burnt
malt
flavor
washes
over
the
palate
followed
immediatly
by
an
pungent
bitterness
id
guess
the
rich
flavor
is
due
to
the
rare
peat
smoked
malt
used
in
scotch
whiskies
and
addional
malts
hop
presence
is
low
and
incidental
just
enough
to
dry
aftertaste
full
bodied
and
strong
but
finishes
clean
as
a
scotch
ale
this
is
real
drinkable
lower
alcohol
a
nice
smoke
presence
and
caramel
sweetness
make
this
an
interesting
diversion
for
any
day
or
all
day
as
the
case
may
be
i
would
like
to
see
more
alcohol
in
this
but
this
is
damn
good
drinkabilit
it
is
a
deep
and
complex
beer
i
could
definitely
enjoy
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
i
wish
this
was
available
in
more
than
the
mix
pack
deep
ruby
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
shrunk
to
a
thin
patch
nice
lacing
smelled
fruity
and
floral
with
a
candy
or
soapy
overtone
dry
malty
taste
with
a
slight
sweet
finish
and
small
bite
metallic
and
prune
or
liquorice
qualities
in
the
flavor
as
well
could
only
find
the
faintest
smoke
or
peatiness
which
was
disappointed
medium
body
with
almost
no
apparent
carbonation
very
smooth
not
bad
but
not
my
thing
i
guess
as
a
scotch
fan
i
was
hoping
for
more
smoked
peat
got
this
from
their
12pk
collection
seems
to
be
a
good
marketing
device
for
them
certainly
gets
you
to
ttry
the
full
line
overall
a
nice
scotch
ale
while
being
massproduced
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wanted
to
be
able
to
drink
a
nice
scotch
ale
by
the
sixer
bottle
notched
best
by
october
2005
when
i
heard
sam
adams
was
bringing
this
beer
back
i
was
overjoyed
i
fondly
remembered
the
complex
smokey
flavor
of
the
old
brew
finally
found
some
in
a
brewaster
12
pack
at
greens
in
columbia
sc
alas
i
was
a
little
disapointed
poured
a
deep
rich
ruby
red
with
an
off
white
head
smell
of
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
the
peat
smoked
malt
that
i
remember
maybe
my
taste
buds
have
matured
or
they
have
changed
the
recipe
but
i
did
not
sense
as
much
of
the
peat
smoked
malt
as
before
a
very
satifying
brew
just
not
as
good
as
i
remember
a
remarkably
average
scotch
ale
for
what
i
was
expecting
the
pour
was
a
bit
darker
than
ive
had
in
other
scotch
ales
and
the
head
but
a
bit
denser
but
thats
about
it
light
malty
and
dry
smell
perhaps
unbleached
paper
not
really
malty
or
sweet
not
enough
lowland
scotch
sensation
either
not
bad
but
nothing
remarkable
about
the
taste
perhaps
a
bit
undercarbonated
readily
drinkable
pours
out
a
clear
deep
ruby
colour
with
an
off
white
head
that
sticks
slightly
as
lace
sweet
malty
and
slightly
smoky
aroma
lots
of
peat
smoked
malt
in
the
flavour
quite
tasty
a
bit
of
alcohol
spice
adds
a
touch
of
character
the
overall
profile
is
sweet
and
malty
but
a
dryness
in
the
finish
balances
this
brew
out
the
body
comes
off
as
lacking
mainly
because
i
prefer
a
big
body
with
a
flavourful
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
prickly
ends
with
some
warmth
and
satisfaction
im
sure
id
like
this
more
in
december
rather
than
early
june
i
would
buy
this
if
offered
in
six
packs
and
available
in
the
fall
and
winter
a
nice
ale
drinkability
i
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
it
was
nice
to
see
that
sam
adams
brewed
something
that
was
different
from
other
breweries
nice
to
try
but
not
my
favorite
overallwhile
i
suppose
i
can
respect
the
labor
of
love
that
went
into
this
brew
and
that
i
am
a
defender
of
boston
beer
this
is
one
of
the
most
disappointing
beers
ive
had
the
mix
of
flavors
isnt
sucessful
and
dont
go
together
at
all
chunky
mouthfeel
as
well
im
not
a
fan
poured
out
a
light
brick
ruby
color
with
a
nice
12
inch
head
smell
was
all
malts
for
the
most
part
some
caramel
makes
an
appearence
with
some
smoky
peat
lingering
in
the
background
i
would
of
liked
to
see
some
more
smokiness
but
this
will
do
taste
was
decent
sweetened
malts
start
out
and
gives
away
to
a
caramel
smoky
peat
flavor
some
hpos
do
show
up
but
just
add
to
the
variety
of
flavors
that
are
already
in
here
mouthfeel
was
a
little
weak
i
thought
it
was
medium
but
finished
a
tad
watery
with
no
big
aftertaste
overall
it
was
a
good
tasty
brew
drinkability
this
is
an
intriguing
offering
from
the
boston
beer
company
that
is
fortunately
featured
in
their
brewmasters
collection
packs
while
i
find
the
smokiness
a
bit
too
overwhelming
to
enjoy
this
regularly
if
i
could
that
is
this
is
nonetheless
a
beer
worth
tasting
a
very
smooth
pour
a
nice
deep
red
brown
color
lots
of
clarity
little
head
smells
strongly
of
butterscotch
sweet
maltyness
toffee
and
that
classic
scotch
ale
smokiness
is
just
perfect
wow
the
smokiness
is
much
more
pronounced
than
i
thought
it
might
be
that
hits
you
up
front
and
then
fades
to
the
sweeter
candy
butterscotch
tones
hinted
at
in
the
smell
nice
toffee
malts
im
sure
there
are
hops
in
this
beer
but
beyond
a
slighty
bitter
bite
in
the
finish
i
can
barely
notice
them
nice
slick
full
mouthfeel
a
nice
end
of
the
evening
beer
obtained
in
sam
adams
latest
brewers
collection
pack
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
maltycarmel
nose
nice
mixture
of
sweetness
and
bitter
in
the
taste
the
neck
band
mentioned
the
presence
of
peatsmoked
malt
and
i
was
looking
forward
to
it
but
im
not
really
sensing
much
smokiness
interesting
complexity
to
the
taste
clean
finish
and
a
medium
body
good
drinkability
went
nicely
with
a
grilled
sirloin
for
dinner
pleseant
brew
nice
taste
and
good
enough
to
be
made
for
a
6ers
nice
show
all
around
drinkabilitynotes
far
off
of
style
for
a
scotch
ale
a
type
which
i
happen
to
like
very
well
disappointing
that
such
a
beer
comes
from
sam
adams
whom
i
associate
with
competent
if
not
inspired
craft
brewing
overall
impression
drain
food
didnt
enjoy
this
at
all
and
i
like
scotch
ales
i
think
sam
adams
is
trying
to
be
all
things
to
all
people
which
is
a
bad
road
im
also
thinking
that
somehow
the
case
we
got
was
abused
well
hoping
really
have
another
laddie
aye
fairly
dense
dark
cream
colored
head
leaves
some
nice
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
kind
of
biscuitydoughy
with
a
bit
of
caramel
transparent
deep
mahogany
colored
beer
with
a
ruby
hue
body
isnt
too
thick
but
the
mouthfeel
is
still
soft
and
chewy
flavor
is
just
sweet
enough
tastes
like
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
toasted
bready
goodness
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
just
a
tad
tangy
a
good
scotch
ale
that
would
probably
go
over
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
beer
drinkers
well
honestly
i
bought
a
12pack
of
the
brewmasters
collection
for
the
black
lager
but
this
was
the
real
gem
in
the
package
i
know
that
sam
adams
presents
a
fine
target
for
the
beer
geeks
of
the
world
but
i
hope
ive
always
given
them
a
fair
shake
and
this
is
my
reward
for
doing
so
a
very
nice
wee
heavy
with
a
nice
mix
of
the
caramel
and
smoked
malts
along
with
an
uncharacteristic
hop
touch
that
melds
nicely
into
the
beer
in
general
i
can
see
why
people
begged
boston
beer
to
bring
this
one
back
and
i
hope
that
this
will
be
a
regular
offering
for
them
in
my
opinion
not
the
best
example
of
the
scotch
ale
style
but
still
enjoyable
if
you
enjoy
good
scotch
then
you
should
love
this
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
large
sticky
head
smells
very
sweet
and
malty
some
what
smoky
too
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
and
smokey
malts
some
syrupy
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
make
this
ale
a
very
balanced
one
mouthfeel
is
meduim
kind
of
creamy
what
can
i
say
this
is
one
the
best
samuel
adams
has
to
offer
one
thing
i
do
not
undersand
is
why
not
six
packs
either
way
a
big
thumbs
up
pours
a
very
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
handsome
beige
head
lots
of
lacing
smells
mildly
nutty
and
sugary
strong
dark
caramel
malt
profile
with
a
bit
of
tart
sweetness
scant
chestnut
and
ginger
blurbs
in
there
too
finishes
slightly
dry
and
astringent
easy
on
the
tounge
easy
going
down
another
nice
sam
specialty
brew
a
good
beer
and
fairly
complex
but
a
lot
more
subtle
than
i
remember
it
being
years
ago
more
balls
and
this
would
be
a
great
one
tastes
of
sweet
cookie
dough
malts
with
notes
of
peat
bog
and
whiskey
moves
toward
a
meaty
smoky
bitterness
as
we
head
into
a
breadysweet
finish
mediumbig
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
good
example
of
the
style
as
far
as
i
can
tell
one
of
the
best
sas
ive
had
as
well
they
should
sell
sixpacks
of
this
this
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
good
head
im
thinking
of
a
burnt
apricot
smellpleasant
smokey
but
more
of
a
licorice
tastethis
isnt
my
type
of
ale
but
not
that
bad
it
has
a
slight
malty
after
taste
that
stays
for
awhile
this
is
worth
a
try
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
overall
this
beer
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
other
than
the
second
bottle
i
have
i
cant
see
ever
wanting
to
drink
this
one
again
alstroms
update
you
can
now
get
two
bottles

12
pack
excellent
ale
from
sam
adams
looks
good
smells
good
and
tastes
good
cant
compare
this
ale
to
another
because
it
is
quite
unique
smooth
malt
goes
down
nice
refreshing
also
can
say
a
lot
negative
about
this
beer
one
of
the
best
in
the
ne
wline
of
sam
adams
ales
final
thought
this
was
the
6th
final
beer
of
the
brewmasters
collection
and
all
were
great
i
raise
my
beer
for
you
sam
you
founded
the
microbrewery
and
i
drink
to
you
what
a
pleasant
surprise
this
brew
poured
a
caramell
brown
with
an
initial
two
finger
head
that
dissipated
but
remained
with
excellent
lacing
smell
was
malty
with
a
smoked
character
taste
was
three
fold
an
initial
malt
sweetness
then
a
smoky
peat
character
and
finally
a
lightly
bitter
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
good
with
no
harsh
or
oily
element
throughout
easy
to
drink
a
pleasant
surprise
out
of
a
sampler
pack
a
nice
example
of
the
style
im
really
glad
sa
decided
to
bring
this
brew
back
nice
to
see
this
brew
back
if
only
in
the
brewmasters
collection
perhaps
bbc
can
put
a
couple
in
the
winter
classics
box
too
tis
a
proper
pint
ive
always
liked
this
beer
this
didnt
disappoint
taste
mmm
interesting
smooth
malty
roasted
medium
body
beer
with
light
carbonation
roasted
aftertaste
that
quickly
fades
tad
bit
dry
but
very
welcome
wow
this
is
tasty
very
drinkable
pity
it
is
only
found
in
the
twelve
pack
brewmasters
collection
dark
brown
ruby
beer
with
tan
head
looks
like
root
beer
a
little
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
nutty
aromas
with
coffee
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
i
get
a
faint
licorice
smell
as
well
a
little
grainy
too
the
taste
is
pretty
rich
with
nutty
caramel
and
coffee
flavors
coming
through
the
most
a
grainy
character
is
present
that
contributes
to
a
little
bit
of
dryness
that
this
beer
needs
hops
make
an
appearance
but
the
maltiness
dominates
there
is
a
delicate
smokey
flavors
that
lends
itself
excellently
to
the
complexity
of
this
beer
surprisingly
light
mouthfeel
for
the
taste
an
enjoyable
beer
i
feel
like
this
walks
the
line
between
porter
and
scotch
ale
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
is
very
pleasant
it
has
a
caramel
malt
aroma
that
is
sweet
and
creamy
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
creamy
it
has
a
dry
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
scotch
ale
it
has
real
malty
complexity
and
a
creamy
finish
a
good
drinker
out
of
the
brewmasters
collection
pours
a
light
tan
with
a
creamy
dark
caramel
colored
head
aroma
consists
of
toffee

i
love
the
finish
of
this
scotch
ale
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
smokey
peaty
finish
robust
and
satisfying
the
hop
bitterness
that
arrives
midway
through
provides
a
nice
balance
to
the
malty
sweetness
glad
to
see
the
return
of
sam
adams
scotch
ale
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
this
was
one
of
the
brews
that
were
included
in
the
brewmasters
collection
the
brew
poured
to
a
nice
deep
mahogany
type
color
with
a
nice
pillowy
off
white
head
that
broke
down
slowly
and
left
nice
chunky
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aromas
from
this
brew
are
of
heavy
on
the
malt
with
a
strong
caramel
sweetness
that
goes
perfectly
together
also
notice
a
slight
smoky
aroma
with
highlights
of
dark
fruit
simply
a
fantastic
smelling
brew
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
are
very
good
with
a
strong
caramel
sweetness
that
leads
to
a
slight
smoky
mixed
with
earthy
flavors
also
has
a
little
bit
of
a
alcohol
taste
that
i
was
able
to
notice
but
was
mixed
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
of
this
brew
very
nice
offering
from
bbc
wish
the
would
sell
just
this
in
a
6er
very
nice
stuff
probably
one
of
sam
adams
best
offerings
i
could
do
with
a
little
finer
less
enthusiastic
carbonation
but
i
have
no
complaints
with
the
malt
at
all
pretty
much
the
same
as
i
remember
it
in
its
previous
incarnation

the

very

and
smooth

easily
one
of
the
most
quaffable
scotch
style
ales
i
have
had
to
date
and
very
well
the
best
boston
beer
co
brew
widely
distributed
in
the
brewmasters
collection
part
of
the
brewmasters
collection
i
heard
through
a
buddy
of
mine
that
the
scotch
ale
would
kick
my
butt
as
soon
as
i
sip
it
man
was
he
right
for
appearance
scotch
ale
pours
out
in
a
deep
red
colour
with
little
head
the
bottle
label
uses
a
tartan
design
i
didnt
smell
much
of
an
odor
upon
opening
the
bottle
after
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
i
detected
a
smoky
odor
the
taste
was
really
strong
at
first
it
was
very
smoky
and
i
felt
it
immediately
on
my
tongue
on
the
label
jim
koch
describes
it
as
a
subtle
smoky
flavor
there
was
nothing
subtle
about
it
after
a
few
sips
i
began
to
fully
enjoy
the
drink
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
scotch
ale
like
myself
then
enjoy
one
and
see
if
you
like
it
i
came
around
to
enjoying
this
drink
cheers
sam
adams
scotch
ale
was
the
first
micro
i
ever
drank
that
was
outside
of
the
basic
pale
ale
flavor
profile
it
was
the
beer
that
taught
me
that
beers
could
taste
different
it
pours
a
deep
redmahogany
with
a
thick
tan

that
has
some
staying
power
aroma
is
one
of

and
even
some
iodinemedicinal
notes
like
one
would
find
in
scotch
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
as
well
taste
is
malty
with
some
strong
smokey
peat
notes
with
a
nice
dry
finish
with
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
the
dry
finish
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
as
good
as
i
remember
a
pity
that
it
is
only
available
in

12

medium

disappointing
confused
as
to
what
they
are
thinking
with
this

overhopped
for
sure
which
basically
ruins
the
beer
sa
scotch
ale
is
solidly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
what
a
treat
a
notch
above
most
other
bbcs

this

the

i
am
now
stuck
with
oh
how
ive
missed
this
beer
now
if
only
the
honey
porter
would
return
ah
the
ever
elusive
sam
scotch
ale
i
was
able
to
grab
the
second
to
last
brewmasters
pack
at
a
local
store
solely
for
two
bottles
of
this
brew
its
been
at
least
five
years
since
my
last
sample
and
boy
did
i
miss
it
it
pours
a
lovely
ambercopper
colour
with
a
clear
crisp
body
a
slightly
tan
thick
and
foamy
head
hangs
out
for
a
good
while
the
smell
is
just
great
mainly
of
malt
with
a
little
sweetness
in
the
back
maybe
berries
of
some
kind
with
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
smoke
the
flavour
is
full
on
but
niceley
balanced
smokey
malt
with
a
dry
slightly
chocolate
finish
burnt
toast
and
caramel
are
interlaced
throughout
yum
yum
yum
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
thats
just
loaded
with
flavour
its
one
of
if
not
the
best
of
the
bbcs
beers
pours
a
beautiful
brown
color
with
tan
head
that
holds
up
nicely
throught
the
duration
of
the
beer
i
really
love
the
appearance
of
this
beer
has
a
smoky
scent
to
it
with
a
hint
of
tobacco
tastes
a
bit
chocolatey
very
malty
and
goes
down
great
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
taste
now
if
youll
excuse
me
im
about
to
have
another
right
now
now
bring
back
the
honey
porter
dammit
on
a
side
note
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
at
the
brewery
about
2
years
ago
they
were
playing
around
with
the
recipe
a
little
and
they
had
added
a
bit
more
smoked
malt
in
that
batch
it
really
added
another
depth
to
this
wonderful
beer
its
really
sort
of
a
shame
they
didnt
push
the
envelope
again
with
this
mass
release
still
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
sam
adams
beers
one
ofthe
better
sa
beers
and
an
enjoyable
drink
nowhere
close
to
mcewens
but
that
is
a
truly
special
beer
this
is
simply
very
good
gotta
love
the
brewmasters
collection
this
beer
pours
a
gleaming
reddish
with
a
middling
head
smells
of
peat
roased
malts
and
smoke
tastes
of
smoke
peat
and
a
nice
malt
hop
balnce
finished
dry
with
a
nice
citrus
hop
aftertaste
that
compliments
the
smoke
scotch
flavors
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
what
i
expected
given
the
aromas
but
was
pleasing
overall
and
made
me
wish
there
were
more
than
two
of
these
in
the
pack
as
i
would
have
liked
more
call
me
ishmael
this
is
one
of
my
white
whale
beers
well
i
was
not
disappointed
at
all
it
was
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
head
was
fairly
thick
and
stood
around
for
the
whole
drink
the
smell
was
like
most
scotch
ales
but
had
a
bit
more
body
in
the
malt
area
it
says
that
whickey
malt
is
used
in
it
and
i
can
detect
it
in
the
smell
the
taste
had
a
small
hint
of
whiskey
malt
to
it
i
thought
but
had
a
creamy
sweetness
to
it
as
well
the
only
thing
that
was
a
let
down
to
the
beer
was
that
it
wasnt
really
thick
in
the
taste
like
most
are
dont
get
me
wrong
though
it
was
still
really
friggin
awesome
that
aids
the
drinkability
though
imho
it
doesnt
leave
you
all
full
and
bloated
and
leaves
you
refreshed
if
you
see
this
buy
it
or
leave
more
for
me
all
i
had
are
five
year
old
notes
on
this
beer
so
its
good
to
see
it
back
in
sampler
packs
glowing
brown
amber
appearance
clear
small
tealike
head
of
a
yellowish
hue
laces
in
rings
and
latter
small
dots
good
smell
caramel
and
twix
bar
chocolate
mingling
body
is
medium
slightly
lighter
than
i
remember
it
the
flavor
is
entirely
pleasant
beginning
with
obvious
malt
tones
the
balance
is
good
for
a
beer
astringent
hoppiness
finishes
the
impression
a
little
more
like
an
esb
as
a
scotch
ale
could
be
a
little
thicker
and
emphasize
the
malt
qualities
hinted
at
in
the
aroma
drinkable
brew
also
my
main
reason
for
buying
the
new
sampler
pours
a
very
deep
maroon
color
with
a
tan
head
has
a
very
different
smell
smells
sweet
but
robust
probably
from
the
barrels
that
were
used
in
the
aging
process
has
a
nice
roasted
carmel
taste
that
really
shifts
into
a
hops
finish
very
smoothly
this
is
an
extremely
satisfying
beer
that
is
worth
buying
the
sampler
to
get
my
only
negative
reaction
to
this
beer
was
the
label
why
cant
boston
beer
have
sam
in
a
kilt
on
the
label
is
that
too
much
to
ask
ok
maybe
it
is
drinkability
very
good
although
i
keep
burping
up
hop
leaves
beautiful
red
hue
when
held
to
the
light
otherwise
there
is
lovely
brown
influence
as
well
clear
the
head
is
foamy
and
light
beige
in
color
about
a
half
finger
in
height
it
fades
to
big
soapy
bubbles
there
was
some
spotty
lacing
as
the
beer
was
quaffed
the
nose
had
a
modest
aroma
strengthwise
the
bouquet
expressed
hints
of
chocolate
malts
that
are
lightly
toasted
with
a
whisper
of
smokycaramel
at
the
end
there
is
something
mysterious
about
the
aroma
the
invitation
is
frank
and
i
gladly
took
a
sip
the
mystery
is
solved
the
palate
is
well
developed
with
chocolate
malts
upfront
slightly
dry
a
note
of
earthy
herbal
spicy
hops
are
found
in
the
middle
plus
a
vague
smooch
of
sweetness
and
the
finish
is
smoky
dry
chalky
with
a
hint
of
toasted
malts
wood
and
peat
this
is
far
drier
than
i
expected
and
the
maltiness
is
not
as
big
or
as
sweet
then
id
prefer
but
the
subtle
complexity
of
this
scotch
ale
cannot
be
ignored
medium
in
body
a
bit
less
bulk
than
there
should
be
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
thinned
by
a
lack
of
malt
this
aspect
of
the
beer
is
ordinary
at
best
this
is
a
plenty
tasty
beer
id
recommend
you
find
this
dandy
pop
the
cap
pour
enjoy
pours
a
deep
red
amber
with
a
big
offwhite
lacey

roasty
sweet

flavors
are
in
front
with
an
almost
smokey
thing
going
on
too
spices
and
hops

solid

the
brew
smooth

a

thin

fine

am
glad
to
see
again
pours
a
deep
clear
mahogony
with
a
nice
hefty
off
white
head
good
strong
malty
aroma
mostly
of
caramel
the
taste
really
shines
here
some
dark
fruity
flavors
that
give
way
to
a
sweet
malt
with
a
slightly
meaty
character
a
bit
like
bovril
some
hops
round
thing
out
in
the
finish
balancing
this
out
slightly
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
with
with
a
syrupy
aftertaste
but
as
far
as
scotch
ales
go
this
is
quite
drinkable
an
overall
good
mild
scotch
ale
if
you
enjoy
this
try
a
heartier
scotch
ale
like
mcewans
j
the
beer

an

scotch
ale
as
beer
afficianados
see
it
hmmm
however
nicely
done
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ever
sorely
missed
edit
now
available
in
the
sam
adams
brewmasters
collection
12pack
but
you
only
get
2
of
them
overall
more
towards
and
amber
than
scotch
ale
but
drinkable
and
relatively
fully
flavored
especially
good
as
an
option
during
travel
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
with
minimal
head
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
refreshing
floral
finish
pine
woodsy
feel
overall
not
a
ton
of
taste
though
fairly
bland
until
the
aftertaste
rating
f
had
this
on
tap
at
pike
nothing
real
special
just
average
there
wasnt
anything
that
stood
out
positive
or
neg
would
have
liked
more
abv
i
compare
it
to
oskar
blues
old
chub
without
the
8
pike
street
original
can
drink
all
night
kind
of
beer
pours
an
orangeyruby
cloudy
with
shortlived
fizzy
offwhite
head
theres
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
fairly
simple
with
just
nondescript
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
about
the
same
theres
not
a
lot
to
either
it
does
have
a
decent
weight
to
the
body
though
a
surprising
miss
from
pike
overall
good
scotch
ale
i
would
have
again
overall
drinkability
not
an
amazing
scotch
alewee
heavy
just
ok
does
go
well
with
food
though
beef
burger
sliders
and
deviled
eggs
in
this
case
while
not
very
remarkable
this
does
not
mean
its
bland
just
that
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
of
final
note
its
actually
quite
drinkable
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
in
quantity
and
wash
down
food
with
as
a
complement
just
enough
flavor
to
complement
and
be
enjoyable
not
too
much
to
overwhelm
or
clash
with
a
meal
so
ill
give
it
higher
marks
on
drinkability
than
on
being
a
good
scotch
ale
this
one
never
gets
it
all
together
at
the
same
time
individual
elements
were
okay
but
this
beer
delivered
the
goods
appearance
was
consistently
opaque
almost
sultry
this
ale
would
indeed
be
seductive
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
velvety
two
or
three
of
these
and
you
will
be
on
your
way
overall
a
very
general
kind
of
brew
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
abv
but
like
the
others
from
this
brewery
not
terribly
memorable
probably
very
nice
fresh
out
of
the
tap
at
the
brewery
nothing
offensive
but
also
nothing
particularly
exciting
either
overall
above
average
i
would
give
it
a
try
if
you
arent
expecting
a
very
heavy
scotch
ale
fairly
accessible
for
the
style
could
be
good
for
drinkers
new
to
it
rjt
o
a
solid
offering
that
is
a
must
try
for
fans
of
malty
beers
its
tasty
and
it
has
the
scotch
ale
characters
but
theyre
more
like
scotch
ale
light
mildly
peaty
and
toasty
easy
enough
to
drink
needs
more
flavor
it
gets
a
little
boost
from
my
nostalgic
appreciation
this
beer
was
pretty
expensive
at
nearly
10
a
six
pack
but
i
figure
its
good
to
splurge
on
some
good
beer
on
occasion
this
was
enough
of
a
taste
treat
to
make
it
worthwhile
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
good
malty
flavor
the
smell
is
average
i
like
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
must
try
it
is
an
above
average
beer
not
to
bitter
at
all
try
this
out
when
you
see
it
you
will
not
be
dissappointed
you
may
actually
even
like
it
its
a
great
session
beer
with
the
buds
no
doubt
o
well
below
average
i
enjoy
this
style
but
this
beer
misses
it
overall
i
think
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
it
improves
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
i
think
i
would
like
to
see
it
a
touch
clearer
in
the
glass
and
maybe
a
touch
less
boozy
poured
on
tap
at
the
tasting
room
into
a
shaker
everything
it
seems
comes
in
a
shaker
here
poured
a
deep
ruby
orange
toffee
color
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
leaves
some
runny
lacing
with
minimal
sustainability
through
the
glass
the
nose
was
roasted
malt
and
toffee
with
an
overwhelming
burnt
sugar
smell
if
youve
ever
gotten
sugar
on
a
stove
eye
before
you
know
the
smell
it
was
hard
to
get
past
however
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
overall
had
a
nice
fruity
hop
background
to
a
huge
malt
bill
it
was
full
of
caramel
and
brown
bread
very
heavy
mouthfeel
good
beer
but
not
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
poured
into
a
macandrews
thistle
glass
pours
a
reddish
copper
amber
with
a
fine
one
finger
very
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
apple
cider
tea
and
a
hint
of
peat
smooth
flavor
of
caramel
malt
light
grassy
hops
slight
fruit
juice
and
a
hint
of
peat
so
well
balanced
that
no
flavors
really
stand
out
medium
bodied
with
great
creaminess
a
very
nicely
integrated
and
easy
to
drink
scotch
ale
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
aggressive
peat
but
very
nicely
made
had
a
pint
at
tk
irish
pub
brownish
amber
hazy
in
color
small
creamy
head
pretty
malty
and
mildly
hopped
ever
so
slightly
syrup
feel
good
flavor
alcohol
takes
effect
in
this
one
quickly
which
is
a
little
suprising
at
6
50
i
like
this
beer
but
im
unsure
about
the
style
its
under
i
found
it
more
comparable
to
something
like
fat
tire
or
even
alaskan
amber
anyways
enjoyed
it
and
will
have
again
for
a
beer
thats
been
around
forever
this
is
pretty
anemic
but
its
not
too
offensive
and
maybe
thats
what
keeps
it
selling
at
the
brewpub
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
total
wine
in
huntington
beach
california
where
youll
find
all
sorts
of
oddities
regardless
of
quality
this
is
easily
my
favourite
of
all
the
offerings
that
pike
has
to
offer
nothing
exceptional
but
it
is
a
tasty
malty
but
not
overly
so
beer
that
drinks
very
smoothly
i
definitely
would
buy
again
and
the
price
point
isnt
bad
either
this
is
the
first
scotch
style
ruby
ale
ive
tried
and
its
made
me
interested
to
try
other
offerings
in
this
vein
o
a
decent
scotch
ale
again
nothing
really
special
pours
a
nice
bourbon
caramel
with
a
small
fleeting
white
residue
brilliant
clarity
smells
of
toast
english
tea
some
brown
sugar
and
a
wee
bit
of
cinnamon
flavor
carries
plenty
of
bread
some
yeast
and
slight
oxidation
cardboard
hints
of
tea
medium
bodied
with
light
carb
and
a
noninvasive
finish
a
decent
approachable
beer
i
can
see
myself
grabbing
this
on
a
cool
fall
day
pours
dark
red
with
a
subonefinger
head
slightly
off
white
smells
of
heavy
buttery
scotch
and
molasses
flavor
follows
with
a
mix
of
fruits
and
butterscotch
with
a
super
smooth
finish
not
much
peaty
or
smokey
flavor
here
but
i
was
ok
with
that
a
little
slick
juicy
with
medium
carbonation
was
hungover
when
i
had
this
but
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
pike
really
impressed
me
on
my
seattle
visit
overall
this
was
enjoyable
thanks
to
my
mother
and
fatherinlaw
for
this
one
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
and
not
much
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
which
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
almost
an
orange
appearance
in
sunlight
lacing
was
weak
sweet
aroma
and
sweet
on
the
palate
but
not
over
the
top
terrific
mouth
feel
i
was
reluctant
to
swallow
pleasant
carbonation
and
exemplary
taste
for
a
scotch
style
ale
it
exceeded
my
expectations
o
a
tasty
scotch
ale
but
a
little
too
mild
for
my
liking
i
like
my
scotch
ales
to
possess
more
on
the
peat
flavours
so
dont
look
to
this
one
if
youre
looking
for
a
bold
scotch
ale
this
might
be
a
good
choice
to
ease
someone
into
the
style
taste
is
really
nice
more
sweet
than
smokey
like
most
but
its
more
approcable
and
easy
drinking
carbonation
is
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
making
this
very
easy
drinking
o
a
very
peppery
and
pleasant
brew
not
big
on
peat
or
smoke
but
unique
enough
to
stand
out
while
being
very
drinkable
o
quite
enjoyable
when
in
the
mood
for
this
style
i
would
certainly
try
again
sad
for
scotch
lovers
like
myself
but
a
tasty
red
ale
in
the
sam
adams
or
ohara
style
nonetheless
overall
a
good
beer
but
1
would
only
be
able
to
drink
1
overall
its
alright
but
nothing
special
more
wood
tannin
grittiness
and
sweetness
on
the
palate
didnt
catch
the
smokiness
at
this
point
warming
effect
of
alcohol
more
drinkable
than
average
for
style
a
little
nuttiness
and
caramel
thrown
in

apple
juice
light

medium
crisp

good

fill
the
mouth
i
dont
think
this
ale
can
lift
a
kilt
an
ok
brew
some
flaws
but
tasty
drink
i
had
this
about
4
years
ago
i
know
why
i
didnt
buy
again
im
glad
fil
spent
for
bottle
for
me
to
review
with
not
many
other
choices
on
the
menu
that
were
appealing
to
me
i
ordered
up
this
scotch
ale
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
mostly
caramel
maltiness
in
the
nose
nutty
caramel
in
the
taste
some
sugar
and
peat
and
a
mild
fruit
flavor
not
too
strong
but
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
one
while
on
vacation
in
san
diego
poured
from
the
bottle
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
khaki
head
on
the
nose
i
get
some
light
smoke
sweet
malt
and
caramel
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
and
nicely
balanced
between
smoke
and
sweetness
with
flavors
of
light
peat
smoke
biscuit
and
caramel
o
kind
of
flavorful
at
least
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
while
this
is
quite
departed
from
your
typical
scotch
ale
and
not
one
i
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
choose
again
i
dont
think
this
beer
as
horrible
as
some
have
made
it
seem
im
finding
it
a
bit
unique
if
nothing
else
yet
if
not
of
for
the
review
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
d
low
1
bottle
is
all
i
needed
it
doesnt
taste
bad
its
just
smokey
pass
if
you
have
a
better
option
by
my
estimation
it
falls
nicely
between
the
boldest
shilling
ale
and
a
slowsipping
heavy
you
wouldnt
miss
the
peat
presence
if
it
was
removed
big
body
not
bad
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
caramelred
color
with
a
thin
filmy
head
the
nose
has
aromas
of
caramel
malt
and
nut
with
very
slight
hoppy
scents
the
beers
flavor
is
a
rich
malt
sweetness
which
is
wellbalanced
with
subtle
green
bitter
hops
the
body
is
round
and
smooth
in
mouth
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
follows
a
scotchymalt
aftertaste
dangerously
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
with
almost
any
kind
of
food
since
the
flavors
are
not
overpowering
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
pikes
note
o
g
1
064
with
27
ibus
scotch
style
ruby
ale
with
no
date
code
opinion
well
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
to
drink
it
has
a
pretty
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
so
it
does
a
decent
job
as
a
pale
ale
or
something
as
far
as
it
being
a
scotch
ale
i
wouldnt
be
expecting
anything
from
scotland
except
for
the
faint
peat
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
as
far
as
fermentation
flaws
or
anything
it
just
isnt
a
scotch
ale
feels
a
little
watery
and
i
wouldnt
be
really
excited
to
drink
another
not
an
exceptionally
interesting
beer
to
be
honest
ive
had
it
before
on
locale
in
seattle
and
remember
it
far
more
fondly
orangy
copper
some
fine
sediment
a
light
tan
cap
with
little
retention
but
decent
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
solid
in
its
power
toated
and
caramel
malts
almonds
and
slight
fruit
lots
of
toasted
caramel
taste
a
bit
almond
interesting
sweetness
slight
spicy
burn
i
enjoyed
how
this
tasted
but
not
enough
to
get
any
more
medium
bodied
light
fizz
in
the
mouth
smoothness
that
seems
syrupy
but
is
not
decent
middle
but
it
fades
to
quickly
on
the
finish
chewy
and
mild
spice
meet
the
bitterness
in
a
lingering
after
taste
golden
brown
color
crisp
with
a
hint
of
ruby
nutty
caramel
smells
sweet
taste
of
burnt
caramel
malt
fruits
and
some
bitterness
appearance
and
smell
were
better
than
the
taste
imho
certainly
not
bad
at
all
but
definitely
not
a
top
runner
either
a
great
beer
for
the
sidelines
of
a
world
sampling
tour
it
has
a
moderately
thick
body
with
low
carbonation
but
i
still
did
not
find
it
to
be
exceptionally
drinkable
even
at
6
5
abv
d
i
finished
it
it
was
not
horrible
but
there
are
so
many
better
examples
of
the
style
skip
this
and
try
another
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
brewed
to
1
064
with
pale
crystal
carapils
peated
and
munich
malt
hopped
with
magnum
and
goldings
to
27
ibus
and
fermented
with
english
ale
yeast
it
pours
almost
ruby
more
of
an
auburn
lightlyhazed
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
thin
cap
rich
and
sweet
in
the
nose
from
the
munich
and
crystal
blended
with
earthy
tealike
nearly
roasted
notes
the
flavor
starts
malty
and
rich
lightly
sweet
followed
by
hops
and
an
earthy
fullness
from
the
peat
hints
of
raisiny
crystals
creep
in
here
and
there
and
are
balanced
by
lightly
spicy
hops
that
contribute
little
bitterness
a
flavorful
yeast
strain
rounds
it
out
and
things
end
on
a
lightly
peated
note
while
it
begins
crisp
and
dry
once
the
carbonation
ebbs
the
body
fills
out
nicely
very
nice
brew
here
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
than
most
scotch
ales
but
this
is
wellbalanced
and
damn
tasty
definitely
recommended
d
an
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
that
is
neither
awe
inspiring
or
off
putting
in
any
way
simple
and
straight
forward
goes
done
rather
easily
a
bargain
for
the
price
no
complaints
would
gladly
drink
again
but
not
something
i
would
highly
recommend
all
in
all
i
like
this
beer
not
your
average
scotch
ale
but
i
guess
they
vary
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
brew
was
drinkable
enough
poured
this
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
icy
pint
glass
color
was
a
copper
amber
with
a
little
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
nose
was
sweet
and
toasty
i
found
almost
no
bitterness
very
balanced
and
drinkable
not
as
heavy
or
rich
as
other
scotch
ales
i
have
tried
overall
a
good
drinkable
ale
but
nothing
exceptional
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
im
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
particularly
at
this
time
of
year
but
this
effort
is
a
serious
disappointing
brew
it
lacks
the
boldness
and
the
full
bodied
character
that
i
think
defines
the
style
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
its
my
first
from
pike
and
im
disappointed
it
packs
a
punch
but
it
isnt
zippy
or
burny
some
people
might
be
put
off
by
this
but
im
not
convinced
that
a
strong
alcohol
presence
is
a
necessary
component
of
a
scotch
drinkability
my
palate
grows
weary
of
the
onslaught
of
notterriblyinteresting
malt
flavors
for
me
personally
this
is
not
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
it
is
serviceable
though
a
decently
drinkable
more
or
less
solid
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
may
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch
here
certainly
malty
aye
and
a
wee
bit
boozy
with
some
underrated
hops
to
keep
things
honest
something
worth
considering
come
the
inevitably
cooler
weather
and
that
scottish
bards
celebration
in
january
dit
is
actually
a
very
easy
to
drink
ale
i
would
have
liked
more
hops
and
alcoholic
bite
but
i
think
i
would
pick
this
up
again
not

this
was
a
decent
beer
more
like
a
scottish
than
scotch
ale
it
wasnt
super
clean
or
bold
and
rich
flavors
are
present
small
offwhite
head
it
is
solid
the
color
really
throws
one
off
going
into
it
this
is
a
pretty
weak
attempt

and
a
slightly
chalky
hops
close
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
slightly
creamy
and
has
a
nice
small
carbonation
that
makes
it
drinkable
however
the
flavor
is
something
i
find
boring
and
average
which
makes
me
not
want
to
finish
it
moderate
carbonation
thick
and
hops
light
smoke
in
the
background
as
well
the
finish
is
rich
and
sweet
with
a
lingering
caramel
malt
aftertaste
above
average
all
around

tap
at

just
outside
denali
national
park
the
color
is
a
reddish
copper
with
minimal
head
and
a
bit
of
delicate
lace
do
they
use
lace
on
kilts
the
smell
is
rose
hips
and
smoky
malt
now
were
getting
more
scottish
the
taste
has
a
nice
hops
bite
followed
by
a
sharp
malt
very
dry
finish
not
at
all
sweet
but
lacks
the
smokiness
and
peat
that
id
expect
in
such
an
ale
caramel
is
obvious
i
personally
think
it
is
less
distinctive
than
it
was
before
i
wouldnt
mild
drinking
more
of
this
but
dont
feel
drawn
to
by
any
means
id
call
this
retoolingrestoration
a
success
only
with
some
definite

from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
was
also
called
ruby
ale
on
the
bottle
it
poured
a
light
amber
very
clear
with
a
small
white
head
adn
light
lacing
nose
is
mostly
of
malts
and
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
there
is
a
little
fruit
and
bit
of
herbal
taste
mild
finish
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
pike
again
has
put
out
another
great
well
balanced
beer
if
you
like
this
ale
you
will
love
their
ruby
scotish
ale
d
ill
try
another
one
just
to
confirm
or
dispel
my
initial
conclusions
but
what
i
found
here
was
not
enjoyable
in
any
form
overall
a
fine
effort
and
well
deserving
of
the
84
score
when
i
wrote
this
review
nice
dark
amber
color
with
red
and
gold
hues
peeking
through
in
the
light
no
head
no
real
cap
and
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
maybe
just
a
hint
of
tan
and
white
floating
in
there
the
smell
is
a
sweet
caramellike
scent
not
too
complex
some
smokey
tones
linger
there
too
the
taste
was
very
much
on
the
sweet
side
but
had
a
nice
little
spicey
smokey
bite
to
it
again
though
not
too
complex
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
mildly
carbonated
mouthfeel
goes
good
with
the
food
at
the
pub
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
be
looking
for
this
one
otherwise
not
impressive
possibly
my
least
favorite
scotch
ale
to
date
d
good
enough
to
drink
again
yes
worth
seeking
out
maybe
not
the
pick
of
the
litter
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
worth
a
try
this
was
my
wifes
favorite
of
the
pike
but
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
light
for
being
a
scotch
ale
the
dark
golden
color
with
a
white
head
was
nice
in
the
glass
but
the
mouthfeel
didnt
match
up
watery
and
light
for
style
sharp
bite
in
the
taste
over
a
solid
malt
almost
but
not
quite
astringent
with
a
very
light
hint
of
smokiness
musty
in
the
nose
with
a
light
malt
and
little
hop
anywhere
too
be
expected
a
little
off
center
from
style
but
a
very
good
beer
and
this
was
one
of
only
two
pints
my
wife
ordered
in
three
bars
so
a
pretty
recom
there
this
beer
pours
a
straight
copper
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
exhibiting
light
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
and
slightly
earthy
the
taste
is
focused
on
the
malts
but
there
is
a
balanced
hop
presence
it
tastes
to
me
equally
split
between
malt
and
hops
but
the
malt
dominates
the
first
several
seconds
of
a
taste
and
the
hops
fill
in
afterward
no
significant
fruit
esters
in
this
beer
one
of
the
defining
characteristics
of
the
style
a
drying
finish
despite
a
malty
sweetness
in
taste
is
spot
on
in
this
beer
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
drying
due
to
the
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
scottish
heavy
but
the
higher
abv
somewhat
deceptively
high
keeps
it
out
of
the
session
category
a
gift
from
seattle
but
that
6
6
abv
isnt
noticeable
in
the
taste
flavorful
malty
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
dangerously
drinkable
its
not
nearly
as
big
or
complex
as
fat
bastard
the
wee
heavy
i
am
most
familiar
with
but
when
i
was
thinking
it
was
a
scottish
ale
i
was
happy
with
it
and
im
not
going
to
change
my
score
i
like
both
styles
cant
really
tell
much
of
a
difference
anyway
i
liked
it
and
its
available
at
just
about
every
store
around
the
seattle
area
so
i
recommend
it
and
will
definitely
get
it
again
drinkability
not
too
bad
but
this
needs
to
be
kicked
up
a
few
notches
on
the
malt
and
peat
levels
decent
beer
at
times
this
comes
off
as
thin
and
under
carbonated
its
enjoyable
to
drink
but
somehow
seems
a
little
slick
at
times
pour
is
reddish
orange
head
appears
for
a
moment
and
then
vanishes
entirely
nose
reminds
me
of
hops
dipped
in
caramel
taste
is
hoppy
brown
sugary
and
caramely
this
one
isnt
completely
doing
it
for
me
ill
be
honest
mouth
is
quite
nice
though
very
thick
carbonation
is
like
a
blanket
drinkability
is
ok
because
the
taste
isnt
bad
or
tastebud
wrecking
after
only
a
couple
sips
it
would
work
to
try
a
sixer
of
this
pours
an
orangeamber
color
topped
by
just
a
touch
of
creamy
white
head
aroma
of
rich
caramel
malt
some
light
peaty
smoke
light
fruity
hops
and
a
hint
of
diacetyl
palate
is
wellbalanced
between
sweet
caramel
and
fruity
hops
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
peat
smoke
medium
body
is
just
a
bit
light
for
this
style
and
lacks
the
syrupy
feel
that
is
characteristic
of
some
of
the
heavierhitting
scotch
ales
nonetheless
its
a
fairly
tasty
and
easydrinking
take
on
the
style
d
drinkable
this
brew
surprised
me
i
thought
that
i
would
not
like
it
but
its
really
not
that
bad
would
buy
again
i
really
need
to
seek
out
more
brews
in
this
style
as
this
one
is
night
and
day
different
to
the
only
other
scotch
ale
ive
had
to
compare
it
to
it
has
a
fruity
tangy
flavour
with
a
malt
profile
which
manages
to
mix
caramel
and
carrot
this
is
well
balanced
with
enough
hops
to
give
it
a
little
bite
as
the
beer
warms
the
fairly
high
alcohol
content
becomes
apparent
i
like
this
beer
but
it
isnt
easy
to
knock
back
and
an
imperial
pint
was
more
than
enough
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
light
tasty
and
very
drinkable
id
love
to
stop
by
the
pike
pub
brewery
and
try
one
on
tap
some
time
i
found
it
to
be
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
i
also
dont
think
its
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
the
faint
smokiness
probably
means
it
would
pair
well
with
with
a
good
stadium
dog
or
a
hearty
chowder
but
by
itself
this
really
just
drinks
like
a
malty
amber
ale
the
head
is
tiny
offwhite
bubbly
greasy

and

not

kind
of
homebrewy
overall
impression
dangerously
drinkable
high
abv
and
great
drinkability
could
be
a
very
dangerous
combination
in
this
one
wish
i
could
get
it
regularly
here
in
colorado
the
peated
malt
is
apparant
and
there
is
some
residual
sweetness
but
overall
it
was
too
bitter
for
this
style
the
flavours
were
just
a
little
harsh
for
my
tastebuds
good
stuff
it
sits
well
in
the
mouth
asking
for
another
hit
or
even
better
a
visit
to
pikes
itself
well
done
kilt
lifter
a
fairly
common
name
it
seems
is
not
good
beer
it
misses
the
style
mark
by
a
fairly
wide
margin
yet
isnt
so
bad
that
its
completely
without
merit
it
really
isnt
worth
a
purchase
though
and
im
glad
that
i
only
bought
one
bottle
pass
this
one
by
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
mild
crystal
malt
scent
with
a
bit
of
peated
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
good
although
im
not
sure
it
really
nails
the
style
too
well
it
has
a
nice
and
light
malty
core
with
a
smokey
feel
and
a
rather
bitter
hop
aftertaste
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
grainy
bisquit
malt
and
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
brew
it
is
certainly
unique
and
quite
flavorful
a
good
drinker
highly
dissapointed
in
this
one
thin
fizzy
lacks
peat
lacks
maltiness
has
almost
a
fruity
sourness
very
unremarkable
drinking
experience
i
would
never
buy
this
one
again
perhaps
its
old
but
we
got
it
from
liquid
solutions
and
i
assume
they
only
ship
fresh
beer
even
if
it
is
old
a
6
6
scotch
should
hold
up
better
tangy
tasting
just
not
at
all
what
i
expected
light
orange
color
nose
almost
smells
like
a
barnyard
tart
on
the
finish
not
very
good
at
all
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
goes
away
fast
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
kmpitz2
described
the
aroma
as
tomato
and
spices
and
i
totallly
agree
the
flavor
was
much
the
same
i
didnt
even
detect
any
peated
malt
something
really
strange
about
this
brew
not
in
a
good
way
i
had
to
pour
this
one
out
this
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
the
nose
is
really
strange
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
tomato
some
leather
and
spiceyness
i
hope
the
flavor
is
different
what
i
get
in
the
flavor
is
odd
i
get
the
peated
flavor
but
it
tastes
a
bit
like
leather
there
is
a
bit
of
bite
in
the
finish
but
overall
i
dont
like
the
beer
all
that
much
not
what
i
want
from
a
scotch
the
feel
is
rather
thin
and
drinkability
suffers
from
the
odd
notes
i
get
in
the
flavor
and
nose
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
i
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
back
in
the
days
when
there
was
a
lot
of
peated
barley
presence
and
it
was
still
called
maul
hammer
it
still
has
some
decent
mouthfeel
and
when
it
warms
up
you
get
just
the
slightest
reminder
of
that
smoky
peat
it
has
always
been
a
smooth
drinker
to
the
point
of
being
quite
dangerous
in
its
6
5
abv
past
but
i
think
its
been
dumbed
down
to
the
point
of
nearfogettability
still
its
better
than
most
us
attempts
at
a
scottish
style
pours
a
copper
orange
with
a
white
cream
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
grilled
fruit
alcohol
lingers
the
taste
is
very
light
for
this
style
roasted
malts
and
fruit
blend
well
with
the
alcohol
tones
hopyp
dryness
bring
up
the
rear
a
drinkable
scotch
ale
but
lighter
than
most
i
like
scotch
ales
with
a
cigar
but
this
one
just
doesnt
quite
make
it
to
the
cigar
room
copper
infused
rust
color
a
bit
of

haze
to
it
large
and
thickly
fluffed

sits
well
for
a
while
before
descending
to
a
thin
collar
and
the
lacing
sticks
in
strings
and
spots
aroma
is
super
yummy
malt
goodness
thick
and
dark
caramel
super
nice
peat
moss
thats
not
overly
smokey
but
favorlaby
earthy
and
has
a
terrific
sweetness
to
it
overall
taste
follows
suit
with
a
brigade
of
dark
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
with
super
nice
earth
tones
and
breadiness
to
make
it
rich
and
thick
again
the
peat
is
there
but
not
overwhelmingly
smokey
it
adds
just
enough
to
it
to
really
go
wow
hops
play
underneath
more
towards
the
finish
with
a
slight
spice
and
bite
helping
the
end
of
warmth
and
add
to
some
of
the
slight
dryness
great
feel
nearly
full
very
well
rounded
and
toothsweet
smoothness
and
the
low
carbonation
makes
this
a
creamy
thick
treat
to
drink
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
and
only
after
a
few
sips
is
that
its
a
whole
hell
of
alot
like
a
good
barleywine
but
without
all
the
baggage
of
the
higher
abv
a
real
plus
and
incentive
to
get
alot
more
of
this
in
the
future
as
it
is
quite
a
malty
yummy
treat
one
i
would
keep
in
my
fridge
alot
if
i
could
get
it
yummy
did
i
already
say
that
pours

nice

with
a
thin

that
is
gone
pretty
quicklyaroma
is
soft
and
fruity
with
a
light

note
that
lingers
taste
is
fruity
in
the
start
with
an
alcoholic
warming
aspect
to
iti
noticed
a
hoppy
dryness
in
the
finish
seems
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
flavorful
i
would
try
it
again
though
notes
it
has
alot
going
for
it
but
one
thing
that
really
is
out
of
whack
is
the
ultra
thin
mouthfeel
still
fairly
drinkable
but
it
comes
up
short
of
a
great
beer
pike
kilt
lifter
scotch
style
ale
was
served
from
a
22
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
clear
orange
caramel
brown
color
and
was
topped
by
a
negligable
head
that
left
weak
lacing
the
nose
was
quite
malty
with
a
nice
orange
citrus
presence
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
peat
smoke
i
would
have
liked
the
peat
to
be
more
pronounced
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
by
the
taste
though
a
sweet
flash
is
very
quickly
eclipsed
by
a
powerful
orange
zippy
bitterness
which
lasts
though
to
the
drier
very
estery
earthy
bitter
finish
very
nice
and
lively
the
body
felt
appropriately
full
for
the
flavors
and
style
but
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
lacking
which
was
apparant
from
the
lack
of
a
significant
head
overall
a
very
tasty
effort
that
drinks
well
drinkability

i
dont
know
if
ill
be

after
one
of
these

it
sure
was

i
get
that
subtle

note
as

warms
i
could
occasionally
taste
the
alcohol
the
mouth
is
chewysticky
and
viscous
great
stuff
perfectly
instyle
and
then
some
big
surprise
overall
a
very
good
wee
heavy
would
gladly
get
more
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
wee

the
smell
is
overloaded
with
alcohol
tastes
very
chocolaty
a

of
coffee
as
well
the
lasting
flavor
mixes
dark
candied
fruit
balanced
by
alcohol
and
light
herbal
and
spicy
hops
o
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
big
beer
there
is
so
much
going
on
that
it
could
have
been
a
jumbled
incoherent
mess
but
instead
the
flavors
work
with
each
other
and
then
give
way
to
the
next
set
of
tastes
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
wee
heavy
i
could
believe
it
was
a
quadrupel
or
perhaps
a
barleywine
excellent
sweet
aroma
and
flavor
faint
dark

and
compatible

i
would
buy
this
again

prunes
reminscent
of
warm
brown
bread
and
molasses
good
carb
strong
but
didnt
seem
to
be
boozy
slightly
warming
o
this
is
definitely
not
one
for
those
who
arent
a
fan
of
big
sweet
beers
but
the
complexity
is
quite
astounding
two
years
of
aging
seems
to
have
blended
the
flavors
brilliantly
even
bringing
our
more
notes
that
may
not
have
been
noticeable
when
fresh
a
big
slow
sipper
that
s
among
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
big
and
bold
tempered
by
an
evenkeeled
smoothness
and
respectable
complexity
rather
tame
in
the
looks
and
smell
departments
and
the
feel
has
a
somewhat
weak
watery
aspect
but
tastewise
a
lot
is
offered
worth
checking
out
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
wee
heavies
ive
had
in
awhile
nose
is
soft
but
reveals
a
rather
complex
union
of
bready
biscuit
malt
rich
mediumdark
caramels
and
hints
of
a
leathery
peat
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
fully
toasted
malts
finish
with
dark
caramels
balanced
by
just
enough
hops
to
eliminate
any
cloying
but
also
not
make
it
bitter
it
also
softens
up
a
bit
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
adding
touches
of
toffee
and
lighter
caramels
this
is
one
fine
beer
i
cant
believe
i
havent
had
this
beer
until
today
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
creamy
light
tannish
colored

atop
brown
sugar

some
meatiness

with

in
the

a
big
sipping
beer
here
with
great
full
on
flavors
o
not
a
style
i
prefer
but
this
one
is
an
enjoyable
deviation
from
what
i
normally
drink
chewy
exceptionally
creamy
medium
low
carbonation
but
very
soft
with
a
very
fine
bead
some
warming
but
not
a
lot
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
wee
heavy
but
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
than
a
wee
heavy
its
certainly
more
different
than
other
wee
heavy
that
ive
had
still
its
a
damn
delicious
beer

and
very
deep

the

lots

nice
surprise
it
has

this

loved
this

may
have

and
save
some
for
this

definitely
recommend
this
beer
overall
a
very
pleasant
poor
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
know
they
make
a
barrelaged
version
and
i
would
love
to
try
it
perhaps
that
could
compare
to
my
favorite
wee
heavy
the
backwoods
bastard
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
the
alcohol
notes
are
present
but
get
a
bit
annoying
only
in
the
taste
that
last
spike
of
bitterness
smell
is
rich
and
smooth
could
smell
it
all
day
the
taste
is
smooth
enough
and
makes
me
appreciate
the
scotch
ale
style
a
bit
more
not
my
favourite
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
superb
a
bit
of
ageing
could
probably
make
it
even
smoother
overall
good
big
beer
lots
of
sweetness
but
too
much
peat
smoke
and
roast

me

am

overall
this

honestly
probably
the
most
drinkable
wee
heavy
ive
ever
had
could
have
used
more
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
it
was
delicious
overall
really
good
beer
that
has
some
inclinations
toward
being
great
very
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
must
try
for
fans
of
it
fans
of
any
style
should
enjoy
it
as
well
its
very
accessible
and
very
easygoing
im
glad
i
finally
gave
this
a
shot
i
will
be
looking
for
the
barrelaged
version
on
tap
nice
take
on
a
scotch
ale
less
peaty
and
smoky
than
many
out
there
this
is
driven
by
malt
sweetness
rather
than
earthiness
but
retains
some
of
the
quintessential
characteristics
of
the
style
dark
brown
amber
color
dense
looking
without
a
short
lived
tan
head
a
nose
of
sweet
musty
grain
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
smoke
the
taste
isnt
that
sweet
though
only
a
little
in
the
finish
when
it
warms
up
and
the
booze
comes
out
to
play
a
little
bit
its
not
as
full
bodied
as
i
like
mine
to
be
but
it
helps
this
drink
pretty
easy
a
beer
that
almost
demands
food
smoked
meats
cured
meats
and
cheeses
even
bread
pudding
all
leap
out
at
me
as
foods
that
this
beer
was
made
for
well
hidden
abv
for
the
most
part
too
well
made
bottle
a
must
share
though
at
this
strength
and
density
addictive
at
first
i
was
not
blown
away
but
damn
this
grows
on
you
like
vd
except
good
vd
really
consistent
flavor
fantastic
mouth
feel
and
a
kicked
up
abv
whats
not
to
love
o
alesmith
has
created
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
personally
conflicting
beers
in
wee
heavy
on
one
hand
their
ability
to
completely
downplay
the
amount
of
alcohol
this
beer
contains
is
quite
incredible
its
barely
even
hinted
at
on
the
other
hand
the
subtle
nature
of
the
malt
profile
shows
serious
promise
but
with
each
sip
i
wonder
where
the
flavors
run
off
to
deep
complexity
is
one
thing
but
to
have
next
to
no
standout
flavor
at
all
is
another
i
would
expect
some
forward
sweetness
at
least
something
all
the
characteristics
seem
to
hide
in
the
shadows
unfortunately
it
leaves
me
feeling
that
the
only
reason
i
might
reach
for
this
beer
again
would
be
to
down
something
high
in
alcohol
with
little
temperament
not
a
sugar
bomb
not
super
bitter
just
there
o
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
its
probably
alesmiths
most
balanced
offering
its
malty
and
sweet
without
being
cloyingly
so
its
a
high
abv
beer
without
being
syrupy
the
taste
profile
is
really
complex
yet
everything
works
in
harmony
this
is
one
seriously
underrated
beer
highly
recommended
o
a
fantastic
scotch
ale
love
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
scotch
ale
good
toasty
malt
and
smoke
flavors
great
presence
of
dark
fruits
that
almost
make
it
seem
like
a
dubbel
overall
nice
scotch
ale
a
little
too
sweet
overall
it
does
its
job
and
a
good
job
it
does
its
decent
its
not
terribly
difficult
to
drink
and
at
10
thats
an
admirable
quality
but
the
higher
abv
does
seem
to
make
a
difference
and
maybe
this
one
can
stand
to
make
an
improvement
or
maybe
at
a
ba
score
of
93
it
doesnt
need
to
improve
itself
it
just
seems
a
bit
thick
to
me
but
still
a
great
finished
product
overall
its
great
but
i
think
it
would
be
10x
better
if
it
aged
for
6
months
to
a
year
i
have
no
problem
with
this
ale
being
a
mere
wee
heavy
thats
scaled
up
to
barleywinetype
proportions
forget
the
style
forget
the
rules
forget
its
origins
and
inspirations
one
sip
changes
all
that
and
demands
that
the
beer
be
seen
in
a
special
light
one
not
meant
for
the
mere
entusiast
but
for
the
connoisseur
the
10
pct
abv
is
hidden
rather
nicely
in
a
lower
carbonated
setting
making
this
ale
a
real
pleasure
to
experience
a
stunning
beer
well
balanced
and
so
full
of
malt
o
interesting
take
on
a
scotch
ale
while
it
has
plenty
of
rich
malt
character
there
are
plenty
of
other
flavors
which
keep
it
in
balance
o
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
esp
if
youre
a
scotch
ale
fan
as
i
am
this
cranks
the
style
up
ten
fold
creating
a
fuller
bodied
experience
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
but
isnt
an
ass
about
it
overall
a
very
nice
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
expect
a
little
more
smoky
flavor
from
the
style
would
go
very
nice
with
some
sweet
bbq
not
quite
kismet
with
me
and
this
beer
in
the
right
persons
glass
this
could
be
heaven
but
it
makes
me
craving
more
spice
or
something
to
balance
out
that
sweetness
update
i
got
basque
sheeps
cheese
but
i
think
that
a
stronger
sheeps
cheese
would
go
better
with
this
the
taste
is
just
awesome
dried
fruity
fig
raison
meets
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
but
then
you
add
the
complexity
of
the
scotchwee
heavy
yeast
character
and
you
have
an
awesome
brew
its
so
easy
to
drink
especially
as
it
warms
and
each
flavor
component
really
begins
to
shine
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
decent
big
brewski
with
nice
complexity
but
a
bit
too
strong
of
an
alcohol
bite
overall
super
super
complex
all
the
best
qualities
that
make
a
superb
wee
heavy
it
is
definitly
a
sipper
at
10
abv
but
if
you
can
get
past
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
profile
you
are
in
for
a
definite
treat
poured
from
bottle
into

with
a
big

aroma
is
candy
sugar
scotch
some

raisins
chocolate

flavor
is

forward
and
sweet
light
carbonation
goes
down
easy
only
a
hint
of
scotch
here
and
it
is
going
very
well
with
my
sharp
cheddar
beautiful
scotch
whiskey
finish
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
wow
this
is
fantastic
this
was
a
great
purchase
in
my
opinion
immediately
wished
i
had
another
bottle
overall
wee
heavy
is
an
excellent
beer
for
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
definitely
recommended
cheers
what
electrifies
me
with
this
beer
is
the
great
malt
complexity
together
with
the
overall
wellfocused
structure
flavor
intensity
and
well
thought
hopping
it
isnt
aweinspiring
but
its
pretty
darn
good
so
far
the
best
ive
quaffed
in
it
style
scotch
ale
unique
and
wellmade
with
high
drinkability
even
though
its
overall

merry

httpquaffable
orgp138
o
i
have
to
knock
it
down
a
hair
just
because
it
really
does
seem
more
like
a
belgian
dark
strong
or
dubbel
than
a
scottish
ale
a
fine
beer
nonetheless
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
honestly
everything
about
this
beer
was
strong
but
the
look
was
exceptional
the
coloring
was
drop
dead
gorgeous
and
the
head
retained
beautifully
contributing
in
full
to
the
excellence
of
the
mouthfeel
the
aroma
and
taste
were
nearly
as
exciting
with
a
clean
wellblended
style
this
is
fantastic
for
the
style
and
certainly
the
standard
to
be
compared
against
overall
this
is
real
interesting
but
it
seems
like
the
toffee
sense
on
this
is
downplayed
i
normally
like
a
good
sense
of
that
and
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
quad
which
doesnt
always
grab
me
when
i
want
a
wee
heavy
its
got
a
great
flavor
profile
but
its
not
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
and
they
all
seem
like
they
are
trying
to
play
nice
together
but
have
a
hard
time
fitting
well
with
each
other
nicely
regardless
its
a
very
well
crafted
beer
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
light
taupe
head
perpetually
fed
by
carbonation
bubbles
from
the
bottom
chocolate
fudge
nose
some
cinnamon
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
invading
the
olfactory
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
fw
double
dba
viscous
mouthfeel
that
ads
to
the
richness
of
the
beer
theres
certainly
an
oktoberfest
on
steroids
with
this
one
spicy
chocolaty
fudgy
creamy
smooth
not
much
to
dislike
o
complex
a
bit
too
big
to
be
drinkable
but
tasty
in
small
doses
very
enjoyable
o
one
of
the
best
wee
heavys
out
there
would
kill
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
o
definitely
a
very
strong
boozy
and
complex
scotch
ale
the
weird
leatherydustywoody
aspect
really
detracted
i
thought
it
almost
tastes
oxidized
in
a
way
but
this
is
super
fresh
just
came
into
the
store
last
week
fairly
smoky
and
peaty
too
which
i
generally
dont
like
too
much
i
was
kind
of
torn
on
the
scoring
as
i
didnt
like
some
of
the
flavors
but
it
also
has
a
lot
of
good
flavors
as
well
as
the
complexity
and
balance
the
smoke
and
peat
seems
inline
with
the
style
so
its
hard
to
take
away
points
for
that
either
tough
one
to
score
i
did
not
enjoy
this
one
at
all
however
highly
recommended
while
not
my
favorite
scotch
ale
a
very
unique
and
very
nice
take
on
the
style
and
super
enjoyable
well
crafted
and
delicious
overall
quite
a
good
beer
if
you
like
gargantuan
malt
bombs
this
beer
is
for
you
in
small
portions
mostly
after
dinner
with
a
good
dessert
why
not
crème
brûlée
overall
this
is
really
good
stuff
i
know
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
alesmith
gives
really
good
stuff
but
this
is
excellent
even
by
their
high
standards
this
is
a
wee
heavy
in
the
rich
thick
and
juicy
variety
not
the
type
created
by
a
slight
hint
of
peat
i
feel
like
this
is
the
better
o
a
very
solid
selection
though
my
maltaverse
friends
didnt
want
to
split
this
one
with
me
i
think
this
beer
could
find
favor
on
almost
any
beer
lovers
palate
a
great
job
by
alesmith
six
of
us
attending
a
beer
tasting
that
i
hosted
in
my
man
cave
pub
gave
this
beer
a
score
of
24
out
of
a
possible
30
for
and
an
average
score
of
4
0
it
ranked
tied
for
3rd
out
of
the
12
beers
we
tasted
the
group
of
six
were
divided
evenly
3
that
favored
ipas
and
3
that
favored
stouts
this
wee
heavy
scotch
style
ale
comes
in
a
25
oz
bottle
may
be
hard
to
find
full
bodied
decent
carbonation
creamy
and
luxurious
on
the
tongue
i
savored
every
drop
of
my
taster
i
would
easily
buy
a
few
bottles
of
this
if
it
wasnt
so
pricy
here
in
philly
o
an
awesome
wee
heavy
very
tasty
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
o
a
really
nice
beer
for
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
find
myself
reaching
for
this
over
an
ris
anytime
soon
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
had
no
problem
finishing
the
750
i
will
certainly
buy
this
one
again
i
think
a
barrelaged
version
of
this
must
be
absolutely
fantastic
i
hope
they
release
it
again
soon
overall
offstyle
from
the
hops
good
but
not
what
i
expected
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
latticework
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
burnt
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
awesome
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
it
very
easy
to
drink
very
subtle
but
good
malt
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
theres
a
high
alcohol
content
but
it
is
not
present
in
the
flavor
making
this
a
scary
easy
drinking
beer
theres
a
good
peat
presence
in
the
nose
though
it
is
slightly
more
subdued
in
the
flavor
as
i
would
say
it
should
be
though
i
usually
like
a
little
bit
more
the
beer
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
peat
smoke
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
malt
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
complex
i
get
some
nice
toffee
and
dark
fruit
notes
along
with
a
hint
of
peat
smoke
and
some
light
alcohol
notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
did
i
say
this
was
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
had
super
smooth
very
flavorful
avoided
being
too
sweet
or
chewy
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
my
last
review
of
an
alesmith
beer2010
decadence
the
last
alesmith
beer
ive
had
before
this
onei
mentioned
that
the
beer
fell
short
particularly
in
regards
to
the
potential
of
the
brewers
alesmith
wee
heavy
is
the
kind
of
beer
im
talking
about
there
only
a
world
class
brewer
could
make
a
beer
like
this
this
was
awesome
malt
bomb
to
perfection
perhaps
the
beat
wee
heavy
ive
ever
had
thanks
again
egrace84
o
really
impressed
with
this
beer
love
a
beer
that
can
be
subtle
and
big
at
the
same
time
reminds
me
of
kate
the
great
from
portsmouth
brewery
in
that
way
lots
of
delicate
fruity
malty
notes
boozy
without
being
cloying
or
requiring
a
fork
and
knife
to
aid
in
ingesting
it
really
top
notch
stuff
o
i
love
a
good
scotch
ale
and
this
is
my
first
attempt
at
a
wee
heavy
and
it
was
a
uber
enjoyable
experience
go
alesmith
you
rock
o
best
wee
heavy
yet
o
good
but
not
great
i
can
think
of
a
few
other
examples
of
the
style
that
i
would
choose
over
this
worth
trying
for
sure
but
13
is
a
bit
much
for
this
to
be
a
regular
purchase
cons
in
the
boston
area
its
pricey
and
difficult
to
find
i
could
only
find
it
at
martys
17
and
ball
square
wines
in
somerville
seems
like
a
prime
example
of
the
big
caramely
robustly
alcoholic
scotch
ale
that
american
craft
breweries
like
to
make
the
smoke
is
fleeting
id
like
to
have
a
true
peaty
character
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
along
with
a
thick
medium
head
that
lasts
throughout
deep
caramelly
malty
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
in
the
finish
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
voluptuous
reflecting
the
flavor
with
malt
familiar
with
the
scottish
style
hop
and
yeast
characteristics
mouthfeel
lush
full
rounded
almost
chewy
mouthfeel
a
good
wee
heavy
style
that
i
rarely
drink
o
was
very
impressed
with
this
wee
heavy
semi
new
to
the
style
but
i
liked
it
more
than
founders
offerings
cant
wait
to
get
a
ba
version
o
meh
probably
wont
buy
again
but
it
is
really
a
decent
beer
o
as
expected
i
was
not
dissapointed
at
all
in
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
lot
from
an
alesmith
and
i
was
impressed
very
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
and
by
far
the
best
overall
scotch
ale
or
wee
heavy
i
have
ever
sampled
prefect
balance
of
dark
caramel
dark
fruit
and
light
earthpeat
flavors
drinkability
is
stupidly
off
the
charts
as
i
could
easily
down
this
750ml
in
short
time
if
necessary
although
i
will
choose
to
enjoy
it
here
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
toasty
and
delicious
almost
tastes
like
a
barrel
aged
beer
even
though
its
not
i
love
it
o
this
beer
wowed
me
alesmith
has
delivered
once
again
with
a
fantastic
beer
if
i
were
to
nitpick
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
little
more
smokiness
but
this
is
an
extremely
minor
fault
sweet
malty
and
completely
satisfying
d
i
really
am
digging
this
beer
at
10
it
is
super
smooth
and
subtle
quite
the
high
wire
act
o
awesome
nose
pretty
straight
forward
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
very
solid
over
all
overall
outstanding
scotch
ale
the
chocolate
flavors
along
with
the
smoke
and
hint
of
coffee
and
the
overall
sweetness
create
a
very
interesting
flavor
profile
that
is
fairly
true
to
the
style
the
alcohol
was
not
dominant
you
know
its
there
but
the
beer
is
some
sweet
and
complex
that
it
doesntt
seem
to
have
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
because
i
typically
love
alesmith
products
but
this
one
for
me
missed
the
mark
overall
this
was
a
pleasantly
nice
beer
tastes
better
than
it
smelt
this
is
a
special
beer
i
love
wee
heavys
but
this
is
like
a
luxury
sedan
compared
to
very
nice
standard
vehicles
seek
it
out
be
patient
wait
a
year
and
enjoy
youll
probably
wish
you
could
open
a
second
immediately
its
like
a
raisincordialchocolatecherry
that
is
dipped
in
spiced
rum
yea
just
like
that
still
plenty
of
booze
even
though
the
bottle
is
more
than
a
year
old
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
not
a
whole
lot
of
smoke
or
peat
on
the
flavor
id
like
to
see
more
but
it
is
quite
delicious
as
is
i
love
the
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
presents
i
find
myself
mmmming
to
myself
more
and
more
as
it
warms
despite
the
lack
of
smokiness
i
love
so
much
in
a
wee
heavy
the
alcohol
is
sooo
smooth
and
gentle
the
best
way
i
can
describe
this
would
be
a
blend
of
old
chub
and
belhaven
wee
heavy
with
more
alcohol
and
complexity
very
nicely
done
alesmith
o
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
beer
thats
slightly
turning
ive
had
it
for
2
years
or
is
how
its
supposed
to
be
i
generally
consider
skullsplitter
to
be
the
best
wee
heavy
but
i
think
alesmith
could
give
it
a
run
for
its
money
i
wish
i
had
a
skullsplitter
tonight
to
taste
them
head
to
head
of
course
that
would
probably
lead
to
a
skullsplitting
morning
overall
this
is
my
second
beer
by
alesmith
its
an
enjoyable
good
beer
this
alesmith
beer
impressed
me
more
than
speedway
stout
the
downside
is
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
quadruple
than
a
wee
heavy
thats
why
i
have
a
lower
score
on
the
overall
section
not
true
to
style
dr
very
drinkable
even
for
its
high
abv
this
is
good
sipper
if
you
like
to
drink
whilst
reading
a
book
i
imagine
it
ages
well
id
love
to
try
this
on
draught
or
even
nitrodraught
if
it
exists
this
is
maybe
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
had
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
alesmith
why
is
everyone
in
san
diego
so
focused
on
stone
when
beers
like
this
are
available
from
alesmith
give
this
one
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
a
good
beer
to
sip
along
with
through
the
night
but
i
do
feel
that
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
stong
for
me
perhaps
if
this
ale
was
toned
down
abit
it
would
excel
even
further
the
thing
i
like
about
wee
heavies
is
the
attention
to
malt
they
really
highlight
what
malt
can
do
towithfor
a
beer
roasty
sweet
smoky
fruity
smooth
chewy
this
one
has
all
the
above
juicy
would
be
another
word
although
this
one
has
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
perhaps
too
much
for
my
stylecrosshairs
but
who
am
i
i
drink
beer
and
ill
have
this
again
very
nice
for
a
nightcap
great
to
just
sip
on
some
alcohol
is
present
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
overall
experience
o
i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
tasted
good
smell
and
flavor
but
not
as
bold
as
i
would
like
very
drinkable
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
poured
a
creamy
dark
chocolate
color
a
small
tan
white
head
slight
smokey
and
malty
nose
low
carbonation
and
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
some
bitterness
little
hop
presence
before
chocolate
roasted
and
perhaps
some
smoked
malt
making
it
balanced
nothing
overpowering
perhaps
some
yeast
esters
peat
alcohol
is
well
hidden
taste
has
a
mixture
of
sweet
dark
fruit
molasses
and
a
bit
of
light
hops
pretty
good
but
there
are
a
couple
more
i
rate
higher
scotch
ale
is
not
really
an
exciting
style
in
my
opinion
but
surprise
surprise
alesmith
does
it
well
dark
brown
appearance
with
an
offwhite
head
peaty
and
malty
aroma
really
intense
pretty
heavy
stuff
lots
of
sweet
caramel
maltiness
hints
of
chocolate
and
smoke
not
much
carbonation
alcohol
is
there
but
fairly
subdued
for
a
10percenter
o
this
is
a
great
brew
the
flavor
is
really
great
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
especially
for
the
abv
i
could
drink
this
everyday
without
a
problem
o
super
smooth
wee
heavy
4
5
o
this
is
probably
the
scotch
ale
that
will
convert
me
to
scotch
ales
would
buy
again
for
sure
o
caramel
kiss
in
a
glass
i
now
know
why
this
one
gets
the
kudos
that
it
gets
overall
this
is
an
excellent
malt
focused
beer
with
many
nuances
that
open
up
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temp
will
definitely
reach
for
this
one
again
alesmith
wee
heavy
is
so
much
more
complex
and
expansive
than
even
most
of
the
fine
malted
milk
ball
malt
bombs
of
the
style
which
i
love
takes
the
style
to
a
new
level
for
me
palate
is
slick
and
sweet
and
a
little
prickly
from
booze
flavors
of
dried
dates
figs
burnt
caramel
heather
and
top
soil
long
long
finish
sweet
but
not
cloying
price

at
whole
foods
nyc
o
good
beer
holds
up
very
well
and
was
actually
very
well
balanced
o
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
but
not
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
had
goodish
though
recommended
perhaps
but
i
wouldnt
have
another
this
scotch
is
a
lil
sweeter
than
one
would
like
all
things
said
it
is
respectable
and
worth
trying
this
beer
pours
a
rich
and
smooth
medium
bodied
dark
brown
borderline
black
in
color
with
a
one
finger
cream
colored
head
it
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
cream
nuts
and
a
red
wine
sweetness
it
tastes
of
candied
sugar
super
sweet
caramel
and
dark
malts
and
cream
it
also
has
a
strange
and
faint
red
wine
like
aftertaste
i
would
rate
this
so
much
higher
if
not
for
the
sweetness
god
damn
its
sweet
this
one
drinks
far
too
light
for
what
it
should
it
is
creamy
like
the
speedway
but
in
an
overly
thin
manner
what
the
deuce
overall
id
describe
this
as
a
sweet
and
flavorful
malt
bomb
compared
to
big
sound
from
cigar
city
this
one
needs
work
and
less
sugar
long
live
big
sound
di
cant
believe
how
easy
drinking
this
is
there
are
no
detectable
signs
of
the
abv
and
its
a
very
complex
beer
while
maintaining
a
balance
between
its
many
characteristics
this
is
a
tasty
wee
heavy
from
the
always
reliable
alesmith
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
a
little
bit
of
a
tannic
finish
pretty
solid
flavors
here
a
little
dry
and
i
am
not
fond
of
the
metallic
finsh
otherwise
pretty
solid
brew
this
was
one
of
the
first
alesmiths
i
was
able
to
find
here
in
pa
with
much
excitement
i
opened
the
bottle
shortly
after
getting
it
and
split
it
with
a
friend
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
very
deep
reddish
brown
color
much
darker
than
i
thought
itd
be
the
head
on
it
was
a
very
light
tan
color
with
a
pretty
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
really
nice
earthy
aromas
mixed
with
some
dark
sugary
fruit
aromas
too
the
taste
was
good
its
had
a
really
nice
malt
backbone
to
it
its
on
the
sweeter
side
but
its
subtle
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
had
a
pretty
good
thickness
to
it
overall
if
i
come
across
it
again
one
day
its
worth
picking
up
again
possibly
for
aging
purposes
o
this
did
not
blow
me
away
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
this
one
has
been
on
my
radar
for
a
bit
and
im
glad
i
plopped
down
the
loot
for
it
very
overpriced
for
what
you
getas
with
most
alesmith
products
but
its
great
for
the
style
i
can
see
a
bit
of
benefit
from
some
short
term
aging
although
i
have
no
idea
how
old
the
bottle
i
had
was
which
is
a
real
shame
i
think
a
little
more
wood
and
smoke
flavors
would
be
great
but
as
is
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
made
versions
of
a
wee
heavy
which
is
my
favorite
style
something
to
sip
and
savor
highly
recommended
o
this
is
good
dangerously
drinkable
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
something
about
this
that
keeps
it
from
being
too
drinkable
i
like
the
flavors
very
complex
yet
hits
the
style
on
the
head
just
right
for
me
i
prefer
my
scotch
ales
peaty
and
a
bit
on
the
smokey
malty
side
but
i
like
the
spice
that
this
one
gives
which
add
to
it
md
modest
carbonation
thick
bodied
beer
it
had
a
nice
balance
to
the
beer
wasnt
overly
sweet
and
the
booze
was
barely
noticeable
overall
definitely
recommended
alesmith
fails
to
disappoint
again
this
would
go
brilliantly
with
a
dessert
or
with
a
cigar
as
many
have
pointed
out
ill
pick
this
up
next
time
and
give
that
a
go
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
complex
and
flavorful
but
its
a
touch
too
roasted
tasting
for
my
liking
its
still
a
very
good
beer
but
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
o
a
solid
offering
from
alesmith
here
with
an
outrageously
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
this
ones
like
velvet
going
down
tops
in
its
style
for
sure
this
ones
definitely
worth
going
after
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
maltier
beers
t
a
lot
of
raisin
breadfruitcake
taste
upfront
with
some
delicate
spiciness
a
little
rum
flavor
and
some
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
huge
and
dense
like
taking
a
handful
of
ripe
raisins
and
taking
a
bite
theres
not
much
in
here
that
would
indicate
its
high
abv
except
a
slight
dryness
and
warmness
on
the
finish
and
a
bit
of
a
peatyearthy
taste
thats
left
on
your
tongue
this
is
a
really
incredible
beer
d
just
a
well
done
beer
that
is
dangerously
easy
to
drink
nice
beer
definitely
a
pick
me
up
for
a
cold
winter
night
drink
a
very
nice
beer
and
it
certainly
holds
its
own
not
sure
it
quite
lives
up
to
its
status
for
me
i
would
say
founders
db
beats
it
hands
down
but
they
are
very
different
this
is
much
lighter
and
softer
in
its
flavors
than
db
which
has
more
robust
dark
fruit
profile
neither
are
like
the
true
wee
heavy
styles
from
scotland
traquair
bellhaven
orkney
which
disappoints
me
any
10
750
that
i
can
drink
entirely
by
myself
and
still
walk
a
straight
line
afterwards
is
deficient
in
some
way
the
problem
with
this
scotch
ale
is
that
it
lacks
scotch
aleness
its
thin
in
the
aroma
and
taste
it
has
no
gravitas
no
depth
no
weight
there
is
no
smokiness
there
is
no
umph
its
the
98lb
weakling
that
charles
atlas
warned
you
about
the
bottle
is
pretty
but
they
ought
to
put
more
effort
into
the
contents
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
american
scotch
ale
go
find
a
founders
dirty
bastard
pass
d
drinks
way
too
easy
for
10
doesnt
really
drink
like
a
scotch
ale
i
muscle
my
way
through
an
old
chub
and
i
find
myself
polishing
this
off
far
too
easily
i
suppose
this
falls
into
the
dangerous
category
overly
sweet
and
lacks
the
heavy
sticky
body
i
expect
overall
an
excellent
strong
scotch
ale
d
a
nice
scotch
ale
some
nice
carmale
and
nuts
would
like
to
have
again
this
is
all
alesmith
is
cracked
up
to
be
cheers
an
obvious
standout
of
the
tasting
wee
heavy
is
a
paragon
of
the
scotch
ale
style
sweet
complex
and
incredibly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
the
beer
is
incredibly
easy
drinking
especially
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
my
first
rate
on
ba
after
4
years
as
a
member
this
one
pours
very
dark
brownred
with
an
orangy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
nutty
and
woody
with
lots
of
chocoate
and
a
little
bit
of
raisins
and
molasses
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
much
more
fruit
forward
with
predominately
raisins
and
molasses
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
nuts
and
roasted
malts
the
nuttiness
lasts
throughout
the
mouthfeel
on
this
thing
is
spectactular
very
silky
and
smooth
the
alcohol
is
not
noticed
only
felt
after
the
fact
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
they
should
really
bottle
this
in
some
smaller
bottles
with
some
plaid
on
the
label
because
this
is
the
best
scotch
ale
in
america
by
far
and
i
think
the
best
one
still
available
period
had
high
expectations
still
a
good
sipper
beer
finger
plus
of
moderate

with
many
scattered

causing
some

with
only
few

thick

which
is
not
exactly
typical
for
a
wee

at
times

as
much

a
deeper

through
the
finish
the
earth

murmurs
but
never
clearly
enunciates
the

of
the
flavors
outstrips
its
flaws
in
the
end
appears
to
be
seeking
imperial
wee
heavy
status
d
welldone
all
around
a
superb
example
of
the
style
complex
reasonably
drinkable
and
plenty
dangerous
8oz
of
this
would
be
plenty
shame
it
has
to
come
in
such
a
large
format
one
of
the
better
alesmith
beers
out
there
cant
wait
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
pours
from
the
bottle
a
lush
reddishblack
color
with
a
decent
little
beige
colored
head
aromas
of
roasted
malt
dark
brown
sugar
caramel
and
a
little
smoke
on
the
palate
this
one
is
creamy
and
full
bodied
with
smokey
malt
warming
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
excellent
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
on
the
palate
its
sweet
up
front
with
some
caramel
notes
in
the
midpalate
region
and
follows
it
up
with
nice
malt
presence
and
clean
finish
that
isnt
dry
drinkability
is
high
and
i
really
liked
this
beer
im
very
interested
in
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
beer
now
because
i
think
this
would
take
the
barrel
notes
well
more
wood
more
alcohol
sounds
good
to
me
d
it
drank
really
good
and
is
very
tasty
for
the
style
this
beer
has
definitely
been
above
average
every
time
ive
had
it
and
im
glad
i
have
access
to
it
on
a
daily
for
something
with
such
a
high
abv
a
scotch
ale
that
doesnt
have
a
syrupy
malt
quality
and
still
has
a
broad
latitude
that
is
not
compromised
the
feel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
nice
mild
lace
that
indicates
the
sugar
there
is
quite
a
bit
that
carry
a
multitude
of
other
delicate
esters
color
is
a
mild
color
mahogany
the
head
regenerates
with
each
sip
nose
of
bourbon
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
toastiness
and
honey
the
palate
is
every
aspect
of
that
with
a
pollen
mild
fluff
a
neutral
sweet
of
fig
and
a
warm
throat
the
booze
is
a
tad
noticeable
but
only
mildly
a
wonderful
feel
seriously
good
beer
poured
with
a
large
foamy
frothy
fine
tan
head
that
lasts
and
good

color
is
a
hazy
mahoganey
aroma
is
heavy
volatile
mix
of
malt
peat
dark
ripe

and

flavor
is

with

sweetnessbitterness
balance
that
is

on
along
with
the
earthiness
that
works
great
body
and
carbonation
work
perfectly
together
and
are
full
and
lush

is
like
flavor
with
a
fleeting
sense
of
the
smoke
the
rest
of
the
characteristics
actually
taper
off
rather
quickly
and
smoothly
ending
with
a
fairly
mild
alcohol

the

d
maybe
ive
been
drinking
too
many
big
beers
lately
but
this
doesnt
seem
as
flavorful
as
it
could
be
the
nose
and
taste
are
good
but
could
use
a
little
extra
power
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
the
alcohol
isnt
found
anywhere
in
the
taste
making
this
beer
quite
drinkable
pours
a
very
deep
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
several
fingers
quickly
turn
into
a
slight
lacey
ring
nose
is
quite
complex
with
caramel
brown
sugar
raisins
brown
sugar
miscellaneous
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
similar
but
not
as
strog
nor
as
complex
good
solid
body
wihout
much
heat
drinks
nicely
now
im
looking
forward
to
pulling
out
another
one
in
a
year
or
two
acquired
in
a
trade
served
this
in
a
snifter

brown
almost
black

to

and
a
liberal
dose

bitterness
in
the
end
to
ameliorate
all
that
sweetness
up

mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
watch
out
cause
you
certainly
arent
aware
of
the
abv
this
is
a
very
nice
offering
although
alesmith
seems
to
seldom
miss
they
certainly
didnt
with
this
one
this
beer
in
one
word
paunchy
very
well
balanced
potently
malty
well
worth
a
try
i
really
enjoy
the
straight
forward
and
well
blended
flavors
of
this
brew
backed
by
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
though
my
opinion
might
be
a
little
biased
as
i
am
beginning
to
realize
i
am
quite
fond
of
this
style
pours
a
dark
almost
opaque
mahogany
lots
of
marshmallowy
smooth
tannish
head
and
sticky
lacing
robust
aromas
of
figs
black
cherries
huge
maltiness
a
wisp
of
alcohol
awesome
so
far
flavor
is
enormous
and
maltysweet
right
away
flavor
of
the
barrell
aging
morphs
into
some
roasty
bitterness
and
finishes
off
a
little
bitter
but
delicious
this
is
excellent
and
heavy
beer
still
not
as
good
as
mcewans
but
a
fine
replacement
expensive
at
10
49
for
pint9oz
but
worth
it
find
and
drink
for
thas
is
fookin
grrayt
beeah
i
am
also
willing
to
bet
that
it
will
cellar
very
well
id
give
it
2
years
upright
and
it
should
become
even
deeper
with
smooth
and
mellow
flavors
of
deep
buttery
figs
and
rich
sticky
malt
drinkabilityim
perfectly
happy
just
sipping
this
the
bottle
is
empty
and
my
glass
is
about
two
thirds
full
as
i
write
this
i
assume
the
glass
will
be
empty
after
not
too
much
longer
this
beer
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
mediumsized
sandy
colored
head
and
a
fair
mount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
definitely
indicative
of
a
scotch
ale
the
beer
tastes
pretty
good
and
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
character
alesmith
wee
heavy
is
a
pretty
straight
forward
brew
i
didnt
find
a
lot
of
intricacies
or
intriguing
flavors
here
just
a
basic
plain
scotch
ale
there
is
a
noticeable
warming
alcohol
note
in
the
finish
though
not
overpowering
despite
the
lack
of
complexity
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
pretty
drinkable
especially
given
the
10
abv
overall
a
good
offering
though
certainly
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
scores
really
well
here
for
the
style
inviting
aromas
great
flavors
and
incredibly
smooth
swallow
all
make
for
high
marks
here
will
most
certainly
be
picking
up
more
for
some
good
aging
d
very
very
good
a
good
i
dont
like
beer
beer
di
would
share
this
with
a
friend
for
dessert
or
with
dessert
the
10
abv
is
hidden
well
but
the
density
of
the
beer
makes
it
super
filling
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
with
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
the
carbonation
is
below
average
and
pretty
appropriate
for
the
style
and
size
of
the
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
its
an
excellent
tasting
beer
overall
probably
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
and
another
very
impressive
beer
from
alesmith
very
good
beer
spoton
example
of
the
style
ive
been
consistently
impressed
with
alesmith
this
ones
no
exception
jd
md
full
bodied
and
very
heavy
mouth
feel
carbonation
is
just
strong
enough
to
keep
the
beer
moving
through
the
mouth
smooth
creamy
medium
bodied
and
properly
carbonated
the
alcohol
is
well
disguised
for
10
00
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
have
not
already
drinkability
i
have
been
cellaring
this
bottle
for
three
or
four
years
and
it
is
drinking
beautifully
now
the
alcohol
that
others
have
noted
in
their
reviews
has
toned
down
and
the
complexity
of
the
sweet
flavors
has
increased
a
desirt
sipper
on
roids
this
has
several
flavor
profiles
shinning
through
the
bigness
of
the
beer
warm
but
not
hot
and
pleasing
all
the
while
really
enjoyed
this
one
d
its
a
big
one
an
excellent
example
of
style
this
one
would
age
beautifully
for
years
but
its
great
as
it
is
d
definitely
a
beer
to
seek
out
if
you
enjoy
the
style
kinda
pricey
but
then
everything
from
alesmith
is
i
cant
wait
to
a
taste
one
aged
and
b
enjoy
a
barrelaged
version
would
definitely
love
to
have
more
of
this
drinkability
my
first
beer
from
them
and
wow
is
this
a
winner
this
is
a
nice
and
super
complex
malt
bomb
this
is
a
great
beer
regardless
of
style
i
like
this
a
lot
this
is
one
style
of
beer
that
varies
greatly
from
beer
to
beer
i
thought
this
to
be
a
more
mild
imperial
stout
than
some
of
the
others
ive
tried
in
its
style
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
but
could
probably
do
with
some
aging
to
mellow
things
out
certainly
recommended
though
another
great
brew
from
alesmith
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
very
drinkablenot
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
but
it
is
very
good
none
the
less
d
extremely
drinkable
i
liked
this
one
more
than
the
ba
version
even
though
it
was
more
tame
d
rough
and
strong
just
begging
for
a
hangover
if
you
can
manage
to
drink
more
than
one
the
bottle
i
had
will
probably
be
the
last
one
i
have
great
drinkability
and
the
alcohol
is
only
later
warming
in
the
gut
overall
its
great
but
just
a
tad
too
sweet
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
let
it
sit
longer
to
balance
out
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
bite
of
carbonation
another
great
alesmith
brew
although
it
doesnt
quite
soar
to
the
heights
of
their
world
class
ipa
i
think
they
did
an
excellent
job
on
this
covers
all
the
points
i
look
for
in
the
style
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
complexity
mid
palate
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
immensely
side
notes
i
really
like
this
beer
and
the
style
so
it
works
for
me
i
highly
recommend
letting
this
cellar
for
at
least
6
months
however
i
dont
practice
what
i
preach
its
gone
right
away
for
me
the
abv
is
cleverly
masked
leaving
behind
a
nice
warming
effect
without
the
booziness
a
very
drinkable
pleasant
representation
of
a
scottish
strong
ale
drinkability
the
taste
seem
to
be
just
right
for
me
though
the
alcohol
is
ever
present
ill
split
it
down
the
middle
and
says
it
has
good
drinkability
in
the
next
month
or
soif
that
long
the
drinkability
factor
could
easily
rise
but
im
drinking
it
now
with
some
very
late
summer
like
temps
so
take
that
as
you
will
bottom
line
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
example
of
the
style
and
alesmith
once
again
did
not
let
me
down
a
great
brewery
all
around
dan
excellent
brewrich
toffee
slick
and
super
smooth
this
is
a
hard
one
to
dislike
a
brew
made
for
a
snifter
really
improve
the
drinkability
as
it
stands
the
wee
heavy
taste
is
outstanding
like
i
said
a
lighter
body
would
be
nice
but
i
understand
its
hard
to
get
the
sweetness
without
some
viscosity
overall
alesmith
has
not
let
me
down
again
75cl
bottle
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
maltysweet
aroma
with
caramel
dried
fruits
smoke
and
nuts
the
flavor
is
intense
with
caramel
dries
fruit
smoky
earth
and
just
tons
of
malt
there
are
hops
there
but
good
luck
trying
to
pick
them
out
full
body
with
medium
carbonation
with
small
bubbles
really
good
stuff
a
quite
refined
sipping
beverage
the
balance
makes
it
very
drinkable
for
its
strength
only
marginal
alcohol
is
detected
though
you
feel
it
if
you
drink
to
fast
i
like
this
a
whole
lot
the
only
problem
is
that
alcohol
hits
a
little
hard
hindering
the
drinkability
i
aged
this
a
good
6
months
maybe
could
use
even
a
little
more
id
love
to
try
750
ml
a
darker
brown
pour
than
i
expected
a
thick
cream
colored
head
that
really
hung
around
almost
like
a
guiness
foam
smells
of
burntroast
malt
molasses
brown
sugar
peat
taste
is
a
compliment
of
the
nose
lots
of
malt
toffeecaramel
and
brown
sugarmolasses
some
ash
earthy
peat
not
much
bittering
but
some
booze
and
warmth
going
down
really
liked
the
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
and
almost
creamy
drinkability
seemed
good
though
this
is
a
bit
warming
and
filling
but
that
is
to
be
expected
certainly
deserving
of
the
high
listing
in
the
style
excellent
scotch
ale
deep
and
warm
alesmith
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
around
and
the
wee
heavy
lives
up
to
the
rest
of
the
lineup
it
pours
a
rich
deep
burgundy
without
a
mote
of
haze
the
offwhite
head
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
its
a
pretty
beer
the
aroma
is
thick
with
fruity
malt
flavors
and
warming
alcohol
it
smells
like
dried
apricots
and
plums
mashed
up
with
fine
rum
the
aroma
is
like
a
caramelized
belgian
quad
phenols
and
rich
malt
blend
with
melting
sugar
im
really
not
a
big
fan
of
the
scotch
ale
generally
speaking
but
this
beer
hits
the
malt
flavors
just
right
the
malt
is
chewy
and
thick
with
a
wonderful
warming
alcohol
presence
its
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
and
particularly
with
regard
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
tight
and
dense
khaki
colored
head
very
thick
took
its
time
dissipating
and
left
a
nice
wall
of
lacing
as
it
settled
you
can
feel
the
heavy
as
you
poured
it
the
aroma
is
of
raisins
and
figs
quite
sweet
hints
of
a
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
of
brown
sugar
and
raisins
tobacco
and
roasted
malt
hints
of
sherry
and
mocha
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
profile
the
feel
is
way
full
bodied
nicely
carbonated
yet
smooth
finishes
with
a
roasted
malt
bitterness
wow
wasnt
expecting
this
this
is
a
wee
wee
heavy
almost
stout
like
great
look
great
flavor
profile
great
range
of
flavors
like
to
see
some
smoke
flavors
in
this
but
other
than
that
a
very
excellent
brew
d
a
well
crafted
beer
very
impressive
malty
profile
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
great
beer
medium
to
full
body
is
well
carbonated
great
example
of
the
style
from
alesmith

thanks
for
this
one
harry
i
was
able
to
share
with
several
people
including
milos
and
the
owner
of
the
keaton
mark
all
were
quite
appreciative
so
thanks
a

towards

this

syrupy
certainly
a
sipper
this
was
enjoyed
by
many
so
thanks
again
harry
drinkability
well
everything
is
great
about
this
beer
its
nice
to
look
at
smells
incredible
tastes
even
better
and
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
however
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
to
make
this
something
that
i
would
want
to
try
to
get
through
but
kels
said
it
best
if
im
having
trouble
sleeping
ill
just
crack
into
one
of
these
good
stuff
overall
drinkability
this
is
definitely
everything
i
would
expect
from
a
wee
heavy
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
hangs
in
my
chest
and
is
pleasantly
present
without
being
too
much
to
bear
the
balance
of
the
flavors
couples
nicely
with
the
mild
mouthfeel
notes
this
might
just
be
the
first
alesmith
offering
ive
had
that
didnt
blow
me
away
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
probably
way
too
young
in
fact
it
suffered
the
same
fate
as
the
bottle
of
07
decadence
way
too
hot
and
boozy
this
badboy
needs
a
looong
timeout
in
the
cellar
to
chill
out
a
bit
besides
the
already
complex
flavor
profile
will
only
get
deeper
as
time
passes
right
now
it
is
not
on
point
as
far
as
im
concerned
in
2
or
3
years
however
this
has
the
potential
to
reach
the
summit
of
my
alltime
favorites
its
malty
but
with
big
booze
and
some
light
bitterness
and
hint
of
tart
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
in
the
finish
a
big
different
though
certainly
with
enough
traditional
characteristics
interpretation
of
a
wee
heavy
this
isnt
a
beer
for
every
occasion
but
its
good
enjoyed
this
out
of
one
of
my
thistle
glasses
just
kidding
it
was
from
a
tulip
pours
dark
amber
decent
head
and
some
sticky
lacing
smells
like
a
boozey
malty
blast
like
something
english
and
sweet
plums
very
bready
smell
and
the
taste
echoes
big
and
filling
doughy
sweet
far
sweeter
than
expected
lacking
that
peaty
smokey
sensation
bring
us
some
figgy
pudding
is
what
this
reminds
me
of
as
it
warmed
drinkability
slowed
down
as
it
seemed
to
open
up
a
lot
more
in
thickness
and
gravitas
a
definite
slow
sipper
but
not
a
terrible
one
maybe
i
need
to
try
this
one
fresh
as
it
was
an
older
bottle
d
in
spite
of
abv
this
is
plenty
drinkable
this
poured
a
translucent
dark
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
dark
oak
and
smoke
and
raisin
and
honey
wheat
with
some
roasted
cocoa
beans
it
tasted
like
charred
oak
and
roasted
cocoa
and
barley
with
some
honey
wheat
and
molasses
it
was
thick
with
silky
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
great
malty
flavor
and
fantastic
body
however
the
alcohol
flavor
became
quite
apparent
as
the
beer
warmed
which
made
it
a
bit
less
easy
to
drink
this
wasnt
as
succulent
as
the
other
alesmith
beers
ive
tried
but
it
still
seemed
fitting
for
the
style
i
just
personally
prefer
the
sweeter
malts
rather
than
the
heavier
ones
like
this
this
beer
was
actually
reminiscent
of
immort
ale
with
the
huge
charred
oak
flavor
but
this
was
better
in
every
way
drinkability
alchohol
suggests
some
points
off
here
but
given
the
incredible
flavors
swirling
around
in
this
brew
id
have
a
hard
time
not
downing
one
after
another
one
bottle
of
this
brew
could
be
shared
among
56
people
easily
it
is
very
demanding
but
also
very
rewarding
almost
a
bit
too
much
of
the
malty
goodness
still
it
makes
a
nice
sipper
taste
follows
the
nose
with
lingering
cocoa
and
chocolate
on
the
finish
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
though
well
hidden
on
the
nose
dark
sweet
cherry
and
plum
notes
with
some
warming
nicely
complex
and
with
a
light
effervescent
carbonation
rich
body
initially
which
does
thin
just
a
bit
after
sitting
for
a
while
smooth
and
solid
on
the
feel
and
with
a
solid
drinkability
limited
somewhat
by
the
sweetness
and
hefty
abv
i
dont
pick
up
any
smoke
or
peat
flavors
here
but
this
is
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
with
no
aging

after
going
back
to
the

it
is
clear
as
to
which

is
of

quality
and
just
better
overall
the
price
is
definitely
worth
it
when
in
the
mood
for
a

go

character
note
the
flavors
and
complexity
are
really
highlighted
in
this
beer
as
it
warms
up
do
not
serve
cold
but
perhaps
only
chilled
or
cool
for
most
enjoyability
and
to
highlight
the
best
of
this
brew
this
brew
pours
up
a
dark

poured
into
a

black
with
a

smell
is
very
sweet
lots
of
malted
scents
taste
is
very
sweet
suprisingly
sweet
the
apperence
makes
me
think
this
is
going
to
be
a
thick
heavy
beer
but
its
really
not
very
light
mouthfeel
with
a
little
hint
of
high
alcohol
carbonation
is
perfect
i
really
wish
this
were
available
in
texas
d
probably
good
that
i
shared
the
bottle
but
wish
i
coulda
saved
it
all
for
myself
i
really
enjoy
the
earthy
notes
of
this
style
and
its
a
shame
that
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
more
wee
heavys
out
there
great
stuff
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
barrel
aged
version
d
one
of
the
better
wee
heavys
ive
had
in
recent
memory
one
bottle
is
too
much
for
me
but
would
love
to
split
one
again
some
time
soon
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
from
such
a
far
away
brewery
drinkability
very
well
done
d
fantastic
wee
heavy
and
another
offering
from
alesmith
that
does
not
disappoint
this
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
complex
yet
sweet
and
malty
to
the
core
a
tasty
sipper
without
question
but
the
bottle
for
meself
may
have
been
a
bad
idea
d
the
alcohol
is
present
but
doesnt
have
the
10
burn
i
would
expect
very
tasty
for
cold
nights
drinkability
only
reason
i
didnt
give
it
any
higher
was
the
strength
it
was
so
full
of
flavor
and
had
such
a
kick
that
i
was
barely
able
to
finish
the
bottle
it
was
almost
too
much
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
split
with
a
friend
i
went
to
great
lengths
and
significant
financial
costs
to
show
alesmith
the
meaning
of
support
so
naturally
i
expected
them
to
show
me
the
meaning
of
tasty
masterfully
crafted
beer
and
they
certainly
have
this
wee
heavy
is
far
and
away
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
yet
to
come
across
and
id
be
only
so
happy
to
go
to
the
same
means
to
get
another
bottle
this
really
is
an
astonishing
piece
of
brewing
artistry
mouthfeeldrinkability
on
the
thin
side
the
carbonation
lays
low
due
in
part
to
the
high
abv
but
allows
the
flavors
to
unravel
a
real
treat
especialy
for
when
the
weather
gets
chilly
thanks
to
epseja
for
sharing
this
with
me
an
interesting
beer
reminiscent
in
some
respects
to
a
dark
tripel
with
less
yeast
influence
delicious
drinkability
a
pretty
solid
brew
and
a
big
bold
large
wee
heavy
the

is
wellhidden
and
integrated
into
this
one
and
though
its
a
little
uneven
and
too
spicy
the
array
of
flavors
and
aromas
here
is
nice
pretty
complex
authentic
and
all
in
all
solid
its
no
speedway
stout
which
i
think
i
said
about
the
last
alesmith
i
had
that
wasnt
the
speedway
stout
heh
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
d
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
for
the
first
few
sips
even
on
a
small
pour
i
thought
that
a
little
was
enough
pours
an
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
high
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
meaty
like
a
savory
marrow
well
salted
with
some
notes
of
toasted
grain
and
dried
fruit
the
taste
is
sweet
starting
off
with
biscuit
and
moving
into
pear
and
prosciutto
finishing
with
an
edge
thats
salty
bitter
and
highly
alcoholic
the
carbonation
is
light
but
present
and
the
body
is
full
and
viscous
its
chewy
but
tasty
enough
that
you
keep
going
for
another
bite
so
to
speak
a
more
than
adequate
representation
of
the
style
and
then
some
full
rounded
flavors
texturally
balanced
and
deceiving
at
10
abv
a
perfect
sipper
for
a
cold
winter
night
the
body
is
closer
to
moderate
than
full
some
residuals
really
leave
this
boarder
line
though
carbonation
is
light
but
leaves
a
creamy
feel
overall
a
fantastic
beer
some
minor
off
notes
but
one
of
the
best
wee
heavys
i
have
ever
had
despite
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
i
thought
it
to
be
a
great
scotch
ale
due
to
the
decently
high
alcohol
content
and
filling
nature
of
the
beer
i
would
only
be
able
to
drink

nose
was
malty
sweet
caramel
molasses
dak
fruit
roasty
boozy
with
a
suggestion
of
hops
detectable
in
the
background
taste
consistent
with
nose
complexity
of
scents
translates
into
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
consistent
effervescence
throughout
the
quaff
and
a
light
alcohol
burn
and
hops
bittering
detectable
towards
the
finish
definitely
a
big
beer
that
lets
you
know
it
enjoyed
sipping
this
over
the
course
of
an
hour
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
yet
another
great
brew
from
alesmith
this
really
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
the
barrel
aged
version
pours
a
lightly
hazed
dark
reddish
brown
huge
and
thick
tan
head
forms
very
sticky
leaves
a
ton
of
lacing
on
the
glass
and
settles
to
a
medium
ring
great
retention
smell
is
nice
sweet
brown
sugar
iron
lots
of
fruit
strawberries
and
raisins
vanilla
touch
of
roast
quite
bready
some
caramel
nice
taste
is
similar
toffee
and
iron
up
front
bread
some
brown
sugar
yeast
strawberries
and
melons
alcohol
raisins
very
malty
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
nicely
made
wee
heavy
not
as
full
bodied
as
i
would
like
but
quite
nice
thanks
russ
notes
as
time
went
on
it
started
to
hit
me
how
similar
this
beer
is
to
gulden
draak
and
not
just
because
i
used
my
tulip
glass
really
though
the
malty
sweetness
and
nectar
syrupy
mouthfeel
were
very
reminiscent
of
that
at
15
99
per
750
ml
bottle
i
believe
that
it
is
more
expensive
than
gulden
draak
at
least
around
here
so
i
would
more
likely
opt
for
the
latter
this
is
a
great
beer
none
the
less
and
everyone
should
try
it
full
bodied
assertive
and
bold
a
savoring
sharing
sipper
really
tasty
but
no
attempt
to
hide
the
booze
would
be
interested
to
see
what
happened
to
it
after
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
my
brother
found
the
booze
overwhelming
and
left
me
the
chore
of
draining
the
majority
of
the
bottle
i
enjoyed
it
was
up
to
the
task
but
it
took
a
while
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
little
that
is
noted
integrates
well
into
the
beer
overall
although
somewhat
eccentric
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
good
balanced
and
very
nice
great
malty
depth
one
of
the
best
american
examples
of
the
style
will
never
get
tired
of
drinking
this
d
very
good
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
pours
dark
mahogany
with
a
thick
tan
head
nutty
smoky
aroma
with
smoe
caramel
the
taste
is
phenomenal
toasty
malts
and
buttescotch
with
a
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
finish
is
creamy
and
sweet
one
of
the
first
scotch
ales
ive
had
and
easily
one
of
the
best
just
an
awesome
beer
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
brew
d
easy
sipper
here
the
scotch
taste
is
not
overbearing
the
woody
tones
keep
it
interesting
and
the
10
is
very
well
hidden
drinkability
is
high
its
tasty
a
little
boozey
thick
and
malty
how
could
you
not
like
it
all
in
all
this
ale
was
rich
in
flavor
full
bodied
and
not
too
heavy
on
the
tounge
its
high
abv
and
ease
of
drinkability
makes
me
kinda
wonder
about
pounding
this
stuff
back
id
hafta
say
i
and
my
buddy
as
well
was
pretty
impressed
but
this
brew
salud
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
wee
heavy
ive
ever
tasted
its
big
and
complex
yet
very
drinkable
another
great
brew
from
alesmith
alesmith
wee
heavy
is
a
huge
beer
with
so
much
going
on
in
it
its
quite
hot
though
and
doesnt
quite
have
the
body
worthy
of
a
knife
and
fork
definitely
give
it
a
try
as
anything
from
alesmith
is
always
worth
it
top
notch
stuff
nothing
more
to
say
other
than
you
should
absolutely
buy
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
i
owe
abankovich
a
huge
thank
you
for
the
tif
winning
package
quite
generous
to
say
the
least
silky
powerful
finish
that
leaves
notes
of
coffee
and
peat
smoke
along
with
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
edge
unbelievable
wee
heavy
i
still
have
awesome
memories
of
drinking
local
fresh
wee
heavies
in
scotland
but
honestly
none
of
them
actually
tasted
this
good
overall
an
incredible
beer
i
was
suprised
by
the
goodness
of
this
beer
you
should
definitely
try
this
if
you
like
good
beer
d
will
definately
have
this
beer
again
very
nice
loved
it
dark
brown
maybe
black
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
on
a
normal
pour
reasons
to
stick
with
my
duvel
glass
smell
i
always
seem
to
get
way
better
smells
off
that
glass
even
though
i
have
a
huge
glassware
connection
anyway
barely
getting
some
slightly
sweet
smells
nothing
huge
kinda
disappointed
there
but
im
really
thinking
its
the
glassware
will
try
in
another
glass
when
i
finish
the
bottle
taste
is
really
sweet
upfront
and
then
as
it
washes
over
my
tongue
it
gets
really
wet
and
sweeter
at
the
back
as
it
goes
over
the
bitter
areas
weird
getting
some
ethanol
now
both
in
the
throat
and
lips
slightly
noticeable
but
i
think
as
its
warming
up
its
really
starting
to
come
out
some
really
mild
bittering
hops
in
the
aftertaste
a
great
balance
on
this
one
with
malts
and
hops
deeper
down
getting
way
better
smells
great
solid
lacing
down
the
glass
and
head
retention
is
there
getting
the
alcohol
in
the
nose
picking
up
the
sweet
malts
pours
dark
brown
and
red
with
a
nice
tan
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
very
nice
carmel
malts
alcohol
roasted
nuts
and
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
again
dominated
by
the
malt
but
very
enjoyable
there
is
also
a
nice
kick
of
alcohol
throughout
the
flavor
finishes
with
a
subtle
but
nice
hint
of
green
apples
wee
heavy
is
really
unlike
anything
else
nothing
has
such
a
nice
balance
of
carmel
malt
hops
and
alcohol
i
will
be
looking
for
this
again
pours
a
deep
and
sexy
mahogany
color
frothy
sandcolored
head
piles
high
and
fades
somewhat
slowly
leaves
behind
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
huge
smokey
malts
spicy
alcohol
some
vanilla
and
caramel
velvety
caramel
taste
dark
fruits
lots
of
raisin
spicy
alcohol
almost
an
oak
taste
in
there
more
vanilla
this
is
decadent
creamy
mouthfeel
enticing
warming
alcohol
carbonation
is
incredibly
smooth
an
excellent
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
youd
want
to
drink
in
a
dark
library
surrounded
by
leather
and
old
books
i
dont
know
if
that
makes
sense
and
i
dont
care
d
great
scotch
ale
delicious
and
highly
recommended
ages
amazingly
d
thanks
to
the
folks
at
belmont
station
for
recommending
this
to
my
wife
back
in
december
its
a
damn
good
wee
heavy
thinking
back
i
may
have
only
had
this
once
or
twice
before
even
then
it
was
probably
a
small
festival
sample
i
can
attest
it
goes
well
with
grilled
fish
and
later
now
works
just
fine
on
its
own
a
little
booziness
and
an
overall
high
abv
cuts
drinkability
but
only
a
little
definitely
worth
seeking
out
md
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
a
bit
drying
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
velvety
texture
decent
drinkability
for
such
a
big
beer
a
sipper
and
it
could
use
some
balancing
in
the
taste
which
probably
come
from
extended
cellaring
this
bottle
is
maybe
68
months
so
maybe
1218
months
would
be
best
drinkability
its
delicious
nutritious
and
taste
like
alcohol
this
will
get
you
all
sorts
of
fudged
up
high
alcohol
enjoy
if
your
team
is
losing
a
game
i
cant
say
i
like
the
drying
quality
too
much
and
wish
it
were
a
bit
thicker
but
for
the
most
part
its
a
well
crafted
tasty
ass
wee
heavy
ill
get
some
more
some
day
for
sure
then
have
some
fresh
and
some
aged
2
years
as
noted
by
the
brewers
notes
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
its
very
rich
on
the
heavy
side
of
wee
for
sure
still
its
smooth
and
well
made
with
the
high
abv
largely
unobtrusive
mainly
just
some
heat
in
the
belly
while
alesmith
comes
through
as
usual
its
not
exactly
my
ideal
perhaps
to
much
anticipation
im
hoping
this
will
further
round
out
and
gain
more
depth
with
age
this
is
a
delicious
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
richness
excellent
version
of
a
style
i
really
like
d
big
thanks
to
the
insanely
generous
abankovich
for
this
treat
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
oh
and
where
the
hell
is
the
9
5
abv
i
couldnt
find
it
bottom
line
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
to
have
this
beer
barrel
aged
i
might
lose
my
mind
this
one
was
pretty
big
smell
was
initially
strong
of
tootsie
rolls
and
dark
chocolate
eventually
dark
fruits
came
out
the
taste
was
different
almost
no
hop
character
other
than
the
what
is
supposed
to
be
there
smokey
and
silky
nice
body
though
somewhat
one
dimensional
could
have
used
some
more
chocolate
character
perhaps
a
nicely
complex
beer
that
will
benefit
from
aging
i
will
visit
this
beer
again
not
a
fan
of
wee
heavy
or
scottish
ales
but
this
was
beyond
good
pured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
dirty
white
head
that
was
very
fluffy
the
nose
was
very
compex
i
could
smell
caramel
sugar
dried
fruit
vanilla
and
heavy
malts
taste
was
superb
complex
and
better
than
any
wee
heavy
i
have
ever
had
it
really
matched
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
malty
brown
sugar
came
out
and
so
did
the
thick
caramel
and
maybe
even
molasses
drinks
very
easy
for
the
abv
style
a
little
too
much
hops
profile
for
the
style
dryness
kind
of
slows
you
down
too
a
good
beer
just
a
bit
off
style
i
do
expect
more
out
of
alesmith
though
i
expected
more
caramel
peat
less
hops
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
its
very
sweet
and
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
overall
this
was
interesting
worth
a
try
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
curiosity
something
tells
me
i
would
enjoy
it
more
if
it
was
aged
for
a
while
at
this
point
in
its
life
it
wasnt
overally
impressive

and
gets
better

better
with
each
sip
ok
i
know
this
is
a
scotch
ale
and
a
scotch
shouldnt
finish
with
big
bitter
but
delicious
is
delicious
and
if
alesmith
wants
to
make
a
dellicious
scoth
ale
with
a
bitter
finish
im
good
with
that
overall
i
thought
this
was
really
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
in
the
style
i
am
just
starting
to
get
around
to
all
the
big
alesmith
beers
and
this
was
top
notch
i
am
really
enjoying
this
one
and
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
wee
heavy
this
is
a
must
try
well
hell
its
a
must
try
anyway
for
the
fullness
of
body
this
one
drinks
especially
well
finishing
clean
yet
leaving
a
thin
oily
coating
intriguing
for
the
style
with
more
depth
than
i
expected
and
some
evolution
of
flavor
as
you
go
noticing
various
caramel
bread
and
fruit
flavors
alcohol
strength
is
to
be
expected
but
somewhat
of
a
detraction
from
overall
drinkability
d
9
5
would
be
the
only
limiting
factor
for
drinkability
on
a
cold
night
my
wife
and
i
split
this
and
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavors
came
out
much
more
enjoyable
let
this
beer
warm
up
a
malt
lovers
dream
highly
recommended
this
is
one
strong
wee
heavy
it
pushes
the
boundaries
of
the
style
with
its
raw
strength
my
one
nitpick
is
it
isnt
as
drinkable
as
other
wee
heavys
ive
had
another
alesmith
delight
pours
dark
brown
with
light
head
aroma
of
fruits
malt
taste
comes
on
big
and
sweet
tofee
molasses
caramel
blended
nicely
with
roasted
malt
giving
way
to
a
nice
lingering
smokey
bitter
hops
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
warming
a
big
delicious
beverage
with
a
good
amount
of
punch
onell
do
ya
but
youll
want
more
drop
it
like
its
hot
d
this
full
flavored
and
roasted
malt
notes
has
a
great
flavor
combined
with
nice
smoky
qualities
and
no
bandaid
flavor
the
hops
and
alcohol
balance
each
other
nicely
and
let
the
malt
do
most
of
the
talking
until
it
warms
up
a
bit
d
a
great
endofthenight
sipper
i
paired
it
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
dried
apricots
for
a
great
match
poured
into
a
snifter
blackish
brown
color
with
a
huge
sticky
tan
head
lots
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
with
some
peaty
raisin
flavor
is
really
rich
and
decadent
huge
caramel
maltiness
with
some
sugary
boozy
dark
fruit
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
it
will
catch
up
and
hinder
the
drinkability
similarly
the
thickness
and
sweetness
are
a
bit
much
the
further
you
get
through
a
750
ml
bottle
in
all
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
the
end
really
dissapointed
me
i
cant
get
past
the
metallic
and
strong
alcohol
flavors
before
the
nice
chocolate
finish
i
will
get
this
one
again
and
see
how
it
ages
as
for
drinkability
well
i
finished
the
entire
750
by
myself
with
no
troubles
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
could
probably
drink
the
whole
750
myself
and
thats
pretty
damn
good
for
a
wee
heavy
d
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
warm
so
you
have
to
take
it
slow
this
beer
is
a
malt
bomb
but
does
not
cross
the
line
into
a
cloying
syrup
it
pours
a
deep
amber
red
with
a
little
head
it
smells
of
molasses
caramel
and
biscuity
malt
the
taste
is
more
of
the
smell
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
but
expect
a
maltbomb
pours
out
of
the
silver
foiled
champagne
bottle
a
very
deep
amber
color
the
tan
head
floats
atop
the
brew
and
hangs
on
as
it
slowly
diminishes
the
smell
is
awesome
a
sweet
and
smoky
aroma
attacks
the
nose
there
is
a
strong
scent
of
caramel
and
fresh
pumpkin
noticeable
there
is
also
some
berrylike
esters
right
when
the
sniff
starts
the
taste
is
also
amazing
a
big
malty
sweetness
hits
the
tongue
and
swallows
the
taste
buds
a
slight
alcohol
taste
is
apparent
but
not
overwhelming
and
warms
the
throat
as
it
descends
a
roasted
flavor
complements
the
caramel
taste
first
noticed
in
the
smell
the
aftertaste
is
full
of
smoky
bitterness
that
i

wee
heavy

thick
and
syrupy
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
tickle
the
tongue
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
i

i
might

another

cloudy

ruby
reddark
brown
color
with
decent
white
head
that
goes
fast
and
doesnt
leave
any
tremendous
lace
but
there
is
some
there
the
nose
is
very
much
dark
fruit
and
some
malt
sugar
taste
follows
the
nose
malty
as
hell
early
but
dark
fruits
and
spice
come
out
not
a
ton
of
scotch
ale
flavors
here
but
they
are
present
i
think
they
are
just
overshadowed
by
the
abv
as
it
warms
they
come
out
more
but
so
do
the
malts
kind
of
chocolatey
almost
malt
flavor
maybe
roasted
sugary
finish
with
a
little
nice
hop
bite
this
is
a

wee
heavy
mouthfeel

i
like
in

style
however
you
can
defenitely
feel
this
beer
in
your
mouth
drinkability
is
good
for
a

of

strength

i
have
had

overpriced
brew
displays
a
mahogany
tone
the
pour
prompts
a
tan
head
of
short
stature
and
duration
which
evolves
into
sloppy
lace
streamers
carbonation
is
difficult
to
assess
due
to
the
rich
intensity
of
the
colour
the
nose
is
heavy

dark

if
you
want
to
toss
cliche
about
like

i
choose
such
description
the
taste
is
outshined
at
first
by
the
rich

thick
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
is
nearly
outrageous
thick

the

here
the
price
is
a
bit
suspect
to
me
i
am
not
saying
that
this
is
not
a
good
brew
i
just
find
fault
with
the
fact
that
it
is
twice
as
expensive
as
other
comparable
within
100
ml
bomber

offerings
that
are
at

in

with
this
i
will
buy

exactly

this

i
think
part
of
the
bitterness
comes
from
that
traditional
smokey
flavor
which
is
sort
of
the
signature
quality
of
a
good
scotch
ale
not
immediately
offputting
for
me
with
a
bit
more
alcohol
and
thats
the
only
drawback
to
this
otherwise
perfect
wee
heavy
the
alcohol
needs
to
be
more
restrained
and
that
goes
to
fermentation
really
sweet
toffee
leaving
echoes
that
resonate
for

in

to
another
quiet
evening
exploring
its

again

this
is

i
have
had

another
great
product
of

barrel
program
o
overall
this
beer
is
a
killer
drink
i
cant
imagine
how
good
this
batch
will
be
aged
o
a
hard
one
for
me
to
drink
only
because
i
dont
enjoy
it
as
much
when
the
bourbon
overwhelms
everything
in
the
base
beer
i
can
definitely
see
how
some
people
can
really
enjoy
this
but
its
really
not
for
me
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
mild
heat
lingering
bb
o
not
always
does
barrelaging
a
beer
make
it
better
but
it
certainly
does
in
the
case
of
alesmiths
wee
heavy
good
but
uninteresting
and
frankly
quite
plain
the
normal
version
of
this
beer
features
the
same
alcohol
percentage
hidden
behind
distant
maltiness
while
the
barrelaged
version
features
forward
alcohol
at
the
same
percentage
that
manages
to
bring
out
its
underlying
maltiness
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruit
are
more
apparent
in
the
face
of
bourbon
barrelinduced
vanilla
oak
and
well
bourbon
and
all
conglomerate
for
a
party
in
the
mouth
thats
quite
extraordinary
but
not
quite
worth
the
40
price
tag
alesmiths
barrelaged
wee
heavy
is
a
fantastic
beer
but
if
i
saw
it
on
the
shelves
again
at
the
same
price
i
wouldnt
think
twice
about
passing
on
it
the
beer
equivalent
of
comfort
food
its
rich
velvety
texture
and
satisfyingly
sweet
undertones

bottle
o
great
beer
the
barrel
treatment
on
this
one
is
perfect
and
it
really
adds
to
the
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
i
would
drink
this
beer
any
day
of
the
week
i
feel
like
if
this
was
done
with
a
lighter
wee
heavy
and
less
barrel
aging
time
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
much
more
its
certainly
a
delicacy
sweet
savory
boozy
a
slow
sipper
and
a
night
cap
all
the
way
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
like
its
unnecessarily
overdone
and
it
would
benefit
from
curbing
some
of
the
intensity
just
a
little
bit
still
a
very
very
solid
brew
though
jd
when
tasted
this
one
came
up
a
bit
short
leaving
me
wanting
the
full
flavor
and
body
of
the
usual
wee
heavy
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
mind
you
but
the
standard
alesmith
wee
heavy
does
set
a
high
bar
i
have
always
appreciated
a
booze
hot
mouthfeel
but
this
one
comes
out
light
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
it
is
an
improvement
upon
the
original
a
barrel
does
not
universally
lead
to
better
o
not
much
more
to
say
this
is
delicious
and
im
going
to
enjoy
savoring
this
over
the
course
of
the
next
hour
or
so

had
this
next

flavor
on

there
is

on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and

this
is
a

and
warm
its
a
lovely
beer
i
realize
that
im
sorta
repeating
myself
here
but
the
rich
malt
flavor
of
the
base
beer
is
impeccably
blended
into
the
bourbon
barrel
flavors
alesmith
is
one
of
the
very
best
at
barrel
aging
and
it
very
much
shows
in
this
beer
feel
is
smooth
and
full
never
gets
too
sticky
or
boozey
this
is
just
a
phenomenal
beer
on
a
sidenote
i
dont
think
it
will
get
any
better
with
age
this
beer
is
drinking
wonderfully
right
now
this
didnt
live
up
to
the
legend
of
the
ba
speedway
that
id
built
up
in
my
mind
but
thats
my
own
couchissue
really
good
beer
that
im
really
happy
to
have
tried
bottle
2009
vintage
poured
a
clear
medium
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
offwhite
foamy
head
with
some
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
light
toffee
notes
and
light
butterscotch
and
some
wood
with
a
light
whiskey
finish
taste
is
also
a
good
mix
between
balanced
notes
of
butterscotch
and
caramel
with
some
notes
of
wood
and
whiskey
and
light
residuals
sugar
notes
i
though
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
with
medium
carbonation
overall
very
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
alesmith
hands
down
o
overall
pretty
good
but
nothing
mind
blowing
a
joy
another
great
ba
beer
from
alesmith
with
the
exception
of
ba
speedway
i
have
yet
to
taste
one
of
their
ba
brews
that
isnt
outstanding
drinkability
its
hard
not
to
both
respect
this
beer
but
also
be
a
little
disappointed
in
it
all
at
once
ive
half
a
mind
to
try
and
get
my
hand
on
a
2009
bottle
to
see
what
this
ones
like
at
the
height
of
its
power
should
have
tried
to
do
a
sidebyside
because
the
remnants
of
a
great
beer
are
definitely
here
as
it
stands
this
ones
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
but
in
a
way
thats
demanding
of
appreciation
crack
em
if
youve
got
em
folks
drink
this
was
my
last
beer
of
the
night
and
i
was
blown
away
by
everything
there
this
was
definitely
in
the
top
5
of
the
night
a
simple
amazing
beer
with
layers
upon
layers
of
flavors
o
incredible
i
am
so
fortunate
to
be
able
to
be
drinking
this
amazing
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
so
much
barrel
character
so
derrricious
if
i
had
to
choose
something
bad
to
say
about
ba
wee
heavy
id
say
the
barrels
take
over
the
base
beer
just
a
bit
too
much
but
hot
damn
this
is
a
tasty
brew
sweet
oaky
bourbony
and
incredibly
smooth
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
because
this
is
always
what
i
hope
a
ba
barleywine
is
going
to
taste
like
even
though
its
not
one
gotta
hand
it
to
alesmith
they
do
barrel
aging
right
o
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
although
the
base
beer
does
not
show
through
very
much
in
the
flavor
that
being
said
this
is
nowhere
near
the
bourbon
bomb
that
the
last
vintage
was
o
a
good
beer
though
not
extremely
complex
stil
its
quite
tasty
and
still
bourbony
after
nearly
3
years
big
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
sharing
this
brew
750ml
capped
and
foiled

2009
vintage
bottle

pours
a
deep
mahogany
almost
brown
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
nose
expresses
bourbon
light
smoke
and
a
buttery
character
all
on
malty
backbone
taste
consistent
with
nose
some
vinous
notes
and
a
light
acidity
are
also
revealed
as
well
as
a
trace
of
maple
syrup
the
buttery
character
present
in
the
nose
also
manifests
itself
in
the
flavor
profile
theres
also
more
of
a
barrel
presence
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
still
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
texture
this
beer
could
use
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
in
my
opinion
what
a
great
brew
thats
both
easy
drinking
and
complex
that
said
i
cant
say
that
the
ba
version
is
better
than
the
standard
which
i
also
really
enjoy
however
its
quite
different
although
nonetheless
enjoyable
owow
unexpected
treat
almost
perfect
pours
a
gorgeous
yellowed
brown
brown
with
a
nice
tint
not
really
any
head
smells
bourbon
heavy
and
a
bit
boozy
really
nice
nose
tastes
boozy
and
malty
the
bourbon
is
fairly
subtle
on
the
tongue
compared
to
the
nose
smooth
and
rich
quite
good
overall
despite
the
huge
bourbon
and
booze
on
the
aroma
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
mean
i
almost
dont
consider
this
beer
anymore
because
the
bourbon
completely
overpowers
the
wee
heavy
base
i
dont
think
this
style
of
beer
lends
itself
to
barrelaging
as
well
as
barleywines
and
stouts
but
thats
my
two
sense
i
am
torn
on
this
beer
because
while
it
was
tasty
i
could
have
easily
just
poured
a
glass
of
bourbon
and
added
a
dash
of
the
original
wee
heavy
with
similar
results
probably
not
worth
the
time
effort
or
cost
it
took
to
procure
and
i
do
not
need
to
revisit
anytime
soon
o
might
be
at
its
peak
very
well
done
for
the
style
but
seems
to
get
forgotten
because
it
is
a
wee
heavy
and
not
a
stout
look
and
nose
were
excellent
but
the
mouth
dropped
off
a
lot
m
mediumheavy
body
carbonation
keeps
it
from
being
too
cloyingly
thick
really
good
beer
i
like
what
the
barrels
did
tried

cheers
thanks

and
happy

dude
overall
the
beer
is
very
tasty
and
smells
very
nice
normally
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
a
beer
being
a
bit
hot
the
beer
seems
to
be
not
substantial
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
barrel
in
many
ways
i
think
that
this
beer
was
diminished
by
being
barrel
aged
o
nice
wee
heavy
nice
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
cherrys
in
the
nose
the
wood
i
did
not
find
in
the
taste
or
smell
o
decadent
and
a
slow
sipper
enjoyed
by
all
md
pour
looked
flat
but
it
had
good
carbonation
pretty
thickbody
feels
great
bourbon
adds
a
nice
sweet
element
to
the
base
solid
beer
a
sipper
as
the
booze
is
pretty
noticeable
surprisingly
mellow
at
the
same
time
the
extremely
low
carbonation
also
works
really
well
in
this
o
really
like
this
one
a
lot
flavorful
smooth
easy
to
drink
shocked
as
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
guess
the
barrelaging
really
paid
off
in
this
one
o
just
fantastic
stuff
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
any
day
though
after
having
the
previous
release
last
year
id
say
not
the
best
candidate
for
aging
d
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
was
glad
to
try
it
i
would
still
like
to
try
an
older
vintage
but
i
hear
theyre
becoming
oxidized
def
would
try
this
one
again
2009
vintage
pours
with
pretty
low
carbonation
looks
an
even
brown
color
with
a
touch
of
tan
head
looks
fine
the
smell
is
big
bourbon
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
wood
with
just
a
touch
of
smoked
malts
bourbon
oak
and
smokedroasted
malt
blend
nicely
finishes
a
bit
boozy
in
flavor
not
heat
and
with
some
oak
seems
like
it
could
use
some
time
to
round
out
the
finish
lower
carbonation
and
medium
body
enjoyable
ba
scotch
ale
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
still
quite
good
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
heavier
mouthfeel
and
more
bourbon
i
got
to
try
2
oz
s
or
so
of
an
06
vintage
a
few
months
ago
and
really
liked
it
and
remembered
it
having
more
bourbon
than
this
newer
batch
still
a
good
beer
but
not
their
best
ba
beer
or
vintage
d
the
fact
this
is
not
a
ris
really
adds
to
its
drinkability
i
could
drink
many
more
of
these
somewhat
heavy
body
as
befits
a
drink
this
flavorful
and
decent
carbonation
even
after
its
time
in
the
barrel
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
always
look
for
from
now
on
this
and
the
ba
speedway
overall
if
theres
one
thing
i
know
about
alesmith
besides
the
fact
that
they
dont
make
a
bad
beer
its
that
they
know
their
way
around
a
barrel
a
very
well
done
beer
and
one
thats
well
worth
a
shot
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
best
aged
beer
flavor
is
really
quite
exceptional
with
a
really
nice
barrel
character
really
smooth
and
mellow
beautiful
warmth
in
the
finish
coming
from
the
alcohol
slight
sweetness
comes
alongside
the
dark
fruit
character
medium
body
and
quite
complex
good
carbonation
ive
been
waiting
quite
a
long
time
to
try
this
one
and
it
certainly
was
not
a
disappointment
d
a
very
enjoyable
experience
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
happen
across
this
brew
you
will
most
certainly
enjoy
it
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
really
creamy
there
is
minimal
peat
in
the
midpalate
and
rounds
out
nicely
to
finish
the
beer
the
lead
off
is
a
little
sweet
and
very
bourbony
it
is
not
very
hot
just
a
nice
beer
all
around
the
flavors
walk
that
line
between
tasting
like
liquor
and
being
liquor
i
would
have
more
of
this
if
that
were
possible
as
it
is
now
ill
just
have
to
lean
on
my
memory
dthis
is
very
sugary
and
rather
thick
and
creamy
hints
of
oxidation
and
nothing
subtle
to
it
seems
to
be
to
style
but
the
flavors
seem
slightly
jumbled
together
but
not
bad
i
dont
think
this
style
is
really
for
me
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
heavily
oxidized
and
is
way
past
its
prime
regardless
of
my
own
tastes
excellent
beer
at
this
point
the
2005
vintage
is
drinking
very
nicely
very
mellow
and
very
rounded
now
would
be
a
good
time
to
open
a
bottle
i
point
this
out
to
the
multitudes
of
you
with
bottles
waiting
to
be
opened
with
that
said
given
the
minimal
oxidation
it
could
probably
handle
another
couple
of
years
but
i
dont
necessarily
see
it
improving
either
creamy
body
has
a
delicate
carbonation
very
nice
i
wish
i
had
the
patience
to
save
some
beers
a
few
years
what
an
awesome
beer
if
this
wasnt
so
rare
id
definitely
seek
it
out
again
easy
to
drink
for
what
it
is
thanks
to
urwatuh8
for
a
great
trade
involving
this
brew
pours
a
maroonbrowncoke
color
with
tan

pretty
significant
carbonation
for
a
ba
brew
is
this
force
carbed
smell
is
sweet
bourbony
tangy
slightly
sour
shriveled
raisins
and
plums
and
any
other
fruit
that
people
dry
up
you
can
definitely
tell
this
is
oxidizing
its
a
2006
bottle
so
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
flavor
more
of
the
above
this
is
a
sweet
beverage
some
brown
sugar
chocolate
and
toffee
also
present
themselves
body
is
mediumthick
with
lightmedium
carbonation
tasty
brew
but
i
doubt
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
acquire
another
bottle
of
this
in
the
future
nice
to
have
tried
it
though
appearance
is
a
murky
maroon
and
brown
color
very
still
obviously
low
carbonation
and
a
very
thin
off
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
absolutely
nothing
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
very
rich
and
port
like
strong
notes
from
the
barrel
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
and
occasionally
raisins
oak
chocolate
etc
also
assert
themselves
body
is
lighter
side
of
medium
with
fine
soft
carbonation
with
a
long
lasting
slightly
dry
raisin
and
bourbon
finish
flavor
begins
with
pleasant
bourbon
sweetness
before
the
base
beer
with
rich
malt
toffee
raisin
etc
enters
and
lingers
into
the
finish
slightly
astringent
but
very
little
alcohol
presence
or
burn
a
very
pleasant
sipper
mildly
complex
and
delightfully
balanced
however
maybe
a
little
past
its
prime
as
its
lost
the
robustness
and
complexity
of
the
regular
wee
heavy
drinkability
is
solid
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
this
could
be
a
world
class
beer
if
there
was
either
more
body
or
a
better
level
of
carbonation
but
as
it
is
that
glaring
weakness
has
a
negative
effect
on
the
taste
and
overall
enjoyment
nonetheless
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
and
one
im
glad
i
had
the
privilege
to
consume
d
surprisingly
drinkable
it
was
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
id
have
no
trouble
drinking
more
of
it
and
enjoying
it
slightly
hot
medium
body
with
a
nice
silky
viscous
malt
presence
with
lots
of
chocolate
roasted
coffee
bean
burnt
toast
caramel
and
licorice
very
roasty
with
subtle
hops
and
a
huge
bourbon
presence
that
is
slightly
hot
and
somewhat
dominates
the
flavor
it
isnt
too
overpowering
however
allowing
the
other
notes
to
shine
slight
tannis
and
a
heavy
oak
and
vanilla
presence
absolutely
delicious
highly
recommended
d
a
huge
bourbony
beer
that
has
held
up
well
these
years
drinkability
abv
is
burny
and
kind
of
high
definitely
a
sipper
the
maltiness
doesnt
seem
especially
well
blended
with
the
woodiness
and
the
alcohol
but
still
pretty
solid
i
think
i
actually
prefer
the
regular
wee
heavy
from
them
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
this
beer
is
exceptionally
caramelly
rich
and
nottoosweet
the
barrelaging
complements
the
earthy
quality
of
the
style
it
adds
an
additional
dimension
that
breaks
up
the
heaviness
it
is
strangely
tart
and
bright
in
the
taste
which
is
probably
due
in
part
to
the
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
the
carbonation
also
keeps
the
stickiness
from
weighing
down
the
beer
and
it
finishes
nearly
clean
this
beer
almost
reminds
me
more
of
a
wine
in
the
way
it
drinks
a
very
highly
alcoholic
wine
the
first
bottle
i
had
was
stored
in
a
cupboard
so
the
oxidation
was
quite
pronounced
but
the
second
bottle
i
drank
on
1010
was
my
own
and
had
been
stored
at
55
degrees
since
the
release
oxidation
was
still
a
bit
too
strong
to
be
complimentary
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
drink
it
now
if
you
have
it
d
damn
good
i
love
the
non
ba
version
and
i
now
love
this
one
too
i
would
have
no
problem
taking
care
of
a
bottle
by
myself
d
definitely
a
slow
sipper
tasty
though
the
other
night
i
split
a
bottle
of
the
09
vintage
that
i
received
from
peteinsd
with
some
friends
very
briefly
this
was
excellent
fruity
with
raisins
port
honey
bourbon
and
vanilla
the
balance
between
the
base
beer
and
the
barrels
is
exceptionally
done
here
fantastic

d
one
glass
was
enough
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
id
be
interested
in
trying
a
new
batch
but
this
seems
to
be
on
the
decline
d
i
could
sip
this
one
all
night
long
this
is
a
very
boozy
scotch
ale
that
will
be
tasty
for
those
folks
who
really
like
a
bourbonheavy
taste
another
world
class
brew
from
alesmith
the
apparent
lack
of
carbonation
is
compensated
for
by
a
full
thick
silky
maltiness
this
is
no
thirstquenching
quaffer
of
course
but
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
nonetheless
the
deeper
i
drink
of
this
the
more
entangled
i
become
in
a
web
of
pleasure
it
spins
about
my
soul
so
that
i
desire
to
drink
deeply
of
it
endlessly
and
endlessly
pours
like
the
non

is
surprisingly
very
good
what
a
nice
beer
its
not
nearly
the
big
heavy
beast
i
thought
it
would
be
i
actually
was
kind
of
hoping
for
a
brash
and
heavy
bourbon
laced
brew
and
this
wasnt
it
this
was
malty
sweet
light

goodness
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to

excellent

not

i
was

this
is
a

to

with
but
barrel
aging
has
smoothed
it
out
even
more
no
heat
whatsoever
despite
the
high
abv
and
the
low
carbonation
makes
for
a
silky
mouthfeel
excellent
stuff
not
quite
as
outstanding
as
ba

but
clearly
better
than
ba
old
numbskull
thanks
to
tom
at
obriens
sd
and
his
alesmith
tasting
for
this
maybe
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
2006
vintage
released
in
08
bottle
253254
the
first
thing
i
thought
when
i
smelled
the
open
bottle
was
bourbon
the
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
and
i
am
pretty
sure
it
looks
like
the
regular
wee
heavy
but
ive
only
had
that
once
the
aromas
from
the
glass
seem
to
be
mostly
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
taste
is
pretty
good
licorice
vanilla
nuttyfruits
different
than
i
remember
the
regular
version
but
a
hint
of
smoke
and
peat
which
i
couldnt
detect
in
the
regular
version
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
in
this
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
but
really
only
a
twist
to
a
beer
that
was
already
good
to
start
with
i
would
definitely
purchase
this
again
if
i
ever
had
a
chance
damn
you
alesmith
good
body
low
carbonation
lots
of
complex
flavors
and
aromas
working
here
very
enjoyable
big
beer
but
sightly
thin
in
the
middle
of
the
mouthfeel
long
never
ending
finish
that
shows
loads
of
residual
sugar
brown
sugar
brandy
reduced
dried

shine
through
on

anticipated
bourbon
huge
vanilla
toasted
oak
charred

with
much
more

on

slight

as

that
i
look
hugely
forward
to
enjoying
again
in

love
to

some

some
day
from
this
brewery
drinkability
very
tasty
bourbony
boost
to
what
was
already
an
excellent
beer
happiness
really
is
a
choice
overall
i
thought
this
was
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
only
thing
it
lacked
was
a
little
bit
better
initial
presentation
but
aside
from
that
it
was
just
sublime
i
could
have
had
a
dozen
bottles
and
would
open
one
every
night
i
just
think
it
was
amazing
the
transformation
this
one
undertook
some
barrel
agings
just
do
not
go
over
well
this
one
on
the
other
hand
just
went
perfectly
i
could
not
have
envisioned
it
being
any
better
just
perfect
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
and
can
only
imagine
what
the
speedway
must
be
like
if
i
can
ever
manager
to
get
a
hold
of
a
bottle
of
that
one
after
i
was
done
explaining
to
various
people
that
this
was
actually
beer
and
not
oaked
whiskey
like
they
were
all
claiming
i
was
able
to
do
my
review
i
expected
more
from
this
brew
but
it
was
still
good
bourbon
and
wood
character
seemed
to
just
take
over
the
original
brew
certainly
the
strongest
tasting
scotch
ale
i
have
tried
next
to
the
berksire
for
julios
might
pay
the
money
for
another
bottle
in
the
future
but
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
do
so
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
though
d
i
definitely
think
the
barrel
aging
has
improved
the
wee
heavy
from
alesmith
which
was
already
a
great
beer
it
gave
it
more
complexity
and
in
the
end
made
it
much
more
interesting
ill
definitely
buy
another
bottle
or
2
at
the
next
release
a
beer
that
certainly
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
this
beer
tastes
completely
different
than
the
nonbarrel
aged
version
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
little
to
no
head
and
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
no
carbonation
taste
and
smell
had
a
lot
of
vanilla
bourbon
caramel
and
prunesfigs
as
it
warmed
the
beer
took
on
more
and
more
of
prune
flavors
and
was
completely
flat
by
the
time
we
finished
a
great
sipping
beer
but
you
will
be
hard
pressed
to
finish
a
bottle
by
yourself
i
must
admit
that
i
like
the
regular
version
of
this
beer
a
bit
better
but
that
is
typically
the
case
for
me
i
just
think
that
this
one
is
holding
up
a
bit
better
than
most
do
as
the
base
beer
really
is
such
a
malty
monster
of
a
beer
though
you
lose
that
with
the
bourbon
barrel
character
layered
on
top
of
it
my
biggest
complaint
is
the
lack
of
substantial
carbonation
a
lightmedium
level
of
carbonation
would
be
perfect
though
it
does
still
do
well
with
the
low
level
that
it
does
have
i
really
like
how
complex
integrated
the
barrel
character
is
here
somehow
though
it
is
the
dominant
note
it
does
not
overwhelm
my
palate
and
it
is
not
too
hot
and
one
dimensional
this
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
i
could
keep
sipping
this
all
night
long
its
really
a
finely
crafted
masterpiece
as
mentioned
below
this
is
second
only
to
the
decadence
old
ale
that
was
barrel
aged
glad
i
waited
in
line
for
this
gem
im
sorry
but
there
is
no
way
this
beer
is
only
10ish
alcohol
its
three
maybe
four
percentage
points
above
that
at
least
feels
weird
to
enjoy
a
brew
that
people
would
pay
hundreds
of
dollars
for
on
ebay
since
i
didnt
and
couldnt
pay
that
much
for
it
just
have
to
bask
in
my
fortunateness
and
luck
aroma
is
dominated
by
bourbon
but
i
can
detect
ample
caramel
malt
dark
fruits
toasted
toffee
and
mild
notes
of
licorice
body
is
dark
brown
not
muddy
and
holds
a
diminishing
frothy
tan
head
holds
flavors
of
raisin
stewed
prunes
licorice
oak
caramel
vanilla
bourbon
and
a
massive
and
sustained
malt
backbone
that
can
more
than
stand
up
to
the
many
different
flavor
components
its
a
joy
to
drink
and
feels
very
nice
on
the
mouth
it
only
has
the
faintest
suggestion
of
smoked
malt
in
the
finish
i
think
this
beer
is
great
i
am
very
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
once
in
a
lifetime
beer
d
the
bourbon
barrel
effect
on
alesmith
wee
heavy
is
a
winner
take
something
thats
already
quite
good
and
make
it
several
times
better
this
is
a
slow
and
easy
sipper
that
will
warm
you
up
and
content
you
on
a
quiet
night
well
done
a
hearty
cheers
to
alesmith
for
a
oneofakind
ale
of
distinction
wish
the
best
to
the
fortunate
few
that
get
to
savor
this
one
ultimately
this
turned
out
to
be
a
beer
pulled
in
opposite
directions
and
i
am
unclear
which
way
the
brewers
intended
it
but
it
appears
to
be
an
infected
barrel
with
a
bunch
of
oxidation
from
either
that
same
barreling
or
from
the
age
on
this
corked
bottle
overall
id
have
this
again
and
again
if
i
could
sad
that
its
retired
may
have
to
go
back
for
another
bottle
it
was
hard
enough
deciding
on
this
or
curieux
750ml
bottle
2006
vintage
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
ruby
tinged
amber
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
tan
head
on
it
but
it
didnt
linger
long
nor
leave
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
the
oak
in
the
initial
nose
lots
of
other
aromas
in
there
fruits
bread
caramel
faint
spice
maybe
some
peat
the
taste
is
quite
good
it
is
quite
complex
and
starts
a
touch
sweet
but
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
fruits
and
smokiness
on
top
there
is
a
bit
of
oakiness
there
also
as
well
as
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
finish
almost
a
bit
of
a
port
wine
characteristic
to
it
also
very
nice
musette
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
surprisingly
light
carbonation
complex
and
not
muddled
despite
the
myriad
of
flavors
this
beer
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
i
look
forward
to
finding
it
again
the
body
was
nicely
full
and
wellrounded
without
being
heavy
drinkability
was
very
good
and
this
isnt
one
of
my
more
favorite
styles
overall
a
very
good
beer
thats
worth
seeking
out
ill
never
be
a
great
lover
of
this
style
but
by
jove
this
one
is
nice
and
mellow
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
the
flavours
are
wellintegrated
d
a
great
drinker
considering
its
weight
md
very
much
so
enjoyed
this
brew
this
one
started
out
pretty
good
cold
but
really
after
some
time
in
the
room
temperature
like
maybe
a
half
hour
to
45
minutes
the
flavors
really
came
out
love
to
try
the
brew
fresh
very
lucky
though
to
try
this
one
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
will
keep
this
brew
on
the
radar
for
the
future
a
must
try
for
anyone
that
likes
the
style
d
not
too
bad
good
mouthfeel
not
thick
or
syrupy
very
balanced
a
little
sweet
to
have
one
after
the
other
but
very
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
being
10
had
this
one
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
get
a
bottle
save
it
or
drink
it
it
ages
very
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
rich
soft
and
very
smooth
with
the
10
very
well
hidden
i
would
definately
buy
this
if
i
saw
it
again
mediumbodied
but
the
tartness
gives
it
a
very
dry
feel
overall
a
good
beer
the
kings
of
hop
smooth
and
easy
drinking
delicious
beer
its
drinking
very
well
while
this
one
started
out
positively
and
still
ended
well
ill
add
that
in
the
realm
of
wee
heavys
this
one
is
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
scale
i
enjoy
mine
a
bit
more
bold
generally
but
this
one
is
sure
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
good
one
for
me
to
have
on
hand
for
just
drinking
if
allagash
were
available
in
oklahoma
overall
i
sat
on
this
beer
for
over
a
year
and
i
dont
think
its
any
better
for
it
d
really
nice
didnt
know
to
expect
going
in
to
this
one
but
i
got
a
pleasant
surprise
a
belgian
inspired
wee
heavy
why
not
drinkability
was
good
i
am
a
hophead
but
sometimes
you
want
to
ease
up
a
bit
this
was
a
great
diversion
medium
body
needed
a
bit
more
complexity
and
density
to
turn
into
a
great
beer
but
still
makes
for
a
very
nice
late
night
drink
d
nice
smoke
good
beer
probably
the
least
complex
beer
ive
had
from
allagash
an
interesting
take
on
scotch
ale
though
splitting
this
with
the
wife
but
i
think
given
no
place
to
go
tomorrow
i
could
take
down
the
entire
bomber
i
dont
cotton
much
to
bombers
in
this
highfalutin
price
range
but
im
very
glad
i
tried
this
excellent
beer
mouthfeel
is
medlight
crisp
carbonation
dry
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
but
id
rank
a
few
other
allagash
beers
ahead
of
it
worth
a
shot
just
dont
expect
a
wee
heavy
drinkability
they
may
call
it
a
scotch
ale
but
it
is
definitely
still
a
belgian
it
is
a
good
beer
but
the
other
two
in
the
series
curieux
and
odyssey
easily
beat
it
out
but
for
many
many
brewers
this
could
easily
be
their
top
beer
a
touch
of
heat
but
nothing
like
curieuxs
bourbon
heat
i
will
age
the
latter
but
not
the
former
not
what
i
was
expecting
given
the
bagpipes
not
a
hint
of
peat
or
scotch
taste
is
creamy
grain
some
caramel
some
malt
barley
and
some
spice
in
the
back
becomes
thicker
as
it
warms
hv
d
an
drink
that
was
very
easy
going
down
and
easy
to
enjoy
the
abv
is
nicely
hidden
behind
a
sweet
malting
pours
a
dark
plum
color
with
a
slight
red
tint
aroma
is
dominated
by
scotch
but
also
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
very
strong
scotch
presence
with
tastes
of
dark
fruit
vanilla
and
butterscotch
another
very
good
allagash
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
onefinger
brownish
white
head
that
collared
nicely
aroma
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
very
fruity
taste
is
brandylike
but
smooth
on
the
sweet
side
but
also
remindes
me
of
a
belgiumale
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
thick
although
not
syrupy
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
taste
is
outstanding
highly
recommended
and
an
excellent
session
beer
again
it
was
better
than
decent
not
quite
good
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
apples
and
pears
being
the
most
prominent
there
is
also
a
butterscotch
element
as
well
as
toasted
malt
and
caramel
the
appearance
is
hazy
purplebrown
with
a
two
finger
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
only
a
trace
of
oak
barrels
the
palate

is

toasted

some

sliced
pears
maybe
perhaps
some

some

and

a
nice
mix
of

in
this

taste
is
well
balanced
with
pleasantly
sweet
malts
up
front
giving
way
to
delightfully
bitter
hops
on
the
finish
all
the
while
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
thick
and
coating
a
wonderfully
crafted
immensely
flavourful
offering
from
allagash
perfect
for
sipping
on
chilly
evenings
recommended
for
sure
d
very
easy
to
drink
especially
considering
the
abv
pours
a
hazy
deep
copper
color
with

in
the
aroma
oaky

small

taste
dark

but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
either
a
copper
light
brown
color
with
a
twofinger
head
in
my
glass
that
was
tancolored
and
stuck
aroudn
for
a
while
due
to
good
carbonation
i
know
there
is
some
caramel
or
sweet
malt
in
here
because
the
last
few
ounces
of
pour
where
a
syrupy
discharge
also
picked
up
some
dark
fruits
or
something
tart
along
with
a
little
floral
hops
my
nose
seems
to
be
everywhere
on
this
one
mediumbodied
and
overall
smooth
passes
over
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
sweet
and
at
the
same
time
tart
almost
sour
fruit
taste
on
the
front
there
is
definitely
some
spices
there
as
there
is
a
peppery
bite
in
the
mouth
and
it
has
a
dry
but
not
too
dry
or
crisp
backbite
still
maintains
a
smoothness
from
the
oak
this
is
a
great
beer
that
my
pourous
review
doesnt
really
do
justice
i
just
couldnt
categorize
the
taste
properly
too
bad
it
hurt
my
wallet
a
little
the
alcohol
shows
itself
clearly
even
after
two
years
of
aging
though
its
not
overwhelming
the
wood
dominance
hangs
on
well
into
the
aftertaste
sips
well
enough
for
a
sipper
d
this
is
oak
aging
done
right
the
oaking
takes
a
definite
back
seat
to
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
i
think
i
liked
this
more
than
the
score
would
indicate
that
metallic
flavor
lowered
the
score
a
bit
drinkabilityother
notes
just
another
outstanding
example
of
a
style
from
allagash
they
prove
once
again
to
me
that
their
beers
are
worth
a
premium
price
id
gladly
buy
this
over
a
15
wine
any
day
no
this
doesnt
fit
the
style
perfectly
the
yeast
belgian
and
scottish
ale
id
venture
makes
this
way
better
and
more
complex
than
most
in
this
style
a
great
example
of
an
american
brewery
venturing
out
on
a
limb
at
bit
and
succeeding
beautifully
as
always
d
probably
not
food
friendly
but
more
than
pleasant
as
an
after
dinner
ale
at
10
abv
caution
is
in
order
pretty
rich
but
well
balanced
like
i
said
not
overly
sweet
a
little
bit
of
belgian
charecter
with
some
raisins
a
pretty
complex
beer
medium

i
wish
we
could
get
allagash
beers
in
arizona
again
overall
very
tasty
brew
creamy
and
delicious
musette
is
definitely
worth
a
try
however
with
so
many
other
outstanding
offers
from
allagash
this
one
suffers
from
comparison
musette
exhibits
the
type
of
craftsmanship
in
brewing
that
transcends
beer
it
show
what
a
great
beer
truly
can
be
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
dark
slightly
hazy
caramel
color
with
a
good
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
and
it
has
some
good
carbonation
as
well
it
has
a
sweet
dry
aroma
with
some
faint
hints
of
banana
some
malts
and
alcohol
it
has
a
smooth
mildly
crispy
and
spicy
taste
with
some
caramel
flavors
its
got
dry
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
really
coats
your
mouth
the
bitterness
fades
a
bit
after
its
warmed
up
some
and
some
of
the
sweeter
flavors
come
out
as
well
poured

this

to

thank
you
allagash
highly
recommended
d
this
one
has
good
drinkability
in
moderation
as
stated
above
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
foods
i
would
think
it
might
work
well
with
spicy
foods
like
indian
also
would
be
good
with
a
pepper
steak
i
actually
had
a
one
bottled
august
06
and
drank
it
in
august
07
it
was
super
smoothe
not
as
apparent
alcohol
smell
and
taste
very
well
blended
flavors
my
roommates
at
the
time
didnt
drink
beer
and
still
dont
but
they
all
loved
this
year
old
musette
d
not
great
couldnt
finish
md
full
bodied
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
prickly
alcohol
is
there
but
done
nicely
its
a
sipper
and
one
bottle
is
probably
enough
but
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
very
good
example
of
what
oak
and
oak
alone
can
bring
to
a
beer
economically
not
such
a
great
deal
at
16
99
when
you
can
get
the
real
deals
from
overseas
for
a
lot
less
not
sure
what
allagash
is
thinking
of
at
that
price
on
tap
at
publick
house
in
boston
pours
dark
amber
with
minimal
light
tan
head
aroma
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
whisky
really
nice
taste
the
flavor
has
real
complexity
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
in
addition
to
the
caramel
and
whisky
the
whisky
is
present
throughout
but
adds
to
rather
than
dominates
the
flavor
warming
alcohol
on
the
finish
excellent
offering
an
unusual
and
very
tasty
brew
complex
flavor
profile
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
who
knew
that
the
malty
smoky
aspect
of
a
scoth
ale
would
match
well
with
belgian
sweetness
and
spices
good
stuff
super
drinkable
10
wee
heavy
only
wish
it
was
cheaper
and
more
readily
available
it
would
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
d
pretty
drinkable
for
a
strong
wood
aged
beer
the
flavor
of
the
base
beer
is
a
bit
weak
but
the
oak
character
is
quite
nice
substantial
but
not
overwhelming
the
finish
is
particularly
complex
dthis
is
a
crazy
mixed
up
brew
that
comes
out
all
good
in
the
end
imho
a
very
nice
offering
this
poured
a
hazy
dull
copper
color
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
a
perfectly
balanced
blend
of
wild
belgian
yeast
caramel
malt
and
floral
and
pine
hops
it
immediately
had
a
watereddown
oaky
flavor
along
with
the
semisweetsemibitter
taste
of
burnt
honey
caramel
salt
and
lemon
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
clean
and
sweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
an
interesting
drink
with
many
good
elements
but
could
have
been
further
refined
with
a
bolder
flavor
and
body
overall
a
wonderful
beer
saying
this
one
is
complex
is
a
terrible
understatement
layer
upon
layer
of
flavor
seek
the
musette
youll
be
happy
you
did
thanks
again
to
nflmvp
i
think
i
recently
lost
my
trading
notebook
d
yet
another
very
enjoyable
offering
from
allagash
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
stuff
tastes
of
spices
fruits
a
bit
of
oak
and
the
yeast
adds
some
more
character
may
2006
bottle
kept
in
my
beer
cellar
until
this
past
friday
poured
into
two
belgian
chalices
this
beer
had
a
golden
tan
color
with
a
fizzy
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
the
oak
aging
was
apparent
in
the
smell
the
taste
was
of
raisins
and
peat
but
the
oak
aspect
really
stopped
at
the
palate
i
have
had
beers
that
really
tasted
oak
aged
but
this
one
was
faint
its
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
example
of
oak
aging
as
for
price
i
am
glad
that
i
got
this
one
for
12
off
normal
price
this
beer
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
from
the
oaked
aged
series
from
allagash
complex
but
not
all
that
interesting
to
me
especially
for
the
price
this
beer
was
clear
and
a
dark
burnt
orange
colour
topped
by
a
thin
layer
of
bright
white
foam
composed
of
small
bubbles
the
head
eventually
receded
to
a
collar
and
produced
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
quite
fruity
some
white
grape
character
with
lots
of
earthy
notes
some
vanilla
oak
and
tobacco
low
bitterness
with
a
fruity
flavour
fairly
spicy
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
throughout
bready
malt
and
vinous
character
balanced
tobacco
leaf
and
peppery
spice
and
there
was
some
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
background
though
there
was
plenty
of
warmth
it
definitely
wasnt
hot
medium
to
full
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
high
side
the
texture
was
a
bit
slick
good
stuff
pretty
complex
but
still
accessible
the
oak
didnt
come
off
as
overdone
or
unbalanced
next
to
the
base
beer
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
with
a
good
balance
between
the
barrel
and
the
base
scotch
ale
this
beer
was
just
way
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
17
is
just
not
worth
it
it
would
be
worth
it
for
8
or
9
maybe

but
17
is
pretty
ridiculous
if
you
have
a
heap
of
cash
to
spare
give
it
a
shot
otherwise
save
your
money
there
are
much
better
and
cheaper
beers
out
there
pours
a
slightly
clouded
dark
ruby
flavor
is
amazingly
smooth
wood
character
comes
through
as
does
a
good
sweet
tone
who
cares
about
specifics
i
give
it
a
5
on
flavor
feel
is
perfect
balance
between
liquid
and
carbonation
i
cant
believe
i
am
having
this
on
tap
so
drinkable
i
want
to
kill
the
keg
i
can
only
imagine
what
this
is
like
on
bottle
and
plan
on
finding
out
at
some
point
nice
mouthfeel
light
and
fizzy
for
a
scotch
ale
but
if
you
like
the
brewery
not
a
bad
beer
kinda
like
a
belgian
scotch
ale
a
belch
if
you
will
drinkability
suffers
slightly
because
of
the
sweetness
and
abv
but
i
like
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brown
with
little
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sour
and
slightly
sweet
and
a
bit
yeasty
the
taste
has
nicely
balanced
flavore
of
sweet
malt
and
nicely
subtle
oak
as
well
astypical
belgian
yeast
flavors
of
banana
spice
and
coriander
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
spritz
nice
and
a
bit
different
for
a
wee
heavy
more
like
a
wee
heavy
and
tripel
hybrid
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
small
lacing
rings
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
notes
of
light
oak
taste
is
dominated
by
a
big
sweet
malt
base
with
some
toffee
notes
the
bourbon
and
the
alcohol
were
not
discernable
i
was
expecting
more
peat
malt
and
less
sweetness
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
even
thought
it
stray
very
much
from
the
style
guideline
the
first
of
the
allagash
oaks
that
ive
tried
this
beer
is
unexpectedly
delicate
serve
warm
stay
away
from
rich
food
pairings
and
enjoy
slowly
it
might
drink
like
water
but
it
hits
like
a
brick
it
should
be
noted
that
i
received
this
as
a
gift
and
therefore
havent
been
influenced
by
the
price
as
it
seems
others
have
who
knows
if
i
were
to
have
shilled
out
close
to
20
for
the
bottle
i
too
may
not
be
so
in
love
with
it
its
good
but
not
great
its
not
a
scotch
style
and
certainly
not
a
wee
heavy
its
a
decent
belgian
strong
but
either
way
its
just
not
worth
17
a
bottle
d
extremely
high
for
a
wee
heavy
alagash
did
a
fantastic
job
on
the
delivery
of
this
one
drinkability
sadly
another
allagash
brew
that
doesnt
cut
it
imo
17
for
this
a
decent
run
of
the
mill
oaked
beer
but
the
flavors
really
dont
jump
out
at
you
one
more
overpriced
on
to
go
a
thing
of
beauty
i
like
anything
barrelaged
but
this
is
the
first
ale
ive
had
that
seems
like
it
was
designed
just
to
be
aged
in
oak
it
pours
the
color
of
a
cherry
tea
with
a
thick
head
and
lots
of
good
lacing
the
aroma
and
initial
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
oak
but
then
some
notes
of
bitter
cherry
orange
peel
and
plum
enter
the
mix
not
overly
complex
but
it
does
have
a
faint
ale
funk
throughout
and
a
nice
crisp
vaguely
hoppy
finish
this
struck
me
as
great
for
winetype
occasions

intrudes
not
my
favorite

by
a

much
more
belgian

this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
such
a
heavy
hitter
i
did
however
notice
that
the
booze
started
to
build
on
the
tongue
after
a
while
as
did
a
bit
of
an
ash
tray
like
smoke
which
was
evident
in
the
nose
but
not
the
taste
quite
the
drinkable
beer
one
you
get
past
the
initial
boozy
flavor
then
again
this
isnt
nearly
as
booze
laced
as
your
average
ris
highly
recommended
and
an
especially
good
beer
for
christmas
time
this
and

would
make
an
excellent
match
the
mouth
is
about
medium
read
not
thin
which
leaves
me
yearning
for
a
bit
more
heft
but
the
carbonation
is
just
right
it
warms
the
tongue
real
nice
but
above
all
its
a
deliciously

its

with
a
date
of

2006
the
color
was
a
nice
amber
bottle
calls
for
a
slow
pour
so
i
started
with
that
and
ended
up
about
medium
even
with
the
increase
in
pour
there
was
almost
no
head
at
all
several
other
reviews
talked
about
a
3
finger
head
so
something
wrong
here
the
smell
was
oaky
and
sweet
with
raisin
and
fruit
the
taste
was
pretty
good
but
a
tad
too
sweet
from
the
alcohol
sugars
its
10

and
you
can
just
start
to
taste
the
alcohol
so
pretty
well
balanced
there
mouthfeel
was
good
with

feel

a

gives

to

it
is
a

theyve
never
steered
me
wrong
every
beer
of
theirs
ive
tried
has
been
average
at
the
very
least
loch
down
is
better
than
that
it
is
a
solid
perfectly
serviceable
offering
in
its
own
right
and
moreover
makes
a
great
ambassador
for
the
style
o
an
okay
beer
could
help
with
a
little
more
sweetness
not
up
to
the
standard
of
dirty
bastard
and
scotty
karate
o
nicely
true
to
style
particularly
the
malty
aroma
but
with
the
higher
abv
a
bit
more
obvious
best
ale
ive
had
from
this
brewery
ov
decent
flavours
and
very
drinkable

it

d
good
enough
all
around
give
it
a
try
if
you
havent
already
o
i
really
feel
like
so
much
more
could
have
been
accomplished
by
this
brew
and
that
its
onto
something
i
feel
like
it
fell
short
of
its
goals
somewhere
however
and
just
kind
of
faded
into
the
woodwork
its
disappointing
because
it
felt
like
it
was
getting
there
with
smell
taste
mouthfeel
then
it
just
stopped
without
peaking
a
bottle

when
you
wanted

this
is
the

that

had
in

has
just

better

i
still
feel
like
it
has
to
be
an

it
looks
ugly
it
smells

as
well
as

still
a

again
the

something

d
i
admit
i
really
like
wee
heavies
and
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
thought
the
complexity
of
flavor
was
terrific
and
made
this
one
drinkable
beer
drinkability
overall
i
feel
like
my
numerical
ratings
are
a
bit
unfair
for
this
beer
its
not
really
a
bad
beer
id
probably
buy
it
again
sometime
but
its
not
really
giving
me
anything
to
work
with
a
decent
highabv

more
d

lots

tonsure
and
not
too
much
perceptible
aroma
very
spunky
carbonation
and
great
fizzy
mouthfeel
as
well
as
an
appropriate
weight
only
problem
is
alcohol
much
too
evident
on
the
front
end
perhaps
for
this
reason
the
maltiness
is
a
fairly
vague
taste
of
toast
slightly
brownsugary
but
not
sweet
taste
perhaps
less
drinkable
than
mcewans
but
more
drinkable
than
most
fine
american
microbrew
scotch
ales
given
this
less
distracting
profile
again
few
can
beat
the
carbonation
perks
here
post
facto
taste
is
substantial
smokiness
and
peat
do
linger
on
far
after
the
beers
done
but
before
food
is
consumed
all
in
all
quite
pleasurable
a
so
so
scotch
ale
not
bad
at
all
but
does
not
compare
to
the
upper
tier
for
the
style
a
quaffable
ale
i
enjoyed
two
or
three
tonight
and
it
didnt
get
old
on
my
tongue
it
might
not
be
recommended
to
drink
more
than
one
because
of
the
high
abv
but
for
me
it
worked
out
just
fine
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
scotch
ale

back

the
high
abv
may
make
it
a
noncession
brew
but
the
beer
is
nicely
balanced
and
doesnt
wear
out
the
palate
the
pepper
finish
and
elevated
abv
remind
me
of
a
fine
whiskey
it
had
a
good
medium
body
to
it
a
slight
creaminess
helped
coat
the
tongue
and
mouth
there
was
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
that
gave
a
slight
bite
to
the
tongue
worth
trying
arcadia
does
well
with
english
styles
and
apparently
scottish
styles
as
well
d
i
found
that
this
gets
definitely
better
as
it
warms
so
try
to
start
out
warm
it
was
a
good
scotch
ale
but
currently
of
the
2
others
i
have
had
this
is
my
least
favorite
the
brew
is
drinkable
if
someone
offered
this
to
me
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
then
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
in
this
style
over
all
it
is
a
decent
brew
d
good
stuff
the
alcohol
becomes
slightly
more
apparent
as
it
warms
but
its
not
offputting
in
the
least
not
recommended
dthis
is
a
wonderful

to
me
its

theres

some

alcohol
that
makes
the
beer
a

finish
my

tastes

it

either
way

it

out
there
im
not
sure
what
that
off
flavor
that
gets
in
the
way
of
the
taste
is
all
about
d
i
dumped
it
maybe
next
time
im
up
in
michigan
papa
d
fairly
good
could
barely
tell
this
was
an
above
average
amount
of
alcohol
not
something
i
am
going
to
go
searching
for
but
if
the
mood
strikes
me
and
i
feel
the
need
to
support
arcadia
and
none
of
their
bombers
are
available
which
i
enjoy
thoroughly
then
i
may
pick
this
up
again
not
foul
but
i
felt
it
fell
a
bit
short
d
since
i
love
scotch
bourbon
and
even
the
occasional
cognac
i
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
big
heavy
booze
bombs
and
although
7
5
isnt
really
outrageous
this
beer
sure
tastes
like
its
more
alcohol
laced
than
that
figure
suggests
many
will
be
put
off
by
the
motor
oil
and
brandy
mixture
and
this
is
surely
not
a
session
brew
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
glow
and
good
clarity
there
is
a
thin
but
steady
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
caramel
sweetness
as
well
as
a
bit
earthywoody
the
flavor
has
a
highly
bittersweet
caramel
note
and
hop
bitterness
is
low
the
beer
finishes
with
a
slightl
alcohol
prick
and
some
residual
sweetness
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
dont
like
to
do
this
but
this
beer
just
does
not
do
it
for
me
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
small
head
with
a
hard
pour
and
almost
no
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
tastes
the
same
with
some
sweetness
mouthfeel
light
and
carbontion
ok
no
complexity
to
this
beer
and
i
tried
it
at
three
differant
times
too
flawed
to
be
enjoyable
misses
the
boat
on
the
style
odd
d
overall
not
bad
a
bit
to
much
alcohol
flavor
however
this
is
a
smooth
scotch
ale
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
most
but
it
is
full
of
big
flavor
this
is
really
an
outstanding
beer
pours
a
cola
brown
with
a
disappearing
white
head
aromas
of
malt
with
a
little
citrus
hop
in
the
background
solid
malt
body
natch
with
some
sweet
fruit
in
the
background
fairly
heavy
overall
as
is
to
be
expected
from
a
scotch
ale
the
body
hides
the
higher
alcohol
well
not
a
session
beer
but
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
it
is
this
actually
makes
for
a
good
fall
beer
warms
you
up
a
little
on
those
cool
nights
a
near
black
beer
with
small
amber
highlights
and
a
finger
of
big
bubbled
head
that
dissolves
too
fast
aromas
of
grape
and
wine
and
lots
of
sourness
taste
is
similar
drying
sourness
with
light
toffee
wine
like
the
nose
body
is
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
an
okay
beer
the
best
ive
had
from
arcadia
although
not
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
note
whoa
i
see
on
ba
its
7
5
alcohol
not
noticeable
in
the
least
nice
there
is
a
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
up
front
along
with
caramel
and
an
herbal
tangy
hop
note
dark
fruits
begin
to
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
raisins
plums
cherries
along
with
a
slight
hint
of
oak
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
wee
heavy
style
which
apparently
people
either
love
or
hate
i
personally
love
them
it
is
a
bit
heavy
and
high
in
alcohol
content
to
be
a
sessioner
though
still
recommended
mediumfull
bodied
smooth
and
filling
a
nice
treat
on
a
cool
fall
day
overall
this
is
a
decent
enough
scotch
ale
however
i
usually
prefer
some
oak
or
woodlike
qualities
in
the
style
which
is
absent
here
a
fine
cool
evening
sipper
well
done
for
the
style
just
not
my
favorite
scotch
ale
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
sour
yeast
scent
that
is
paired
with
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
there
may
be
others
present
but
i
cant
tell
the
difference
because
of
the
contamination
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
bold
malt
presence
its
rich
with
crystal
peated
and
roasted
malts
it
goes
down
and
warms
on
the
finish
there
is
a
sour
finish
its
not
as
pronounced
due
to
the
high
dark
malt
component
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
is
at
least
drinkable
but
not
one
id
buy
again
the
contamination
is
too
distracting
drinkability
this
is
very
good
ale
and
the
abv
renders
it
borderline
sessionable
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
very
good
representation
of
style
its
not
really
a
beer
that
you
can
pound
down
but
thats
not
what
you
look
for
from
a
scotch
ale
its
a
very
good
beer
that
you
would
want
to
relax
with
and
sip
slowly
this
is
another
good
beer
from
arcadia
pours
a
two
finger
head
that
disipates
into
nearly
no
head
the
beer
itself
is
an
opaque
brown
black
looks
as
dark
as
some
imperial
stouts
the
nose
is
intriguing
and
smells
of
dark
sugar
and
nuts
the
smell
fails
to
develop
and
is
fairly
one
dimensional
tastes
of
sweet
dark
licorice
but
like
the
smell
it
fails
to
develop
and
lack
complexity
this
really
needs
to
develop
more
of
a
roasted
malt
backbone
alcohol
is
evident
but
in
place
and
not
overwhelming
lacks
carbonation
and
features
a
thin
mouthfeel
i
only
had
one
i
think
it
would
be
a
bit
much
to
sit
down
with
a
few
of
them
overall
not
great
seems
to
hot
and
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
poured
a
dark
brown
with
good
carbonation
yet
minimal
head
development
smell
is
malty
and
porterish
not
as
sweet
smelling
as
i
would
expect
from
this
style
however
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
mild
bitterness
fairly
smooth
but
strong
and
warming
overall
drinkability
is
good
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again

a

a

example
of
a
scotch

not
amazing
and
the

doesnt

still
not
a

brew
rich

with

very

and
a

about

for
the
abv
i
would
try
again
if
i
found
the
beer
fresh
and
compare
to
this
experience
im
reading
ambitious
brews
and
i
imagine
early
american
dark
brews
being
very
similar
to
this
im
calln
it
drinkable
this
one
falls
above
the
line
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
not
much
head
to
speak
of
here
and
what
does
exist
thins
out
real
fast
smells
sweet
and
woody
sugary
malt
aroma
with
some
heavier
earthen
scents
keeping
in
line
with
the
style
but
nothing
spectacular
taste
is
a
bit
bland
as
well
smooth
but
flat
theres
some
kick
up
front
with
a
burst
of
hops
and
lots
of
raisins
some
coffee
here
too
which
i
would
not
have
expected
i
mean
its
nice
enough
but
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
not
a
great
example
of
a
scotch
or
a
wee
heavy
i
probably
wont
return
to
this
one
ok
drinkability
worth
a
try
or
maybe
its
everyone
else
thats
crazy
this
is
one
of
my
current
favorites
since
im
a
michigan
boy
and
it
is
easily
available

not
overly
expensive

very
mild
with
just
a
bit
of
smoky
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
malty
with
an
earthy
sweetness
some
hops
and
a
lingering
caramel
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
overpowering
nice
combo
of
malts
and
sweetness
well
done
mouthfeel
is
a
little
undercarbonated
but
still
smooth
and
nice
drinability
is
good
its
a
quality
winter
brew
the
first
taste
is
one
of
delight
as
there
is
a
smooth
delivery
with
a
slightly
fruity
finish
how
do
they
get
the
malt
to
do
that
i
expected
a
stronger
alelike
presence
but
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
a
very
tasty
treat
have
had
before
will
again
d
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
nearly
indistinguishable
could
be
dangerous
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
quiet
upon
entry
into
the
mouth
it
rolls
silently
on
the
tongue
and
with
a
little
coaxing
the
beer
gently
gingerly
swells
to
a
miniscule
foam
not
bad
but
i
love
my
scotch
ales
to
be
more
alive
in
the
mouth
it
brings
out
the
smoke
the
malts
the
flavor
this
beer
is
smooth
without
question
where
is
falls
a
wee
bit
light
in
mouthfeel
it
drinks
extremely
well
overall
and
deserves
praise
arcadias
scotch
ale
is
very
good
and
rich
this
beer
shows
signs
of
respectability
but
it
is
too
flawed
i
love
scotch
ales
but
this
one
is
a
joke
is
my
bottle
bad
it
would
seem
but
not
much
from

has
impressed
me
much
surely
not
every
beer

detracts

also

still
with
some
acidity
at

a

this

the

in

to
create
something
the

nothing

gives
a
nice
warming

to

no

and
no

by
the
dry

my
first
impression
was
not
very
good
but
as
i
drank
it
improved
some
this
one
wasnt
bad
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
well
balanced
but
there
really
wasnt
anything
that
stood
out
to
make
it
memorable
it
is
quite
enjoyable
but
i
like
a
like
an
american
scotch

or
any
scotch

to
be
a

an

the

is
a
masterful
beer
by
a
great
brewery
thanks

and
a
decent

brew
well
worth
giving
this
a
try
its

bought
this
at

at

for

better
than
most

the
standard

quite
malty
with
a
nutty

chocolate
flavor

melds
together
wonderfully
noticable
alcohol
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
becomes
a
bit
phenolic
but
light
medium
to
firm
body
that
remains
quite
drinkable
the
sweetness
could
use
a
bit
more
hopping
to
contribute
balance
and
character
finishes
a
bit
sweet
and
a
bit
rough
roughness
from
harsh
carbonation
and
alcoholic
strength
without
the
depth
to
mask
quite
a
bit
of
depth
and
complexity
in
the
flavor
a
bit
more
balanced
than
some
scotch
ales
in
that
the
malty
sweetness
isnt
as
much
of
a
presence
still
this
is
a
big
beer
it
has
generous
amounts
of
malt
that
have
several
interesting
and
wellblended
flavor
characteristics
overall
a
stunningly
original
and
poised
example
of
this
style
there
have
been
too
many
overly
cloying
and
syrupy
renditions
to
where
ive
almost
avoided
diving
back
into
this
style
im
certainly
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
try
only
wish
i
would
have
tried
it
in
november
but
better
late
than
never
this
brew
pours
an
opaque

almost
black
color
the
head
is
threefingers
in

rocky
the
aroma
is

the
taste
is
of

cream
the
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
smooth
and
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium

overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
i
will
certainly
have
this
again
brought
a
bottle
back
from
my
trip
to
madison
think
it
came
from
woodmans
drinkability
enjoyable
and
pretty
easy
drinking
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
by
any
means
but
it
is
one
that
i
will
buy
again

taste

a

probably
my
least
favorite
offering
from
arcadia
so
far
nice
black
colour
with
a
bit
of
head
but
did
not
deliver
but
a
faint
taste
of
licorice
and
molasses
malt
recently
bought
some
numbing
carbonation
medium
mouthfeel
more
of
an
inoffensive
brown
ale
particularly
since
licorice
on
the
aftertaste
inviting
caramel
and
coffee
aromas
with
earthy
wafts
from
hops
and
some

crisp
flavors
are

initially
acidic
but
not

mediumfull
body
and

roasted
malts
linger
in
the
finish
that
could
use
more
ibus
i
had
this
in
a
bottle
at
my
local
watering
hole
one
could
smell
the
sweet
malty
aroma
typical
of
scotch
ales
the
head
was
minimal
with
little
lace
on
the
glass
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
burgandy
hue
the
taste
was
the
aroma
magnified
it
had
a
glorious
sweet
malty
toasty
taste
the
sweetness
was
not
cloying
the
body
was
a
little
thin
but
this
made
it
even
more
drinkable
a
fine
effort
from
a
brewery
im
not
overly
familiar
withi
hope
to
remedy
that
very
dark
brown
even
darker
than
cola
colored
body
head
fades
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
until
nothing
is
left
except
a
couple
of
specks
on
the
dark
surface
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
and
a
smell
similar
to
potting
soil
not
in
a
bad
way
though
taste
is
sweet
with
carmel
sweet
apples
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
some
slightly
nutty
flavors
mouthfeel
has
a
low
carbonation
level
but
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
yet
strong
and
delicious
beer
this
makes
up
for
the
battle
creek
reserve
disaster
that
i
recently
had
from
arcadia
dark
brown
appearance
with
chestnutcolored
highlights
smallish
head
last
about
half
a
minute
at
the
most
very
little
lace
to
speak
of
impressively
malty
aroma
accompanied
by
a
little
anise
and
tobacco
as
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
along
with
carbonation
fairly
hefty
but
not
at
all
sticky
candyish
flavors
caramel
candy
popcorn
with
a
touch
of
diacetyl
slightly
cashew
nutty
just
a
slight
sense
of
bitterness
no
real
chance
to
put
a
finger
on
the
hop
impression
pretty
good
beer
at
hanging
on
to
its
flavor
and
agreeable
mouthfeel
dries
a
bit
to
a
dusky
unsweetened
cocoa
at
the
close
an
enjoyable
brew
the
beer
is
very
smooth
though
good
drinkability
with
this
scotch
ale
i
would
drink
another
one
of
these
overall
despite
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
and
really
full
flavor
this
is
a
surprisingly
easy
beer
to
drink
perhaps
better
suited
for
a
fall
or
winter
night
than
one
at
the
end
of
july
but
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
not
quite
black
but
close
a
nice
tan
colored
head
rises
from
the
beer
but
leaves
quickly
this
beer
smells
sweet
and
malty
maybe
a
little
nutty
as
well
the
taste
is
milder
than
i
had
expected
at
first
but
that
gives
way
to
a
sweet
carmelly
syrupy
and
warmashell
aftertaste
that
just
sticks
and
sticks
and
sticks
i
also
notice
chocolate
and
maybe
some
fruity
notes
this
one
is
definitly
heavybodied
any
heavier
and
wed
be
slugging
out
of
an
aunt
jemimas
bottle
its
really
warm
going
down
seems
much
higher
than
the
listed
7
5
which
is
still
very
nice
the
drinkability
is
good
as
long
as
i
sip
it
slowly
im
sure
ill
be
trying
this
one
again
along
with
other
beers
of
the
same
style
to
compare
cheers
this
beer
is
not
highly
drinkable
and
surely
wasnt
intended
to
be
a
session
beer
it
also
rates
fairly
low
on
the
would
i
like
another
scale
not
nearly
as
well
done
as
the
last
arcadia
brew
i
had
the
nut
brown
ale
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
though
as
arcadia
brews
are
not
available
in
the
area
poured
out
a
dark
brown
with
a
smallish
tan
head
spotty
lacing
and
a
short
lived
head
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
strong
nutty
character
there
was
an
odd
burnt
smell
as
well
that
was
a
bit
detracting
flavor
starts
off
with
a
kick
of
caramel
malt
and
a
light
roastiness
some
earthy
qualities
but
the
odd
burnt
flavor
is
present
in
the
taste
it
tasted
like
almost
an
over
roasted
malt
that
didnt
quite
fit
in
seemed
more
like
a
brown
ale
over
all
to
me
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
and
quite
creamy
and
smooth
pretty
drinkable
stuff
despite
the
off
flavor
decent
beer
just
not
what
i
would
want
out
of
a

i
just

it
feels
like
my
beer
its
not
great
or
inspiring
or
delicious
it
just
makes
me
smile
smell
is
a
good
combination
of
malty
dark
and
earthy
scents
with
a
generally
smooth
texture
pure
and
calm
malts
on
the
nose
turn
to
something
different
flavorwise
as
either
chocolate
malts
or
roasted
barley
were
used
in
abundance
acrid
toasty
bitterness
washes
over
a
decent
backbone
of
pale
malts
had
the
attenuation
and
mouthfeel
of
the
style
but
almost
stoutlike
roast
pungency
but
when
i
come
back
to
this
beer
a
couple
more
times
each
one
is
much
more
rounded
and
smooth
showing

incipient
in

is
a

of

which
is
immediately
superceded
by

virtually
bereft
of

save
a

twang
complementary
to
the
static
sweet

presence
mild
notes
of
bakers
chocolate
and
grainy

surface
as
the
beer
breathes
nearly
full
in
body
with
an
agreeably
dextrinous
mouthfeel
that
suits
the
malt
backbone
well
finishes
with
hints
of
candied
nuts
and
more
molasses
but
not
at
all
cloying
in
that
regard
a
well
crafted
scotch
ale
not
as
complex
as
some
but
more
balanced
than
most

thanks
to
huge
for
the

overall
a
beer
i
wouldnt

down

if
it

accessable
by

id
buy

or
so
a

still
not

scotch

by
any

not

by
any

wow
many
thanks
to
crjmellor
for
this
sample
an
overlooked
brewery
on
my
part
this
scotch
ale
has
opened
my
interest
it
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
that
cascades
to
a
soft
small
tan
head
no
lace
is
left
behind
a
sweet
aroma
of
butterscotch
malt
shows
the
way
this
beer
is
smooth
easy
to
drink
eventhough
the
alcohol
level
is
up
the
taste
has
a
soft
alcohol
hint
to
it
the
taste
is
more
of
a
candied
beer
lots
of
malt
mixed
well
with
caramel
toffee
and
even
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
sweetness
the
mouth
is
pleased
with
a
butterlike
feel
dispite
the

this
would
make
a
good
anytime
beer
or
at
least
a
good
dessert
beer
thanks

this
is
a
very

beer
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
quenches
thirst
well
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
dies
off
quickly
there
is
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
rich
in
slightly
roasted
malts
and
alcohol
smells
more
like
a
single
malt
than
a
scotch
ale
the
taste
is
also
very
very
malty
not
a
bit
of
hops
in
sight
dark
chewy
malts
and
bits
of
caramel
and
toffee
dominate
a
good
little
alcohol
punch
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
strong
the
drinkability
suffers
a
little
due
to
the
7
5
not
being
masked
very
well
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
props
to
crjmellor
for
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
alcohol
warming
very
apparent
absolutely
delicious
which
i
could
find
it
more
often
average
no
more
no
less
this
isnt
a
particularly
loud
or
boisterious
brew
it
seems
content
to
be
mellow
but
thats
not
to
be
mistaken
for
lacking
in
depth
of
character
arcadia
scotch
ale
has
a
creamy
milkshake
feel
to
it
primarily
in
the
nose
oaky
wood
chips
and
buttery
smoothness
deep
and
robust
flavor
reminds
me
of
malted
milk
balls
and
sweet
sugarcoated
mixednuts
almonds
perhaps
down
to
earth
peanut
butter
smoothness
surprisingly
this
isnt
that
heavy
of
a
brew
and
the
alcohol
hides
itself
well
behind
smoked
woodchips
and
malty
sweetness
balanced
to
perfection
you
simply
cant
tell
where
one
phase
of
this
beer
ends
and
another
begins
pours
out
to
a
brownish
to
amber
color
in
the
glass
nose
gives
off
faint
hint
of
liquor
and
malt
taste
is
good
but
not
remarkable
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
butterscotch
and
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
swallow
that
allows
for
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
but
not
a
beer
you
would
choose
to
drink
all
night
a
dark
amber
ale
with
a
slight
head
that
faded
quickly
leaving
no
lace
at
all
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
and
a
plumb
like
aroma
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
flavor
is
typical
for
a
scotch
ale
with
a
strong
sweet
maltiness
has
quite
a
punch
and
a
bit
warming
this
brew
poured
a
transparent
dark
brown
colored
body
and
a
medium
head
of
fine
mostly
lasting
bubbles
it
had
a
strong
malt
aroma
and
a
fizzy
coffee
flavor
with
good
lacing
it
was
smooth
initially
and
finished
very
strong
we
had
this
at
the
festival
in
frankenmuth
mi
this
is
one
alcoholic
tasting
drink
i
taste
the
alcohol
the
whole
way
through
and
it
is
strong
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
but
here
it
almost
goes
overboard
with
alcohol
taste
once
i
get
past
the
alcohol
i
taste
roasted
almonds
and
some
woody
flavors
in
this
beer
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
but
not
too
strong
all
in
all
a
good
drink
this
scotch
ale
poured
a
tan
head
with
medium
bubbles
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
had
an
amber
colored
body
the
taste
of
this
brew
was
smooth
which
is
much
to
my
liking
it
had
no
bitter
taste
to
it
this
was
indeed
a
good
drink
nice
slightly
offwhite
head
creamy
in
a
stoutlike
way
decent
lacing
dark
purple
beer
really
not
much
of
an
aroma
if
you
try
real
hard
there
are
hints
of
cherry
and
oak
lovely
taste
slightly
sweet
some
woody
flavors
very
nice
semisweet
aftertaste
and
clean
mouthfeel
a
very
very
dark
cherry
mahogany
body
with
lovely
ruby
accents
the
brew
is
clear
and
has
a
small
beige
head
that
departs
very
quickly
insignificant
lacing
from
the
residual
the
nose
is
light
and
hints
of
toasted
malt
and
toffee
the
taste
starts
much
like
a
porter
but
as
the
brew
warms
begins
to
show
its
scottich
side
as
it
becomes
less
roasted
in
flavor
and
a
bit
more
malty
smooth
and
easy
body
with
just
a
bit
of
ending
crispness
a
very
small
bit
light
hints
of
alcohol
despite
its
relatively
high
abv
so
this
must
be
fairly
well
balanced
beer
seems
as
if
it
crosses
styles
and
is
not
as
true
to
the
scottish
heritage
as
its
name
implies
nice
looking
brew
pours
out
to
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
pretty
ruby
highlights
and
forms
a
thin
but
creamy
light
tan
head
atop
small
to
mediumsized
bubbles
carbonation
is
moderate
aroma
is
potent
with
caramel
toffee
nutty
character
and
a
fruity
ferment
hops
are
barely
there
with
no
smoke
character
noted
mouthfeel
is
extremely
soft
and
smooth
with
a
medium
body
lacing
is
sparse
taste
begins
unpleasantly
with
some
strong
and
nasty
offcharacter
fusel
and
isopropyl
alcohols
leading
into
a
metallic
note
but
halfway
through
this
beer
becomes
tolerable
the
wet
soft
finish
is
characterized
by
nutty
toffee
amber
malts
with
a
subtle
light
molasses
note
and
some
faint
rubbery
hops
smoke
is
not
perceptable
it
looks
nice
and
has
a
nice
finish
but
thats
not
enough
to
make
me
want
to
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
even
scotch
ale
lovers
it
seems
these
peter
austin
systems
make
all
beers
taste
the
same
this
is
the
3rd
brewery
ive
tasted
to
use
them
and
they
all
brew
unimpressive
beers
yawn
this
beer
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
small
head
that
left
a
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aroma
is
mostly
of
malt
flavor
also
is
mostly
malt
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
think
it
would
benefit
from
a
bit
more
hops
as
it
is
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
this
is
one
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
so
far
my
favorite
from
arcadia
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
almost
no
head
looks
just
like
it
should
aroma
of
smoked
peat
caramel
and
alcohol
quite
pleasant
on
the
tongue
sweet
caramel
notes
to
begin
with
followed
by
some
light
smoke
flavor
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
some
noticable
alcohol
has
a
nice
warming
effect
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
an
excellent
representation
of
a
strong
scottish
ale
part
of
an
arcadia
sampler
i
found
this
to
be
a
really
good
scotch
ale
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
minimal
head
and
thin
lacing
aroma
of
malt
cinnamon
and
alcohol
flavor
is
stong
malt
with
caramel
and
alcohol
present
along
with
a
zippy
tongue
feel
this
is
one
of
the
better
arcadia
brews
i
have
tried
so
far
this
beer
is
also
deceptive
in
that
it
feels
like
you
are
drinking
a
higheralcohol
beer
than
you
actually
are
this
beer
was
black
as
sin
and
had
a
light
bubbly
head
that
that
left
some
oily
lace
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
sweetness
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
some
sweetness
i
could
not
place
the
body
was
lighter
than
some
others
of
this
style
but
not
a
bad
start
for
this
company
a
super
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
spots
and
streaks
on
the
glass
nose
has
so
much
to
offer
and
delight
in
the
bourbon
is
well
represented
without
being
too
big
it
sets
a
platform
that
allows
the
malt
of
the
ale
to
offer
toffee
and
caramel
against
the
notes
of
smoked
cherry
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
a
hint
of
oak
some
toasted
coconut
and
vanilla
flows
throughout
taste
is
superb
balanced
and
complex
lots
of
scotch
ale
in
the
front
with
its
typical
burnished
maltiness
cherries
and
vanilla
follow
with
the
oak
dryness
leading
to
a
mild
hop
presence
lots
of
subtle
complexities
caramel
and
dark
fruits
toffee
and
roasted
grains
feel
is
full
and
creamy
with
just
a
few
points
off
for
a
bit
of
thinness
that
seems
to
affect
the
bottle
im
having
last
one
seemed
a
bit
better
carbonated
still
a
good
feeling
glass
this
time
around
with
a
mild
smooth
feel
and
satisfying
swallow
a
stupendous
beer
al
the
way
around
the
seemingly
perfect
melding
of
scotch
ale
and
bourbon
barrels
has
me
wondering
about
the
prominence
of
stout
instead
of
a
good
wee
heavy
this
is
just
outstanding
never
had
a
scotch
ale
before
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
but
maybe
because
this
is
barrel
aged
i
dunno
but
its
good
and
ill
seek
out
more
of
this
type
o
fantastic
fantastic

again

me
away

to

an
incredible
brew
that
has
lots
of
similarities
to
backwoods

with
a

more

and
sweetness
o
this
is
a
great
beer
so
glad
i
had
it
and
would
always
try
it
again
overall
its
very
slick
and
the
butterscotch
flavor
almost
takes
over
the
bourbon
keeps
it
pretty
interesting
though
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
bourbon
barrels
worked
overtime
on
this
majestic
offering
the
nose
is
as
expected
with
rich
toffee
and
a
classic
bourbon
scent
the
smooth
almost
creamy
beverage
is
a
comfortable
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
sense
of
higher
abv
than
the
beer
offers
the
nice
tingle
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
is
reminiscent
of
a
well
aged
bourbon
this
one
is
a

and

note
2014
vintage
overall
really
nice
smell
nice
body
and
a
good
blend
of
flavors
would
happily
drink
again
overall
so
glad
i
picked
this
up
again
i
didnt
fall
in
love
with
it
last
year
but
this
fresh
bottle
is
fantastic
if
its
in
your
market
it
is
well
worth
the
13ish
4pack
price
id
rank
it

of
this
years

but
just
behind
bba
bw
would
be
awesome
if
this
were
aged
in
some
highland
barrels
cw
brings
it
again
it
seems
like
they
cant
miss
on
their
barrel
program
drank
this
at
nearly
room
temp
and
was
fairly
well
blown
away
this
viscous
concoction
pours
a
dark
amber
with
minimal
head
and
oily
lacing
the
nose
and
taste
are
an
explosion
of
vanilla
and
caramel
and
just
the
right
amount
of
booze
this
brew
was
good
enough
that
i
actually
had
regret
after
drinking
it
i
should
have
shared
it
with
a
buddy
one
hell

the

was
the

i
like
how

i
must
try
backwoods

one
of
these
days
in
order
to
compare
o
so
drinkable
its
crazy
i
think
i
even
prefer
this
to
backwoods

o
overall
excellent
beer
a
great
take
on
a
great
style
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
o
i
loves
me
some

this
was
truly
an
awesome
one
o
i
think
i
covered
this
its
frigging
fantastic
o
scotch
ales
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
really
good
definitely
worth
a
try

lets
you
down
on
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
its
description
or
hype
felt
that
it
needed
more
barrel
aging
probably
would
have
liked
it
better
in
a
blind
taste
test
not
knowing
it
was
barrel
aged
or
if
i
hadnt
smelled
it
first
o
another
gem
from
central
waters
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
and
its
shows
that
they
really
know
their
barrel
aging
want
more
served
in
a
noda
snifter
kind
of
a
muddy
brown
body
and
not
much
carbonation
this
will
instantly
draw
comparisons
to
backwoods
bastard
which
i
tend
to
favor
this
will
also
draw
comparisons
to
the
other
barrel
aged
beers
in
the
cw
arsenal
which
i
also
tend
to
favor
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
the
barrel
flavors
are
spot
on
but
could
be
turned
up
a
notch
in
my
opinion
nice
toffee
notes
throughout
o
really
nice
this
is
right
up
there
with
backwoods
as
the
finest
scotch
ale
ive
had
barrel
character
is
nice
the
touch
of
smoke
is
really
welcome
with
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
just
balanced
enough
but
plenty
of
nice
bourbon
flavors
id
love
to
side
by
side
this
and
backwoods
some
day
but
during
the
day
i
had
this
in
tampa
it
reminded
me
a
ton
of
one
of
my
favorites
mouthfeel
is
something
special
and
the
wee
heavy
and
bourbon
balance
is
great
o
good
flavor
and
decent
depth
and
complexity
really
a
well
made
delicious
beer
its
a
bit
sweet
but
theres
so
much
going
on
with
the
flavor
profile
i
really
didnt
mind
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
a
single
bottle
but
regardless
this
is
an
impressive
beer
o
this
beer
had
some
very
nice
flavors
of
barrel
and
malt
sugars
but
the
odd
flavors
of
pencils
really
got
in
the
way
of
enjoying
the
rest
of
the
beer
overall
its
a
decent
brew
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
overall
this
was
just
an
incredible
beer
maybe
its
just
that
i
havent
had
any
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
scotch
ales
but
this
really
blew
me
away
thanks
a
lot
to
coirm
for
the
bottle
another
well
done
brew
by
cw
oenjoyed
this
a
lot
right
up
there
with
backwoods
bastard
really
nice
a
touch
more
body
would
elevate
this
o
an
absolutely
killer
ba
scotch
ale
easily
might
be
the
best
in
the
style
i
have
had
thus
far
maybe
even
better
than
founders
backwoods
bastard
but
to
confirm
i
might
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
a
chance
to
try
a
delicious
sweet
candylike
liquid
bliss
of
a
beer
do
not
let
this
one
out
of
your
sight
if
you
see
it
buy
it
judgement
another
recommended
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
aged
behemoth
o
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
bourbon
barrel
beers
but
this
one
i
enjoyed
with
the
flovors
melding
nicely
together
balanced
this
is
pretty
fantastic
while
im
not
a
big
fan
of
their
scotch
ale
after
the
bourbon
barrels
this
is
great
that
sweet
toasted
malt
pairs
wonderfully
against
the
vanilla
from
the
barrels
id
almost
say
the
scotch
ale
works
better
than
a
stout
to
highlight
the
bourbon
barrels
if
you
like
bourbon
aged
things
or
scotch
ales
this
is
highly
recommended
this
kicks
ass
i
can
feel
the
bourbon
leaching
out
of
my
pores
like
after
a
good
garlic
pizza
i
probably
smell
like
it
the
base
beer
is
overshadowed
but
its
so
good
who
cares
excellent
beer
for
the
equivalent
of
6bomber
how
can
you
beat
it
overall
the
beer
is
perfectly
aged
not
overbearing
with
bourbon
smell
and
taste
yet
always
lingering
around
perfect
palate
is
a
great
finish
to
a
very
well
done
beer
i
loved
it
o
central
waters
rich
malty
scotch
ale
is
the
perfect
candidate
for
barrel
aging
and
who
else
does
barrel
aging
as
well
ready
to
drink
fresh
the
barrelaging
is
balanced
perfectly
and
brings
relaxed
soothing
additions
to
the
beer
not
flagrant
booze
for
another
stellar
addition
to
their
brewers
reserve
collection
and
an
exceptional
transition
from
fall
to
winter
when
the
big
barrelaged
stouts
come
out
medium
bodied
smooth
easy
to
drink
with
perfect
carbonation
a
very
well
made
beer
which
i
would
buy
again
gladly
overall
a
very
good
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
bold
barrel
presence
and
some
good
toasty
caramel
malt
flavor
its
a
very
solid
barrel
aged
beer
the
scotch
ale
contributes
a
nice
sweet
side
with
earthy
tones
very
enjoyable
othis
is
an
elite
offerings
one
of
the
my
favorite
beers
of
alltime
these
fuckers
do
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
right
o
highly
enjoyable
offering
from
central
waters
admittedly
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
their
regular
scotch
ale
but
doggone
it
they
aged
it
in
some
bourbon
barrels
and
it
tastes
fantastic
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
with
a
few
minor
flaws
has
some
great
qualities
but
fails
where
it
matters
most
still
a
worthwhile
drinking
experience
but
it
is
no
backwoods
bastard
overall
this
was
a
great
scotch
ale
i
would
love
to
put
some
of
these
away
i
have
had
some
great
experiences
aging
some
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
brews
and
im
sure
this
will
be
no
exception
spot
on
scotch
ale
nice
barrel
aging
a
quality
beer
o
very
nice
aroma
the
taste
is
almost
very
good
but
not
quite
therethe
bitterness
is
not
really
complementary
and
i
think
it
could
use
some
richness
tasty
stuff
there
are
other
better
bourbonbarrel
scotch
ales
around
but
not
many
id
definitely
drink
it
again
though
only
when
im
in
the
mood
for
such
a
thing
o
i
am
surprised
by
how
sweet
the
beer
manages
to
be
while
still
remaining
balanced
the
first
things
i
notice
are
all
sugary
vanilla
coconut
caramel
toffee
candied
nuts
etc
even
the
bourbon
is
sweet
but
then
a
light
roasted
flavor
oak
tannin
and
relatively
small
sharp
carbonation
come
together
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
still
sweet
but
not
quite
a
dessert
beer
great
take
on
a
scotch
ale
o
a
very
nice
barrelaged
scotch
ale
more
on
the
dark
roasty
side
than
im
used
to
for
scotch
ales
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
poured
into
darkness
glass
appearance
is
a
deep
dark
amber
with
minimal
light
passage
some
tan
head
upon
pour
with
moderate
retention
the
nose
starts
with
mellow
bourbon
notes
mainly
vanilla
some
malt
base
is
present
at
the
back
a
touch
of
smoke
and
peat
paired
with
caramel
taste
starts
out
with
smooth
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
oak
the
oak
seems
to
add
some
acidity
to
the
flavor
not
sure
if
this
is
intent
all
or
what
light
bitterness
present
next
with
strong
caramel
and
a
metallic
twinge
on
the
finish
i
cant
help
but
perceive
the
beginnings
of
the
infected
flavors
i
experienced
in
peruvian
morning
perhaps
this
is
just
from
some
astringency
from
the
oak
as
it
stands
this
is
a
tasty
brew
but
im
not
sure
how
long
this
one
will
hold
up
overall
job
well
done
nice
balance
to
this
complex
beer
o
another
great
bb
offering
from
cw
this
one
is
outstanding
d
smells
great
although
i
think
a
12oz
bottle
would
be
a
pretty
hefty
serving
it
took
me
awhile
to
work
through
my
chalice
still
its
pretty
nice
stuff
and
a
definite
return
to
form
for
central
waters
after
some
middling
and
off
beers
central
waters
has
yet
another
fine
ba
offering
here
i
plan
to
age
2
of
my
bottles
to
see
how
it
develops
subtlety
is
strong
in
this
one
oxymoron
overall
the
bourbon
is
overpowering
the
base
beer
here
ill
sit
on
a
few
of
these
and
see
if
that
will
fade
over
time
o
great
on
tap
wish
i
remembered
this
one
more
but
ill
wait
to
buy
in
bottles
at
the
end
of
the
day
though
central
waters
knocks
another
one
out
of
the
park
in
their
brewers
reserve
bourbon
barrel
series
2
more
time
in
the
barrel
to
mellow
out
the
boozey
burn
found
in
this
beer
a
perfect
example
lies
in
what
central
waters
did
this
year
with
all
the
barrel
aged
offerings
2013
vintages
of
the
cw
brewers
reserve

for

instead
of

practiced
this
made
such
a
remarkable
difference
in
the
quality

i
dont
drink
bourbon
but
i
dont
mind
bourbon
e
g
bcbs
if
i
wanted
straight
up
bourbon
i
would
invest
in
a
good
bottle
of
bourbon
the
bourbon
is
strong
here
but
it
is
at
the
expense
of
the
base
beer
which
i
can
barely
taste
i
cant
help
but
think
that
central
waters
just
threw
slainte
into
used
bourbon
barrels
as
a
money
grab
slainte
is
a
fine
scotch
ale
on
its
own
but
it
does
not
get
much
of
a
chance
to
shine
here
as
a
style
comparison
this
is
nowhere
close
to
being
in
the
neighborhood
of
backwoods
bastard
or
ba
big
sound
as
a
local
comparison
i
consider
shaggin
in
the
wood
to
be
significantly
better
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
to
most
but
if
you
enjoy
a
strong
bourbon
flavour
this
is
probably
your
beer
o
almost
as
good
as
bwb
and
great
to
have
in
the
summer
time
when
very
few
ba
beers
or
scotch
ales
are
available
im
not
aging
this
because
i
think
it
is
perfect
to
drink
right
now
o
another
great
brew
from
central
waters
barrel
program
this
is
a
very
good
ba
scotch
ale
that
with
a
little
more
body
would
be
terrific
i
will
gladly
pick
up
a
case
this
year
and
seek
it
out
again
next
year
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
scotch
ales
as
the
alcohol
is
not
too
in
your
face
usually
not
a
fan
of
linenkugels
beers
but
this
beer
was
4
bucks
and
was
2
years
old
so
i
figured
what
the
hell
overall
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
it
was
a
pleasant
experience
and
i
would
recommend
picking
up
a
single
if
you
get
the
chance
well
this
beer
was
certainly
an
adventure
as
a
wee
heavy
its
an
utter
headscratcher
but
as
a
sour
ale
its
a
rather
creative
interpretation
with
the
prominent
dose
of
anise
integrating
remarkably
well
with
the
tartness
the
alcohol
strikes
a
good
balance
between
character
and
concealment
allowing
it
to
remain
highly
drinkable
in
spite
of
approaching
doubledigit
abv
leinenkugels

arm
has
shown
promise
in
some
of
its
other
offerings
as
well
even
if
they
havent
quite
hit
the
bullseye
just
yet
this
is
worth
trying
if
only
for
the
novel
experience
and
even
more
so
for
the
sour
ale
aficionado
found
this
at
a
local

2012
vintage
and
scooped
one
up
not
too
thrilled
when
i
noticed
leinenkugel
on
the
label
which
i
associate
with
the
annoying
tv
commercials
about
shandy
but
got
over
it
decided
to
perform
a
memory
charm
to
you
harry
potter
fans
to
wipe
the
negative
associations
away
before
trying
it
i
have
to

i
dont

if
the

was

or

but
this
is
something
i
will
not
buy
again
the
smell
was
sweet

others
reviewed

this
bottle
had
know

it
was
all
sour

not
hoppy
bitter

sour
i
have
tasted
a
few
scotch
ales
so
far
and
this
did
not
taste
anywhere
near
the
others
too
thin
in
the
mouth
feel
i
poured
it
out
because
i
could
not
stand
the
way
the
sourness
was
overpowering
it
was
almost
like
a
sour
of
something
that
has
spoiled
like
a
dairy
product
for
a
wee
heavy
it
is
wonderful
taste
very
similar
to
scotty
karate
from
dark
horse
it
is
a
great
sipping
beer
it
starts
off
with
a
bitter
bite
but
ends
with
almost
no
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
nose
is
sublime
will
definitely
be
enjoying
this
wonderful
brew
again
by
far
the
best
of

was
the

ive
had
todate
o
a
pretty
tasty
take
on
the
style
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
fullness
in
the
nose
to
savor
especially
with
that
big
abv
available
to
deliver
it
the
level
of
toast
in
the
malt
bill
does
a
great
job
of
balancing
the
sugars
so
they
dont
make
this
beer
too
sweet
to
enjoy
i
know
i
liked
it
enough
after
the
first
couple
of
bottles
to
make
a
point
of
grabbing
a
second
fourpak
whats
interesting
about
this
beer
is
the
way
the
burnt
wood
shows
up
only
in
the
backend
of
the
finish
giving
it
a
campfire
feel
rjt
o
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
with
the
flavors
being
sweet
and
malty
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
is
a
tad
sweet
for
me
though
pours
an
almost
opaque
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
molasses
caramel
toffee
and
slight
smoke
aromas
there
is
also
a
slight
funk
smell
that
i
am
getting
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
much
the
same
with
smoke
and
bandaid
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
smoke
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
smell
that
is
quite
sweet
and
sugary
but
it
doesnt
really
show
in
the
taste
d
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
but
enjoyable
o
very
enjoyable
havent
had
many
of
this
style
so
cant
wait
to
expand
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
as
rich
and
flavorful
as
some
other
scotch
ales
the
lemony
notes
provide
a
pleasantly
dry
finish
and
some
balance
but
i
dont
believe
its
necessary
in
this
style
it
should
be
all
about
deep
rich
malt
flavors
even
at
the
expense
of
a
dry
finish
i
prefer
a
scotch
ale
with
a
sweeter
finish
overall
meh
nothing
special
too
much
smoked
malt
that
doesnt
go
far
and
nothing
else
really
hops
try
to
do
something
but
cant
even
compete
everything
else
pretty
much
drowns
out
is
this
a
smoked
malt
beer
or
a
scotch
ale
poured
into
a
macandrews

oddly

a
reasonable
domestic
take
on
this
style
but
not
as
full
flavored
or
complex
as
i
expected
for
such
a
high
abv
ale
fun
to
drink
but
not
quite
a

scotch
ale
thanks
evan
you
rule
mate
overall
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
and
mostly
good
things
not
a
big
fan
while
i
love
scotch
ales
this
ones
after
taste
is
just
too
rusty
and
weird
i
have
always
believed
that
good
beers
do
not
linger
after
a
sip
for
more
than
20
seconds
this
one
lingered
too
long
if
you
like
scotch
ales
and
i
do
go
for
the
oskar

brew
old
chub

the

a

worth

try

get
your

fix
this
is
a
nice
one
by
them
one
of
the
few
usually
this
line
is
hit
or
miss
i
do
mean
the
big
eddy
so
its
nice
to
have
a
hit
overall
i
really
loved
big
eddy
ris
so
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
scotch
ale
unfortunately
i
found
the
alcohol
to
be
a
bit
overbearing
and
the
rest
of
the
flavors
to
not
come
together
as
well
here
as
in
other
scotch
ales
i
will
finish
up
more
four
pack
but
will
not
rush
out
to
get
this
again
o
im
really
glad
leines
surprised
me
with
this
one
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
imo
because
it
really
has
all
the
elements
it
should
particularly
the
peat
and
smoke
if
they
had
ramped
up
the
malt
profile
a
bit
maybe
with
bigger
caramel
toffee
and
sweet
notes
this
would
have
been
an
out
of
this
world
beer
enjoyable
and
good
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
had
an
old
chub
earlier
and
followed
up
with
this
to
compare
this
had
a
much
stronger
smell
and
taste
to
it
old
chub
is
great
but
it
is
more
subdued
than
this
beer
the
peat
and
the
dark
fruit
have
a
distinct
presence
and
make
it
stand
out
from
the
other
scotch
ales
ive
have
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
great
beer
very
fruit
forward
here
big
rustic
malts
as
well
there
was
only
a
hint
of
roast
and
no
smokiness
but
the
fruit
made
up
for
it
pretty
good
for
the
style
the
big
eddy
series
is
on
a
roll
except
for
the
dipa
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
delicious
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
been
getting
into
scotch
ales
recently
and
this
is
my
favorite
thus
far
i
know
it
doesnt
have
the
highest
ba
rating
but
it
is
absolutely
one
to
try
really
good
on
tap
pours
a
a
very
dark
brown
with
just
a
touch
of
red
when
the
light
hits
it
just
right
it
has
a
medium
light
head
to
it
with
a
nice
darker
almond
color
when
it
is
there
the
lacing
can
be
a
wee
heavypun
intended
and
linger
on
the
glass
it
smells
of
burnt
brown
sugar
ala
creme
bruľe
with
the
slightest
touch
of
peat
the
taste
overall
is
kind
of
sweet
with
a
bitterness
that
hits
the
back
of
your
tongue
with
a
smokey
peat
flavour
that
lingers
and
completes
the
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
hints
at
syrup
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
over
all
this
is
a
delightful
beer
especially
for
those
who
enjoy
a
a
touch
of
smokiness
in
their
adult
beverages
half
finger
off
white
head
with
poor
retention
on
a
murky
amber
brown
body
some

aroma
is
very
sweet
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
molasses
brown
sugar
and
burnt
caramel
flavors
of
sour
citrus
dark
fruit
mostly
plum
burnt
oak
roasted
nuts
molasses
and
chocolate
medium
chewy
body
and
moderate
carbonation
very
complex
and
full
flavored
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
of
the
style
o
first
commercial
wee
heavy
ive
had
since
schells
2012
wee
heavy
its
nice
i
would
have
liked
a
little
better
head
retention
to
seal
the
deal
but
overall
its
almost
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
i
drank
it
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
and
im
gonna
try
a
pint
glass
and
a
slightly
more
aggressive
pour
to
see
if
that
helps
the
head
out
i
know
i
should
cellar
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
i
have
but
to
hell
with
it
this
is
delicious
cheers
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
really
packs
a
punch
no
doubt
it
is
cloying
the
nose
is
full
of
floral
and
caramel
notes
that
lend
well
to
the
style
mouthfeel
is
very
sweet
lots
of
sugar
left
behind
overall
a
big
cloying
brew
but
not
in
a
bad
way
liked
it
overall
enjoyable
scotch
ale
a
nice
sipper
to
keep
you
warm
cheers
though
the
dry
peat
taste
is
moderate
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
lumbering
this
beer
is
indeed
complex
and
strong
and
the
peat
influence
is
strong
all
of
which
create
a
sense
of
power
and
complexity
overall
i
would
really
enjoy
this
beer
if
the
peat
flavor
correct
for
the
style
was
less
apparent
hes
big
but
only
a
wee
bit
heavy
sorry
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
rubybrown
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
roasted
malts
clove
brown
sugar
light
molasses
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
and
a
smidge
of
fig
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
at
the
start
but
as
things
progress
a
definite
sense
of
strong
banana
weaves
its
way
betwixt
all
the
other
flavors
it
gets
pretty
damn
strong
at
times
competing
directly
with
the
spicy
roast
for
my
tastebuds
attentions
and
detracting
from
the
overall
wee
heavy
experience
near
the
finish
this
banana
bit
starts
to
appear
a
bit
toasted
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
decently
solid
scotch
ale
but
one
whose
banana
character
holds
it
down
d
a
very
nice
wee
heavy
here
from
leinenkugels
there
big
eddy
line
of
brews
has
some
very
nice
offerings
this
one
is
a
sipper
a
nice
brew
to
sit
back
and
unwind
with
i
would
gladly
drink
again
and
recommend
to
fans
of
the
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
style
i
think
i
mightve
gotten
an
infected
bottle
or
a
bad
batch
either
way
this
was
pretty
nasty
and
not
a
scotch
ale
i
would
buy
again
overall
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
would
definitely
drink
this
again
when
im
in
the
mood
it
wasnt
amazing
by
my
standards
but
it
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
if
you
enjoy
a
big
malty
beer
i
think
that
this
is
worth
your
time
at
least
once
wellcrafted
example
of
this
style
overall
i
am
pleased
with
my
first
taste
of
the
big
eddy
series
and
look
forward
to
more
of
them
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
its
got
a
very
intriguing
palate
and
complexity
to
it
o
this
is
a
nice
wee
heavy
the
big
eddy
series
is
pretty
good
overall
doesnt
have
everything
i
want
in
a
scotch
ale
but
its
quite
a
lot
more
interesting
than
berry
weiss
the
palate
however
is
mildly
disappointing
opening
with
plenty
of
malt
character
this
has
some
heavily
toasted
malt
burnt
sugar
bitterness
toffee
some
grainy
astringency
and
is
in
general
rather
intense
the
leather
pairs
quite
well
with
the
dark
brown
sugar
and
dark
caramel
but
ultimately
the
lack
of
balance
is
to
the
beers
detriment
nice
flavors
of
rum
and
raisins
are
also
present
rather
dry
and
highly
carbonated
this
beer
finishes
with
flavors
of
burnt
sugar
brown
sugar
and
some
sweetness
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
is
noticeable
as
well
mediumlight
in
body
this
beer
is
quite
nice
on
the
palate
but
for
the
high
carbonation
as
it
warms
up
and
the
carbonation
dies
down
it
improves
significantly
and
im
upping
my
t
score
to
3
5
this
is
a
mediocre
scotch
ale
the
apple
notes
are
intense
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
its
much
better
than
the
usual
leinenkugal
offerings
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
again
this
is
pretty
run
of
the
mill
as
weeheavys
go
so
far
big
eddy
has
failed
to
impress
me
this
is
a
stye
i
love
but
this
one
is
noting
special
but
would
do
in
pinch
pours
very
dark
but
still
barely
transparent
with
a
small
tanyellow
head
the
smell
is
unlike
any
other
wee
heavy
ive
had
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
smells
mostly
of
tobacco
the
taste
is
pretty
much
more
of
the
same
i
knew
it
would
be
sweet
but
was
still
rather
taken
aback
by
the
astounding
sweetness
i
was
affronted
with
i
love
sweet
beers
and
after
a
few
sips
i
was
ok
with
the
level
of
sweetness
but
its
definitely
the
sweetest
beer
of
the
style
that
ive
encountered
and
at
first
i
thought
it
was
too
much
it
also
has
a
smoky
tobaccolike
taste
and
a
roasted
malt
bitterness
its
very
sticky
its
definitely
within
style
but
is
an
extreme
example
of
the
characteristics
with
which
the
style
is
generally
described
very
sweet
very
alcoholic
very
smoky
particularly
tobaccolike
flavours
and
all
bitterness
is
roasted
maltderived
this
is
an
extreme
example
of
the
style
so
be
prepared
its
not
bad
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
but
its
right
on
the
edge
of
being
overthetop
o
this
one
started
to
grow
on
me
as
it
warmed
up
in
my
glass
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
another
one
anytime
soon
but
im
not
against
trying
it
again
when
they
release
it
a
solid
scotch
ale
displays
the
allimportant
smokiness
i
enjoy
it
much
more
than
the
other
big
eddys
on
tap
yesterday
at
tylers
in
durham
poured
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
nice
sticky
12
finger
off
white
headnice
color
defination
and
a
nice
head
to
the
pour
alot
of
caramel
in
the
nose
it
seemed
to
dominate
a
bitlighter
dark
fruit
and
even
a
little
faint
woodsmoke
wich
was
nice
caramel
toffeebutterscotch
flavors
abound
wich
isnt
really
a
bad
thing
but
it
was
dominantthere
is
a
decent
woodyearthy
notes
in
the
finish
my
first
big
eddy
try
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
gooda
little
sweet
but
not
bad
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
one
that
i
will
purchase
again
there
are
some
nice
flavors
here
but
really
no
depth
or
complexity
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
watery
as
this
warms
the
booze
picks
up
too
i
loved
the
big
eddy
ris
but
this
scotch
ale
seems
to
falter
a
bit
beer
is
malty
and
heavy
with
a
thin
forward
with
alcohol
very
boozy
strong
on
the
palate
it
is
a
big
big
beer
not
for
the
light
hearted
a
very
big
scotch
ale
it
is
probably
not
a
repeat
for
me
but
i
did
enjoy
it
nice
as
it
is
though
im
not
overly
impressed
a
solid
offering
and
another
nice
one
from
the
big
eddy
series
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
could
use
a
little
more
in
there
also
the
high
alcohol
is
not
having
any
effect
untilwhoa
here
it
comes
overall
fruit
forward
with
limited
dark
malt
presence
served
on
tap
in
a
snifter
at
lucky
monk
appearance
is
a
deep
redbrown
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
the
nose
features
sweet
molasses
and
caramel
zero
hop
character
present
a
hint
of
smokiness
present
taste
is
very
sweet
with
some
candied
fruit
caramel
toffee
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
seems
off
for
the
style
and
abv
overall
this
is
a
lackluster
wee
heavy
the
flavor
is
minimal
and
watered
down
this
certainly
does
not
meet
the
level
of
quality
that
the
big
eddy
ris
wee
heavy
scotch
ale
poured
a
darker
brown
color
with
nice
sized
head
that
quickly
disapated
the
smell
was
a
bit
lighter
and
a
little
boozy
the
taste
had
a
nice
sharp
bite
and
notes
of
black
licorice
but
was
a
bit
watery
flavor
could
have
been
fuller
but
wasnt
too
watery
overall
not
a
bad
beer
better
then
other
lenienkugel
beers
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
feel
a
little
let
down
by
the
lack
of
powerfull
smokey
notes
and
how
quickly
the
tastes
dissipate
and
lack
of
a
strong
mouthfeel
but
i
could
easily
drink
this
with
a
nice
steak
or
pork
for
those
reasons
and
be
happy
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
a
little
sticky
and
the
retention
was
pretty
good
too
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
lot
of
earthy
smokey
malts
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
smokier
than
i
expected
i
think
that
the
smoke
in
this
one
is
a
little
too
heavy
for
this
style
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
is
spot
on
though
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
thick
with
a
gentle
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
liked
the
beer
i
cant
see
buying
a
lot
of
them
but
i
didnt
love
it
or
hate
its
worth
trying
in
my
opinion
this
isnt
in
the
same
league
as
the
big
eddy
ris
the
smoke
while
not
bad
is
a
surprise
everything
else
plays
off
of
it
pretty
good
but
seems
a
bit
underdeveloped
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
brew
a
wonderful
brew
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
very
quite
soothing
and
warming
not
a
huge
leinenkugel
fan
but
this
was
delicious
o
not
a
bad
beer
or
wee
heavy
if
you
like
the
style
its
a
good
beer
for
your
money
o
not
bad
i
like
my
scotch
ales
and
this
is
a
good
smokey
scotch
check
this
out
and
enjoy
it
i
know
i
did
the
big
eddy
series
is
solid
so
far
overall
not
a
bad
wee
heavy
by
far
its
sweet
and
has
a
great
body
also
packs
a
punch
much
better
than
the
ris
by
far
o
a
very
good
beer
however
it
seems
a
bit
overly
sweet
for
the
style
not
enough
toasted
flavor
for
my
taste
while
it
definitely
is
good
heres
definitely
better
choices
for
the
style
with
the
hefty
price
tag
i
highly
doubt
ill
end
up
drinking
this
again
worth
the
try
if
youre
a
leinenkugals
fan
though
very
nice
get
it
a
go
tis
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
cherry
wood
in
color
with
a
one
finger
beige
colored
head
the
foamy
head
only
lasted
a
couple
minutes
it
smells
of
plenty
of
sweet
malts
toffee
light
butterscotch
and
caramelized
sugar
with
an
ever
so
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
flavors
are
nice
and
complex
it
features
an
array
of
malt
flavors
such
as
toffee
caramel
cocoa
cherry
butterscotch
and
cream
its
surprisingly
well
rounded
the
cocoa
comes
around
a
bit
more
n
the
after
taste
its
sweet
without
being
overpowering
and
the
lighter
mouthfeel
probably
aids
that
it
drinks
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
in
body
but
isnt
sticky
at
all
the
aftertaste
is
really
nice
its
interesting
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
scotch
ale
the
big
eddy
series
mpressed
once
again
overall
this
was
certainly
an
interesting
beer
its
got
a
complex
but
not
quite
perfect
flavor
and
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
makes
it
hard
to
appreciate
the
flavors
this
has
to
offer
its
nice
to
see
leinies
is
trying
to
enter
the
craft
beer
market
but
i
really
was
expecting
something
better
out
of
this
the
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
wee
heavy
i
get
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
and
some
peet
malt
as
well
as
some
caramel
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
the
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
notes
are
dominant
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
smoke
hiding
in
the
background
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
body
is
medium
with
enough
going
on
to
stay
interesting
its
a
bit
smooth
but
not
completely
with
a
touch
of
a
crisp
note
just
in
the
front
it
goes
just
a
touch
thinnish
likely
from
the
alcohol
overall
not
exceptional
but
a
very
decent
effort
from
leinie
oleinies
big
eddy
series
does
it
again
a
wee
heavy
that
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
wee
heavy
most
everything
seemed
on
par
with
this
beer
expect
for
the
aroma
and
the
body
this
beer
was
pretty
drinkable
for
a
wee
heavy
just
about
as
drinkable
as
dirty
bastard
and
it
hides
its
alcohol
really
well
i
could
drink
another
one
if
i
had
it
pretty
impressive
for
the
style
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
nice
and
complex
flavors
this
beer
looked
damn
good
and
the
added
peat
smoke
flavors
made
for
a
nice
and
complex
wee
heavy
what
i
like
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
the
body
the
aroma
was
going
in
the
right
direction
till
i
got
to
the
out
of
place
sour
and
vinegar
aromas
and
the
body
could
have
been
just
a
little
thicker
i
might
buy
a
single
of
this
beer
again
if
i
feel
like
it
but
it
for
sure
doesnt
come
close
to
knocking
off
dirty
bastard
as
my
go
to
wee
heavy
if
you
are
a
wee
heavy
fan
you
should
give
this
beer
a
try
i
found
everything
except
the
aroma
to
be
on
par
for
the
style
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
solid
wee
heavy
and
with
a
little
work
on
the
aroma
and
body
it
could
be
able
to
hold
its
own
against
some
of
the
big
names
of
the
style
i
wasnt
to
impressed
with
the
big
eddy
ris
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
nice
improvement
and
i
am
for
sure
down
to
check
out
more
beers
from
the
big
eddy
series
if
the
trend
continues
and
these
beers
keep
improving
then
there
will
be
some
great
things
to
look
forwards
in
this
series
good
job
leinenkugels
thanks
for
making
limited
release
beers
for
the
connoisseurs
we
appreciate
it
a
decent
attempt
at
a
scotch
ale
from
this
brewery
very
drinkable
and
you
could
barely
taste
the
9
5
the
only
problem
was
that
those
were
the
only
two
qualities
that
stood
out
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
just
kind
of
one
dimensional
overall
the
scotch
ale
style
is
really
growing
on
me
this
one
isnt
quite
great
yet
but
very
good
overall
nice
flavors
that
have
the
potential
to
blend
with
a
little
more
time
at
a
price
thats
tough
to
pass
up
i
feel
i
can
support
this
endeavor
an
interesting
beer
that
will
allow
you
to
really
expand
your
palate
and
is
nice
with
a
hefty
steak
in
front
of
you
deep
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
1

sweet

rounded
out
by
a
lightly
kilned
malt
taste
and
some
alcohol
low
carbonation
creamy
thins
out
slightly
on
the
finish
reminds
me
of
some
ancient
scotch
ale
unrefined
and
very
raw
big
bold
one
note
flavors
that
have
their
moment
in
your
mouth
then
fizzle
decent
but
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
o
with
relatively
low
expectations
i
was
overly
impressed
with
this
leinenkugels
treat
its
refreshing
to
see
a
noncraft
brewery
stepping
in
and
showing
they
have
a
true
understanding
of
the
brewing
climate
as
it
is
today
and
ultimately
being
a
part
of
it
12oz

cloying
and
with
the
high
abv
its
definitely
a
sipper
good
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
perhaps
the
consistency
of
this
one
is
off
because
i
did
not
encounter
some
of
the
nastiness
that
others
seem
to
be
getting
this
this
one
leinie
haters
perhaps
i
thought
it
was
good
overalll
ignoring
style
and
cost
this
might
get
a
22
5
taking
those
into
consideration
it
gets
dinged
a
bit
further
the
hard
part
to
get
over
is
leinenkugels
is
making
craft
style
ales
that
are
up
nearing
10
abv
yet
they
pour
like
fizzy
yellow
carbonated
beers
the
color
is
nailed
a
deep
ruby
nearly
mahogany
body
with
a
light
khaki
head
forming
thick
and
dwindling
and
fading
fast
specks
of

are
said
this
beer
misses
the
boat
on
appearance
aroma

tart

dark
ripened

a
bit
of
booze
marinating
those
plump
jewels

a
hint
of

a
tart
apple
cider
lingering
quality
in
each
sniff
flavor
harsh
acidic
grape
juice
with
ripened
raisins
and
fake
oak
chips
with
a
strong
booze
overriding
the
whole
experience
each
sip
makes
want
to
gag
this
is
truly
the
worst
pseudo
craft
sin
ive
come
across
yet
i
will
drink
a
six
pack
of
the
anheuser
busch
wild
blue
before
i
ever
reach
for
this
again
i
honestly
have
a
headache
from
the
first
sip
drain

with
a
capital
d
get
out
of
here
cloying
gag
inducing

this

please

truly
horrible
creation
and
a
sorry
excuse
for
any

let
alone
something

overall
this
is
was
a
great
wee
heavy
i
am
super
impressed
with
leines
on
this
one
one
of
the
better
wee
heavys
i
have
had
it
is
extremely
drinkable
for
how
high
the
abv
dont
go
into
thinking
this
is
going
to
be
bad
because
its
from
leines
it
is
legit
overall
a
decent
ale
better
than
most
brews
from
leinenkugel
o
while
rich
and
complex
leinies
big
eddy
wee
heavy
never
gets
completely
inyourface
or
potent
rather
like
an
introvert
invites
you
to
discover
its
depth
and
balance
quietly
and
patiently
surprisingly
drinkable
for
its
boastful

this
wee
heavy
is
definitely
worth
its
weight
in
shillings
o
i
like
their
ris
much
better
but
this
is
a
decent
effort
however
there
are
many
better
wee
heavies
out
there
e
g
backwoods
bastard
maybe
this
would
be
more
complex
with
some
age
on
it
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
scent
is
mostly
of
malts
but
some
hints
of
oak
and
nuts
are
present
the
taste
is
more
than
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
there
is
a
smooth
malty
tone
in
the
taste
that
is
reasonably
bold
there
are
also
some
citrus
earthy
hints
hidden
within
a
refreshing
beer
that
has
great
drinkability
to
go
alone
with
a
decent
taste
would
like
to
see
a
little
better
price
on
it
but
what
can
you
do
the
taste
nails
the
style
wonderfully
some
nice
complexity
to
it
also
a
worthy
brew
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
for
salting
away
a
translucent
mahogany
with
an
inch
of
tan
foam
that
faded
quickly
and
didnt
leave
much

smell
was
softly
malty
some
dark

slightly

overall
mild
and
hard
to

was

sweetness
more
dark

cola
lightly
roasted
malt
was
more
apparent
on
the
finish
which
was

fairly
clean

was
a
bit
on
the
light

no
evidence
of
9

abv
decent
enough
but
a
weaker
effort
than
their
ris
o
im
glad
to
see
leinenkugels
reach
outside
of
their
comfort
zone
so
far
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
with
both
this
and
the
ris
im
anxious
to
test
out
the
brews
to
come
in
the
big
eddy
series
iipa
and
a
baltic
porter
from
what
ive
heard
growler
from
brewery
poured
into
snifter
pours
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
into
a
thin
film
with
moderate
lacing
clear
and
reddishbrown
sweet
rich
and
roasted
malty
nose
with
notes
of
toffee
and
dark
fruits
earthy
malty
flavor
notes
of
raisins
and
prunes
rather
straightforward
slightly
metallic
undertones
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
with
mediumheavy
body
and
moderate
carbonation
lingering
on
tip
of
tongue
decently
balanced
overall
i
like
the
feel
and
the
nose
but
i
find
the
flavor
lacking
much
complexity
enjoyable
and
sessionable
i
have
had
better
in
this
style
but
i
would
still
buy
again
overall
a
quite
tasty
scotch
ale
that
isnt
too
overwhelming
the
flavors
and
smell
are
fantastic
but
a
little
thicker
of
a
body
may
have
slightly
more
fitting
overall
though
it
was
a
rather
good
drinker
the
body
is
medium
to
a
little
above
and
the
carbonation
is
a
hair
below
medium
overall
a
very
good
well
balanced
scotch
ale
the
feel
is
this
beers
strong
suit
its
not
phenomenal
but
it
hits
the
balance
in
the
strength
of
body
provides
ample
crispness
and
smoothness
and
remains
consistent
to
the
end
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
a
very
well
balanced
surprisingly
fruity
scotch
ale
definitely
recommended
this
is
a
great
brewery
and
a
very
good
beer
o
this
was
good
overall
i
normally
never
get
the
chance
to
have
a
scotch
ale

i
bought
this
on
a

was

i

this
is
an

all
around

and
very
smooth
to

a

has
a

that
leaves
good

when
sipped
good
carbonation
the
aroma
of
caramel
is
right
up
front
around
with
some
dark
fruit
like
plum
or
berries
very
nice
the
taste
is
also
very
pleasant
with
hints
of
caramel
butterscotch
toffee
and
malts
great
balance
of
flavors
not
a
summer
brew
as
this
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
great
brew
for
cooler
months
for
sure
i
like
the
dark
look
of
this
beer
when
held
to
the
light
ruby
hues
can
be
seen
hops
stand
out
in
the
smell
not
too
much
different
than
an
amber
ale
but
a
little
sweeter
the
taste
is
very
smooth
the
malt
comes
through
with
a
slight
caramel
flavor
pleasant
after
taste
a
well
blended
ale
mouth
feel
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
ill
have
to
try
more
of
big
skys
offerings
they
have
yet
to
disappoint
the
heavy
horse
is
a
good
scotch
ale
not
to
heavy
and
not
to
sweet
the
beer
pours
a
clear
brownish
amber
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
has
sweet
malt
and
touches
of
peat
and
scotch
the
taste
is
a
nice
even
beer
with
heavy
malt
backbone
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
good
and
definitely
sessionable
too
drinkable
mmmmhhhhugggghhn
overall
a
beer
thats
worth
a
try
its
maybe
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
with
quite
a
kick
at
nearly
7
percent
abv
but
a
pretty
good
sipping
beer
overall
the
aromatics
are
this
brews
strong
points
the
taste
could
have
been
given
a
bit
more
bold
characteristics
but
was
still
plenty
flavorful
kettlehouses
coldsmoke
still
holds
the
title
for
me
in
this
category
drinkable
o
aptly
named
brew
heavy
too
heavy
on
most
counts
and
not
something
id
buydrink
again
o
mediocre
but
not
bad
overall
as
normal
big
sky
has
created
another
great
beer
its
not
super
big
but
its
def
a
great
session
ale
thats
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
atmosphere
is
excellent
great
head
and
some
thick
lacing
nose
is
complex
combination
of
malt
fruit
and
tea
candied
malt
flavor
accentuated
with
plum
some
light
bitter
licorice
and
some
sweet
maple
syrup
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
the
flavor
is
very
soft
and
a
bit
thin
with
some
stale
characterizes
i
didnt
taste
any
of
the
rich
malt
flavor
or
any
pot
caramel
or
any
of
the
other
wonderful
characteristics
of
a
scotch
ale
o
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
its
on
the
sweet
side
which
i
tend
to
prefer
relatively
simple
but
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
this
was
better
than
expected
not
extremely
complex
but
super
tasty
its
like
a
comfort
beer
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
this
6
7abv
this
will
be
great
to
have
handy
this
winter
o
if
you
havent
liked
scotch
ales
before
because
of
the
booze
try
this
one
it
is
much
more
subtle
on
the
booze
great
beer
overall
just
another
delicious
brew
from
big
sky
at
6
7
abv
this
is
actually
a
pretty
nice
brew
for
a
late
september
afternoon
makes
for
a
great
autumn
beer
4
5
d
damn
good
beer
big
bold
flavors
that
you
cant
help
but
love
overall
another
great
beer
from
big
sky
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
the
style
and
leaves
me
wanting
another
the
only
thing
i
can
see
wrong
with
it
is
that
its
a
limited
release
i
should
stock
up
on
this
stuff
before
it
goes
away
this
is
how
i
think
beer
should
taste
yuuummmy
overall
very
rich
anyone
trying
to
session
this
might
find
themselves
regretting
their
decision
after
the
first
beer
or
two
consider
this
a
one
off
dessert
beer
cheers
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
though
that
it
was
a
little
below
average
for
the
style
the
look
and
the
aroma
were
going
in
the
right
direction
but
when
it
got
to
the
taste
it
really
fizzled
out
and
left
me
wanting
much
more
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
smooth
but
the
flavor
was
pretty
bland
and
it
couldnt
hold
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
and
im
ready
to
move
onto
something
with
more
flavor
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
they
were
both
were
they
should
be
for
the
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
it
seems
like
all
the
nice
things
i
picked
up
in
the
aroma
never
made
its
way
to
the
taste
and
that
really
hurt
this
beer
this
beer
was
priced
well
but
the
lackluster
taste
really
holds
this
beer
back
and
i
would
much
rather
have
a
dirty
bastard
i
cant
say
that
i
would
recommend
this
beer
i
find
big
sky
to
be
a
pretty
solid
brewery
but
i
was
a
little
let
down
with
beer
as
it
really
didnt
deliver
when
it
came
to
the
flavor
you
guys
make
some
good
and
solid
beers
its
too
bad
this
is
not
one
of
them
better
luck
next
time
looks
like
im
back
to
the
dirty
bastards
a
decent
scotch
ale
smells
and
tastes
very
very
malty
with
very
little
of
the
earthy
depth
many
of
these
style
beers
showcase
palate
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
touch
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
almost
tastes
and
feels
like
a
barleywine
in
that
respect
very
grainy
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
good
i
like
the
fuller
body
on
this
one
and
the
fairly
heavy
carbonation
i
think
serves
it
quite
well
this
isnt
my
favorite
scotch
ale
or
even
my
favorite
big
sky
beer
but
its
sessionable
for
a
its
style
and
its
one
that
works
with
all
kinds
of
food
so
i
will
probably
grab
this
one
again
if
i
see
it
deep
mahogany
an
inch
of
loose
tan
head
manages
to
hang
on
for
the
entire
pint
obvious
caramel
toffee
and
fruitcake
with
a
fairly
balanced
dry
finish
mild
bitterness
and
hopping
clean
and
drinkable
this
one
lacks
the
really
full
malt
depth
to
be
great
but
the
flavors
and
balance
make
it
worth
going
back
for
another
bottle
or
two
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
recommend
to
friends
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
malt
forward
brew
but
not
one
of
the
top
scotch
ales
for
sure
o
i
like
scotch
ales
and
this
one
was
pretty
good
recommended
o
its
ok
but
on
the
spectrum
of
scotch
ales
there
are
many
that
are
above
this
o
tasty
and
refreshing
scotch
ale
but
theres
a
few
i
can
think
of
that
ill
go
to
before
this
one
worth
trying
either
way
review
from
42011
notes
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
red
amber
slight
head
but
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
slight
dark
fruit
flavor
starts
as
with
sweet
and
caramel
malt
some
dark
fruit
somewhat
nutty
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
sour
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
kick
initial
flavors
are
nice
but
the
finish
is
not
great
there
are
better
scotch
ales
out
there
overall
this
was
the
middle
of
the
pack
for
all
three
of
us
i
was
happy
to
try
this
blind
first
before
i
sit
down
with
a
bottle
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
at
a
restaurant
the
ale
produced
a
slight
head
as
scotch
ales
go
this
one
appeared
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
certain
degree
of
cloudines
the
aroma
was
not
incredibly
potent
but
did
produce
a
mild
wheat
flavor
one
may
have
to
really
search
for
an
aroma
here
the
initial
taste
was
a
moderate
level
of
scotch
sweetness
with
a
wheat
backbone
this
flowed
into
the
aftertaste
which
was
mildly
warming
and
yet
somewhat
sour
overall
this
is
a
mild
scotch
ale
it
would
not
standout
in
crowd
of
elite
scotches
but
it
is
an
easy
drinker
overall
i
would
absolutely
go
back
for
seconds
thirds
and
fourths
for
this
ale
overall
id
happily
buy
this
again
and
again
with
a
little
more
richness
it
would
be
in
my
toptier
as
the
flavors
and
aroma
that
are
there
are
top
notch
caramel
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
that
reached
a
height
of
around
an
inch
before
fading
and
leaving
the
top
of
the
glass
mostly
bare
light
lacing
on
the
sides
as
well
aroma
was
spectacular
rich
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
oozing
with
butterscotch
and
sweet
herbal
notes
light
hint
of
a
boozy
alcohol
touch
to
it
at
well
but
it
played
out
quite
nicely
the
first
sip
made
me
fall
back
in
my
chair
simply
brilliant
rich
butterscotch
and
toffee
flavors
roll
across
the
tongue
enormously
sweet
like
a
wonderful
piece
of
hard
candy
each
sip
seemed
more
compelling
then
the
one
before
it
sublime
nice
herbal
hop
notes
playing
it
up
quite
well
and
the
smooth
delicate
caramel
finish
with
a
light
touch
of
booziness
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
the
aftertaste
of
this
medium
bodied
ale
is
a
light
dry
with
hints
of
alcohol
i
was
pretty
pleased
with
this
beer
you
should
check
it
out
if
given
the
opportunity
another
entry
into
the
aw
bhof
big
sky
nailed
it
with
this
brew
simply
nailed
it
it
pours
up
a
deep
mahogany
body
with
a
nice
1finger
head
that
hangs
around
for
quite
a
while
scents
of
rich
malts
and
dark
fruits
like
cherries
and
plums
precede
the
flavors
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
dark
fruits
put
the
sense
of
smell
and
taste
into
overdrive
by
breathing
in
through
your
nose
just
as
you
are
drinking
some
of
this
fine
brew
oh
yeah
theres
just
enough
hit
of
hops
to
make
this
one
amazingly
fine
brew
this
is
a
easy
brew
to
drink
so
keep
track
of
how
many
you
enjoy
o
nice
brew
from
bsb
definitely
worth
purchasing
if
youre
able
to
locate
it
cheers
to
this
unique
brew
feels
full
in
body
though
a
little
lower
in
abv
than
most
wee
heavies
makes
this
beer
a
little
more
enjoyable
very
complex
for
the
weaker
abv
daddy
like
o
a
decent
beer
would
be
nice
if
a
layer
of
flavor
cut
through
some
of
the
sweetness
after
the
initial
taste
o
nice
smooth
not
quite
sweet
yet

i
always

to
get
off
of
a
scotch
ale
a
little
concerned
already
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
scottish
ale
taste
is
pretty
light
caramel
malt
and
bready
sweetness
in
a
package
with
a
thin
flavor
and
a
thin
body
no
depth
in
the
flavor
seems
to
be
short
of
the
style
someone
mentioned
that
it
was
more
like
a
odd
brown
ale
than
a
scotch
ale
and
i
would
say
it
represents
something
more
like
a
scottish
style
ale
or
a
brown
ale
than
a
scotch
ale
overall
this
is
not
nearly
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
overall
it
seems
more
like
a
woody
brown
ale
than
a
scotch
ale
so
i
marked
it
down
there
a
bit
body
is
just
about
medium
to
light
medium
with
a
smooth
clean
profile
to
the
palate
malts
mostly
prevail
but
comes
up
a
bit
short
for
a
being
a
solid
scotch
ale
the
body
and
drinkability
are
probably
the
best
aspect
of
the
entire
experience
of
this
heavy
horse
other
then
its
solid
appearance
about
what
youd
expect
form
big
sky
if
its
not
their
bigger
beers
overall
a
decent
rendition
of
this
style
would
have
it
again
but
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
at
6
7
abv
its
not
quite
a
session
beer
i
might
buy
some
if
i
find
it
when
the
temps
go
up
bbq
parties
come
around
overall
it
was
an
alright
beer
had
a
very
bitter
hoppy
finish
for
a
scotch
ale
i
think
reviewing
it
style
in
mind
was
what
brought
my
grade
down
had
i
not
known
this
was
a
scotch
ale
i
probably
would
not
have
been
able
to
tell
you
it
was
definitely
would
enjoy
this
again
overall
a
good
brew
with
very
good
and
noticeable
stages
in
the
tasting
drinkability
is
fairly
good
this
covers
all
the
things
you
expect
in
a
wee
heavy
only
problem
is
it
isnt
outstanding
this
is
an
excellent
gateway
beer
or
example
of
the
style
without
being
extreme
in
anyway
i
probably
will
purchase
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
sits
pretty
heavy
because
its
not
carbed
at
all
but
still
goes
down
pretty
smooth
overall
pretty
good
scotch
ale
a
little
sweet
and
the
finish
and
aroma
is
a
little
odd
but
for
some
reason
i
simply
like
the
taste
isnt
that
good
enough
d
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
havent
tried
many
scotch
ales
but
this
seems
like
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
was
very
enjoyable
mouthfeeloverall
i
wish
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
body
to
it
pretty
light
bodied
but
not
overcarbonated
which
helps
out
a
bit
overall
a
decent
wee
heavy
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
regular
scottish
ale
and
was
borderline
wowed
but
when
i
saw
that
it
was
in
the
wee
heavy
class
changed
my
assessment
to
solid
and
still
above
average
but
unspectacular
d
very
drinkable
good
all
around
a
good
dark
copper
color
light
uniform
carbonation
nice
solid
head
with
long
legs
at
first
sniff
there
are
light
biscuity
notes
a
second
sniff
brings
more
of
the
same
flavor
is
a
robust
malt
with
a
prominent
alcoholic
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
light
pleasant
tingle
of
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
not
remarkable
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
not
a
big
powerhouse
of
flavors
like
others
in
the
style
but
this
is
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
enough
to
be
well
worth
a
try
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
that
gets
me
excited
its
run
of
the
mill
and
the
cola
cherry
carob
combination
makes
my
stomach
a
little
queezy
d
a
slow
starting
but
powerful
horse
this
beer
is
heavy
horse
certainly
pulls
its
weight
tasty
and
absolutely
gorgeous
its
not
a
perfect
brew
but
its
a
treat
of
a
scotch
ale
nonetheless
big
sky
deserves
more
love
than
they
typically
get
their
ipa
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
and
they
knock
a
few
other
offerings
out
of
the
park
as
well
heavy
horse
scotch
ale
despite
not
being
the
bees
knees
is
still
good
beer
that
is
enjoyable
to
drink
nothing
else
really
matters
in
the
end
d
this
is
a
nice
wee
heavy
ive
had
better
but
it
was
worth
a
try
as
aforementioned
this
one
is
a
delight
to
drink
and
is
going
down
far
too
quickly
i
wish
i
had
more
drinkability
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
this
beer
pours
a
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
nuts
cream
and
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
what
i
think
really
makes
this
beer
wonderful
is
that
no
one
aspect
of
the
flavor
or
aroma
dominates
instead
everything
seems
to
work
well
together
in
perfect
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
this
scotch
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
had
that
last
for
a
fair
while
as
a
good
scent
of
malts
tickles
your
nose
it
has
a
bold
flavor
that
is
not
too
strong
but
also
not
too
weak
either
has
a
slight
nutty
taste
that
finishes
rather
nicely
with
little
after
taste
a
very
nice
find
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wouldnt
say
that
it
classifies
as
a
strong
scotch
or
anything
but
it
comes
across
as
more
like
a
80
schilling
or
something
with
mild
peat
regardless
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
and
would
drink
it
again
as
it
has
a
wellblended
balance
d
very
good
drinkability
especially
since
it
isnt
really
heavy
i
really
like
this
style
of
beer
and
this
offering
too
luckily
it
is
available
to
me
will
seek
this
out
time
after
time
yum
notes
it
can
be
difficult
to
make
a
beer
that
tastes
strongly
of
both
sweet
and
alcohol
without
reminding
me
of
cough
syrup
this
one
doesnt
cut
it
unfortunately
though
the
maple
and
brown
sugar
help
i
still
cant
recommend
buying
this
beer
better
luck
next
time
big
sky
not
even
remotely
impressed
with
this
beer
afterwards
when
talking
with
the
owner
of
enoteca
i
mentioned
this
beer
and
he
told
me
he
believed
it
was
replacing
either
powder
hound
or
slow
elk
now
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
either
of
those
beers
but
i
sure
dont
remember
them
being
anywhere
near
this
bad
avoid
drinkability
isnt
too
high
didnt
like
this
beer
some
offflavors
leaving
me
not
impressed
overall
a

an

candy
like
component
finishes
sweet
with

aftertaste
easy
drinking
and
light
for
a
scottish
ale
the
sip
has
a
juicey
palate
that
moves
to
something
more
syrupy
in
the
middle
the
taste
starts
with
carbonated
toasted
bread
crust
the
middle
is
just
an
explosion
of
caramelized
fruit
the
finish
adds
some
alcoholic
heat
that
gives
this
beer
a
sort
of
liquer
like

heavy

a

the
smell

the
taste
was
lightly

and

it
finished

with
a
touch
of

and
throat
warming
alcohol
it
was

bodied
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
heavy
horse
was
a
decent
scotch
ale
and
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
ruby
twinges
the
smell
is
of
some
drunken
apples
and
a
bit
of
earthy
notes
that
come
along
with
it
there
is
a
good
citrus
note
from
the
hops
to
mix
in
with
the
aroma
would
have
liked
it
to
be
more
potent
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mixture
of
ginger
and
molasses
some
cinnamon
comes
to
play
in
the
party
and
i
think
perhaps
there
is
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
note
it
is
a
good
quality
flavor
for
a
scotch
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
sticky
and
malty
with
a
twinge
of
bitterness
that
is
paired
well
with
the
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
from
an
american
brewery
clear
crimson
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
had
decent
retention
before
settling
to
a
thin
cap
quite
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
caramel
with
notes
of
peat
with
some
grassy
hops
flavor
is
caramel
with
a
hint
of
peat
and
smoke
just
a
little
grassy
near
the
finish
seems
very
dry
for
a
scotch
ale
nothing
terrible
about
the
flavor
but
there
is
very
little
to
make
one
excited
body
seems
a
little
thin
for
the
style
as
well
but
has
nice
carbonation
easy
drinking
beer
which
is
a
little
dangerous
considering
the
abv
nothing
really
to
savor
to
slow
consumption
i
expected
something
better
from
big
sky
d
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
its
nothing
special
drinkability
now
i
am
not
one
for
this
style
but
this
is
a
beer
i
would
want
the
next
time
i
grill
up
a
fat
ribeye
the
color
was
pleasing
like
a
brown
ale
with
a
hint
of
amber
when
held
to
the
light
the
taste
was
complex
with
malts
and
subtle
hops
finishing
with
a
little
nutty
flavor
we
get
plenty
of
big
sky
beers
in
the
store
here
5
flavors
but
not
the
scotch
ale
and
i
am
going
to
have
to
find
out
where
to
get
me
some
because
it
is
easily
my
favorite
to
date
the
beer
coats
my
tongue
with
a
sticky
maltiness
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
other
better
choices
within
this
style
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
well
made
beer
big
malty
flavors
and
still
sessionable
this
makes
the
feel
a
bit
light
too
otherwise
its
darn
good
glad
i
have
5
more
poured
from
a
bottle
into
the
snifter
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
crowned
well
after
dissipating
also
left
some
good
lacing
smelled
very
much
like
a
scotch
ale
should
with
good
malts
and
a
little
of
the
peatiness
expected
taste
was
much
the
same
with
good
maltiness
and
peaty
taste
feel
is
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
a
good
scotch
ale
that
i
will
pick
up
again

d
this

despite
the

to
drink
more
the

a
clear

the

the

stopped
exactly
at

very
slightly
under

and
it

a

its
good
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
when
i

very

be
a

to

goes
down

this
one
could
get
you
into

does
it

had
to
kept
reminding
myself
this
beer
is
called
heavy
horse
for
a

again
delicious
it

all
the

are
seasonal
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
the
feel
at
the

time
it
seems
there
are
thick
malts
only
in
the
mouthfeel
and
not
the
flavor
its
also
light
and
a

otherwise
there

relatively
fruity
as
if
a
somewhat
belgian
version
of
the
style
o
not
a
good
wee
heavy
and
i
would
only
try
this
in
a
pinch
it
gets
better
as
its
gets
warmer
not
a
good
sign
enjoyed
from
bottle
may
edit
review
if
i
try
it
again
when
i
have
my
proper
glassware
smell
is
lowkey
malts
and
booze
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
at
first
finishing
hot
and
boozy
but
still
smooth
not
a
bad
beer
overall
although
i
assume
with
all
the
low
reviews
its
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
an
all
right
brew
but
a
bit
more
boozy
then
desirable
as
it
makes
it
quite
difficult
to
sit
sip
and
enjoy
full
bodied
rich
and
smooth
light
coating
on
the
tongue
this
is
even
better
after
it
warms
up
for
30
minutes
a
much
better
beer
than
the
brothers
think
apparently
overall
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
canned
corn
aroma
and
flavor
it
distracted
me
and
effected
this
ones
drinkability
maybe
mine
was
infected
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
woody
caramel
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
woody
with
notes
of
caramel
it
starts
with
big
alcohol
but
fades
quickly
a
small
alcohol
bite
but
mainly
smooth
with
a
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
woody
and
alcohol
like
aftertaste
a
nice
woody
presence
and
nice
alcohol
that
fades
out
one
omy
favorites
from
the
brewers
in
erie
also
couldnt
detect
a
trace
of
that
10
abv
this
wee
heavy
is
a
fine
beer
but
its
no
more
a
strong
scottish
ale
as
it
is
an
ambiguous
american
strong
ale
barleywine
imperial
red
or
pick
another
strong
beer
tasty
for
a
session
perhaps
but
the
beer
just
doesnt
know
what
it
is
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
really
pretty
looking
red
color
with
a
creamy
looking
orangey
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
nice
along
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
and
malty
very
pleasing
aroma
on
this
beer
the
smell
transferred
perfectly
to
the
taste
where
the
peated
malts
meet
with
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
i
found
to
be
very
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
kind
of
creamy
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
working
well
on
this
beer
overall
this
brew
was
worth
trying
on
just
about
all
levels
in
my
opinion
im
very
surprised
this
doesnt
have
better
reviews
on
here
very
smooth
very
malty
quite
sweet
and
huge
notes
of
autumnal
fruits
and
spices
make
this
a
winner
only
drawback
is
that
metallic
taste
at
the
beginning
but
that
goes
away
very
quickly
overall
i
like
this
one
but
it
is
a
sipper
it
has
a
nice
combo
of
earth
and
sweet
malt
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
more
than
just
a
single
o
this
beer
is
a
scotch
ale
my
white
behind
this
beer
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
sour
aftertaste
if
it
were
up
to
me
this
beer
would
be
under
flanders
but
i
didnt
brew
it
so
ya
overall
meh
decent
beer
but
missing
something
a
little
boozy
too
its
still
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
best
by
any
means
when
it
comes
to
the
style
its
kind
of
lacking
something
i
feel
it
was
missing
more
of
the
dark
fruits
you
get
in
these
brews
this
brew
has
a
decently
high
abv
so
be
ready
for
a
big
hit
as
you
sip
this
brew
d
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
great
has
an
outofplace
graininess
and
astringency
and
not
enough
warm
malt
sweetness
for
the
style
i
might
have
liked
it
better
if
it
was
labeled
an
abbey
style
i
think
it
fits
that
style
better
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
d
drinkability
was
forgiving
enough
still
surprised
that
this
was
10
1
which
drank
more
like
a
7
at
best
nice
malty
character
though
not
to
expansive
in
the
taste
spectrum
have
to
be
careful
you
dont
indulge
in
more
then
you
should
here
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
a
rotten
example
of
a
scotch
ale
and
one
of
the
most
awful
beers
ive
ever
had
this
thing
is
a
disgrace
to
the
style
like
a
good
little
scotch
ale
enthusiast
i
let
it
warm
up
for
a
while
before
opening
it
my
reward
was
a
nose
full
of
old
vegetables
and
pink
sweetarts
the
taste
is
sweet
salty
and
at
the
same
time
terribly
bitter
and
sour
and
full
of
boiled
peas
it
gained
a
slightly
pleasant
malt
characteristic
after
reaching
room
temperature
otherwise
this
is
a
total
and
complete
failure
if
you
want
a
good
american
scotch
ale
go
find
yourself
a
founders
dirty
bastard
again
another
score
from
erie
brewing
i
am
surprised
by
the
much
lower
ratings
when
this
tastes
almost
identical
to
railbender
just
with
a
kick
d
all
told
a
pretty
decent
offering
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
seems
a
hair
too
boozy
id
love
to
see
the
same
beer
at
about
7
5
abv
poured
clear
red
with
a
tall
light
tan
head
theres
a
strong
bready
toast
and
crust
aroma
with
a
hint
of
toffee
thats
a
little
cleaner
than
most
in
the
style
the
flavor
falls
a
little
flat
for
such
a
strong
beer
theres
a
earthy
spice
and
creamy
candy
with
the
aromas
dark
bread
grain
notes
i
suppose
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
character
just
seems
muted
given
the
strength
d
the
aftertaste
and
lack
of
depth
at
10
1
is
a
bummer
and
surprising
moreys
bottom
line
not
my
favorite
style
but
ebc
achieves
what
theyre
going
for
here
im
actually
surprised
by
some
of
the
low
reviews
on
this
one
makes
me
wonder
if
people
are
taking
the
style
into
consideration
being
that
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
i
personally
like
the
high
abv
not
a
good
way
to
start
the
new
year
this
wee
heavy
pours
an
almost
too
clean
and
clear
red
i
mean
a
brilliant
90
minute
boil
ruby
to
a
light
red
color
i
poured
this
big
beer
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
it
looks
a
little
thin
for
a
wee
heavy
i
smell
sweet
sweet
malts
i
did
not
detect
anymore
than
a
faint
hint
of
booze
smell
i
detect
no
hops
which
is
to
style
the
first
taste
is
thicker
than
expected
i
taste
sweet
malts
at
first
followed
by
roasted
flavored
malts
and
some
booziness
i
did
detect
some
spicy
after
taste
that
could
have
been
some
hops
for
balancing
but
they
have
been
washed
out
by
the
booze
and
malts
i
thought
ol
red
cad
would
be
sweet
and
this
beer
is
just
that
i
liked
it
i
do
have
to
say
this
is
another
solid
beer
by
erie
but
i
think
this
wee
heavy
is
a
little
to
one
sided
to
be
a
home
run
i
will
seek
it
out
again
though
as
it
is
a
solid
wee
heavy
which
can
be
hard
to
come
by
in
my
area
all
in
all
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
beer
would
get
this
again
d
well
i
dont
know
i
could
use
more
flavor
and
this
beer
seems
to
be
more
of
a
get
drunk
kind
of
beer
since
it
has
a
quickly
thinning
flavor
and
hardly
detectable
abv
i
may
have
it
again
all
in
all
quite
a
good
wee
heavy
best
left
for
dessert
note
not
with
dessert
for
dessert
overall
impression
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
good
but
wow
was
i
wrong
this
is
marked
as
a
wee
heavy
but
it
actually
reminds
me
very
much
of
old
stock
ale
and
fullers
vintage
ale
old
ales
less
peaty
than
traquair
house
ale
which
was
welcome
dryness
is
maybe
not
to
style
but
was
also
welcome
this
is
now
my
favorite
beer
that
comes
in
6packs
i
had
a
small
glass
of
this
at
george
keeleys
on
manhattans
upper
west
side
id
never
heard
of
this
beer
before
and
i
liked
it
quite
a
lot
very
typical
for
a
scotch
wee
heavy
good
aroma
great
color
outstanding
flavor
i
will
have
this
again
pours
a
rich
brown
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
some
lace
aroma
of
cherries
malt
and
alcohol
flavor
is
good
malt
brown
sugar
vanilla
cherry
the
staggering
alcohol
is
deceptively
well
hidden
some
years
have
done
a
good
job
mellowing
this
one
out
smooth
and
full
bodied
this
makes
for
a
good
sipper
a
good
wee
heavy
would
like
a
bit
more
flavor
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
this
is
a
rather
hohum
wee
heavy
in
the
flavor
department
but
it
tastes
good
and
is
drinkable
dispite
the
high
alcohol
good
stuff
pours
a
beautiful
red
mahogany
with
little
head
aroma
kinda
had
me
in
a
recoil
at
first
nose
cant
quite
place
it
but
its
bad
im
guessing
this
is
an
old
oxidized
bottle
however
theres
something
odd
beyond
that
diacetyl
maybe
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
actually
quite
nice
though
loads
of
malt
with
caramel
brown
sugar
figs
dark
fruit
dominate
that
seem
to
balance
well
with
the
bitterness
d
a
very
nice
scottish
ale
this
one
is
up
there
with
oscar
blues
old
chub
in
my
book
retained
a
nice
offwhite
head
over
a
copperish
body
with
a
strong
malt
smell
and
some
minor
hop
profiling
to
go
with
it
real
smooth
and
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
and
chocolate
sweetness
along
with
hints
of
bread
and
roasted
malt
to
balance
and
give
it
some
dey
aftertastes
there
are
dark
fruit
and
herbal
hops
in
the
backbite
as
well
not
a
fave
of
mine
yet
for
some
reason
i
couldnt
put
this
sucker
down
and
i
really
liked
it
a
pretty
solid
beer
overall
and
fits
the
style
drinkable
enough
to
get
you
in
trouble
as
the
10
doesnt
hit
you
til
the
end
of
the
glass
probably
would
buy
this
again
in
the
future
i
like
the
label
and
the
name
but
i
have
to
say
i
dont
like
the
beer
that
much
definitely
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
one
positive
is
that
i
would
not
have
guessed
that
this
sucker
is
over
10
abv
d
fair
due
to
the
high
abv
but
also
the
less
than
impressive
taste
and
feel
3
5
drinkability
doesnt
really
match
the
style
well
at
all
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
the
abv
feels
pretty
manageable
for
being
10
10
too
i
guess
all
thats
left
to
say
is
that
you
shouldnt
let
the
subpar
ratings
scare
you
away
from
this
beer
or
any
of
eries
offerings
for
that
matter
i
have
found
them
to
be
quite
enjoyable
had
this
ale
a
little
bit
ago
but
if
my
memory
serves
me
it
was
better
than
the
review
average
would
suggest
its
a
nice
beast
of
a
beer
from
erie
and
i
distinctly
remember
intense
floral
qualities
and
caramel
stickiness
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
got
this
in
a
trade
from
steelersxl
thanks
man
dark
red
color
no
surprise
there
decent
head
and
lacing
looks
good
the
smell
is
not
like
any
wee
heavy
ive
had
its
not
peaty
or
smoky
just
very
malty
the
flavor
is
not
bad
at
all
but
again
it
tastes
more
like
a
strong
ale
or
red
ale
than
a
wee
heavy
as
far
as
im
concerned
ol
red
cease
and
desist
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
maybe
a
touch
of
fruit
the
flavor
is
very
malty
hops
are
nowhere
to
be
found
unlike
some
other
reviewers
i
didnt
notice
any
alcohol
i
enjoyed
this
one
your
mileage
may
vary
overall
kind
of
confused
about
this
one
it
doesnt
taste
bad
really
but
it
tastes
off
i
cant
imagine
that
this
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
that
its
almost
like
an
artificial
sweetener
weird
d
this
beer
is
missing
something
as
a
wee
heavy
little
too
much
bitterness
with
not
the
appropriate
amount
of
malts
to
go
along
flavor
is
also
pretty
light
but
decent
at
first
flavor
hits
in
a
little
stronger
as
it
sits
on
your
tongue
some
warm
caramel
notes
sweet
malts
mild
carbonation
a
slight
bitter
backside
can
taste
the
scotch
which
is
pleasant
and
warming
decent
beer
d
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
especially
given
the
strange
flavor
10
abv
and
the
syrupy
quality
inherent
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
garnet
red
with
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
are
sweet
with
a
hint
of
peat
smoked
malt
trailing
in
taste
is
similar
with
a
very
sweet
initial
flavoring
of
malts
but
the
slight
oddity
of
the
peat
trailing
in
at
the
end
feel
is
full
bodied
with
an
oiliness
that
lingers
drinkable
for
the
style
as
the
abv
limits
intake
this
might
not
be
the
greatest
wee
heavybut
its
a
good
beer
especially
considering
the
cost
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
highlight
of
this
tasting
is
the
beautifully
smooth
prickly
texture
that
begins
and
ends
with
a
gentle
ebb
tide
full
and
round
it
lends
the
essential
feature
that
improves
the
unique
character
of
the
flavors
this
offering
used
to
be
called
red
ryder
big
beer
apparently
those
who
hold
the
rights
to
the
movie
a
christmas
story
told
erie
to
cease
and
desist
since
red
ryder
is
the
brand
name
of
the
air
rifle
that
ralphie
wants
so
badly
even
if
it
isnt
true
its
still
an
interesting
story
i
wish
the
same
could
be
said
of
ol
red
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
samuel
smith
imp
pint
glass
after
pouring
it
retained
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
frothy
head
with
good
carbonation
deep
ruby
color
very
smooth
sweet
fruity
esters
biscuit
like
notes
are
pretty
dominant
in
this
malt
bomb
no
real
hop
notes
alcohol
is
very
noticed
but
it
is
still
very
pleasant
to
drink
in
my
thinking
this
is
one
of
the
better
years
for
this
brew
erie
brewing
co
has
some
great
beers
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
as
i
told
my
brother
as
i
drank
this
its
probably
one
of
if
not
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
tasted
a
disappointment
indeed
nothing
really
distinguished
about
this
brew
but
a
good
beer
brownish
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
fruity
taste
is
fruits
and
sugar
cane
alcohol
is
very
very
well
hidden
smooth
and
goes
down
like
cold
filtered
water
this
is
something
that
could
easily
sneak
up
on
you
if
not
careful
i
would
recommned
and
purchase
again
d
too
much
with
no
refinement
all
i
taste
is
alcohol
almost
like
drinking
actual
scotch
yuck
would
not
tell
others
to
try
it
a
wonderful
interpretation
odf
the
wee
heavy
at
1st
pour
the
beer
does
nothing
to
inspire
you
just
seems
kind
of
run
of
the
mill
although
it
does
have
an
interesting
almost
maghonany
like
color
sitting
in
the
glass
it
is
with
the
first
taste
that
you
will
fall
in
love
with
this
beer
very
smooth
and
compelling
flavor
and
an
easy
on
the
palate
texture
makes
this
an
eminently
drinkable
big
beer
not
the
type
to
have
3
or
4
a
night
but
a
nice
one
to
unwind
from
a
stressful
day
and
have
in
front
of
a
nice
fire
overall
this
is
a
good
us
version
of
the
style
but
best
reserved
for
those
being
brokenin
to
moe
developed
brews
d
fairly
good
drinkability
considering
the
abv
though
i
feel
that
the
fruitiness
and
bitterness
dont
quite
balance
well
enough
i
would
say
this
is
an
average
scotch
ale
and
the
high
abv
is
unnecessary
imo
for
the
abv
there
are
many
better
beers
i
would
rather
drink
that
little
explosion
of
sweetness
did
it
for
me
i
would
definately
drink
this
beer
again
not
necessarily
too
many
at
once
but
i
will
look
for
more
if
i
can
find
it
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
the
smell
is
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
with
some
fruity
sweetness
at
the
back
end
the
taste
is
of
roasted
caramel
malt
and
some
fruity
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
does
give
way
to
a
little
alcohol
taste
at
the
back
end
that
lowers
the
taste
a
little
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
and
not
as
thick
as
i
expected
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
after
taste
knocks
it
down
to
just
average
this
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
with
red
highlights
and
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
almost
all
toasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruitiness
mixed
in
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
followed
by
some
raisinplum
that
hides
the
alcohol
remarkably
well
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
little
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
dangerously
well
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
underrepresented
by
american
micros
in
my
opinion
definitely
worth
a
try
dnot
bad
but
has
some
negative
qualities
that
dont
hit
the
mark
a
good
beer
but
not
one
i
would
crave
time
and
time
again
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
but
dark
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
off
white
foam
smell
and
taste
is
sweet
fruity
ripe
cherries
a
fair
amount
of
sugary
malt
molasses
biscuits
ever
so
slightly
smokey
a
bit
lacking
in
body
especially
for
a
10ish
ale
but
the
ale
is
at
least
amply
carbonated
worth
trying
i
suppose
d
well
it
is
thin
on
flavor
for
a
10
beer
imo
while
this
would
lend
itself
to
be
more
drinkable
the
harsh
metallic
burnt
taste
of
this
beer
makes
it
less
so
ive
had
much
better
scotch
ales
its
just
too
harsh
and
my
sobriety
would
be
better
spent
on
lower
abv
and
tastier
brews
drinkability
is
ok
pretty
simple
strong
for
sure
but
not
really
fusely
or
anything
ive
got
one
more
that
ill
sit
on
for
probably
2
years
and
see
what
happens
drinkability
heavy
abv
will
rule
out
drinking
a
few
a
nice
scotch
ale
with
a
big
malt
body
overall
quite
a
nice
brew
light
reddish
bronze
colored
beer
the
head
is
of
a
very
light
tan
notes
of
toast
and
smoke
in
the
nose
flavor
is
strongly
malty
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
toast
brown
sugar
its
a
nicely
balanced
beer
but
could
benefit
from
a
beefier
body
natural
carbonation
decent
wee
heavy
i
have
chalked
my
bad
tap
experience
up
to
a
possible
problem
with
the
keg
or
the
c02
line
or
the
poor
or
something
but
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
one
of
the
better
showings
for
erie
brewing
company
all
in
all
not
bad
even
if
a
bit
askew
from
the
wee
heavy
norm
goes
down
fairly
smoothly
for
the
abv
a
touch
hot
although
not
necessarily
in
an
alcohol
way
the
fruit
and
hop
notes
are
unexpected
and
somewhat
unwelcome
the
richness
and
malt
qualities
are
there
but
so
is
a
good
bit
of
other
stuff
that
im
not
really
diggin
id
drink
it
again
its
a
solid
brew
but
just
not
quite
good
enough
to
stand
out
in
my
mind
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
full
malt
flavor
that
is
well
blended
and
smooth
with
a
supporting
bitterness
that
grows
as
it
warms
the
cidery
quality
added
a
bit
of
interest
to
the
finish
and
was
not
off
putting
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
a
modest
off
white
head
and
few
lacings
aroma
is
caramel
taste
is
dark
caramel
chocolate
cherries
and
an
earthy
hop
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
alright
but
drinkability
at
10
abv
is
too
much
for
me
reminds
me
a
bit
of
drinking
port
wine
too
much
alcohol
for
this
kid
at
least
i
can
tell
the
wife
i
only
had
one
as
i
snooze
in
the
recliner
for
the
malt
lover
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
chocolate
nuts
and
hops
the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
an
alcohol
finish
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
pretty
well
d
i
like
high
abv
beers
that
can
hide
the
alcohol
taste
this
one
lets
it
through
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
mild
burnt
toffee
scent
along
with
a
light
roasted
character
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
tastey
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
light
roastedsmokey
feel
the
alcohol
presence
is
there
but
well
hidden
it
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
finishes
sweet
with
a
dry
edge
it
seems
a
little
thin
for
a
wee
heavy
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
big
beer
its
full
flavored
with
an
alcohol
kick
thats
not
too
noticeable
served
last
night
off
the
cask
at
pipers
pub
talk
about
excellent
cellaring
these
guys
are
pouring
proper
pints
hug
foaming
khaki
head
completed
with
a
smooth
creamy
texture
body
is
deep
ruby
garnett
semi
clouded
smells
tart
with
some
underlying
fruit
and
raisins
very
malty
no
real
hop
presence
maybe
just
a
little
bit
of
earthiness
flavor
was
okay
a
bit
hot
with
alchol
excessively
sweet
with
malt
flowing
from
every
angle
tart
grape
and
raisins
flood
the
palate
as
well
more
earthy
hops
blended
well
mouthfeel
is
creamy
silky
smooth
low
well
done
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
money
drinkability
overall
is
okay
but
the
twang
and
loads
of
malt
didnt
completely
agree
with
me
this
is
the
same
brew
that
went
through
some
name
changes
but
its
been
around
for
quite
sometime
a
super
light
bodied
ale
for
being
so
high
in
alcohol
good
malty
notes
but
not
as
heavy
or
malty
as
some
wee
heavys
well
worth
trying
and
the
balance
of
the
malt
vs
alcohol
is
quite
impressive
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
at
10
i
know
i
should
be
careful
for
10
i
really
could
not
taste
the
alcohol
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
it
did
come
more
as
it
warmed
however
d
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
and
its
amazing
i
got
beyond
through
that
one
this
beer
is
way
too
aggressive
for
me
and
just
doesnt
have
enough
redeeming
flavor
to
sip
thanks
kbuzz
for
the
chance
to
revisit
i
bought
this
for
a
night
cap
at
the
headkeeper
tonight
after
some
rr
i
poured
it
into
my
crystal
snifter
and
prepared
for
the
best
the
beer
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
color
was
a
deep
deep
ruby
the
aroma
was
full
of
roasted
malts
and
sweet
dark
fruits
it
has
tones
of
dates
sweet
citrus
notes
the
taste
wasnt
as
well
received
as
the
aroma
it
was
a
bit
bland
but
still
passes
as
scotch
ale
a
few
years
ago
i
tried
red
ryder
form
erie
brewing
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
hope
sooner
or
later
they
bring
it
back
this
is
an
average
brew
i
honestly
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
beer
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
all
that
good
either
if
you
like
affordable
high
abv
ales
that
are
strong
on
the
alcohol
and
yeast
then
you
might
like
this
one
one
was
enough
for
me
very
good
job
erie
brewing
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
and
served
in
a
snifter
this
beer
poured
a
dark
burgandybrown
hue
with
a
thin
head
of
tannish
yellow
foam
that
quickly
settled
into
a
mostly
lasting
layer
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
made
up
of
brown
sugar
sweet
caramel
and
some
dark
fruits
the
flavor
included
caramelized
sugars
plums
light
smoke
and
some
warming
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
but
seemed
a
bit
thin
for
a
big
beer
the
carbonation
was
moderately
aggressive
a
pretty
decent
scotch
ale
and
highly
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
notes
i
originally
bought
this
because
the
beer
guy
at
holiday
market
recommended
it
i
dont
think
im
gonna
pay
much
attention
to
his
further
recommendations
not
bad
at
all
this
isnt
the
best
of
the
style
but
it
is
certainly
far
from
bad
good
flavor
and
mouthfeel
help
this
overcome
the
looks
and
smell
to
make
this
a
better
than
average
wee
heavy
a
beer
that
is
certainly
worth
drinking
at
the
brewery
and
worth
trading
for
the
alcohol
is
way
too
present
it
was
cheap
ill
leave
it
at
that
poured
a
bright
ruby
redorange
with
no
head
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
that
stuck
around
till
the
very
end
smelled
of
sweet
malts
and
fruit
very
bready
and
fruity
taste
that
quickly
fades
into
an
alcohol
burn
that
would
warm
an
eskimo
in
a
speedo
had
a
very
silky
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
a
little
smooth
the
alcohol
burn
wasnt
extreme
but
it
took
away
from
the
flavor
not
bad
but
one
a
night
is
enough
drinkability
very
low
i
think
this
beer
is
just
okay
the
alcohol
is
way
too
dominating
to
enjoy
it
let
alone
multiples
of
it
but
i
guess
someone
thought
this
beer
was
worth
releasing
try
it
once
dont
buy
more
than
one
im
already
drunk
poured
into
my
snifter
no
head
on
this
one
at
all
it
goes
strictly
to
business
bright
ruby
color
smells
of
sweets
caramel
maybe
and
fruits
good
taste
to
it
sweet
caramel
and
malt
flavor
to
it
then
you
feel
the
burn
when
it
goes
down
the
hatch
definitely
warms
you
up
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
of
these
not
really
enjoying
the
burn
but
nevertheless
a
good
winter
warmer
im
not
even
sure
if
age
will
do
this
beer
any
good
its
far
from
being
horrible
but
it
is
a
chore
to
sip
it
has
headache
written
all
over
it
a
bit
too
attenuated
hot
and
fruity
for
the
style
a
decent
wee
heavy
that
has
the
kick
and
flavor
for
the
style
imo
erie
came
through
big
on
this
beer
great
for
a
winter
warmer
d
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
at
10
10
this
beer
will
sneak
up
on
you
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
will
not
have
again
very
very
nice
deeply
bronzed
color
not
much
in
the
aroma
departmentsome
malt
and
caramel
but
really
hard
to
find
thick
and
heavy
malt
flavordried
fruits
figs
and
raisens
some
caramel
flavor
maybe
just
a
bit
too
bitter
too
much
alcohol
mars
the
overall
impression
no
smoke
for
a
change
which
is
nice
in
a
wee
heavysmoke
is
way
overdone
for
this
style
decent
and
full
treacle
like
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
but
the
alcohol
mars
it
for
me
might
age
quite
well
after
being
out
in
the
insanely
windy
and
blustery
weather
of
wny
today
i
was
looking
forward
to
having
a
big
warming
malty
brew
this
let
me
a
little
dissaponited
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
rich
deep
amber
with
a
touch
of
tawny
hue
a
nice
tight
formed
one
finger
slight
off
white
head
atoplighter
aromas
than
expected
for
such
a
big
beer
some
molasses
and
rown
sugar
with
a
touch
ogf
gummy
fruitiness
i
was
really
suprised
at
how
basic
the
flavors
were
note
very
much
malt
complexitystarting
out
uneventful
with
a
little
dryer
woodiness
finishing
with
some
molasses
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
just
as
simple
as
that
as
the
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
showed
itself
more
but
didnt
really
lend
anything
to
the
beer
except
for
maybe
bringing
the
drinkability
factor
down
a
little
eh
not
terrible
just
basic
in
my
mind
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
well
in
this
beer
in
fact
most
of
the
flavors
are
drowned
out
by
the
abv
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
but
with
just
a
bit
of
head
and
almost
no
lacing
sweet
malty
scent
but
not
as
strong
or
deep
as
most
wee
heavies
it
has
slightly
sweet
flavor
but
its
completely
overridden
by
the
alcohol
there
are
other
wee
heavies
out
there
that
are
just
a
little
lower
in
abv
but
much
richer
in
taste
it
would
be
good
as
a
warmer
but
so
would
a
nice
scotch
and
i
prefer
more
flavorful
beers
as
opposed
to
those
whose
taste
and
also
rough
feel
are
too
overwhelmed
to
me
the
the
flavors
are
more
of
a
strong
ale
or
a
winter
warmer
overall
a
solid
brew
and
one
that
i
really
enjoyed
will
look
for
this
every
fallwinter

will
be
a
nice
beer
to
cellar
and
let
age
and
revisit
in
a
year
roasty
and
sweet
are
the
two
biggest
flavors
for
me
very
tasty
would
buy
again
lovely
dark
amber
with
a
persistent
golden
head
nice
blend
of
malts
in
this
brew
and
you
can
really
taste
the
smoke
a
faithful
take
on
scottishstyle
ale
lacking
in
taste
just
mediocre
for
me
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
what
id
consider
a
traditional
scotch
ale
due
to
the
assertive
roasted
notes
nonetheless
a
good
beer
from
a
brewing
company
im
anxious
to
try
more
from
stop
the
mandatory
reviews
please
this
is
an
easy
brew
to
drink
i
believe
its
one
of
the
most
underrated
breweries
out
there
i
have
tasted
my
way
around
scotland
several
times
and
this
is
the
closest
to
good
scottish
ale
that
i
have
found
in
the
u
s
so
far
i
love
the
sweet
full
taste
i
purchased
it
locally
but
when
i
went
back
for
more
it
was
no
longer
there
i
need
to
see
more
of
it
hopefully
that
will
be
soon
malty
but
with
a
complex
balance
very
tasty
a
very
nice
brew

45
o
this
beer
overcame
its
sweetness
and
poor
looks
with
big
flavors
its
a
good
one
this
is
a
complex
and
flavorful
brew
that
extends
itself
well
beyond
your
archetypal
scotch
ale
the
synergy
could
be
slightly
better
but
i
must
give
it
a
nod
for
the
slightly
chocolately
nutty
finish
which
i
found
to
be
especially
pleasing
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
overall
a
very
tasty
and
fairly
big
everyday
scotch
ale
if
the
finish
dried
up
a
little
more
and
played
against
the
core
sweetness
this
would
be
sublime
an
interesting
tasting
scotch
ale
a
little
different
than
what
i
expected
my
initial
sip
wasnt
as
malty
and
sweet
as
i
come
to
expect
with
this
style
but
was
actually
quite
nutty
it
was
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
was
just
a
variation
on
what
i
am
used
to
with
this
style
since
it
is
a
pretty
affordable
beer
with
a
solid
abv
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
thing
i
reach
for
when
looking
for
a
scotch
ale
as
the
beer
warms
coffee
makes
a
big
presence
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
to
add
another
tasty
element
to
this
already
complex
beer

smells
amazing
tastes
great
this
is
one
of
the
tyranena
brews
worth
seeking
out
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
winter
seasonal
so
this
bottle
is
probably
78
months
old
i
liked
it
anyway
nice
scotch
flavors
with
plenty
of
malt
and
some
smoky
peat
good
stuff
d
started
off
promising
albeit
a
tad
offstyle
but
the
flavor
was
a
touch
bland
for
me
to
get
really
excited
about
this
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
with
not
much
alcohol
at
all
i
prefer
the
added
depth
of
the
barrelaged
version
but
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
especially
at
its
price
point
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
to
drink
for
a
long
time
overall
its
got
a
good
flavor
to
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
its
good
to
have
when
youre
thristy
and
is
perfect
for
any
occasion
definitely
will
be
buying
this
again
in
the
future
carmelly
brown
pour
with
short
lived
head
no
lacing
smell
is
rich
wertherslike
toffee
malts
taste
is
toffee
and
brown
sugar
molasses
and
roasted
malt
perhaps
even
some
chocolate
notes
earthy
hop
appears
at
the
end
to
refresh
palate
mediumsmooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
tickle
quite
delicious
overall
very
good
but
doesnt
put
forth
anything
particularly
memorable
mild
for
the
style
but
hits
the
right
notes
extremely
wellbalanced
and
tasty
abv
is
deceptive
id
definitely
pick
it
up
again
if
i
had
the
opportunity
but
probably
not
as
a
regular
thing
sheep
shagger
ale
not
only
has
a
funny
name
but
is
relatively
decent
the
beer
poors
a
rich
amber
with
thin
off
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
hints
of
caramel
malt
the
taste
follows
suit
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
subtle
carbonaiton
overall
it
is
a
good
scotch
style
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
even
though
it
departs
from
all
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
very
decent
scotch
ale
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
oi
didnt
care
a
whole
lot
for
this
beer
it
was
alot
bigger
than
i
would
have
liked
taste
awesome
instantly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
is
a
scotch
that
isnt
too
sweet
but
is
severely
malty
balanced
with
a
decent
body
but
not
thick
and
is
hopped
to
a
decent
crispness
i
love
the
toffee
woody
vanilla
mapleesque
tones
a
definite
showcase
of
how
using
different
maltsters
and
topnotch
brewers
can
effect
a
beer
love
it
on
tap
at
twenty
tap
in
indy
poured
a
very
nice
deep
brown
with
red
tinges
and
some
nice
head
though
little
lacing
very
deep
malty
scent
with
a
very
earthy
and
jerky
hop
undertone
at
the
end
big
caramel
flavors
thick
and
malty
very
sweet
with
some
nice
peat
underneath
as
well
and
a
bit
of
jerky
hop
finishing
goes
down
well
but
there
is
some
alcohol
heat
big
bourbon
aroma
an
interesting
taste
with
some
sourness
still
a
good
drinkability
at
the
end
of
a
meal
and
tasting
dark
colour
with
generous
lasting
offwhite
head
above
average
mouthfeel
liked
the
vanilla
long
whiskey
finish
decent
for
the
style
does
have
a
stout
quality
to
it
but
thats
not
really
a
negative
the
feel
is
really
good
and
the
aromas
are
really
good
as
well
this
is
a
quality
scotch
ale
and
shows
no
booziness
that
they
sometimes
can
do
hazel
brown
with
a
nice
1
inch
head
that
slowly
faded
lacing
up
the
sides
much
visible
carbonation
and
a
noticeable
hissing
sound
smell
was
very
nutty
and
i
mean
that
literally
smell
was
of
nuts
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
smells
like
its
gonna
warm
you
up
the
taste
was
very
very
sweet
syrupy
and
lots
of
dark
fruit
flavors
very
sugary
sweet
no
real
taste
of
alcohol
which
at
7
5abv
is
a
nice
touch
o
a
decent
scotch
ale
but
this
is
no
dirty
bastard
sorry
not
bad
but
almost
too
overmalty
for
my
palate
another
situation
where
i
enjoyed
the
bgw
barrelaged
version
of
this
and
just
had
to
try
the
regular
version
it
pours
a
clear
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
baked
toffee
orange
peel
and
some
light
cocoa
the
taste
does
not
deviate
much
at
all
from
this
plan
of
attack
save
for
a
slight
increase
in
the
orange
character
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smoothish
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
scotch
ale
one
that
does
not
disappoint
even
if
it
doesnt
necessarily
impress
either
this
one
took
me
a
bit
by
surprise
with
rich
full
flavors
and
a
great
drinkibility
for
a
larger
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
craft
versions
of
the
style
that
ive
had
and
was
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
good
one
from
tyranena
future
outlook
my
limited
exposures
to
tyranena
have
been
quite
positive
so
its
too
bad
i
cant
buy
them
here
can
feel
my
appreciation
for
wee
heaviesstrong
scotch
ales
really
increasing
recently
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
jcnd9803
pours
deep
cooper
with
thin
tan
head
aroma
has
nice
sweet
malts
some
peat
caramel
and
alcohol
taste
is
similar
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
and
smooth
finish
the
bourbon
is
not
overstatedits
provides
some
nice
warmth
as
it
goes
down
to
me
the
star
is
the
caramelley
goodness
of
the
beer
mmmmm
i
would
love
more
of
this
i
would
personally
like
to
see
a
further
developed
caramel
flavor
and
a
hair
less
roasttoast
but
sheep
shagger
is
quite
good
and
drinks
pretty
easily
for
a
beer
of
this
heft
d
good
easy
to
drink
beer
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
would
probably
get
a
little
bored
with
it
still
good
beer
just
not
my
favorite
here
very
nice
everything
is
there
that
should
be
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
something
i
would
highly
recommend
overall
a
very
tasty
sa
with
an
abv
that
is
hardly
discernible
poured
into
a
tulip
wonderful
dark
amber
with
very
little
head
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
nice
malty
smell
i
get
a
little
biscuit
too
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
a
little
caramel
and
a
clean
finish
well
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
no
problem
to
sit
and
work
through
a
few
of
these
d
fairly
drinkable
for
being
7
3
a
fine
beer
kinda
light
but
with
veritably
no
traces
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
d
easily
consumed
a
nicely
rounded
scotch
ale
brewed
in
the
heart
of
america
well
done
the
taste
starts
super
malty
sweet
with
a
caramel
like
syrupy
texture
the
middle
lets
some
of
the
sweetness
go
for
a
little
alcoholic
warmth
the
finish
is
some
warm
caramel
and
toasted
faintly
nutty
malts
this
a
ood
representation
of
a
wee
heavy
one
worth
enjoying
slowly
soft
coppery
color
bready
and
malty
aromasomewhat
toffeeish
and
caramel
like
malty
flavor
upfront
maybe
a
kiss
of
hops
the
toffeecaramel
thing
continues
throughout
the
flavor
just
a
faint
smoke
tinge
though
that
may
be
more
of
the
malt
coming
thru
then
anything
silky
mouthfeel
nice
scottish
ale
for
sure
one
of
the
better
us
versions
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
well
worth
trying
d
quite
drinkable
pretty
smooth
and
nothing
offensive
pours
a
reddish
bronzish
copper
brown
color
thin
film
of
white
head
floats
at
the
top
smokey
malt
with
a
whiff
of
booze
hits
your
nose
taste
is
earthy
and
slightly
sweet
up
front
very
faint
hints
of
vanilla
and
cherries
it
dries
out
in
the
middle
with
a
smokey
and
slightly
sour
flavor
smokey
and
malty
at
the
finish
with
a
noticable
boozey
feeling
on
my
lips
it
does
have
some
of
the
smoked
malt
characteristics
of
scotch
whisky
this
is
a
big
beer
moderately
thick
body
but
the
complex
flavors
and
high
abv
mean
this
one
is
for
sipping
i
came
in
last
night
from
the
5
degree
weather
and
cracked
one
of
these
open
hit
the
spot
very
nicely
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
drinks
well
and
is
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
either
for
the
style
or
for
tyranena
came
off
more
as
a
robust
amber
ale
as
it
was
lacking
some
rich
caramelized
malt
flavor
this
beer
has
an
awesomely
good
mouthfeel
silky
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
it
is
only
low
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
an
awesome
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
readily
get
drinkability
i
had
forgotten
how
well
tyranena
does
so
many
styles
this
is
an
excellent
easy
drinking
beer
with
an
exceptional
flavor
well
done
d
out
of
all
the
wee
heavies
that
i
have
had
this
is
one
of
the
more
easy
ones
to
drink
for
sure
a
great
session
beer
for
this
style
perhaps
the
best
very
light
on
the
palette
mouthfeel
drinkability
creamy
and
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
the
alcohol
is
not
felt
in
the
flavor
or
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
wiked
beer
nearing
8
kind
of
makes
me
grin
sheepishly
mellow
feel
malty
sweetness
husky
grains
not
getting
any
smoke
or
toffee
notes
typical
of
the
style
sort
of
basic
a
very
malt
forward
scotch
ale
not
a
ton
of
complexity
here
the
abv
is
definitely
hidden
though
cant
really
find
much
more
to
say
about
it
unfortunately
not
the
best
ive
had
from
tyranena
but
a
decent
scotch
ale
drinkability
theres
nothing
better
to
cut
through
the
winter
chill
than
a
nice
slow
sippin
scotch
ale
thank
the
lord
they
make
such
a
fine
one
nearby
solid
session
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
beer
not
too
heavy
while
missing
a
bit
of
the
intensity
of
other
in
the
style
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
i
would
come
back
to
and
have
a
couple
one
of
the
nicer
scotch
ales
ive
tried
and
likely
to
become
a
staple
in
my
beer
pantry
this
one
pours
a
dark
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
light
khaki
head
it
smells
of
woody
hazelnut
and
dark
malts
definitely
interesting
and
welcome
aromas
it
drinks
pretty
nutty
and
has
a
good
rich
hazelnut
flavor
to
it
i
was
very
surprised
it
drinks
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
youd
never
know
it
was
7
7
i
wouldve
guessed
around
6
this
one
is
very
drinkable
i
dont
like
scotch
ales
in
particular
but
this
is
a
good
one
its
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
murky
pale
brown
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
vanishes
within
seconds
into
a
mere
ring
of
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
peat
caramel
nuts
and
chocolate
the
beer
smells
like
a
candy
bar
smoke
with
peat
i
really
like
the
uniqueness
of
this
aroma
the
taste
has
more
caramel
than
the
aroma
there
is
still
a
lot
of
peat
and
a
solid
nuttiness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
very
silky
texture
and
fine
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
really
good
scotch
ale
i
can
see
this
becoming
my
go
to
beer
for
the
style
overall
im
more
of
a
fan
of
the
brewers
gone
wild
series
from
tyranena
md
medium
body
average
carbonation
that
is
a
little
too
prickly
on
the
tongue
abv
is
not
hidden
to
well
you
can
tell
its
almost
8
drinkability
is
average
its
pretty
damn
malty
and
something
about
the
finish
is
off
d
easy
drinking
for
a
scotch
ale
flavors
are
well
integrated
albeit
the
sweetness
perhaps
can
get
to
be
too
much
not
filling
abv
is
pretty
zingy
as
well
i
believe
ill
finish
this
six
pack
before
i
stand
up
overall
a
very
nice
beer
super
drinkable
with
huge
flavors
not
surprising
coming
from
tyranena
d
overall
another
decent
scotch
ale
some
nice
malt
and
dark
fruits
taste
to
it
i
would
have
liked
it
a
little
better
if
it
wasnt
as
boozy
but
it
wasnt
overpowering
i
would
try
it
again
very
good
beer
glad
to
know
the
crew
in
lake
mills
is
cranking
out
new
stuff
even
better
to
find
out
that
its
as
good
or
better
than
the
old
stuff
keep
it
coming
d
this
is
not
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
to
date
but
its
a
solid
offering
from
tyranena
i
would
like
to
see
the
malts
toffee
and
caramel
notes
turned
up
and
a
little
less
booziness
but
considering
there
is
almost
8
abv
its
rather
impressive
this
stuff
drinks
down
with
amazing
ease
and
drinkability
way
too
smooth
for
nearly
8
so
watch
yourself
with
this
one
or
you
may
just
find
yourself
really
sheep
shaggin
d
this
beer
was
pleasant
enough
to
want
several
and
the
abv
was
well
hidden
the
main
issue
is
that
its
not
a
wee
heavy
in
my
opinion
sort
of
like
a
scottish
amber
it
defies
categorization
really
but
its
very
tasty
d
i
wanted
a
six
pack
on
the
first
sip
very
good
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
and
a
delicious
beer
the
mouthfeels
smooth
soft
texture
aids
in
drinkability
d
this
is
a
sipper
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
great

me

mahogany
thin
tight
cap
of
dirty
white
froth
lacing
is

aroma
is
malty

meaty
and
rich
just
the
way
i
like
my
wee
heavy
on
the
buds
take
all
that
is
on
the
nose
the
richness
the
maltiness
the
beefiness
and
add
some
nice
does
of
chocolate
to
the
equation
the
result
is
very
good
luxurious
feel
to
it
creamy
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink

smackin
good
first
beer
from
this
brewery
impressive
o
if
you
like
bourbonbarrelaged
beers
you
will
love
this
beer
the
scotch
ale
style
is
the
perfect
style
to
age
in
bourbon
barrels
the
bourbon
flavors
mesh
very
well
with
the
sweet
roasted
malts
of
the
scotch
ale
style
everyone
should
try
this
beer
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
tyranenas
brewers
gone
wild
series
great
beer
i
cannot
compare
it
to
other
wee
heavy
beers
but
i
did
enjoy
it
o
i
dig
this
scotch
ale
a
nice
use
of
bourbon
barrels
for
the
style
me
thinks
o
pretty
decent
overall
but
a
few
flaws
in
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
put
this
one
behind
the
better
scotch
ales
around
final
thoughts
im
starting
to
really
dig
scotch
ales
i
actually
only
tried
shaggin
in
the
wood
because
an
employee
at
the
beer
store
recommended
it
to
me
so
glad
i
bought
the
bottle
and
will
be
going
back
for
more
if
its
not
sold
out
this
seems
to
be
one
of
those
great
beers
that
no
one
knows
about
which
is
a
rare
find
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
body
is
a
deep
murky
brown
with
a
small
vanilla
colored
head
it
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
vanilla
bourbon
and
oak
the
taste
follows
nicely
with
added
flavor
of
toffee
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
its
got
a
relatively
light
mouthfeel
but
its
carbonated
nicely
there
is
a
slight
warming
effect
that
helps
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
finish
overall
tasty
scotch
ale
that
is
complemented
well
by
the
barrel
but
i
feel
like
it
could
be
an
even
better
brew
if
it
wasnt
blended
despite
this
its
a
very
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
that
would
probably
go
well
with
a
meal
4
tyranena
shaggin
in
the
wood
bourbon
barrelaged
scotch
ale
45
o
a
very
nice
drinking
scotch
ale
my
only
gripe
is
that
there
isnt
enough
bourbon
no
idea
why
this
is
only
70
barrel
aged
100
would
be
perfect
this
is
a
blended
70
ba
scotch
ale
but
an
all
around
solid
ba
scotch
ale
from
tyranena
i
would
really
like
to
taste
it
100
ba
since
i
enjoy
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavors
im
sure
there
are
many
that
will
like
that
the
bourbon
doesnt
overwhelm
the
other
flavor
or
aroma
i
cellared
this
one
for
at
least
a
year
and
a
half
i
think
it
was
longer
but
it
got
a
little
lost
in
the
back
of
the
cellar
obviously
the
basement
trolls
that
are
supposed
to
keep
track
of
my
beers
are
not
doing
their
job
with
this
failure
noted
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
snifter
with
a
dark
brown
appearance
a
generous
head
of
close
to
an
inch
crowned
the
glass
leaving
a
generous
lacing
as
it
receded
it
looked
like
a
the
empty
sides
of
an
cup
after
a
chocolate
milk
shake
had
been
finished
a
big
bourbon
aroma
was
present
with
hints
of
grape
and
vanilla
in
the
background
the
bourbon
establishes
itself
early
in
the
initial
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
scotch
ale
stays
in
the
background
leaving
a
nice
backbone
notes
of
tobacco
grape
skin
sweet
malts
are
present
and
make
an
impression
i
am
a
little
surprised
by
the
intensity
of
the
carbonation
on
this
one
the
taste
did
not
last
as
long
as
i
would
have
liked
but
the
intensity
of
the
taste
compensated
for
the
endurance
in
the
aftertaste
the
bourbon
mellows
leaving
a
mild
warming
sensation
this
is
not
surprising
since
the
brewers
gone
wild
line
of
tyranena
typically
is
not
high
in
abv
darker
fruits
emerge
with
a
greater
intensity
as
the
sweet
malts
fade
to
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
aged
quite
well
though
i
recall
it
was
also
very
good
in
a
more
fresh
state
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
started
great
but
ended
up
leaving
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
good
rendition
of
a
scotch
ale
though
especially
in
the
nose
o
not
a
style
i
like
that
much
but
this
was
good
fairly
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
oaky
vanilla
as
well
i
get
some
caramel
and
toffee
notes
a
rich
malty
beer
that
melds
well
with
the
bourbon
and
barrell
notes
medium
bodied
and
creamy
on
the
tongue
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
smaller
version
of
backwoods
bastard
i
would
love
to
see
it
be
just
a
little
bolder
but
all
in
all
it
is
very
tasty
overall
pretty
unimpressed
not
a
drainpour
but
not
worth
drinking
thanks
so
much
to
funhog
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
in
our
recent
trade
6142011
o
this
isnt
a
scotch
ale
i
could
very
well
be
wrong
but
i
just
feel
that
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
that
it
cant
be
classified
at
all
a
nice
brew
tastes
great
pours
well
pour
but
i
enjoy
it
as
a
brew
and
would
gladly
have
it
again
o
most
of
the
time
i
enjoy
tyranenas
barrel
aged
beers
for
the
fact
that
their
barrel
aging
is
typically
quite
reserved
this
beer
is
no
different
and
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
good
beer
except
for
the
total
lack
of
carbonation
hv
super
tasty
and
super
drinkable
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
this
and
dirty
old
man
were
my
first
tyranena
brews
and
both
were
mighty
impressive
not
quite
as
bold
as
backwoods
bastard
nor
quite
as
much
of
a
bourbon
bomb
as
this
is
more
vanillaforward
but
still
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
had
comparison
to
founders
backwood
bastard
is
inevitable
unfortunately
this
is
not
anywhere
in
the
same
league
tyranena
seldom
disappoints
with
their
barrel
aged
beers
this
is
definately
a
disappointment
do
drinkability
is
moderate
im
not
sure
what
kind
of
expectations
i
came
into
this
beer
with
but
the
only
other
bourbonaged
scotch
ale
i
had
was
founders
backwoods
bastard
and
this
is
certainly
more
mild
than
that
i
wouldve
loved
to
see
more
bourbon
notes
here
as
the
vanilla
and
barrel
certainly
played
their
part
o
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
complex
flavor
profile
and
is
quite
drinkable
there
was
certainly
promise
for
this
beer
but
that
wonderful
buttered
toffee
character
didnt
show
up
enough
in
the
flavor
overall
there
ends
up
being
not
that
much
more
to
offer
compared
to
your
average
scotch
ale
i
suppose
not
every
brewers
gone
wild
beer
can
be
stellar
worth
a
try
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
try
this
why
do
the
israelis
palestinians
anyways
this
is
an
excellent
brew
subtle
deep
complex
yet
comes
across
as
the
girl
next
door
another
winner
from
the
brewers
gone
wild
series
keep
it
up
the
cpj
overall
a
very
nice
beer
good
balance
nothing
too
extreme
just
enough
bourbon
flavor
to
let
you
know
its
there
but
not
being
hot
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
doesnt
get
a
higher
rating
because
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
bourbon
but
still
quite
nice
id
definitely
like
to
have
another
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
low
overall
it
was
a
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
beer
the
bourbon
barrel
character
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
hoped
but
it
was
still
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
style
very
nice
overall
was
hoping
for
better
things
from
this
beer
taste
is
relatively
straight
forward
for
a
scotch
ale
you
cant
really
detect
much
of
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
on
this
beer
which
was
disappointing
to
me
relatively
small
head
and
decent
nose
have
a
few
more
that
i
will
try
over
time
but
wont
seek
out
again
despite
the
pretty
good
price
on
these
overall
tasty
scotch
ale
but
no
barrel
aging
presence
so
a
little
thin
in
that
regard
overall
good
o
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
very
unique
love
the
smoky
oak
presence
im
surprised
its
as
carbonated
as
it
is
i
could
definitely
see
this
one
growing
on
me
and
the
beer
is
tyranenas
shaggin
in
the
woods
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
awesome
thanks
kyle
always
love
trying
new
tyranena
beers
now
knowing
the
style
the
carameltoffee
definitely
makes
sense
and
the
barrels
definitely
came
through
as
i
got
a
lot
of
wood
in
the
taste
surprisingly
i
didnt
get
any
bourbon
in
the
nose
at
all
and
just
a
tiny
bit
in
the
taste
im
thinking
that
sweetness
in
now
vanilla
after
seeing
the
labels
description
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
do
like
complex
beers
when
theyre
done
well
and
this
is
one
of
them
very
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
is
much
higher
than
what
the
pour
indicated
dark
bready
semi
sweet
malts
vanilla
toasty
oak
bourbon
dark
fruits
of
plum
raisin
prune
some
light
peat
smokiness
butterscotch
on
the
finish
with
a
light
buttery
flavor
but
not
diacetyl
if
the
carbonation
in
the
mouth
was
just
slightly
lighter
i
think
it
would
have
made
the
palate
rounder
and
creamier
and
helped
out
a
lot
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
loved
these
ba
offerings
from
tyranena
o
tyranena
makes
a
good
beer
and
sometimes
a
great
one
this
one
is
just
good
overall
dulled
and
murky
scarlet
red
body
thing
beige
head
leaves
sparse
malt
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
peatiness
as
well
flavor
is
smootha
and
richly
sweet
with
accents
of
vanilla
as
well
bourbon
notes
are
subdued
but
this
is
very
drinkable
for
a
wee
heavy
mediumfull
body
with
no
impression
of
alcohol
on
the
buds
lightly
carbonated
and
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
i
really
think
tyranena
does
a
kickass
job
with
their
barrel
aged
beers
and
this
is
another
one
i
like
a
strong
barrel
impression
and
this
has
it
a
lot
of
vanilla
nougat
and
oak
blended
with
a
nice
sticky
sweet
scotch
ale
not
much
of
a
peated
malt
smokiness
if
it
has
some
it
is
muted
by
the
barrel
aged
impressions
body
feels
full
like
i
said
a
little
sticky
sweet
excellent
aroma
and
excellent
taste
great
beer
not
exciting
but
certainly
not
bad
i
really
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
superb
beer
however
in
that
respect
this
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
poured
a
rich
hazy
hazelnut
brown
with
a
minimal
tan
head
that
faded
fast
but
had
a
nice
overall
full
look
to
it
rich
aroma
of
clove
and
heather
almost
with
a
solid
base
of
caramel
and
nuts
the
flavor
was
a
bit
sharp
not
as
polished
but
very
mush
in
the
game
started
with
a
light
fruity
note
hints
of
hops
piney
almost
with
a
nice
earthy
tone
to
it
and
a
rich
caramel
note
lots
of
nutty
tones
in
the
fnish
with
lots
of
fresh
flower
like
flavors
mixed
in
nice
creamy
bosy
with
a
smooth
easy
drinking
feel
4
5
d
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
not
overly
complex
but
good
strong
flavors
solid
nutty
and
grainy
contributions
with
a
subtle
yet
meaningful
barrel
contribution
would
love
to
drink
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
wasnt
as
roasty
as
a
normal
scotch
ale
and
it
was
more
sweet
but
i
liked
it
it
was
really
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
swear
i
was
picking
up
a
coconut
flavor
while
drinking
this
beer
and
it
tasted
like
a
mounds
bar
mmmm
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
no
detection
of
higher
abv
great
subtle
barrel
aging
too
subtle
for
some
far
too
drinkable
and
delicious
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
but
i
have
heard
all
their
brewers
gone
wild
beer
are
great
so
i
look
forward
to
sampling
many
more
to
come
received
this
one
in
a
recent
trade
with
frankenbrew
i
have
been
for
the
most
part
quite
impressed
with
the
others
in
this
series
not
so
much
here
poured
a
nice
copper
color
beige
head
aromas
of
malt
chocolate
vanilla
and
light
bourbon
on
the
palate
fairly
full
bodied
with
flavors
of
milk
chocolate
vanilla
and
caramel
this
is
another
solid
brewers
gone
wild
brew
from
tyranena
who
can
seemingly
do
no
wrong
in
that
series
not
in
the
top
tier
of
ba
scotch
ales
step
forward
alesmith
ba
wee
heavy
but
better
than
most
d
the
dry
malt
has
some
good
depth
and
a
slight
sweetness
to
the
oak
and
vanilla
notes
make
this
very
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
character
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
into
this
style
pours
a
dark
hued
brown
with
really
no
head
to
speak
of
and
light
carbonation
nose
of
roasted
nuts
caramel
popcorn
butter
toffee
and
the
faintest
hint
of
buttery
chardonnayesque
oak
taste
has
an
impressive
array
of
coffe
milk
chocolate
toffee
and
caramel
apple
with
a
very
smooth
creamy
finish
no
wood
noticed
at
all
on
the
palate
another
tasty
beer
that
i
received
as
an
extra
from
i
brewery
that
i
am
glad
to
have
discovered
pours
an
russet
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
laces
down
the
glass
smell
is
muted
some
sweet
almost
maple
aroma
and
a
little
bit
o
bourbon
taste
is
muted
as
well
with
cereal
chocolate
and
carmel
alongside
the
mellowed
bourbon
taste
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
i
would
drink
this
again
but
would
seek
out
a
fresh
bottle
if
only
to
see
how
it
differs
light
carbonation
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
good
not
quite
great
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
though
o
overall
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
didnt
really
take
much
from
the
barrels
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
probably
would
actively
pursue
doverall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
if
this
is
what
this
style
has
to
offer
im
super
excited
to
try
more
this
beer
has
soo
many
flavors
going
on
in
it
but
is
soo
well
balanced
i
love
this
beer
will
be
picking
up
6
ers
of
this
all
the
time
try
this
if
you
havent
yet
o
a
very
good
beer
tyranena
shows
once
again
that
they
know
how
to
barrel
age
with
subtlety
as
opposed
to
the
punchintheface
most
other
breweries
offer
a
delicious
scotch
ale
d
a
solid
scotch
ale
easily
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
the
of
barrel
aging
was
just
the
right
amount
doesnt
overpower
the
other
flavors
this
beer
has
to
offer
welldone
this
is
pretty
mild
for
a
bourbonbarreled
beer
but
that
actually
adds
to
the
charm
for
me
if
this
was
yearround
id
grab
it
on
the
regular
d
this
is
all
right
i
didnt
have
strong
feelings
about
it
either
way
as
mentioned
above
there
are
stronger
examples
of
the
style
dammit
i
miss
using
my
thistle
goblet
then
again
im
far
too
lazy
to
go
into
the
box
in
the
basement
and
retrieve
it
so
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunrise
ruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
oak
caramel
light
toffee
light
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
liquor
the
taste
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
deviate
from
this
winning
formula
though
the
oak
is
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
mild
dark
greens
come
through
near
the
finish
tying
things
up
quite
nicely
the
body
is
a
sleek
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
smooth
feel
overall
one
of
the
better
barrelaged
editions
put
out
through
the
bgw
series
i
would
definitely
enjoy
this
one
again
d
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
i
may
have
to
buy
another
4pack
as
the
rest
of
my
bottles
are
committed
to
a
trade
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
brewers
gone
wild
beers
in
recent
memory
its
nice
to
see
someone
do
a
barrelaged
scotch
ale
that
doesnt
taste
like
harsh
wood
and
alcohol
overall
this
struck
me
as
a
beefedup
version
of
their
barrelaged
rockys
revenge
its
drinkable
considering
but
it
doesnt
wow
regardless
its
solid
enough
and
a
bit
more
agile
than
most
bourbon
barrel
offerings
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barrel
aged
beers
i
think
ive
ever
had
i
think
i
could
easily
finish
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
based
on
the
description
on
the
bottle
bourbon
notes
are
virtually
undetectable
mostly
comes
through
as
oak
and
i
would
have
preferred
more
malt
sweetness
as
well
its
just
a
little
too
mellow
for
what
i
would
have
expected
enjoyable
brew
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
oi
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
wish
i
knew
how
potent
it
was
but
it
is
not
listed
it
may
be
a
little
high
but
i
dont
know
once
again
i
must
say
that
they
did
a
great
job
on
this
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
overall
i
had
a
hard
time
enjoying
this
one
just
something
subpar
about
it
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
under
the
radar
breweries
out
there
and
the
brewers
gone
wild
series
have
been
winners
across
the
board
i
really
liked
this
i
think
they
did
a
fantastic
job
with
the
barrel
aging
and
produced
a
beer
that
still
resembles
the
style
it
came
from
while
simultaneously
showcasing
some
very
nice
bourbon
notes
bravo
this
beer
was
quite
pleasant
overall
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
bourbonaged
beers
ive
tried
overall
an
absolute
treat
of
a
beer
its
got
a
distinct
nutty
taste
with
fantastic
sweetness
from
the
caramel
the
bourbon
is
faint
but
it
seems
to
be
exactly
right
highly
recommended
tyranena
has
outdone
themselves
a
big
thanks
goes
to
wisrarebeer
for
this
one
thanks
to
seeswo
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
loose
quarter
inch
head
that
dissipates
into
a
frothy
band
and
a
thin
skim
slashes
and
spots
of
lacing
are
exposed
on
the
tilt
side
of
the
glass
nose
is
buttery
sugary
and
expresses
a
light
boozy
character
taste
reveals
rich
butterscotch
flavors
initially
but
quickly
becomes
somewhat
thin
and
watery
with
a
slightly
grainy
quality
to
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
and
a
butteryoilycreamy
texture
decent
but
not
what
i
would
consider
style
consistent
nonetheless
an
interesting
brew
d
like
all
the
brewers
gone
wild
series
this
was
enjoyable
and
easy
to
finish
ill
be
looking
to
grab
some
more
of
this
before
its
gone
for
good
and
ill
also
be
looking
to
see
what
comes
out
next
i
also
like
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
by
volume
isnt
crazy
high
id
guess
just
under
8
with
this
one
drinkability
nice
twist
on
an
already
fantastic
beer
could
have
used
this
one
a
little
earlier
in
the
winter
really
takes
the
edge
off
a
cold
winters
night
di
have
been
pretty
impressed
with
the
bgw
series
thus
far
but
this
was
really
a
disappointment
it
is
just
way
to
thick
with
sugars
and
i
am
not
really
sure
that
bourbon
was
a
good
addition
to
the
beer
maybe
if
it
was
blended
in
a
lower
ratio
i
really
like
this
though
i
like
the
base
scotch
ale
much
better
if
this
had
a
fuller
body
and
a
little
more
carbonation
it
would
be
great
very
much
worth
a
try
but
sheep
shagger
is
the
superior
product
imo
this
beer
pours
a
mahogany
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
which
is
alright
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
chocolate
shop
that
makes
its
own
chocolates
and
caramels
there
is
caramel
vanilla
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
nougat
bourbon
and
wood
i
could
smell
this
beer
all
day
long
it
is
perhaps
the
only
beer
that
i
have
ever
wanted
to
grant
a
5
5
score
for
aroma
here
on
beeradvocate
the
taste
is
a
bit
milder
than
the
aroma
there
is
less
caramel
vanilla
and
chocolate
with
the
bourbon
and
wood
staying
at
about
the
same
intensity
it
is
still
really
good
but
it
isnt
great
in
the
way
the
aroma
is
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
would
be
better
with
a
slightly
full
body
and
very
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
though
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
others
mmm
mmm
good
nicely
done
rob
co
d
this
is
a
damn
drinkable
wee
heavy
that
really
hides
its
abv
well
the
barrel
aging
is
done
about
right
for
my
tastes
it
is
there
but
not
overpowering
good
solid
beer
from
tyranena
d
4
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
these
brewers
gone
wild
tend
to
be
lower
abv
than
one
might
expect
but
this
drinks
quite
easily
in
the
final
analysis
is
it
too
approachable
not
challenging
enough
too
sweet
wouldnt
really
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
this
does
seem
worth
returning
to
now
and
again
and
after
all
it
nearly
did
disappear
faster
than
i
could
review
it
yum
yum
yummy
one
awesome
wee
heavy
on
display
here
tyranena
makes
another
top
notch
drinker
with
great
flavor
tone
and
body
i
can
and
will
drink
alot
of
this
stuff
yum
revisited
this
beer
on
4172013
batch
2
is
just
as
good
as
the
first
batch
overall
another
good
beer
from
tyranena
not
spectacular
but
balanced
enough
to
make
me
save
one
for
a
few
months
down
the
line
when
i
took
the
our
i
was
stacks
of
barrels
aging
hoping
id
be
able
to
get
some
glad
i
did
a
solid
beer
that
ill
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
as
it
ages
a
bit
flavor
is
quite
strong
on
the
vanilla
and
oak
with
an
alcohol
burn
at
the
finish
70
of
this
is
scotch
ale
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
and
unlike
some
other
bourbon
barrelaged
ales
this
one
seems
to
have
really
soaked
up
some
of
that
oak
and
bourbon
quality
i
get
a
lot
of
wood
hah
with
bourbon
and
vanilla
tones
really
impressive
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
tad
thin
almost
watery
the
flavors
are
right
in
line
but
very
low
carbonation
and
a
lacking
body
knocks
this
one
down
a
tad
the
finish
is
very
sweet
which
i
guess
is
to
be
expected
but
its
maybe
a
touch
too
much
for
me
other
than
that
i
thought
shaggin
in
the
wood
was
pretty
decent
i
liked
that
the
bourbon
and
oak
notes
were
tamed
and
not
overpowering
d
another
awesome
value
barrel
aged
beer
from
tyranena
this
is
similar
to
backwoods
bastard
but
much
more
mellow
on
the
spirit
and
the
malt
character
worth
a
try
very
nice
pick
this
up
a
very
polished
easy
drinking
wee
heavy
i
could
easily
see
having
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
youre
expecting
much
in
the
way
of
bourbon
however
this
probably
wont
get
it
done
for
you
d
a
nice
sipper
over
a
nice
hearty
meal
i
had
the
black
forest
panini
this
can
also
be
consumed
fairly
quickly
if
you
also
choose
to
at
9
abv
you
will
feel
it
once
done
drinkabilityi
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
typically
prefer
a
thicker
darker
scotch
ale
such
as
lake
louie
reserve
scotch
ale
but
this
is
delicious
the
vanilla
flavor
from
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
excellent
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
bourbon
flavor
but
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
the
appearance
is
a
nice
amber
color
but
that
is
lighter
than
im
used
to
seeing
many
other
scotch
ales
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
there
is
the
distinct
butterscotch
and
caramel
notes
that
are
commonly
associated
with
the
style
but
this
adds
a
light
amount
of
the
pleasant
vanilla
aroma
perhaps
from
oak
barrels
or
perhaps
from
vanilla
addition
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
that
same
profile
as
was
found
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
stronger
maltiness
on
the
palate
though
as
compared
to
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
astringent
then
i
let
it
warm
up
probably
to
around
60
degrees
and
the
mouthfeel
became
buttery
and
sweet
the
fact
is
though
that
it
took
a
lot
of
waiting
for
the
bottle
to
get
up
to
that
temperature
almost
as
if
i
should
have
drank
it
straight
from
the
cellar
rather
than
waste
time
chilling
it
in
the
fridge
still
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
enjoyed
the
end
product
drinkability
is
high
im
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
this
4
pack
drinkability
i
cant
handle
heavy
sweeter
beers
like
this
too
often
so
one
of
these
in
an
evening
will
do
just
fine
this
was
a
great
try
though
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
trade
i
probably
wouldnt
have
picked
it
up
but
im
glad
i
did
a
poor
mans
backwoods
bastard
at
a
lower
pricepoint
and
a
much
higher
drinkability
not
a
poor
beer
by
any
means
however
d
this
was
a
good
drinkable
beer
i
liked
the
sweetness
to
it
but
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
the
abv
could
be
tasted
at
times
in
the
beer
but
i
would
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
this
is
just
an
average
scotch
ale
i
was
expecting
something
close
to
backwoods
bastard
and
this
fell
well
short
of
that
mark
a
vigorous
pour
generates
a
reasonable
tan
head
atop
a
translucent
reddish
brown
body
smells
of
vanilla
the
faintest
touch
of
smoke
and
sugary
malts
smells
pretty
good
the
taste
is
somewhat
disappointing
theres
a
bit
of
dryness
and
a
hint
of
an
unidentifiable
offflavor
in
the
finish
with
limited
flavor
of
vanilla
and
otherwise
very
little
in
the
way
of
bourbon
as
a
scotch
ale
it
is
somewhat
bland
and
uninteresting
the
blended
barrel
aging
offers
only
slight
improvement
the
beer
is
also
slightly
under
carbonated
and
doesnt
take
on
the
expected
creaminess
from
the
barrel
aging
it
does
leave
a
sugary
feeling
on
the
tongue
in
spite
of
these
things
this
beer
is
relatively
drinkable
ive
had
much
better
from
this
series
this
fine
ale
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
very
little
head
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
brings
scents
of
roasted
and
sweet
malt
with
an
rich
caramel
tone
this
beer
is
absolutely
delishous
sweet
caramel
with
burnt
sugars
and
molasses
vanilla
and
bourbon
are
present
as
well
big
time
malt
presence
that
knocks
my
socks
off
with
each
sip
awesome
the
creamy
mouthfeel
is
great
and
fulfilling
i
could
swirl
this
one
around
in
my
mouth
all
day
there
isnt
a
listed
abv
but
i
am
assuming
this
is
a
strong
one
based
on
the
title
alone
but
there
is
0
booze
burn
amazing
this
one
poured
a
very
clear
burnt
amber
in
color
with
a
light
off
white
head
which
laced
my
snifter
the
aromas
are
of
toffee
hazelnut
caramel
light
bourbon
butterscotch
and
vanilla
the
flavors
consist
of
vanilla
toffee
light
bourbon
and
sweet
malts
if
you
like
the
sheepshagger
youll
really
like
this
one
this
beer
looked
so
light
while
pouring
and
is
very
clear
in
the
glass
its
really
surprising
how
it
thickens
up
a
little
to
drink
a
very
nice
and
smooth
medium
in
body
im
not
sure
of
the
content
of
this
one
but
its
just
as
drinkable
as
the
sheepshagger
perhaps
even
more
due
to
the
increased
complexity
this
is
yet
another
really
good
beer
from
the
brewers
gone
wild
series
alcohol
is
well
hidden
really
only
remotely
evident
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
as
it
reaches
room
temperature
nicely
done
tyranena
vigorous
pour
produces
a
foam
glass
from
top
to
bottom
with
a
nice
reverse
cascading
head
that
turns
into
a
beautiful
crisp
clear
almost
red
ale
nice
sticky
residue
left
behind
it
smells
almost
chocolate
like
i
get
a
little
bourbon
wood
smell
in
with
it
little
malt
and
vanilla
as
well
very
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
wow
this
is
very
nice
way
to
easy
to
drink
it
does
not
list
abv
but
sheep
shagger
is
7
70
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
fairy
tale
its
not
too
strong
and
its
not
too
light
its
just
right
pick
it
up
if
you
find
it
this
is
a
really
young
beer
this
would
be
great
if
it
had
a
few
years
on
it
d
overall
i
would
say
that
the
caramelized
dark
fruits
and
loads
of
caramel
malt
usually
at
the
forefront
in
a
wee
heavy
were
taken
over
by
the
barrel
characteristics
not
that
i
mind
a
very
nice
beer
usually
like
scotch
ales
but
the
tartness
threw
me
off
on
this
one
overall
not
good
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
was
intended
to
be
presented
this
way
but
its
not
good
as
is
the
tea
leaf
bitterness
doesnt
work
and
the
tartness
just
adds
to
the
confusion
ill
pass
in
the
future
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
o
almost
too
sweet
yet
not
quite
i
like
this
o
a
decent
wee
heavy
but
i
didnt
find
it
as
complex
as
some
reviewers
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
outstanding
its
gotta
be
me
as
i
just
dont
get
a
lot
of
flavor
out
of
this
poured
perhaps
a
bit
cold
with
a
modest
light
tan
head
that
soon
settled
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
mahogany
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
very
malty
toffee
caramel
hint
of
smoke
grain
flavors
kind
of
bland
not
as
pronounced
as
nose
some
tang
up
front
only
a
suggestion
of
scotch
ale
bodycarbonation
are
excellent
finish
is
like
flavor
a
slightly
nuttiness
lingers
and
thats
it
meh
for
style
this
is
kind
of
a
subtle
beer
it
doesnt
knock
me
over
with
intensity
of
flavor
rather
is
requires
some
searching
and
effort
but
it
is
worth
it
i
really
like
lake
louie
beers
but
this
one
is
a
little
different
than
the
rest
most
of
their
brand
is
smooth
and
refreshing
this
beer
seems
a
little
bit
over
the
top
with
taste
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
have
had
plenty
of
scotch
ales
over
the
years
and
this
one
is
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
for
me
maybe
it
was
just
an
off
night
for
me
on
this
one
i
like
my
strong
beers
but
this
scotch
ale
seemed
a
little
to
much
taste
up
front
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
on
the
back
end
of
the
tongue
and
throat
rather
than
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
all
in
all
i
would
get
the
beer
again
but
not
my
first
choice
for
scotch
ales
this
is
my
go
to
beer
whenever
i
have
been
standing
staring
at
the
selection
at
local
beer
selectorium
for
too
long
trying
to
decide
what
i
would
like
to
take
home
i
inevitably
grab
the
warped
speed
scotch
ale
this
beer
has
everything
i
look
for
in
a
beer
anytime
of
year
fans
of
ipas
may
find
it
a
bit
heavy
in
the
summer
but
for
me
its
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
is
perfect
warped
speed
scotch
ale
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
nice
large
head
for
a
scotch
ale
there
was
a
boozy
sweet
sugary
aroma
the
taste
had
a
very
nice
scotch
like
taste
a
good
hint
of
sweetness
nice
warm
and
boozy
good
full
flavor
nice
sipping
beer
overall
a
very
nice
complete
and
well
crafted
scotch
ale
o
a
maltlovers
dream
warped
speed
scotch
ale
manages
quite
well
in
fact
to
usher
sweetness
forward
while
remaining
balanced
and
drinkable
toffee
and
caramel
get
along
well
with
the
beers
coffee
and
chocolate
roasted
malt
notes
for
an
almost
dessertlike
quality
to
this
smooth
brew
overall
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
when
cold
the
sweet
malts
really
were
present
but
as
it
warmed
the
bitter
hops
over
shadowed
the
malty
goodness

of
this
and
it
sucked
so
i
guess
it
was
the
barreling
that
was
fucked
up
and
not
the
base
beer
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
i
suppose
i
never
really
noticed
the
mouthfeel
which
is
oftentimes
a
good
sign
overall
this
is
a
darn
good
example
of
the
style
i
dont
love
this
style
to
be
honest
but
i
can
certainly
appreciate
this
beer
dark
clotted
blood
color
foam
collar
for
a
head
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
levels
smells
of
sweet
malts
mostly
caramel
dark
fruits
and
also
that
hint
of
peat
smoke
that
i
wasnt
able
to
find
in
the
louies
reserve
taste
includes
all
these
elements
and
some
strong
earthy
hopping
on
top
of
a
bowl
of
grape
nuts
cereal
body
is
medium
thick
and
slightly
undercarbonated
it
really
does
come
across
as
a
smaller
louies
reserve
but
with
the
inclusion
of
peatiness
overallvery
very
good
right
on
par
with
the
brewers
reserve
version
of
this
beer
and
an
excellent
bargain
for
7
99
a
six
pack
maybe
one
of
the
best
beers
for
your
buck
ill
stick
by
my
theory
that
wisconsin
is
incapable
of
producing
a
good
beer
im
not
a
big
scotch
ale
fan
but
i
have
to
admit
this
is
a
good
beer
if
youre
interested
in
starting
out
and
finishing
with
a
good
beer
in
this
style
category
this
is
the
one
with
which
you
should
go
pours
a
chocolate
brown
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
caramel
yeasty
banana
spicy
and
phenolic
on
the
nose
modest
bitter
bite
on
the
tongue
more
than
i
expected
strong
molasses
bready
caramel
toffee
with
a
spicy
boozyness
about
it
and
raisin
fig
and
faint
banana
esters
medium
to
light
body
chewy
boozy
spice
in
the
finish
very
good
characteristics
dont
seem
to
meld
perfectly
in
my
book
the
reserve
is
bigger
and
seems
to
bring
everything
together
a
little
better
do
this
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
that
takes
a
traditional
approach
to
the
style
the
flavors
in
the
middle
were
nearly
perfect
and
overall
it
stayed
appealing
from
start
to
finish
pair
with
lighter
braised
meats
but
dont
look
for
this
beer
to
be
a
reliable
source
of
acidity
in
the
pairing
o
good
scotch
ale
but
a
light
mouthfeel
and
a
overall
character
is
what
i
feel
defines
the
style
very
nice
blend
of
malts
add
to
a
classic
wee
heavy
taste
but
a
bit
light
o
overall
impressive
i
like
my
scotch
ales
to
be
heavier
but
this
was
really
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
light
the
scotch
ale
components
are
there
but
not
prominent
enough
body
is
medium
almost
mediumheavy
carbonation
is
just
about
spot
on
in
conjunction
with
the
body
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wish
i
lived
closer
to
wisconsin
so
i
could
have
access
to
it
whenever
i
please
theres
some
caramel
and
butterscotch
flavors
here
but
none
of
the
diacetyl
and
buttery
mouthfeel
that
i
really
want
in
a
scotch
ale
then
again
theres
none
of
the
unfortunately
chalky
malt
flavor
either
overall
its
relative
mildness
read
blandness
and
perfect
level
of
carbonation
makes
it
supremely
drinkable
and
probably
a
fine
session
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
pitty
i
only
picked
up
one
in
a
mixed
6pack
while
traveling
through
janesville
wi
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
shed
in
spring
green
wi
on
feb
26
2011
and
purchased
2
6
packs
of
bottles
at
the
piggly
wiggly
in
dodgeville
to
bring
home
this
is
my
favorite
destination
beer
the
full
mouth
feel
is
very
satisfying
with
big
malts
some
of
the
recent
ba
reviews
make
me
think
some
bad
or
badly
mistreated
beer
has
been
making
the
rounds
because
i
have
found
this
brew
to
be
fully
satisfying
every
time
i
have
had
it
very
drinkable
any
time
of
year
d
not
sure
if
this
is
the
intended
flavor
or
not
but
it
tastes
kind
of
sour
and
not
too
much
like
what
i
would
expect
from
a
scotch
ale
it
isnt
overly
so
which
has
saved
it
from
the
drain
id
like
to
revisit
this
one
sometime
to
tell
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
not
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
the
carbonation
accentuating
the
flavors
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
moderate
brownred
color
with
a
slight
head
and
no
lacing
the
nose
is
some
light
dark
fruits
caramel
toffee
and
a
slight
sour
scent
the
taste
is
definitely
of
an
infected
batch
though
it
hasnt
set
in
too
much
yet
slight
acetic
character
plus
some
toffee
sourness
pops
up
in
the
feel
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
this
is
a
problem
ive
encountered
with
several
of
their
beers
unfortunately
its
really
a
shame
that
theres
that
misplaced
sharp
smelltaste
otherwise
this
would
be
a
very
nice
wee
heavy
as
it
stands
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
my
first
lake
louie
beer
and
the
first
beer
of
the
preinterview
extravaganza
in
madison
it
pours
a
slightly
hazed
rubygarnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
dank
moss
caramel
drier
greens
and
a
small
pile
of
roasted
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
holds
notes
of
toasted
caramel
toffee
and
walnuts
the
body
is
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
finish
that
borders
on
the
sorta
sticky
overall
a
nice
scotch
nothing
too
amazing
but
a
fairly
tasty
offering
nonetheless
by
far
the
best
scotch
ale
for
the
money
in
fact
i
substantially
prefer
this
to
several
ive
had
that
were
34x
the
price
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
disappointment
ill
probably
not
go
back
to
this
for
a
scotch
ale
fix
drinkability
i
was
told
that
this
was
an
exceptional
scotch
ale
but
this
exceeded
my
expectations
easydrinking
incredibly
flavorful
another
exceptional
example
of
wisconsin
brewing
pours
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
aroma
of
malt
and
dark
honey
mouthfeel
and
flavor
are
excellent
for
this
style
with
a
crisp
maltiness
that
slowly
disapates
there
is
a
lingering
astrigency
sort
of
tannic
that
i
cant
quite
place
that
goes
on
a
bit
too
long
for
my
taste
but
this
is
an
excellent
truetostyle
beer
that
i
would
certainly
seek
out
d
a
fine
scotch
ale
that
offers
a
bit
more
complexity
than
most
scotch
ales
very
good
very
food
friendly
d
we
have
a
winner
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
to
black
color
with
thin
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
sour
with
some
sweet
and
smokey
notes
deep
malt
and
smokey
flavors
are
abundant
there
is
something
sour
in
there
like
cranberries
or
something
along
those
lines
a
little
twang
of
vinegar
hits
at
the
end
you
can
feel
something
that
hints
of
booze
on
your
lips
and
tastes
somewhat
of
smoked
malt
like
scotch
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
but
it
isnt
overly
filling
for
something
this
dark
i
couldnt
find
an
abv
for
this
but
im
betting
its
up
there
this
stuff
could
knock
you
around
if
you
are
not
carefull
overall
i
enjoyed
the
complex
malty
boozey
flavor
of
this
beer
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
warmer
in
the
middle
of
winter
good
flavor
and
well
crafted
but
not
one
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
nice
scottish
ale
i
like
my
scottish
ales
to
have
bigger
flavors
this
one
sits
more
of
the
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
d
cant
figure
out
the
abv
on
this
maybe
9
or
10
not
listed
on
the
website
so
its
a
toss
up
loved
founders
dirty
bastard
so
was
looking
forward
to
this
certainly
a
different
beer
less
smoky
more
fruit
flavors
about
as
good
as
well
will
be
seeking
more
wee
heavies
out
overall
a
below
average
take
on
the
style
try
it
if
you
see
it
but
dont
seek
it
out
another
great
extra
forgotten
in
the
back
of
my
refrigerator
pours
into
a
pint
glass
a
deep
rich
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
cap
of
tan
foam
huge
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
just
a
hint
of
piney
hops
very
nicely
balanced
and
quite
a
good
beer
the
scotch
is
present
but
plays
more
of
a
supporting
role
beneath
the
canopy
of
roasted
and
slightly
smoky
malted
barley
delicious
absolutely
recommend
this
especially
on
tap
maybe
this
bottle
was
slightly
off
still
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
d
moderate
drinkability
potent
abv
it
is
a
scotch
ale
not
filling
from
a
carbonation
point
of
view
but
the
very
thick
beer
seems
to
weigh
down
the
palette
the
flavors
are
not
overbearing
or
fatiguing
to
the
palette
drinkability
unbeatable
flavor
plus
its
a
small
local
brewery
whats
not
to
like
overall
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
havent
had
much
from
ll
but
i
might
have
to
grab
some
more
of
there
stuff
drought
dry
strangely
unsatisfying
this
is
a
decent
brew
that
confounded
my
expectations
this
time
not
in
a
good
way
thanks
thomashardy
for
the
opportunity
this
is
a
very
good
and
extremely
drinkable
scotch
ale
that
might
lack
the
complexity
of
the
best
in
the
style
but
its
still
solid
d
goes
down
very
easy
nice
smooth
drinker
there
is
no
hint
of
alcohol
which
could
be
dangerous
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
really
strong
take
on
a
scotch
ale
here
with
that
deep
fruity
tang
being
the
highlight
but
it
almost
gets
to
be
just
a
big
distracting
as
well
another
good
effort
from
lake
louie
da
true
gem
of
a
scotch
ale
they
dont
make
them
much
better
than
this
what
an
incredible
beer
everything
about
this
is
close
to
perfect
creamy
and
mediumfull
up
front
the
beer
fades
nicely
into
a
warming
and
dry
finish
i
didnt
expect
that
from
a
sweeter
and
maltier
beverage
thanks
jeff
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
fall
evening
i
would
enjoy
this
more
often
if
we
got
it
in
chicago
i
do
with
the
body
was
more
full
though
d
drinks
decently
easy
but
you
can
tell
its
a
reasonably
big
beer
d
very
high
this
is
a
great
ale
that
has
all
the
balance
and
features
you
would
want
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
lighter
tan
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
15
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
poor
lacing
and
poor
retention
smells
of
alcohol
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
plum
very
slight
hops
raisin
and
toffee
fits
the
style
of
a
scotch
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
smoke
slight
citrus
plum
slight
hops
and
toffee
overall
a
quite
excellent
beer
that
is
only
slightly
hurt
by
its
appearance
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
fairly
strong
carbonation
keeping
it
a
bit
lively
pours
out
a
deep
mahogany
color
actually
nice
and
clear
i
can
see
right
through
it
which
is
kind
of
rare
for
the
color
the
head
pours
out
very
dense
and
just
over
1
cm
leaves
pretty
decent
lacing
a
good
looking
scotch
ale
the
smell
has
the
two
main
ingredients
a
lot
of
burnt
caramel
sweetness
and
a
nice
touch
of
smoke
as
you
search
theres
a
deep
earthy
sweetness
maybe
from
a
bit
of
hops
or
some
other
addition
but
a
nice
earthy
leafy
kind
of
smell
like
pipe
tobacco
almost
but
much
sweeter
then
there
gets
to
be
this
chocolatey
smell
almost
with
a
bit
of
coffee
in
it
pushed
along
by
a
bit
of
smoke
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
of
the
smoke
than
the
smell
does
but
it
doesnt
get
you
upfront
you
taste
everything
else
first
and
then
the
smoke
fills
it
up
almost
getting
to
that
meaty
level
but
then
falling
back
into
the
malty
sweetness
the
things
you
taste
first
are
this
dense
burnt
cake
kind
of
taste
its
like
you
put
a
slice
pound
cake
into
a
toaster
until
it
got
kind
of
brown
theres
a
nice
earthy
note
in
the
middle
maybe
a
little
leafy
like
a
tea
made
of
dried
up
withered
almost
burnt
leaves
i
guess
those
two
things
dont
sound
too
good
but
when
theyre
rounded
out
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
they
make
a
brilliant
scotch
ale
which
is
what
this
is
sometimes
with
the
right
amount
of
smokiness
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
the
right
amount
of
earthiness
a
scotch
ale
can
taste
at
points
a
bit
like
the
harder
drink
of
the
same
region
this
one
does
that
a
bit
im
a
fan
the
body
is
good
over
medium
but
not
syrupy
but
the
carbonation
is
a
little
more
than
i
expect
theres
a
slight
sting
which
isnt
unpleasant
but
its
uncharacteristic
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
nice
drink
i
enjoyed
it
from
start
to
finish
and
kept
finding
new
things
to
keep
me
interested
of
course
i
couldnt
sit
and
session
this
i
doubt
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
due
to
the
alcohol
content
and
to
the
intensity
of
flavor
but
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
scotch
ale
and
this
was
nearby
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
it
a
very
solid
easily
drinkable
malty
beer
ill
definitely
be
purchasing
more
of
these
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
fairly
low
carbonation
which
accentuates
the
overall
texture
a
great
combination
of
flavors
truly
a
malty
masterpiece
md
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
average
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
there
isnt
any
reason
to
dock
points
very
dark
brown
pour
without
a
ton
of
head
maybe
a
finger
aroma
is
all
malt
nothing
else
competes
with
the
malt
taste
the
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
booziness
not
a
quick
drinker
but
definitely
one
worth
trying
i
got
it
as
an
extra
in
a
lowcost
trade
and
i
probably
wouldnt
trade
for
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
fragrant
burnt
caramel
toffee
and
strong
floral
notes
this
is
the
best
smelling
scotch
ale
i
have
had
to
date
the
taste
is
both
bold
and
subtle
all
the
flavors
stand
out
on
there
own
and
mingle
perfectly
with
each
other
as
with
the
aroma
with
is
the
best
tasting
scotch
ale
i
have
had
the
honor
to
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
sprightly
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
will
surely
search
out
again
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
refrigerator
bottomofbottle
code
8320
d
well
made
and
enjoyable
but
i
prefer
my
scotch
ales
with
a
bunch
more
smoke
this
could
have
been
a
good
wee
heavy
poor
fermentation
management
has
ruined
this
beer
for
me
though
drinkability
isnt
to
hot
it
was
light
and
sweet
enough
to
go
down
but
the
fact
is
there
were
some
distracting
offflavors
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
for
the
style
minimal
carbonation
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
i
thought
i
would
very
good
but
i
only
think
i
could
drink
1
or
2
at
a
time
because
of
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
lush
full
and
chewy
the
malt
is
awesome
for
the
mouthfeel
in
this
beer
d
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beer
and
is
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkale
beers
i
have
come
across
so
far
but
they
dont
call
it
warped
speed
for
nothing
its
a
great
scotch
ale
thanks
to
whoever
sent
this
one
my
way
i
just
got
a
newer
bottle
of
this
from
grub
so
im
swapping
that
out
with
this
older
one
ive
had
in
the
cellar
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
cloudy
brown
color
akin
to
fresh
brewed
iced
tea
the
tan
colored
creamy
head
measures
a
solid
two
fingers
smells
and
tastes
of
caramelized
malts
bready
yeast
and
fruits
such
as
cherries
and
plums
really
malty
as
a
good
wee
heavy
should
be
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
medium
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
a
creamy
dry
mouthfeel
that
is
a
bit
thin
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
use
some
carbonation
and
a
bit
more
depth
of
malt
character
holy
crap
the
head
on
this
thing
was
huge
crystal
clear
deep
amber
color
gorgeous
beer
could
only
fit
half
the
bottle
in
the
glass
though
with
that
huge
head
and
it
took
a
while
to
settle
down
enough
to
pour
the
rest
i
have
a
cold
so
it
was
hard
to
judge
the
smell
i
actually
think
all
i
detected
through
my
stuffy
nose
was
a
little
whif
of
alcohol
taste
was
excellent
with
strong
alcohol
flavor
and
warming
more
malt
than
hops
but
still
well
balanced
heavy
body
with
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
but
only
in
moderation
with
the
high
abv
d
easy
drinking
even
though
the
aroma
was
similar
to
the
taste
the
aroma
seemed
more
complex
and
the
strange
flavor
didnt
fit
very
well
i
find
this
nicely
drinkable
a
good
scotch
glad
i
tried
it
edit
glancing
at
other
reviews
looks
like
this
sample
is
atypical
of
this
beer
as
the
cloying
sweetness
and
overbearing
tart
aspects
arent
often
noted
this
could
well
be
a
bad
bottle
though
my
s
o
thought
it
smelled
and
tasted
of
sourdough
dough
and
kinda
of
liked
it
not
one
for
me
traders
note
thanks
to
nflmvp
for
the
bottles
an
excellent
wee
heavy
unless
you
absolutely
hate
malt
bombs
this
is
a
must
try
an
interesting
beer
that
has
decent
balance
for
the
unique
flavor
that
it
has
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
brew
autumn
colored
beer
with
a
large
frothy
head
aroma
mainly
dominated
by
contamination
or
you
could
say
unpleasant
smells
not
common
in
scotch
ales
no
rich
malts
mainly
just
wild
yeast
and
funk
in
the
nose
flavor
is
sour
clearly
contaminated
and
not
right
remember
having
this
several
years
ago
and
it
was
great
but
this
bottle
has
some
serious
issues
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
lighter
and
less
sweet
than
most
in
the
style
which
makes
it
more
sessionable
than
your
typical
scotch
ale
overall
its
worth
drinking
several
of
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
good
a
fine
example
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
but
close
prosit
mk
pours
a
dark
brown
with
amber
highlights
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
wonderful
malty
aroma
on
the
nose
it
has
an
interesting
sweetness
to
it
theres
cocoa
caramel
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
watery
for
a
scotch
ale
yet
its
still
smooth
warped
speed
is
a
huge
malty
scottish
ale
flavors
of
smoked
malt
and
chocolate
dominate
theres
an
intriguing
cocoa
sweetness
to
it
that
arrives
midway
and
lingers
into
the
long
finish
nicely
done
body
is
a
bit
disappointing
it
is
rather
thin
adding
to
its
drinkability
but
taking
away
from
what
i
like
in
scotch
ales
taste
is
malty
and
caramelized
but
has
little
depth
or
complexity
an
ok
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
brew
with
good
concentration
and
flavor
complexity
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
produce
a
good
example
of
a
scotch
ale
cheers
solid
heavyness
and
easy
drinker
probably
around
6
here
not
sure
but
a
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
could
have
34
easy
glad
i
got
a
6
pack
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
excellent
it
really
crept
up
on
me
with
how
good
it
was
and
i
would
have
no
issues
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
definitely
a
top
not
beer
that
i
would
love
to
get
a
hold
of
again
any
day
well
daggum
if
this
didnt
produce
one
of
the
biggest
creamiest
heads
i
think
that
ive
ever
seen
it
looked
like
a
jamocha
milkshake
from
arbys
and
as
it
slowly
fell
it
left
some
really
stick
lacing
in
its
wake
the
beer
itself
was
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
color
the
nose
was
very
malty
sweet
with
a
hint
of
coconut
and
milk
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thick
side
with
a
chocolaty
flavor
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
equally
sweet
but
with
a
lingering
smoky
aftertaste
it
was
pretty
good
for
the
style
but
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
that
said
given
that
it
is
apparently
available
in
prefilled
growlers
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
try
pours
a
pretty
clear
dark
reddishorange
and
brown
thick
off
white
head
forms
drops
a
ton
of
lacing
behind
solid
layer
and
ring
looks
real
nice
smell
is
nice
sweet
and
caramelized
very
earthy
some
bread
light
chocolate
super
malty
brown
sugar
on
the
sweet
side
but
nice
taste
is
wow
toasted
bread
toffee
brown
sugar
chocolate
very
malty
earthy
rich
excellent
flavour
alcohol
is

hidden

mouthfeel

with
low
carbonation
some

super
smooth
excellent
stuff
thanks
scott
i
bought
this
single
serve
12oz
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
d
pretty
solid
beer
and
now
that
my
review
is
all
wrapped
up
time
to
pour
myself
a
little
scotch
whisky
to
drink
beside
it
i
am
not
the
biggest
lover
of
this
style
but
being
a
big
sweetooth
i
did
want
to
get
more
out
of
it
still
i
appreciate
the
quality
that
it
brings
to
the
table
i
still
have
a
bottle
left
so
well
see
how
my
palate
evolves
over
time
a
super
smooth
nicely
drinkable
scotch
ale
that
could
easily
become
a
household
favorite
if
locally
available
drinkability
very
nice
beer
to
drink
would
buy
this
again
only
thing
is
i
received
it
in
a
trade
overall
a
good
beer
when
judging
all
the
qualities
there
was
more
brussels
lace
as
the
beer
continued
to
warm
and
the
volume
continued
to
drop
in
the
glass
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
fruitier
than
id
expect
but
nice
thanks
jeff
d
overall
this
scotch
ale
is
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
it
seems
to
be
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
deserves
recognition
but
the
tart
yeastiness
takes
away
from
the
comforting
warm
malts
that
make
scotch
ales
so
alluring
at
this
time
of
year
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
giving
this
a
very
good
drinkability
this
was
the
only
bottle
that
i
had
but
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
get
some
more
in
the
future
bottle
poured
a
deep
mahogany
color
ale
with
a
medium
head
with
some
retention
and
average
lacing
characteristics
aroma
of
sweet
malt
is
dominating
with
some
barley
wine
like
feel
taste
is
dominated
by
some
very
sweet
malt
with
no
peat
like
malt
i
noticed
a
metallic
aftertaste
which
i
didnt
like
very
much
i
thought
this
was
totally
offstyle
and
i
didnt
appreciated
very
much
overall
cant
figure
out
what
all
the
hype
is
about
on
this
one
d
the
big
taste
makes
for
a
great
drink
as
i
said
let
er
warm
up
a
bit
first
smoky
tealike
flavors
dry
earthy
peat
husky
grain
caramel
smoked
malt
earthy
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
clean
finish
too
long
residual
boldness
in
the
flavors
even
though
this
is
likely
best
fresh
after
a
year
it
still
has
very
distinctive
and
unique
characteristics
very
drinkable
and
my
favorite
scotch
ale
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brown
with
deep
burgundy
and
mahogany
highlights
good
head
and
lacing
caramel
nose
the
flavor
is
nicely
assertive
malty
and
roasty
even
a
little
smoky
and
caramel
a
little
nuttiness
and
maybe
even
butterscotch
lurking
in
the
background
nice
hoppy
finish
for
a
scotch
ale
even
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
in
a
good
way
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
id
lost
interest
the
last
few
years
lake
louie
warped
speed
has
brought
it
back
recommended
d
its
good
but
the
flavour
is
a
little
too
bold
to
session
d
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
nice
summer
or
fall
ale
for
those
who
want
a
stronger
flavor
without
too
much
body
good
beer
from
lake
louie
every
one
ive
had
from
them
so
far
has
been
solid
could
use
a
little
tweaking
if
only
to
make
a
good
beer
great
but
definately
an
enjoyable
brew
poured
into
a
chalice
a
grapey
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
tan
head
leaves
some
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
oaky
cherries
figs
raisins
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyoaky
nice
presents
of
dark
fruit
some
tanginess
nice
touch
of
caramel
the
finish
is
dry
lightmedium
body
kinda
watery
a
good
thing
because
it
almost
goes
down
like
water
lol
a
complex
brew
very
drinkable
iyou
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
you
know
it
easily
d
wonderful
balance
complex
aroma
and
flavor
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
id
love
to
have
more
of
this
excellent
beer
the
most
important
components
of
this
beer
smell
and
taste
were
complex
and
wonderful
i
wished
the
mouthfeel
could
have
held
up
better
but
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
and
i
would
easily
try
it
again
mouth
is
nice
with
passive
carbonation
that
is
very
subtle
ultimately
its
like
georges
st
pierre
said
to
matt
hughes
i
am
not
impressed
with
your
performance
did
this
taste
good
yes
does
it
fit
the
style
imo
no
taste
is
quite
fine
a
thick
malty
brew
something
deserving
of
the
style
and
name
a
potent
malting
full
of
flavors
caramel
raisin
molasses
figs
a
bit
smoky
perhaps
a
slightly
biting
alcohol
some
spices
sweet
bitter
just
a
heap
of
goodness
a
meal
unto
itself
the
mouth
is
thick
smooth
and
creamy
just
right
carbonation
warm
and
tingly
sooo
go
scotch
ales
arent
really
my
thing
but
ive
had
several
lately
lots
of
good
ones
too
and
this
one
much
be
tops
its
a
damn
good
brew
and
were
i
to
have
a
sixer
of
this
beer
id
develop
a
real
addiction
to
this
style
very
well
done
and
huge
thanks
to
nflmvp
once
again
i
had
high
hopes
for
warped
speed
scotch
ale
prior
to
cracking
the
crown
while
i
was
slightly
disappointed
initially
my
expectations
were
met
by
the
final
ounce
or
two
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
scotch
ale
of
my
dreams
is
in
my
cellar
at
this
very
moment
in
the
form
of
louies
reserve
scotch
ale
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
that
higher
octane
version
stacks
up
against
this
standard
version
which
by
the
way
is
highly
recommended
pours
a
nice
little
head
with
some
coaxing
and
has
a
seemingly
very
nice
little
lacing
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
an
amber
hue
the
first
smell
was
a
little
weak
but
theres
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
that
doesnt
seem
to
fit
just
right
the
smell
is
very
light
it
has
the
sweet
smell
and
almost
no
roasty
characteristics
at
all
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
it
has
a
little
roastiness
present
with
some
light
sweet
tones
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
and
didnt
have
anything
wrong
with
it
besides
a
small
amount
of
watery
feel
to
it
overall
i
might
actually
try
this
again

anyone

a

this

both
getting

throughout
the
entire

thanks
to
murrayswine
for
the
bottle
stellar
example
of

wish
i
had
more
of
these
to
drink
midwestern
trading
buddies
you
might
as
well
go
buy
me
a
sixer
cause
thats
what
ill
be
searching
for
during
our
next
dealing
nice
30
second
finish
that
leaves
an
creamy
somewhat
resiny
mouthfeel
very
pleasing
and
drinkable
thanks
to
nflmvp
for
this
treasure
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
with
hints
of
caramel
and
candy
lingering
i
havent
been
into
malty
beers
for
a
while
usually
opting
for
hopdriven
brews
and
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
with
how
tasty
this
is
i
think
i
may
switch
up
my
selection
a
bit
more
i
used
to
be
really
into
balanced
session
styles
but
ive
become
a
reluctant
hophead
this
is
a
good
one
to
remind
me
that
malt
driven
brews
can
be
just
as
delicious
uf
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
but
its
not
aggressive
goes
down
rather
smooth
and
each
sip
has
me
coming
back
for
more
i
wish
this
wasnt
my
last
bottle
as
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
another
lake
louie
has
impressed
me
so
far
and
this
just
gives
me
a
good
reason
to
get
back
up
to
wisconsin
and
grab
some
more
sixers

they
laid

out
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
because
theyre
so
delicious
but
i
probably
shouldnt
i
just
cant
give
full
points
for
drinkability
either

glad

cellared
9
months
still
drinking
well
though
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
more
fizzy
at
this
point
the
profile
does
seem
to
have
changed
and
the
roasted
and
toasted
malts
have
moved
further
towards
the
forefront
with
some
peaty
notes
on
the
nose
the
nose
has
flourished
but
the

seems
to
have
lost

citrus
carried
by
a
pleasing
waft
of
alcohol
tastes
butterscotch
with
a
nice
caramel
and
munich
malt
aftertaste
that
just
hangs
around
forever
dry
mixes
with
the
slick
butterscotch
in
a
pleasing
combination
a
hint
of
sour
green
apple
adds
an
underlying
edge
of
complexity
hops
i
cant
identify
but
may
be
the
darkish
flavor
that
held
like
deep
baratone
oohhhmmmm
md
body
and
moderately
carbonated
what
a
wonderful
beer
i
will
skip
the
look
and
smell
since
they
were
not
especially
unique
or
outstanding
and
are
well
captured
by
others
the
big
ones
are
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
taste
is
fantastic
big
malty
goodness
with
an
incredible
sweetness
like
a
doppelbock
but
a
bit
more
subtle
the
body
is
just
as
incredible
making
for
a
looong
lasting
aftertaste
even
with
a
small
sip
caramel
hop
bitterness
and
a
malty
goodness
all
in
perfect
balance
making
this
a
truly
unique
and
satisfying
brew
thanks
to
dirtylou
for
this
excellent
wi
beer
this
one
keeps
reminding
me
of
sweet
rolls
with
honey
butter
warmed
over
a
woodsy
campfire
of
burning
maple
logs
very
yummy
im
amazed
that
a
wisconsin
brewery
can
execute
a
scottish
wee
heavy
better
than
so
many
of
the
native
breweries
wish
i
could
find
this
one
in
kentucky
virginia
or
ohio
thanks
again
kevin
want
more
want

found
this
glass
empty
long
before
its
time
pours
a
murky
maple
brown
pretty
much
completely
lacking
a
head
or
lacing
glows
nose
has
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
smoke
and
some
piney
hops
simply
smells
terrific
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bittering
in
the
taste
balances
the
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
well
ridiculously
smooth
mouthfeel
could
almost
be
mistaken
for
watery
but
its
deceivingly
big
warped
speed
is
a
little
piece
of
heaven
in
a
bottle
this
is
truly
a
wonderful
scotch
ale
if
you
come
to
wisconsin
you
must
seek
it
out
luckily
they
are
available
everywhere
at
least
here
in
madison
relish
it
seek
it
out
try
this
beer
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
with
wonderful
malt
complexity
and
layers
but
it
is
a
little
low
in
carbonation
and
it
would
be
great
to
have
a
bit
more
alcohol
however
it
is
not
too
sweet
and
the
finish
is
mediumdry
so
it
works
quite
well
without
the
alcohol
well
done
edit
2
5
hours
in
ive
finished
a
little
over
2
5
pints
and
i
am
seriously
buzzed
at
first
you
really
dont
notice
the
alcohol
but
as
each
pint
warms
you
can
taste
that
alcohol
bite
even
more
this
wee
heavy
lives
up
to
its
name
it
really
packs
a
punch
delicious
but
definitely
in
moderation
ive
never
been
so
effected
after
2
5
pints
yeeesh
kudos
lake
louie
i
have
met
my
match
slàinte
mhath
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
malty
goodness
and
has
a
slight
smokiness
the
flavor
is
very
nice
with
huge
malt
character
lots
of
dark
and
creamy
flavors
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
tiny
bit
of
smoke
very
tasty
drinks
very
easily
too
about
what
it
would
be
like
enjoying
a
beer
infused
jolly
rancher
while
sitting
around
a
campfire
from
a
growler
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
caramel
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
dies
off
quickly
the
smell
is
very
rich
and
malty
lots
of
sweet
roasted
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
heavenly
malty
malty
and
also
malty
lots
of
toffee
sweetness
coming
through
and
the
alcohol
is
kept
to
a
minimum
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
thick
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
great
for
a
beer
that
is
probably
high
in
alcohol
thanks
to
kevin
for
sharing
this
brew
with
me
grabbed
a
growler
while
in
madison
tonight
seemed
like
a
good
night
to
break
it
out
it
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
slight
coat
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
very
nice
with
a
sweet
caramel
and
slight
fruity
base
there
is
a
sweet
smokeyness
in
there
as
well
its
very
enticing
the
flavor
is
right
on
there
with
the
nose
but
with
a
slight
pepperyness
on
the
finish
i
like
that
pepperyness
there
is
also
a
slight
hint
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
small
carb
overall
this
really
is
a
nice
brew
i
wish
i
knew
the
abv
as
it
is
so
smooth
and
drinkable
i
like
it
very
good
scotch
ale
appearance
is
near
perfect
clear
caramelruby
color
but
the
head
didnt
last
long
enough
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
with
some
alcohol
thrown
in
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
on
the
first
sip
is
the
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
very
silky
and
luxurious
the
malt
takes
the
form
of
wonderful
caramel
covered
dark
fruit
which
really
slides
down
the
throat
with
ease
some
mild
smokiness
shows
up
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
mild
hop
bitterness
which
really
makes
you
want
that
next
sip
i
could
drink
a
ton
drinkability
is
near
perfection
coats
the
palate
and
leaves
such
a
pleasant
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
roasted
notes
that
i
cant
imagine
a
better
representation
of
this
style
great
brew
worth
all
the
good
words
written
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
quickly
fading
large
head
smell
is
sweet
earthy
nutty
chocolatey
just
simply
magnificant
taste
is
so
sweet
and
smooth
on
the
mouth
the
malts
really
stick
out
here
as
they
should
in
a
scotch
ale
but
the
depth
of
this
brew
is
incredible
caramel
and
earthy
flavors
pop
through
maybe
some
smokey
wood
flavors
all
i
can
say
is
if
you
are
in
south
central
wisconsin
go
and
buy
yourself
some
of
this
brew
this
is
only
my
second
growler
of
this
stuff
and
i
am
in
complete
love
if
only
it
were
available
near
me
second
only
to
its
big
brother
the
scotch
reserve
64
ounce
growler
this
beer
has
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
slightly
burnt
creamy
chocolatey
buttery
caramel
huge
malty
flavor
with
chocolate
and
caramel
but
not
too
sweet
malt
flavor
turns
to
smokiness
like
smoked
salmon
very
complex
and
a
great
combination
of
flavors
perfect
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
of
this
beers
is
but
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
finished
a
growler
in
one
evening
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
especially
fans
of
scotch
style
ales
buddy
of
mine
picked
me
up
a
growler
of
this
and
tommys
porter
and
what
a
treat
it
was
this
was
very
fresh
tasting
scotch
with
a
wonderful
caramel
toffee
taste
the
color
is
nice
and
dark
with
a
little
redorange
backlight
the
head
wasnt
large
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
the
sweet
malt
aroma
filled
the
nostrils
and
the
sweetness
on
the
tongue
was
an
excellent
finish
the
alcohol
was
nicely
hidden
but
i
can
tell
this
one
is
prettyheavily
leaded
based
on
the
sommersaults
my
mind
started
doing
this
one
could
be
a
dangerous
one
to
belly
up
at
the
bar
with
all
night
but
not
difficult
get
a
growler
of
this
now
my
3rd
lake
louie
beer
so
far
all
thanks
to
mr
c
and
not
a
one
has
been
less
than
a
joy
if
only
theyd
come
a
little
closer
to
my
house
and
not
stay
way
off
in
wisconsin
id
be
a
happier
monk
than
i
am
now
excellent
craft
yet
again
from
lake
louie
its
hard
to
pass
on
the
ones
you
know
you
like
to
try
out
the
rest
porter
or
cream
ale
next
stop
reading
this
and
try
it
for
yourself
d
mouthfeel
must
be
experienced
to
be
appreciated
silken
just
does
not
seem
to
do
it
justice
serve
this
at
cellar
temp
and
be
prepared
many
thanks
to
cokes
for
this
growler
for
about
9
a
4
pack
this
is
an
absolutely
spectacular
buy
i
prefer
this
over
scotty
karate
old
chubb
dirty
bastard
and
any
of
the
other
regularly
available
mid
west
scotch
ales
it
pretty
much
only
distributes
in
wi
but
whenever
i
am
up
there
this
is
top
of
my
to
do
list
color
is
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
a
cream
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quick
nose
is
a
caramel
malt
with
something
like
a
rye
spiciness
behind
it
maybe
a
hint
of
booze
burnt
sugar
taste
follows
nose
caramel
mild
spice
fairly
sweet
with
bitterness
on
the
followthrough
a
little
dark
fruit
finish
is
bitter
boozy
and
leaves
that
spice
flavor
maybe
nutmeg
creamy
carbonation
very
fine
bubbles
pretty
good
step
up
from
warped
speed
for
sure
like
warped
speed
but
a
bit
better
very
good
scotch
ale
wouldnt
bother
buying
a
4pack
of
this
for
more
than
a
6pack
of
warped
speed
though
o
not
always
a
huge
lake
louie
fan
but
they
do
make
some
fantastic
scotch
ales
this
and
warped
speed
are
phenomenal
beers
perfectly
balanced
in
sweetness
and
awesome
mouthfeel
still
one
of
my
favorite
strong
scotch
ales
of
all
time
definitely
rivals
founders
backwoods
bastard
which
makes
its
own
weather
because
of
the
barrel
aging
beats
my
other
two
commonly
found
gotos
oskar
blues
old
chub
and
dark
horse
scotty
karate
much
better
than
skull
splitter
or
sticky
mcdoogle
o
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
the
best
wee
heavy
beers
in
wi
and
it
is
lake
louies
finest
beer
i
enjoy
a
4
pack
of
this
every
year
if
you
are
in
wi
during
october
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
pack
or
two
o
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
it
is
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
starting
off
by
saying
i
think
it
might
be
a
bad
bottle
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
quick
fading
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
funky
it
should
be
sweet
and
malty
smells
like
it
was
aged
in
oak
or
something
just
too
funky
for
a
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
tart
very
sour
off
the
first
sip
the
finish
is
more
of
the
malty
scotch
ale
shining
through
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
some
sharp
carbonation
overall
this
beer
would
probably
be
good
i
just
think
something
got
infected
here
would
be
willing
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
with
hopes
of
a
better
outcome
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
wee
heavy
beer
its
very
traditional
and
a
solid
beer
all
around
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
that
i
have
drank
from
lake
louie
its
gotta
be
thier
standout
beer
that
they
brew
not
a
bad
beer
but
fell
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
do
this
big
scotch
ale
lacks
the
smoothness
required
of
such
a
sipping
beer
if
acidity
was
not
so
out
of
control
at
times
it
would
impress
as
it
is
authentic
maltderived
flavors
are
tossed
about
and
sent
fleeing
by
the
scathing
carbonic
acid
that
sticks
in
the
throat
it
also
struggles
with
style
identity
a
bit
easily
mistakable
for
a
doppelbock
or
conservative
quad
in
lieu
of
a
wee
heavy
o
good
scotch
ale
will
seek
out
and
try
again
pours

a
dark

mixture
of
dark

in
a
sturdy
aromatic
base
of
sweet

and
toffee
a
sip
of
the
mediumheavy
body
reveals
dense
layers
of
the
same
sweet
malts
with
large
wallops
of
nutty
flavors
and
no
hint
at
all
of
the
alcohol
content
inside
very
small
hop
accents
of
grassy
and
earth
tones
show
themselves
towards
the
end
of
the

smooth
things
out
but
remain
background
level
enough
to
keep
things
appropriate
for
a
wellmade
scotch
ale
silky
smooth
in
texture
the
only
nitpick
i
could
find
is
that
it
could
use
a
smidgeon
of
smokiness
that
said
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
this
is
the
finest
by
far
of
the
few
scotch
ales
ive
tried
a
bold
and
wonderful
beer
you
are
certain
to
enjoy
a
shame
about
the
excess
bitterness
and
alcohol
an
enjoyable
large
sipping
beer
does
not
live
up
to
expectations
however
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
they
barrelaged
this
beer
the
wee
heavy
poured
into
my
snifter
displays
a
deep
amberlight
brown
color
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
that
very
quickly
diminished
to
barely
a
skim
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
earthy
slightly
smoky
caramel
malt
hints
of
booze
and
a
bit
of
butterscotch
the
flavor
is
big
nutty
earthy
caramel
malt
a
bit

balance

good
stuff
here
excellent
editafter
drinking
a
few
scotch
ales
this
winter
i
noticed
that
many
of
them
have
a
little
sourness
to
them
this
one
did
not
initially
but
i
cracked
a
bottle
in
march
that
i
have
had
since
august
and
i
tasted
the
familiar
scotch
ale
sourness
that
was
absent
the
first
time
i
had
this
is
it
possible
that
only
aging
for
7
months
could
have
done
that
o
a
solid
beer
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
during
the
fall
to
be
honest
i
feel
like
it
used
to
have
even
more
flavor
when
they
were
making
it
in
smaller
batches
they
used
to
release
like
14
as
many
cases
as
they
do
now
i
still
enjoy
the
rich
malty
flavor
and
its
a
great
beer
to
lay
down
until
late
winter
overall
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
i
think
this
would
actually
be
a
better
beer
if
the
alcohol
were
lower
i
think
the
high
alcohol
takes
away
from
some
of
the
subtle
flavors
or
caramel
and
chocolate
i
look
forward
to
this
seasonal
every
year
pours
a
cloudy
apple
ciderlike
color
sparse
offwhite
ring
of
foam
not
much
lacing
smells
like
caramel
malt
and
some
red
fruit
mix
of
candied
cherry
and
strawberry
brown
sugar
hop
earthiness
slight
alcohol
taste
is
mostly
caramel
malt
alcohol
along
with
something
that
makes
it
taste
like
a
macro
lager
like
a
dry
lager
yeast
or
something
reminds
me
of
mgd
i
am
confused
now
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
nice
and
somewhat
unique
smell
but
taste
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
overall
as
noted
this
beer
seems
like
it
might
be
starting
to
skunk
however
i
have
had
it
absolutely
fresh
too
and
it
is
solid
not
amazing
but
solid
in
the
fundamentals
1
5
d
im
pretty
sure
i
got
a
bad
bottle
if
i
didnt
then
i
dont
understand
the
other
reviews
this
tastes
like
a
noobs
homebrew
not
a
huge
scotch
fan
to
begin
with
but
these
does
nothing
to
help
change
my
mind
nor
is
it
a
good
representation
of
the
stye
pass
for
me
overall
i
loved
this
beer
i
was
a
bit
turned
off
by
the
smell
but
as
soon
as
i
had
a
swig
i
was
totally
impressed
the
flavor
has
the
distinct
taste
of
malt
and
maybe
some
cocoa
as
well
the
hops
though
light
are
blended
perfectly
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
sold
anywhere
but
southwestern
wisconsin
but
if
you
find
yourself
in
arena
wi
stop
at
any
liquor
store
and
pick
some
of
this
up
youll
be
happy
you
did
overall
quite
nice
for
a
scotch
ale
big
beer
but
great
balance
and
loads
of
complexity
fun
to
drink
but
dangerous
would
be
nice
with
some
caramelized
onion
smothered
pan
seared
pork
tenderloin
already
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
than
one
bottle
d
very
drinkable
i
would
enjoy
a
few
of
these
with
a
rich
stewed
game
meal
d
very
good
for
a
higher
scotch
ale
medium
to
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
slick
and
smooth
with
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
and
alcohol
heat
d
this
is
an
aboveaverage
scotch
ale
that
doesnt
have
any
major
flaws
but
doesnt
really
blow
my
mind
either
although
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
im
curious
what
it
would
take
to
do
so
its
not
very
heavy
in
peat
or
smoke
but
otherwise
its
quite
true
to
style
definitely
recommended
if
youre
into
this
type
of
brew
d
overall
a
decent
wee
heavy
im
not
sure
what
sets
it
apart
from
all
the
others
in
the
style
category
though
d
with
the
great
complexity
of
flavors
in
this
one
and
the
alcohol
never
apparent
in
taste
this
is
a
dangerously
good
beer
every
sip
i
take
it
keeps
getting
better
now
all
ll
has
to
do
is
distribute
more
to
the
milwaukee
area
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
with
little
head
very
little
aromatics
to
give
a
sense
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
warped
speed
with
much
more
intense
dark
flavors
leather
and
earth
this
is
a
very
good
beer
pushing
to
the
edge
of
the
scotch
ale
spectrum
being
a
bit
heavy
to
have
more
than
one
it
would
have
outstanding
potential
to
be
aged
on
oak
heavy
body
medium
carbonation
good
complexity
and
great
flavors
one
of
my
favorites
from
a
great
brewery
look
forward
to
it
every
year
drinkability
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
scotch
ale
it
has
some
nice
sweet
fruity
flavor
and
just
enough
heat
from
the
9
abv
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
beer
fresh
just
to
try
it
at
full
power
still
time
has
done
this
beer
well
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
that
likes
the
style
cheers
drinkability
ive
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
over
the
years
and
its
always
the
same
story
a
pretty
poor
offering
and
certainly
does
not
come
to
mind
when
thinking
on
a
good
scotch
ale
pass
amazing
im
a
big
fan
of
warped
speed
so
this
knocked
my
socks
off
pours
deep
with
a
solid
head
smells
great
and
tastes
even
better
similar
to
warped
speed
but
soooo
smooth
i
could
drink
this
everyday
a
good
thick
malt
bomb
of
a
scotch
ale
that
has
just
enough
smoke
and
fruit
to
keep
things
from
getting
too
syrupy
a
good
strong
brew
that
i
like
to
linger
over
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
louies
reserve
strong
scotch
ale
labeled
on
the
neck
poured
into
my
wachusett
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
murky
crimson
brown
color
with
barely
a
finger
of
fizzy
quickly
fading
tan
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
butterscotch
baking
chips
believe
it
or
not
watermelon
bittersweet
caramel
alcohol
sourdough
bread
raisins
fizzy
carbonation
medium
bodied
and
the
finish
is
bitter
as
well
as
mildly
sweet
and
sour
drinkability
pretty
good
definitely
better
then
the
warped
speed
it
was
lighter
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
some
scotch
esters
decent
depth
as
it
opened
up
but
like
the
warped
speed
im
not
loving
the
acidity
bottle
from
a
trade
with
wisrarebeer
the
beer
is
murky
redbrown
with
a
thin
but
solid
looking
head
the
beer
smells
rich
and
nearly
oppressive
a
strong
malt
bomb
of
a
beer
same
with
the
taste
this
is
massive
with
strong
malt
and
barleywine
notes
very
boozy
so
much
so
that
its
difficult
to
rate
drinkability
very
high
much
appreciated
brew
very
clean
alcohol
note
considering
abv
as
mentioned
before
a
light
astringency
and
seems
to
come
out
more
as
it
warms
carbonation
is
light
but
good
for
style
overall
a
very
nice
weeheavy
the
yeast
notes
are
impressive
and
just
a
minor
tweek
on
the
malt
would
make
this
world
class
poured
a
deep
deep
brownish
red
with
no
head
the
scent
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
malty
caramel
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
was
earthy
and
sweet
there
was
a
good
presence
of
dark
fruit
which
added
to
the
sweetness
im
guessing
and
you
could
pickup
the
alcohol
in
there
too
what
a
beer
im
glad
i
tried
and
wish
i
wouldve
bought
more
than
a
single
bottle
this
fall

thanks
russ
overall
i
was
completely
under
whelmed
by
this
one
i
was
hoping
that
this
was
going
to
be
some
really
great
scotch
ale
the
likes
of
which
i
had
not
seen
before
however
this
was
just
not
the
case
it
was
dull
muted
and
just
really
just
did
not
taste
anywhere
near
what
i
would
have
liked
it
to
i
dont
think
i
would
try
this
one
again
unless
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
but
whatever
there
are
much
better
representations
of
the
style
out
there
to
be
found
i
dont
really
think
this
one
is
worth
the
hype
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bordering
on
heavy
and
feels
silky
smooth
yum
again
that
toffee
is
really
make
this
one
very
drinkable
given
the
alcohol
content
im
really
happy
that
i
got
to
try
this
wee
heavy
as
its
a
darn
good
one
clear
brown
with
an
off
white
head
of
foam
caramel
hits
hard
in
the
nose
with
light
hops
in
the
background
other
notes
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
booze
make
this
one
similar
to
a
dark
chocolate
roasted
caramello
bar
taste
is
caramel
again
with
nice
boozy
warmth
toastedroasted
malts
and
a
wonderful
lingering
finish
of
toffeeness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
that
lends
to
the
excellent
drinkability
d
this
beer
has
a
good
smooth
flavor
with
some
nice
depth
the
light
note
of
smoke
does
a
good
job
of
enhancing
the
malt
without
tasting
like
band
aids
dark
toffee
brown
fairly
clear
with
a
thin
fine
skim
of
beige
foam
the
bubbles
formed
a
solid
collar
and
produced
quite
a
bit
of
delicate
lace
toffeecaramel
aroma
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
roast
light
smoke
low
bitterness
with
a
lot
of
malt
mostly
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
light
hoppiness
and
chocolate
notes
some
alcohol
and
smoke
in
the
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
with
smooth
soft
carbonation
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
with
some
warmth
this
stuff
is
really
quite
good
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
a4
s4
t4
5
m4
5
d4
quite
a
bit
of
punch
here
which
is
probably
due
to
the
alcohol
i
like
the
lasting
flavors
and
slight
lacing
which
also
hung
around
for
a
while
read
some
information
on
louie
reserve
and
it
looks
like
the
alcohol
at
9
to
10
is
what
i
am
sensing
i
did
not
get
the
caramel
either
but
then
i
dont
always
know
what
im
doing
looks
like
i
was
lucky
to
pick
up
a
six
of
this
although
it
was
bit
more
than
i
wanted
to
spend
partly
because
the
vendor
the
ale
is
quite
good
and
can
see
indulging
again
d
the
9
is
so
well
hidden
that
id
be
hardpressed
to
put
the
abv
above
6
the
ale
is
warming
and
full
without
being
to
sweet
an
incredible
beer
that
is
worth
the
accolades
easily
one
of
the
best
wee
heavies
that
ive
ever
had
louies
reserve
strong
scotch
ale
as
the
neck
label
reads
is
the
best
beer
that
ive
ever
had
from
what
i
think
is
the
best
brewer
in
the
great
state
of
wisconsin
its
everything
i
want
in
a
wee
heavy
and
then
some
if
i
was
a
badger
id
buy
this
stuff
by
case
whenever
the
brewery
decided
to
grace
us
with
a
batch
d
it
is
pretty
good
i
think
it
might
be
a
tad
to
old
but
still
tasty
i
think
there
are
better
wee
heavies
though
poured
into
a
chalice
a
grapey
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
tan
head
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
oaky
cherries
figs
raisins
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyoaky
nice
presents
of
dark
fruit
some
tanginess
nice
touch
of
caramel
the
finish
is
dry
medium
body
a
complex
brew
very
drinkable
iyou
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
you
know
it
easily
i
will
get
a
pack
of
this
for
next
winter
pours
a
big
head
that
doesnt
fall
that
fast
it
leaves
a
great
lacing
behind
as
well
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
in
it
the
smell
is
a
little
sour
and
smells
like
a
scotch
ale
the
taste
is
a
little
clove
with
a
big
scotch
ale
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
slightly
fizzy
but
its
crisp
and
a
little
refreshing
as
well
i
will
wait
patiently
for
the
next
years
reserve
ale
to
try
it
again
im
amazed
i
actually
traded
one
of
these
away
leftmindedrighty
mother
fucker
you
better
like
this
one
like
it
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
a
good
brew
medium
leaning
toward
thin
mouthfeel
d
give
me
another
period
overall
this
is
a
very
worthwhile
brew
to
seek
out
while
in
wi
or
through
trading
be
sure
its
fresh
and
stored

malty

this
is
amazingly
drinkable
for
such
a
heavy
beer
balanced
smooth
with
a
belt
that
sneaks
up
on
you
no
wonder
they
used
to
call
this
liqiud
reefer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
and
syrupy
but
remarkably
smooth
and
drinkable
would
make
a
fine
winter
warmer
or
pair
well
with
a
cigar
i
like
it
no
matter
what
it
decides
to
be
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
chewy
with
plenty
of
carbonation
it
makes
itself
known
and
goes
down
easily
with
only
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
another
stellar
scotch
ale
from
lake
louie
that
i
wish
i
had
a
bigger
supply
of
i
see
myself
coming
home
with
a
trunk
full
of
lake
louie
the
next
time
i
get
up
to
wi
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
syrupy
not
bad
at
all
overall
a
good
scotch
ale
and
since
i
dont
often
get
to
have
these
i
have
to
give
this
one
props
although
i
dont
think
id
be
able
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
drinkability
is
solid
the
regular
warped
speed
is
more
stylistic
accurate
imo
but
this
is
a
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
with
just
a
bit
too
much
alcholic
threads

same
batch
cellared
until
now
seems
that
more
of
the
malt
has
come
out
with
age
smooth
but
with
a
nice
alcohol
bite
worth
a
shot
in
the
cellar
for
sure
after
drinking
so
many
hoppy
beers
it
is
good
to
go
to
the
malty
side
and
this
was
a
great
departure
filtered
darker
redamber
with
a
distinct
malt
and
buttered
caramel
popcorn
nose
im
not
getting
any
peat
just
a
lot
of
the
same
flavors
as
the
smell
this
needs
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
since
warming
really
helps
bring
some
excellent
flavors
forward
in
a
big
bodied
beer
i
liked
the
warped
speed
much
better
someone
get
me
a
lake
louie
tshirt
yet
another
dirtylou
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
14
tan
head
over
the
clear
reddish
brown
brew
what
head
there
is
fades
relatively
slowly
with
bubbly
lacing
prevalent
aroma
is
vanilla
and
alcohol
with
sweetness
also
weighing
in
taste
is
almost
a
light
mocha
sweetness
touches
of
peat
smoke
and
a
vanilla
alcohol
close
mouthfeel
is
awesome
for
the
style
and
abv
and
drinkabilty
is
only
limited
by
how
much
you
can
find
another
great
wee
heavy
from
these
guys
nice
american
example
of
a
wee
heavy
sticky
sweet
malts
govern
with
an
assertive
smoky
character
and
ideal
hop
bitterness
for
a
well
executed
complexity
very
enjoyable
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
this
superb
bottle
pours
an
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
some
caramel
and
graham
cracker
as
kmpitz2
said
the
nose
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
the
flavor
actually
got
better
as
it
warmed
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
at
all
when
it
was
really
cold
but
it
got
better
as
it
got
warmer
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
caramel
and
some
burned
malt
finish
is
somewhat
oily
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
alcohol
and
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
pours
a
fullon
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
swirl
of
something
over
top
i
wouldnt
call
it
head
but
its
pretty
cool
looking
nose
is
caramel
and
brownsugary
sweet
with
notes
of
graham
crackers
and
chocolate
just
hints
of
alcohol
play
in
the
back
flavor
is
rather
brownsugar
sweet
with
a
moderate
burnt
to
smokey
note
and
a
bitterness
that
hangs
on
the
finish
but
it
is
not
from
hops
nothing
lingers
too
long
feel
is
slightly
syrupy
slick
thick
with
a
light
carbonation
for
9
this
one
really
goes
down
smooth
and
doesnt
let
on
to
the
alcohol
content
the
more
i
drink
this
one
the
more
it
grows
on
me
glad
i
have
some
to
hang
onto
and
drink
theres
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
otherwise
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
that
detracts
from
the
drinkability
other
than
this
though
louies
reserve
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
better
than
warped
speed
im
not
sure
and
im
leaning
toward
nobut
thats
hardly
something
of
which
to
be
ashamed
i
really
dont
see
that
many
differences
between
this
and
warp
speed
obviously
but
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
lake
louie
is
quite
the
gem
brewery
and
i
will
drink
this
one
while
it
lasts
lets
unretire
this
brew
and
get
it
on
the
best
of
ba
it
deserves
it

updating
my
ratings
slightly
after
several
more
bottles
ive
decided
this
is
not
quite
as
good
as
the
regular
warped
speed
scotch
ale
the
alcohol
is
a
little
overpowering
still
a
great
beer
though
pours
a

big

if
you
can
find
it
get
it
the
most
refined
beer
ive
had
to
date
props
to
cokes
for
the
big
ol
growler
seeya
next
fall
good
buddy
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
on
top
of
all
that
so
soft
and
lucious
leads
one
to
the
assumption
that
you
simply
cannot
stop
back
on
my
heels
the
beer
is
gone
but
not
for
long
this
is
absolutely
brilliant
stuff
and
stands
in
ably
for
a
barleywine
as
a

happy

when
youve
been
good
i
hope
ive
been
good
huge
thanks
to
mr
cokes
for
sending
along
this
22oz
sample
a
great
beer
sent
by
a
great
ba
fucking
incredible
with
a
taste
too
alcoholic
great
beer
on
tap
at
bangers
and
lace
perfect
for
a
snowy
winter
evening
sweet
and
flat
but
overall
a
tasty
brew
very
sweet
for
a
scotch
ale
in
a
good
way
notes
of
plums
and
raisins
similar
to
many
quads
very
interesting
brew
presentation
packaged
in

ml
brown
glass
belgianstyle
bomber
with
a
cork
and
cage
served
in
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
sensory
glass
overall
a
nice
scotch
ale
with
a
subtle
belgian
influence
noticeable
through
its
yeasty
aroma
a
good
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
o
one
of
my
new
regulars
bought
on
a
whim
but
happy
i
did
will
buy
again
noted
that
there
was
what
seemed
to
be
dried
yeast
on
the
bottom
of
the
inside
of
the
bottle
after
i
poured
the
last
drop
but
no
strange
taste
or
smell
if
anyone
has
experienced
this
aspect
with
other
beers
i
would
be
happy
to
hear
it
rjt
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
although
its
not
my
favourite
style
the
taste
is
not
really
strong
nor
is
too
weak
it
starts
with
a
slight
caramel
and
roasted
coffee
taste
its
pretty
bitter
and
quite
strong
although
still
quite
easy
to
drink
nice
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
streaks
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
small
chunks
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
very
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
smells
pretty
nice
but
the
taste
is
way
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
the
body
was
nicely
medium
and
had
a
very
dry
finish
drinkability
was
good
pretty
easy
actually
due
to
the
low
sour
level
overall
a
prety
nice
brew
just
not
very
sour
probably
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
low
b
o
very
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
very
belgian
i
quite
enjoyed
this
brew
not
that
great
an
interesting
belgian
twist
on
the
style
but
not
good
for
more
than
a
glass
overall
its
interesting
i
selected
it
because
it
was
considered
a
wee
heavy
one
of
my
favorite
styles
what
i
got
was
a
large
bottle
which
cost
me
12
99
and
i
decided
to
try
it
and
am
okay
with
it
there
is
no
real
bitter
aftertaste
nothing
lingering
in
the
background
after
its
passed
not
worth
13
but
i
suppose
thats
the
price
for
variety
the
old
commercial
standby
chimay
blue
is
less
and
i
know
what
im
getting
there
but
its
a
worthy
snort
just
not
worth
the
13
while
waiting
for
this
sad
corrugated
mess
to
leave
its
clear
this
stuff
was
built
to
last
its
firm
in
your
grill
kinda
thick
wit
it
without
going
too
far
into
monique
territory
and
doesnt
have
a
bubbly
enough
personality
for
morning
radio
but
can
get
along
well
enough
at
the
dmv
nah
thats
being
mean
substitute
the
social
security
office
there
those
chicks
at
least
feign
smiles
at
times
when
all
is
said
and
done
its
not
dry
outside
but
the
umbrella
sure
as
hell
aint
necessary
just
a
light
sweatshirt
no
hood
fuck
your
hoodies
skatetrash
its
only
water
not
acid
waiting
to
dissolve
that
shitty
dyejob
you
never
shoulda
let
your
flaky
fingerbang
fan
do
to
you
shit
those
pants
are
too
tight
even
for
a
rail
like
her
suspicious
the
malts
are
upfront
no
question
in
the
taste
with
a
butterscotch
or
maybe
more
likely
buttery
taste
followed
by
a
moderate
bitterness
that
doesnt
linger
all
that
much
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
fruitiness
continues
in
the
flavor
and
combines
with
a
brown
bread
yeastiness
that
makes
this
very
unscotch
aleesque
there
does
seem
to
be
plenty
of
caramel
and
even
a
touch
of
peat
in
here
but
is
overshadowed
by
the
yeast
presence
i
want
mad
smoke
peat
chocolate
and
sugar
flavors
in
my
wee
heavy
this
delivers
on
the
carmelysugar
aspect
but
fails
on
the
other
three
mouthfeel
is
good
the
carbonation
fine
and
the
beer
slick
unfortunately
the
beer
seems
to
fall
short
of
the
richness
and
malt
complexity
a
good
bsda
comes
with
and
does
not
fare
well
against
other
great
scotch
ales
due
to
the
lack
of
smokepeatchocolate
its
not
bad
i
mean
i
wont
have
trouble
finishing
this
750
but
certainly
not
something
i
would
come
back
to
again
for
the
price
o
a
good
beer
im
not
real
familiar
with
the
style
and
its
not
my
favorite
style
by
far
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
down
a
bit
fast
for
8
i
cant
get
over
how
sweet
it
is
deep
redbrown
colour
ring
of
white
head
light
lace
as
well
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
malt
some
darker
sugars
and
dark
fruits
pick
up
as
well
as
this
warms
light
undertones
of
belgian
yeast
comes
together
quite
nicely
taste
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
with
caramel
and
toffee
dark
fruits
soaked
in
alcohol
some
sugary
sweetness
before
finishing
quite
belgian
with
a
yeasty
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
medfull
body
lightly
syrupy
at
parts
while
nothing
about
this
beer
jumps
out
as
excellent
its
still
quite
nice
and
fairly
drinkable
wanted
a
fresher
bottle
but
i
thought
it
might
keep
okay
and
this
was
the
only
bottle
available
to
me
in
my
area
so
heres
to
this
experience
skoals
o
a
nice
wee
heavy
with
much
in
common
with
a
doppelbock
but
very
obvious
still
a
wee
heavy
nice
and
malty
its
a
bit
harsh
on
th
etip
of
the
tongue
but
quite
mellow
after
really
good
brew
nice
blend
of
belgium
meets
wee
heavy
and
it
works
i
am
actually
surprised
it
doesnt
have
better
reviews
than
it
does
nice
brew
and
id
have
again
for
sure
wow
this
was
very
good
kind
of
like
a
dubbel
meets
scotch
ale
very
fruity
with
a
dense
malt
backbone
that
had
a
woody
alcohol
edge
to
it
great
feel
and
i
enjoyed
every
sip
im
gonna
pick
up
a
few
of
these
for
christmaswinter
overall
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
but
its
still
a
very
drinkable
above
average
brew
with
the
limited
amount
of
scotch
ales
available
in
my
area
this
is
a
welcome
addition
overall
pretty
good
but
i
dont
see
myself
returning
to
this
one
as
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
personal
tastes
a
very
pleasant
wee
heavy
though
the
emphasis
is
on
the
wee
because
there
is
not
much
heavy
about
this
ale
at
all
lighter
with
loads
of
fruity
flavors
this
is
a
sweet
enjoyable
brew
i
did
have
it
once
before
on
draft
and
seem
to
remember
it
being
hoppier
than
this
but
i
could
be
mistaken
even
if
this
older
and
sweeter
it
certainly
has
not
suffered
due
to
the
age
o
an
good
scotch
ale
although
lacking
some
scotch
ale
qualities
goes
down
well
while
listening
to
the
music
of
european
improvisor
paul
dunmall
on
his
sax
or
bagpipe
also
goes
well
while
watching
the
rangers
play
soccer
in
the
scottish
premier
league
the
rangers
have
become
team
america
now
having
three
americans
on
board
bocanegra
maurice
edu
and
my
main
man
alex
bedoya
alex
is
the
future
ok
but
disappointing
medium
to
full
bodied
crisp
a
bit
too
crisp
and
a
dry
clove
finish
delightful
o
this
is
definitely
a
wee
bit
heavy
but
for
what
it
is
its
one
of
the
smoothest
ive
had
it
might
slap
you
up
a
bit
but
itll
kiss
you
afterwards
overallgreat
scotch
ale
from
belgium
of
all
places
a
lot
mellower
than
most
scotch
ales
i
will
be
seeking
this
beer
out
again
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
ruby
coloring
that
is
hazy
giving
it
a
bloody
quality
the
head
starts
out
a
foamy
rising
light
tan
color
that
is
almost
an
inch
but
quickly
settles
into
a
sparse
covering
film
aromas
are
extremely
sweet
and
boozey
with
a
strong
nut
character
as
well
as
a
roast
and
scotch
backbone
the
nose
is
very
forward
and
strong
tipping
its
hand
towards
a
stronger
flavor
profile
initial
taste
does
not
disappoint
with
a
blast
of
rich
and
deep
flavors
more
roasted
than
the
aromas
depicted
the
nut
and
caramel
malts
remain
strong
with
a
more
subdued
alcohol
characteristic
smooth
bodied
and
surprisingly
not
cloying
the
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
the
aftertaste
is
rich
and
sweet
with
a
hazelnut
flavor
and
the
finish
is
quick
despite
the
full
body
a
slight
tang
of
booze
on
the
very
end
of
the
palate
good
beer
enjoyed
at
the
grille
next
door
in
haverhill
ma
this
stuff
shows
a
rosey
brown
color
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
and
very
little
sign
of
lacing
it
gives
off
a
malty
moxie
and
maple
sugar
smell
with
lemony
accents
i
like
it
the
flavor
says
thick
vanilla
and
candy
apple
with
dr
pepper
ideas
and
a
little
whiskey
to
boot
its
a
mediumplus
bodied
brew
near
syrupy
but
fair
carbonation
makes
it
plenty
drinkable
considering
the
abv
very
enjoyable
overall
impression
maybe
some
more
character
and
ingredient
can
be
included
in
this
one
all
i
get
is
the
single
malt
scotch
tastes
all
the
way
through
also
how
did
i
get
this
stinky
sock
aroma
very
wild
i
wouldnt
suggest
anyone
to
get
this
one
but
if
you
would
be
able
to
get
a
sample
of
this
somewhere
go
for
the
aroma
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
o
this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
interesting
to
put
a
belgian
spin
on
the
style
taste
was
awesome
sweetfruity
berries
malt
alcohol
and
a
bitter
caramel
aftertaste
obviously
heavy
but
still
well
balanced
great
carbonation
and
good
drinkability
love
when
i
get
my
hands
on
a
scotch
silly
have
really
enjoyed
it
every
time
ive
tried
it
overall
just
a
great
scotch
ale
easily
one
of
my
favorites
to
date
taste
is
also
very
nice
wellrounded
firm
with
a
little
complexity
sweet
burnt
raisins
and
prunes
spicy
woodiness
general
nicely
complex
and
integrated
fruityearthywoody
character
with
somewhat
of
a
fortifiedwine
quality
and
light
toastiness
it
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
i
like
this
calm
quiet
and
tasty
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
o
nice
beer
but
not
one
i
would
constantly
seek
out
still
a
solid
brew
thats
worth
trying
if
you
havent
yet
its
a
belgian
scotch
ale
huh
and
its
way
better
than
the
lot
of
domestic
versions
ha
a
strong
chewy
malt
center
juicy
at
times
some
of
the
flavours
are
reminiscent
of
berries
toasty
malt
rounds
out
the
palate
lingering
on
into
the
finish
next
to
no
trace
of
hops
the
body
is
oily
and
vicious
with
a
medium
low
carbonation
o
good
but
not
great

no

on
this

had

wrapped

with
a
very
belgian

i
am
no
expert
at
belgians
but
this
screams
belgian
leaves
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
drinks
like
a
6
and
not
an
8
very
enjoyable
brew
but
would
rather
attach
this
beer
to
one
season
out
of
the
year
d
all
in
all
a
good
though
not
great
wee
heavy
something
just
seems
slightly
lacking
about
it
mouthfeel
is
okay
adequate
for
the
category
but
the
taste
is
way
too
sweet
and
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
light
tan
creamish
colored

thin
head
remains
but
good
overall
cover
and
excellent

on
the

darker

plummish
smell

lighter

to
have

smells
fruitier
more
than
anything
no
hop
or
malt
present
moderate
carbonation
very
dark
sweet
taste
in

actually
very
metallic
in

and
finish
of

alcohol
and
dryness
present
in
finish
finish
nice
in
that
it
fades
raisiny
shows
through
on
the

and
finish
definitely
present
in
long
term
finish
overall
pretty
good
first
encounter
with
a
beer
that
had
that
super
metallicy
taste
present
i
think
i
kind
of
like
it
maybe
pours
a
moderate
caramel
brown
with
a
tint
of
red
little
bit
of
a
light
tan
head
nose
brings
some
toffee
caramel
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
and
some
tart
green
apple
taste
is
a
lot
of
toffee
without
too
much
complexity
hints
of
dates
and
green
apple
feel
is
light
to
medium
with
low
carbonation
very
strange
beer
and
i
dont
think
the
idea
really
carries
at
least
with
this
beer
very
drinkable
for
8
abv
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
rich
body
one
of
the
better
belgian
scottish
styled
beers
overall
pretty
good
scotch
ale
easy
to
drink
i
will
likely
try
several
other
scotch
ales
before
i
try
this
one
again
but
since
i
am
convinced
that
this
was
just
a
bad
one
there
is
more
of
that
overall
sweetness
going
on
not
over
the
top
in
the
sweetness
department
which
seems
to
be
the
common
trend
dont
really
want
more
than
one
in
a
row
id
give
it
another
chance
but
only
once
more
this
will
not
keep
me
warm
and
snug
on
a

it
is
a

ale
and
since
it
was
on

it
may
have
been
a

content
due
to
it
being
a
wee

this

up

most
of
the
scotch
ales
that
i
enjoy
namely

this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
lots
of
breadiness

some

flavor

creeps

wasnt
my
favorite
at
first
sip
but
as
i
continue
to
sip
on
it
the
butterscotch
seems
to
come
through
a
little
more
for
me
then
again
most
wee
heavy
ales
arent
my
favorite
at
first
sip
very
tasty
and
unique
enough
to
want
more
look
forward
to
stone

see
if
they
have
it
there

a
favorite
beer
that
ive
had
many
times

of
the
best
scotch
ales
around
and
not

with

alcohol
coming
through
the
taste
is
a
little
too
watery

overall
a
pretty
average
scotch
ale
but
still
enjoyable
a
decent
if
one
dimensional
and
by
that
i
mean
multidimensional
but
in
the
wrong
way
wee
heavy
ale
the
complexity
of
the
style
forgone
by
the
demands
of
the
west
coast
i
presume
if
youre
gonna
make
an
ale
not
of
that
ilk
as
i
imagine
the
design
meeting
proceeding
lets
make
it
so
true
to
its
origins
i
e
no
real
discernible
hops
that
you
couldnt
mistake
it
for
anything
else
so
there
you
have
it
good
but
a
bit
unbalanced
with
a
wellsublimated
abv
overall
the
kilt
lifter
is
great
the
second
time
around
i
brought
this
from
sickntwisted
in
sd
to
utah
to
share
with
my
good
friend
the
chicken
man
the
beer
pours
a
pretty
rich
clear
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
has
a
purty
caramelly
malt
base
the
taste
is
a
nice
evenly
balanced
beer
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
solid
scotch
ale
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
scotch
ale
fan
overall
i
was
quite
underwhelmed
flavor
was
lacking
allaround
and
it
is
just
a
boring
beer
maybe
the
nitro
hurt
it
but
i
doubt
i
will
be
picking
up
a
bottle
anytime
soon

almost

then
some

then
a

and
an

finish
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
light
overall
a
nice
ale
though
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
even
for
the
style
i
also
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
smokiness
to
it
overall
a
sweet
and
tasty
brew
with
a
great
drinkability
at
8
abv
a
nice
drinker
and
one
to
try
overall
this
may
not
compete
sidebyside
against
some
of
the
scotch
ale
heavy
hitters
but
this
holds
its
own
the
flavor
is
there
without
being
too
boozy
and
it
definitely
pairs
well
with
food
now
it
must
be
my
trek
to
get
this
brew
into
more

beers
i
have
ever

i
am
very
glad
i
came
across
it
hope
this
review
helps
you
and
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
read
my
ramble
a
bit
o
a
full
meal
deal
glad
i
tried
it
o
solid
allaround
beer
few
weaknesses
definitely
a
very
interesting
beer
and
by
the
end
part
of
my
palate
was
questioning
whether
it
was
drinking
either
a
strong
maltbased
beer
or
a
watered
down
scotch
this
is
pretty
recommended
for
nonhop
heads
and
huge
fans
of
whiskey
or
scotch
who
want
to
try
something
new
not
my
personal
favorite
but
i
personally
wouldnt
be
able
to
make
a
better
take
on
this
style
myself
im
most
definitely
intrigued
to
trying
more
beers
like
this
in
the
future
a
good
sipper
lots
of
breadiness
and
i
like
the
fruit
aspect
as
well
the
malt
was
there
but
seemed
shallow
the
fruit
and
bread
was
the
showcase
very
clean
but
the
tannins
helped
out
with
that
i
wouldnt
call
it
bold
but
a
good
drinker
for
the
price
believe
this
to
be
a
well
brewed
example
but
not
a
style
of
beer
i
personally
enjoy
often
i
like
this
style
of
beer
and
enjoyed
it
but
i
would
probably
not
get
it
again
unless
i
visited
california
did
i
mention
it
is
sweet
thats
the
style
but
its
too
sweet
for
my
taste
would
go
well
with
the
van
morrison
and
the
chieftains
cd
overall
certainly
try
this
beer
i
would
recommend
it
i
will
buy
it
and
drink
it
again
love
the
name
and
although
the
beer
isnt
necessarily
a
world
beater
it
is
a
solid
representation
of
this
style
wouldnt
make
overall
a
decent
beer
the
aromas
a
bit
offputting
but
can
be
overlooked
unfortunately
once
overlooked
theres
not
much
to
look
forward
to
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
but
id
drink
it
if
offered
note
side
of
bottle
said
live
ale
keep
refrigerated
it
was
at
room
temp
in
the
store
i
hope
my
other
bottle
isnt
bad
as
well
another
very
good
beer
from
moylans
we
like
it
myself
i
liked
it
very
much
an
interesting
drink
wouldve
liked
a
better
integrated
aroma
sweet
start
with
a
dry
and
bitter
finish
i
dont
like
this
beer
and
it
doesnt
tick
the
boxes
for
style
either
pretty
poor
really
this
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
easy
drinking
and
a
big
kick
to
boot
o
i
dug
this
beer
worth
an
occasional
purchase
and
makes
a
good
nightcap
o
a
decent
enough
scotch
ale
better
than
average
but
not
outstanding
all
the
flashiness
on
the
bottle
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
but
still
a
worth
a
try
do
this
scotch
ale
is
successful
as
a
wee
heavy
that
is
drinkable
yet
slightly
decadent
at
the
same
time
its
sensory
qualities
are
simple
but
adhered
to
well
with
sugary
malt
and
booze
joining
together
in
an
appealing
fashion
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
rangeit
could
pass
as
a
strong
maltfocused
amber
ale
to
be
enjoyed
alongside
a
meal
or
it
could
be
slowly
sipped
to
satisfactory
effect
o
a
tasty
scotch
ale
but
theres
certain
aspects
that
were
a
bit
disappointing
the
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thin
and
the
flavours
could
use
a
bit
of
a
boost
higher
abv
is
well
hidden
though
and
it
is
rather
drinkable
definitely
still
worthy
o
cant
believe
i
have
never
bought
this
before
its
excellent
for
the
price
point
a
great
sipper
boozy
burn
in
the
finish
is
not

nice
balance
true
to
style
a
great
example
of
the
style
great
tasty
sipper
overall
i
like
this
scotch
ale
but
i
dont
love
it
youll
need
to
allow
it
to
warm
to
at
least
60f
to
see
its
full
potential
laughing
lab
has
it
beat
hands
down
it
is
very
easy
on
the
wallet
which
is
important
during
a
shitrittled
economy
worth
a
try
at
least
watery
body
is
unfortunate
should
be
thicker
ive
had
this
before
about
2
years
ago
on
tap
down
in
so
cal
and
i
was
really
impressed
as
with
most
beers
in
general
they
usually
taste
better
from
tap
this
beer
had
a
good
combination
of
smoothness
and
flavor
i
would
recomend
if
you
happen
to
find
this
one
overall
impression
this
brew
was
good
but
needed
more
depth
and
more
strength
coming
in
at
8
abv
i
thought
this
would
happen
but
not
sure
i
ever
caught
what
i
wanted
to
classify
as
a
scotch
ale
wouldnt
diss
this
brew
but
many
more
offerings
from
moylan
brewery
that
are
much
better
overall
im
lovin
tryin
all
these
new
interesting
beers
so
not
a
knock
but
only
slightly
above
average
imo
22
oz
bottle
from
lifesource
s
salem
5
45
seems
like
they
dropped
the
kiltlifter
and
its
just
moylans
scotch
ale
smokey
hazelnut
broon
with
a
small
light
tan
heid
aroma
very
malty
as
expected
and
with
hints
of
creamtoast
and
a
tiny
smidgen
of
peatsmoke
taste
is
smooth
malty
goodness
some
plum
and
again
a
hint
of
peaty
smoke
creamy
underfeel
ok
on
the
palate
on
the
thin
side
but
in
this
case
it
is
helpful
an
ok
beer
again
but
not
a
great
scotch
ale
o
a
tasty
beer
to
be
sure
sweet
without
being
cloying
and
well
balanced
worth
checking
out
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
with
a
nice
crisp
drinkable
body
that
makes
this
beer
just
right
there
is
a
nice
aftertaste
that
hangs
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
then
is
gone
not
long
after
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
somewhat
forgettable
overall
a
decent
scotch
ale
i
would
have
liked
more
carbonation
and
a
little
more
caramel
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
actually
fairly
good
and
true
to
the
style
i
just
like
a
little
more
sweetness
and
carbonation
pours
a
murky
cherry
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
and
no
lacingthe
smell
is
a
touch
of
scotchsweet
caramel
malts
and
fruit
cakethe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
sweet
sticky
caramel
and
toffeefruit
cakeraisins
soaked
in
brandya
light
touch
of
scotchcandied
plums
and
finished
with
a
light
mix
of
herbal
tea
and
bittersweet
toffee
and
overall
its
a
sawh
and
although
very
sessionable
i
would
not
buy
again
cheers
overall
a
sweet
enticing
brew
with
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
that
will
most
definitely
rock
your
world
if
you
drank
too
much
oanother
good
beer
from
moylans
this
beer
despite
being
8
had
a
much
lighter
mouthfeel
that
i
would
have
thought
much
easier
drinking
that
i
would
have
thought
a
rich
rewarding
beer
one
to
savor
on
a
cold
winter
night
good
stab
at
a
scotch
style
ale
i
was
impressed
by
the
head
retention
for
a
beer
with
an
8
avb
aroma
a
taste
were
a
little
roastier
than
i
would
like
in
this
style
the
beer
is
really
tasty
however
and
drinkable
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
anytime
very
pleasant
example
of
a
scotch
ale
when
most
are
fairly
heavy
this
ones
very
drinkable
recommended
overall
this
beer
was
nothing
short
of
disappointing
thin
overly
carbonated
and
very
one
dimensional
if
your
curious
about
this
one
dont
be
overall
pretty
interesting
brew
in
general
with
a
fairly
unique
tasting
range
not
what
i
expected
its
strange
and
not
in
a
terrible
way
so
id
recommend
trying
it
just
for
that
but
its
not
something
on
the
top
of
my
list
to
have
again
and
again
kilt
lifter
is
a
perfectly
serviceable
scotch
ale
but
one
that
is
more
likely
to
impress
those
new
to
the
style
than
more
familiar
palates
it
was
probably
among
the
first
wee
heavy
beers
i
tried
some
five
plus
years
ago
and
comparing
the
scores
my
impression
of
it
then
was
certainly
much
higher
than
it
is
now
but
as
then
i
certainly
did
enjoy
it
yawn
thin
and
light
are
the
two
adjectives
that
best
describe
this
beer
in
my
book
a
good
scotch
ale
will
waft
forth
with
malt
teak
a
little
sting
and
frankly
a
nice
fistful
of
peas
this
has
nothing
very
little
aroma
beyond
yeast
very
little
taste
beyond
more
yeast
gets
slightly
richer
as
it
warms
but
also
gets
waaay
too
boozy
pass
for
a
good
american
scotch
ale
visit
founders
this
a
pretty
good
brew
its
not
as
inyourface
as
many
in
the
wee
heavy
category
the
wood
and
sweet
caramel
cover
up
a
lot
of
the
alcohol
so
youve
got
to
keep
in
mind
the
abv
goes
well
with
grilled
mushrooms
or
ham
my
conclusion
i
think
this
was
only
my
second
sampling
from
moylans
ill
need
to
try
more
before
making
any
conclusions
about
them
but
i
will
say
that
despite
their
kilt
lifter
scotch
ale
tasting
more
like
a
standard
scottish
ale
which
im
not
a
fan
of
that
had
been
intensely
amped
up
than
a
wee
heavy
i
still
enjoyed
it
the
other
criticism
of
this
beer
that
i
have
is
that
it
is
much
better
when
warm
than
cold
the
label
recommends
letting
it
warm
before
drinking
which
can
sound
like
beer
snobbery
to
some
but
in
this
case
it
should
be
taken
as
a
warning
that
the
beer
wont
taste
very
good
otherwise
while
i
agree
that
most
beer
tastes
better
at
around
50
i
consider
it
a
major
weakness
if
one
tastes
this
bad
when
cold
o
a
well
done
scotch
ale
and
it
shouldnt
be
a
problem
to
finish
the
bomber
myself
deep
orange
almost
brown
pour
with
a
sturdy
frothy
head
deep
sweet
aromas
with
slight
hints
of
hop
presence
the
hint
of
hops
on
the
nose
rushes
to
the
front
of
the
flavor
profile
a
mouth
watering
first
gulp
that
finished
sweet
with
only
a
slight
hop
finish
the
hops
really
concentrate
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
pallet
leaving
a
pretty
clean
finish
there
is
a
noticable
alcohol
presence
as
the
drinking
conintues
with
a
warming
of
the
throat
and
chest
the
body
of
the
brew
is
on
the
thin
side
not
leaving
a
lot
of
texture
still
cannot
detect
the
actual
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
through
the
nose
the
flavor
does
not
really
resonate
with
me
and
ends
up
being
relatively
bland
once
the
initial
hop
bittnerness
goes
away
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
thinish
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
on
it
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
the
smell
was
earthy
not
a
lot
of
hops
in
this
brew
or
anything
not
that
there
should
be
for
this
style
the
taste
was
smooth
and
with
some
good
malt
in
the
body
of
the
beer
the
mouthfe
was
on
the
heavier
side
but
not
thick
overall
its
pretty
good
and
totally
worth
another
round
overall
i
thought
this
was
really
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
in
the
style
from
the
bomber
to
the
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
dark
copper
with
a
creamish
head
smell
is
slight
with
toffee
notes
and
malts
taste
is
mild
with
malts
munich
and
toffeecaramel
hops
are
understated
and
sweet
a
nice
solid
scottish
ale
with
the
elevated
abv
buried
well
drink
this
expecting
the
aftertaste
of
a
nice
scotch
but
i
really
couldnt
imagine
drinking
more
than
a
couple
in
a
session
as
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
over
time
all
the
same
a
very
impressive
beer
if
peat
is
what
you
want
to
taste
overall
pretty
tasty
scotch
ale
that
sits
right
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
on
tap
at
this
bar
so
id
definitely
have
more
of
it
id
like
to
try
it
again
in
the
bottle
as
well
drinkability
you
could
drink
these
all
night
but
since
it
is
8
most
would
pass
out
about
an
hour
into
the
night
i
expected
more
spunk
from
this
brew
everything
about
it
was
good
but
not
memorable
makes
for
a
good
drinker
though
the
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
for
such
modest
flavor
theres
no
bagpipe
serenade
as
kilts
go
aflyin
but
im
fairly
content
for
a
scotch
ale
coming
in
at
8
abv
this
beer
tastes
a
bit
light
nothing
about
it
would
ever
make
me
come
back
for
more
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
little
surprisingly
given
the
style
guidelines
if
you
like
the
style
check
this
one
out
not
as
bold
as
the
label
would
have
you
believe
pours
dark
brown
with
small
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
honey
roasted
malts
toasty
dark
fruit
fig
slight
earthy
hops
perhaps
a
bit
of
smoked
malt
as
well
i
get
the
same
from
the
taste
in
addition
to
some
bread
character
and
some
caramel
definitely
malt
forward
but
i
can
detect
a
small
amount
of
hoppiness
medium
body
medium
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
was
a
tasty
scotch
ale
winter
is
about
to
set
in
here
in
michigan
and
this
warms
the
soul
at
8
would
love
to
pick
a
newer
bottle
of
this
up
and
see
the
difference
overall
a
very
tasty
scotch
ale
worthy
of
the
50000
award
seals
they
splattered
all
over
their
label
excellent
for
a
scotch
ale
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
would
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
future
this
is
a
good
brew
it
hides
the
alcohol
extremely
well
the
label
calls
this
robust
and
strapping
and
i
would
totally
agree
while
it
didnt
totally
blow
me
away
d
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
but
ive
had
better
wee
heavies
overall
well
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
id
have
to
say
i
was
pretty
disappointed
aside
from
a
few
minor
flavor
variations
its
not
much
different
then
drinking
a
cheap
40
oz
of
malt
liquor
the
buzz
is
there
but
thats
about
the
best
thing
going
for
this
one
not
a
successfully
barrel
aged
beer
in
my
opinion
d
if
you
can
enjoy
a
rich
brew
you
can
drink
this
one
i
really
like
how
big
this
beer
is
and
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
i
will
defiantly
be
buying
this
beer
again
and
getting
my
kilt
lifted
this
is
the
second
of
moylans
brew
i
have
had
and
the
first
scotch
ale
i
have
tasted
not
really
sure
how
to
rate
this
one
as
it
is
the
first
scotch
ale
i
have
had
sadly
i
didnt
care
for
it
much
at
all
it
has
a
bland
taste
which
i
was
not
at
all
impressed
with
the
smell
was
very
nice
if
moylans
could
bottle
the
smell
and
make
a
candle
out
of
it
the
candle
lovers
of
the
world
would
be
astonished
which
for
me
the
taste
fell
very
short
im
gonna
try
some
other
scotch
ales
so
i
can
give
a
better
review
but
who
knows
maybe
im
just
not
a
scotch
ale
fan
as
far
as
scotch
ales
go
i
have
definitely
had
better
though
i
wouldnt
kick
moylans
out
fo
bed
while
an
entire
night
or
tipping
back
this
alcoholic
sugar
water
at
8
abv
might
not
be
advised
the
22oz
bomber
was
just
enough
to
get
my
fill
as
a
scottish
style
ale
made
in
america
its
fine
i
could
drink
a
few
in
a
night
but
if
youre
expecting
a
scotch
ale
move
on
grab
the
duck
rabbit
which
kills
this
one
and
nails
the
style
drinkability
there
is
no
two
ways
about
it
this
is
just
a
great
value
i
ordered
this
out
to
try
something
new
without
knowing
anything
about
it
and
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
how
that
decision
worked
out
full
bodied
smooth
and
quite
drinakble
i
may
have
to
pursue
some
scottish
ales
and
scotch
ale
wee
heavys
to
really
explore
this
style
d
this
beer
has
a
thin
and
soft
flavor
that
is
missing
the
nice
rich
malt
backbone
but
the
odd
flavors
get
in
the
way
of
what
little
malt
was
there
it
wasnt
worth
finishing
the
bomber
drinkability
great
brew
just
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
drinking
but
just
shy
of
greatness
more
herbs
and
a
different
hop
profile
might
elevate
this
brew
overall
drinkability
is
average
the
flavors
are
good
by
themselves
but
its
the
integration
that
hurts
this
beer
for
me
very
different
from
previous
wee
heavys
because
it
is
much
sweeter
with
almost
no
scotch
taste
i
would
only
recommend
the
beer
to
those
who
prefer
sweeter
beers
but
overall
it
is
only
average
d
its
a
mediocre
beer
probably
would
not
refuse
a
bottle
but
definitely
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
poured
into
a
snifter
the
color
is
an
amberbrown
without
any
real
head
lacing
or
legs
not
much
going
on
here
the
nose
is
some
caramel
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
flavor
doesnt
really
bring
much
other
than
a
bit
of
malt
and
some
alcohol
booze
on
the
palate
and
in
the
finish
not
my
cup
of
tea
drinkability
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
will
not
be
revisiting
not
exactly
the
real
mckay
pronounced
mackie
but
much
more
than
a
young
pretender
it
truly
is
outstanding
i
wish
i
had
another
d
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
tried
but
hardly
great
either
average
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
the
style
not
much
carbonation
almost
syrupy
but
not
quite
makes
me
want
to
go
to
sleep
this
is
probably
a
fine
thing
to
drink
in
winter
a
medium
amber
colored
brew
with
little
head
carbonation
is
medium
sweet
earthy
aromas
flavor
is
heavy
and
sweet
and
very
muddyearthy
let
this
one
warm
a
bit
and
itll
taste
a
bit
better
i
have
brewed
with
peat
smoked
malts
before
and
wish
pro
brewers
would
put
more
smoke
into
this
style
to
balance
the
intense
sweetness
finish
on
this
one
is
a
bit
herbal
the
abv
comes
through
on
the
backside
thanks
to
glid02
for
this
one
d
considering
the
abv
this
is
a
pretty
easy
ale
to
drink
although
i
have
had
better
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
beautiful
glowing
reddishorange
amber
with
little
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
and
firm
with
a
nice
horlicks
aroma
and
a
touch
of
a
maple
syrup
tastes
firm
and
dry
but
with
that
typical
scotch
ale
syrupy
malt
flavor
a
little
spicy
and
with
some
underlying
fruit
firm
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
pretty
nice
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
great
brew
by
any
means
not
worth
hunting
down
and
not
worth
your
time
and
money
started
decent
but
ended
up
not
good
kilt
lifter
makes
for
a
decent
cold
weather
sipper
it
manages
to
sort
of
bridge
a
gap
between
a
proper
scotch
wee
heavy
and
a
scottish
ale
the
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
lending
an
above
average
drinkability
while
kilt
lifter
lacks
the
chewiness
of
a
proper
scotch
ale
its
still
a
respectable
brew
props
to
moylans
for
another
tasty
quaff
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
provides
the
thirsty
braveheart
with
a
semosweet
finish
that
slowly
fades
away
into
a
phantom
bitterness
what
stood
out
is
that
the
aforementioned
potency
increases
as
the
beer
attains
room
temperature
in
other
words
dont
drink
this
cold
as
you
will
miss
out
on
the
taste
of
it
a
real
nice
beer
that
represents
a
very
dependable
style
that
can
be
rewarding
if
done
right
thatll
do
pig
whoops
got
my
movies
confused
damn
that
kilt
lifter
pours
super
hazy
with
a
honeyamber
hue
i
have
never
seen
something
this
hazy
before
smells
strongly
of
sugary
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
dare
i
say
a
little
honey
kinda
reminds
me
of
smoky
apple
cider
as
well
the
hops
cut
through
the
first
few
sips
grain
and
malt
flavors
are
present
this
combo
also
kinda
tastes
smoky
like
a
scotch
or
whiskey
everything
thing
is
there
just
not
popping
out
at
my
pallet
scotchsmoke
flavors
cut
through
after
several
sips
making
me
think
twice
about
the
hop
comment
the
carbonation
is
a
little
distracting
but
not
by
much
i
find
it
acceptable
the
body
is
thin
medium
which
is
nice
if
it
were
any
thicker
i
probably
wouldnt
enjoy
this
once
it
warms
up
not
a
bad
batch
of
scotch
ale
ive
had
several
others
which
i
like
a
little
more
iron
springs
scotch
ale
might
be
my
favorite
but
this
is
certainly
enjoyable
for
the
time
being
d
this
beer
has
the
elements
i
look
for
in
a
strong
scottish
ale
but
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
for
me
the
malt
that
i
enjoy
gets
overpowered
by
the
strong
unpleasant
smoky
flavor
and
aroma
i
dont
need
another
one
d
at
around
68
bucks
a
bomber
its
not
the
worst
you
can
buy
but
dont
expect
a
hearty
wee
heavy
that
will
warm
your
heart
and
fill
your
tastebuds
with
flavor
just
expect
a
great
ale
with
very
nice
caramel
a
molasses
with
a
high
abv
and
very
little
if
any
scotch

pretty

if
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
a
decent
scotch
ale
though
not
as
pronounced
as
a
wee
heavy
would
be
believe
it
or
not
when
it
reached
that
golden
temp
though
it
became
one
of
the
most
ridiculously
drinkable
scotchtype
ales
ive
had
far
from
stellar
allaround
but
despite
the
surprisingly
bittersweet
malty
film
it
leaves
behind
goes
down
ridiculously
smooth
not
rich
nor
weighty
but
alright
atmosphere
is
great
really
pure
and
imperial
appearance
and
a
nose
just
loaded
with
twists
and
turns
flavor
is
really
full
and
hearty
but
almost
cloying
in
nature
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
d
while
it
was
good
this
will
not
be
one
i
reach
for
again
any
time
soon
it
seems
like
a
white
bread
interpretation
of
a
scotch
ale
and
i
prefer
them
to
be
a
little
more
traditional
d
this
is
a
tasty
scotch
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
maybe
a
little
too
smooth
enjoy
d
for
such
a
huge
malty
brew
i
find
myself
drinking
this
faster
then
i
normally
would
balance
is
decent
and
this
is
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
d
a
good
effort
this
beer
is
well
priced
and
is
easily
available
but
it
is
definitely
the
americanized
version
of
wee
heavy
youre
not
getting
belhaven
here
pours
a
dark
slightly
cloudy
amber
with
a
big
tan
head
head
is
a
bout
two
and
a
half
fingers

recedes
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
big
malty
brown
sugary
flavor
up
front
with
some
spiciness
and
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
some
hop
bitterness
lingering
but
not
much
nice
clean
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
surprised
at
how
quickly
i
finished
the
bottle
which
speaks
to
the
drinkability
of
this
one
pours
cherry
red
and
clear
with
a
very
short
lived
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
odd
cherry
cough
syrup
characteristic
present
in
the
sweet
aroma
which
also
comes
out
in
the
front
and
middle
malty
with
same
strange
cough
syrup
characteristic
sugary
middle
faint
faint
bitterness
that
pops
out
after
the
finish
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
this
is
an
unfamiliar
style
for
me
as
smooth
and
creamy
as
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
which
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
beautiful
deep
mahogany
scarlet
in
color
a
lasting
thin
head
of
offtan
cream
sweet
malts
and
brown
sugar
and
some
dark
fruitiness
medium
bodied
this
is
so
smooth
and
velvety
it
is
almost
as
if
you
are
not
even
drinking
it
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
instantly
leaves
you
wanting
to
take
another
drink
my
first
beer
from
moylans
and
im
looking
forward
to
try
hopsickle
d
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
and
style
the
lighter
mouthfeel
from
the
carbonation
makes
this
easier
to
drink
and
the
balance
makes
it
deceptively
smooth
d
easy
enough
to
drink
but
the
boring
flavor
profile
and
conspicuous
alcohol
presence
make
it
hard
to
justify
having
more
than
one
d
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
moylans
kilt
lifter
is
a
truly
world
class
scotch
ale
offering
just
a
notch
the
rest
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
to
strong
to
be
a
session
beer
but
not
quite
a
sipper
just
a
solid
alll
around
offering
and
a
wonderful
introduction
to
moylans
jd
palate
is
wellbalanced
between
sweet
caramel
malt
and
mild
fruity
hops
a
very
mild
hint
of
peat
smoke
lingers
throughout
finish
is
somewhat
boozy
nice
and
warm
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
a
touch
of
stickiness
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
a
little
thin
for
a
scotch
ale
but
still
very
nice
its
a
shame
its
not
available
in
oregon
due
to
a
turf
dispute
with
pike
brewing
o
solid
scotch
ale
great
representation
of
the
style
could
easily
enjoy
a
bomber
to
myself
will
definitely
buy
this
again
drinkability
great
mouthfeel
was
thin
a
bit
overcarbonated
i
was
underwhelned
by
this
beer
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
this
multiple
award
winner
from
moylans
is
decent
in
certain
departments
but
not
an
out
and
out
winner
in
my
book
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
bomber
size
bottle
with
average
head
that
died
quickly
there
was
an
ever
present
lace
on
the
surface
which
also
sticks
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
which
i
like
as
far
as
the
aroma
is
concerned
score
if
you
like
beer
it
would
be
painfully
hard
to
not
take
a
sip
right
away
since
it
smells
so
inviting
taste
is
decent
i
guess
i
just
am
not
a
scotch
ale
kind
of
person
the
scotch
taste
is
unmistakable
but
you
can
also
taste
the
malt
and
caramel
the
scotch
in
the
beer
made
it
not
particularly
drinkable
for
me
after
half
a
pint
i
was
about
ready
call
quits
on
it
at
8
abv
it
is
a
stronger
beer
but
the
scotch
fumes
make
it
very
suitable
for
occasions
when
you
are
relying
on
just
one
beer
or
two
to
get
you
in
a
happy
mood
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
reccommend
it
to
everyone
i
am
enjoying
this
stab
at
a
wee
heavy
but
would
be
fooling
if
i
said
id
buy
it
frequently
or
even
again
there
are
better
examples
and
i
may
soon
have
one
of
the
best
or
at
least
my
favorites
in
my
market
a
nice
beer
nothing
special
but
a
bit
onedimensional
in
the
flavor
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
was
just
a
few
flaws
away
from
being
great
very
good
flavors
and
aromas
however
i
would
like
it
to
be
just
a
bit
more
robust
in
mouthfeel
still
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
the
style
and
well
worth
a
shot
kilt
lifter
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
a
great
one
either
for
all
the
ingredients
in
here
i
expected
more
flavor
still
its
easy
to
drink
and
the
8
0
abv
is
not
all
that
noticeable
its
not
the
best
moylans
has
to
offer
but
its
still
a
decent
brew
pours
a
deep
redbrown
with
decent
amount
of
head
smells
of
caramel
toasted
nuts
scotch
and
hops
tastes
of
caramel
cherry
and
bitter
hops
drinkability
is
suprisingly
good
this
is
a
good
scotch
style
ale
that
would
pair
well
with
a
root
vegetable

crusty

d

and

not
hearty
enough
in
the
malt
department
for
my
tastes
for
this
style
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
id
buy
again
moylans
has
again
produced
a
fine
beer
albeit
one
that
requires
a
little
time
patience
and
the
leveling
factor
of
room
temperature
to
elicit
its
best
characteristics
very
good
stuff
and
another
example
of
why
after
some
time
scotch
ale
has
ascended
the
ranks
of
my
personal
favorite
styles
d
very
good
the
slight
scotch
with
the
sweet
and
slight
bitter
is
well
balanced
very
enjoyable
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
d
pretty
easy
drinker
i
was
looking
for
another
bomber
before
i
knew
it
definitely
will
pick
this
one
up
again
drinkability
decent
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
bomber
bottle
nose
is
of
dark
caramel
malts
with
maybe
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
taste
has
those
dark
caramel
malts
at
the
forefront
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
burning
character
not
unlike
scotch
itself
although
maybe
it
was
just
power
of
suggestion
sweet
overall
with
a
bit
of
a
bitterness
like
that
found
in
unsweet
tea
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
fair
i
found
the
taste
a
bit
intense
so
i
ended
up
sipping
d
another
winner
for
me
from
the
boys
at
moylans
this
is
a
great
style
of
beer
that
is
a
welcome
addition
good
representation
with
in
the
style
but
a
hop
lovers
left
wanting
more
taste
again
very
sweet
not
a
malt
bomb
or
overly
heavy
scotch
ale
even
though
it
clocks
in
at
8
lots
cf
toffeecaramel
may
be
the
cover
for
the
alcohol
true
to
style
not
much
in
hops
or
bitterness
mouthfeel
you
get
a
little
used
to
it
but
at
the
same
time
it
isnt
going
to
leave
you
clammoring
for
more
notes
very
pleasant
and
surprisingly
delicious
to
pair
with
just
about
any
food
this
brew
just
went
down
smooth
for
me
and
i
found
myself
wanting
another
this
is
a
big
bottle
of
beer
and
at
8
its
easy
to
get
carried
away
by
it
nice
brew
definitely
recommended
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
those
who
want
a
light
bodied
brew
withe
earthy
and
malty
undertones
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
malts
the
kilt
lifter
is
very
aggressive
like
most
good
scotch
ales
but
it
all
combines
to
create
an
amazing
whackadoo
ale
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
before
and
i
liked
it
much
more
then
d
for
a
beer
with
8
its
a
good
drinker
but
it
ends
up
being
much
too
sweet
for
me
in
the
long
run
a
shared

is
already
plenty
no
more

that

a
chocolate

color
with
an
average

settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
roasted

a

and
a
touch
of

the
taste
is
a

lightly
roasted

a
bit

milk
chocolate
and
nuts
the
feel
is
moderate
with
initially
a
fizzy

which

to
a
nice

feel
nice
balance
between
sweet

roasted
and
the
abv
well
hidden
the
aroma
and
taste
is
a
tad
below
what
i
expect
for
a
wee
heavy
needs
to
be
a
bit
bolder
and
more
earthy
however
the
brew
has
a
very
nice
feel
and
drinks
very
easy
better
scotch
ales
out
there
but
this
aint
too
bad
d
very
nice
but
i
expected
more
flavor
for
an
8
abv
scottish
ale
very
drinkable
nonetheless
goes
down
easy
and
none
of
the
flavors
become
overpowering
d
drinkable
but
i
think
ive
been
spoiled
on
wee
heavies
after
drinking
the
divine
reserve

wont
be
seeking
out
again
if
the
alcohol
mellows
out
a
bit
this
would
be
really
good
i
might
put
some
away
for
a
year
or
so
and
see
what
happens
though
this
is
not
a
good
beer
to
drink
fresh
imo
d
i
remember
being
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
early
in
my
craft
beer
days
its
not
as
great
as
i
remember
but
its
still
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
with
some
improvements
i
think
it
would
be
a
really
great
one

mouthfeel

drinkability

i
was
craving
a
different
style
and
this
filled
the
bill
a
nice
malt
bomb
that
represents
the
style
pretty
well
got
this
bottle
a
few
months
ago
at
sams
in
chicago
poured
with
a
medium
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
very
hazy
amber
with
brown
highlights
aroma
is
scotch
ale
and
a
little
peat
flavors
about
the
same
but
with
strong
coconut
therefore
not
one
of
my
fav
scotch
ales
no
apparent
alcohol
bodys
ok
d
although
my
tongue
has
adjusted
to
hoppy
beers
after
moving
out
west
and
sampling
the
amazing
hop
crazy
beers
out
here
this
beer
is
a
breath
of
fresh
air
for
my
palate
i
could
drink
this
for
quite
awhile
bravo
to
moylans
for
making
a

that
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
again

maltiness
on
the
fuller
side
of

flavors
came
out
a
lot
better
as
it
warmed
i
didnt
really
write
down
a
whole
lot
about
this
one
but
if
you
enjoy
a
malty
beer
give
this
one
a
try
good
take
on
the
style
opinion
i
am
a
pretty
big
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
this
particular
one
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
the
malts
are
off
balance
somehow
it
should
be
a
bit
sweeter
with
no
real
hops
or
one
particular
malt
component
being
this
noticeable
the
peat
malt
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
even
if
that
is
what
i
am
picking
up
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
peated
crystal
malt
if
there
is
such
a
thing
or
they
went
for
a
long
boil
and
just
burned
the
wort
in
the
kettle
i
dont
know
but
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
harsh
to
me
the
beer
is
not
so
bad
that
i
wont
finish
it
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
particular
beer
from
moylans
again
in
the
near
future
hopefully
it
was
just
kettleburn
and
wont
be
here
in
the
next
release
d
very
good
scotch
ale
with
a
ton
of
malt
character
and
enough
of
a
hop
presence
to
keep
the
malt
from
getting
heavyhanded
d
might
be
ok
with
some
chocolate
but
otherwise
i
would
skip
this
bottle
of
liquid
sugar
the
next
time
around
one
plus
however
is
that
due
to
the
chocolatecake
soaked
in
butterscotchcloying
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
hidden
and
at
8
that
scares
the
hell
out
of
me
the
drinkability
is
just
alright
its
a
very
alcoholpresent
beer
and
should
last
you
a
while
sipping
slowly
fortunately
the
alcohol
doesnt
dominate
the
taste
though
notes
overall
im
impressed
with
the
kilt
lifter
its
definitely
more
on
the
subtle
side
rather
than
big
and
bold
which
means
you
kind
of
have
to
dig
for
the
flavors
but
once
it
warms
up
to
room
temperature
its
a
little
more
forthcoming
ends
up
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
never
overwhelms
the
palate
because
the
balance
is
never
too
far
out
of
whack
enough
interesting
flavors
and
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
through
the
bottle
but
i
dont
know
about
a
bomber
of
this
stuff
as
is
it
was
quite
enjoyable
picked
up
a
single
at
princeton
liquors
in
maple
grove
mn
appeared
a
clear
amber
with
a
short
offwhite
head
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
for
an
unusually
cool
summer
evening
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
a
mix
of
sweet
apple
juice
with
caramel
and
toffee
candy
drinkable
for
the
style
and
slightly
warming
all
in
all
a
very
good
wee
heavy
not
too
dry
not
too
thick
and
not
too
sweet
all
my
typical
complaints
with
this
style
give
ti
a
try
d
easily
drinkable
for
a
strong
abv
very
nice
scotch
ale
very
good
beer
but
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
many
in
the
style
taste
even
started
off
slow
but
thankfully
i
started
to
realize
that
this
is
perhaps
a
more
traditional
take
on
the
style
more
subtle
than
bold
the
flavors
took
a
while
to
unfold
but
once
they
do
quite
nice
caramel
malts
and
overripe
apple
take
the
lead
the
peak
showing
up
toward
the
end
the
mouth
is
medium
doesnt
feel
light
though
decent
carbonation
in
all
based
on
the
other
molyans
ive
had
i
was
expecting
more
instead
i
got
either
a
beer
reveling
in
its
subtleties
or
an
off
beer
or
its
just
stock
decent
enough
to
drink
regardless
d
high
abv
and
overwhelming
sweetness
prevent
me
from
enjoying
more
than
one
picked
up
a
single
of
this
brew
at
hop
city
in
atlanta
ga
poured
into
my
stone
barleywine
glass
pours
a
amber
color
with
nearly
no
head
sweet
brown
sugar
and
candy
in
the
nose
taste
is
malty
bready
and
sugary
sweet
slightly
watered
down
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
scotch
ale
but
ive
had
better
overall
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
a
little
better
the
combination
of
malts
and
hops
just
didnt
click
for
me
i
wont
be
having
this
again
d
the
8
makes
this
a
tough
call
but
i
can
see
this
going
down
a
bit
easier
in
cool
weather
afteer
a
meal
wa
decent
stogie
the
lable
says
its
food
friendly
and
i
agree
this
poured
a
translucent
mahogany
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
nutty
malt
with
creamy
and
bready
yeast
and
some
light
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
light
nutty
malt
with
some
honey
and
caramel
and
bready
yeast
and
a
bit
of
lemon
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
malty
aftertaste
overall
this
was
definitely
just
a
wee
heavy
with
a
lighter
malt
flavor
than
some
other
richer
scotch
ales
but
this
had
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
flavor
that
hid
the
alcohol
quite
well
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
it
had
decent
body
too
so
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
rich
a
maltiness
as
i
prefer
for
this
style
moylans
kilt
lifter
scotch
ale
pours
a
finger
of
tan
foam
over
an
opaque
cloudy
dark
amber
brew
carbonation
is
slow
and
steady
the
head
collapses
to
a
cream
ring
pretty
quickly
the
nose
is
yeasty
fruity
funk
something
like
overripe
apple
the
flavor
is
sweetish
malts
trending
toward
tart
cidery
notes
and
a
bit
of
herbal
hop
off
the
back
though
there
is
little
perceived
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
round
finishing
a
bit
dry
and
theres
a
bit
of
an
herbal
tea
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
by
volume
is
a
decent
8
though
at
no
time
is
the
alcohol
noticeable
usually
i
like
my
scotch
ales
a
little
maltier
and
smokier
than
this
one
something
that
echos
the
scotch
it
could
be
if
it
was
distilled
this
one
though
confounding
my
expectations
a
bit
was
yet
pretty
tasty
a
nice
sipper
to
be
sure
d
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
but
i
find
it
hard
to
finish
more
than
one
i
suppose
it
might
not
deserve
a
deduction
due
to
this
but
no
beer
is
perfect
so
4
0
such
a
great
beer
as
it
warms
and
its
subtlties
shine
through
great
american
rendition
of
this
style
a
must
try
beer
from
a
great
brewery
drinkability
politely
put
its
a
fine
serviceable
scotch
ale
thats
more
wee
than
heavy
leaving
me
wanting
for
a
more
hearty
malt
backbone
for
the
time
being
ill
be
reaching
for
a
90
shelling
instead
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
even
for
an
8
abv
scotch
ale
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
this
is
what
i
envisioned
a
good
scotch
ale
would
be
big
and
robust
sweet
toasty
and
smooth
the
8
alcohol
might
keep
this
from
being
an
everyday
beer
but
i
could
certainly
make
it
a
regular
in
my
fridge
this
may
not
be
the
beer
for
you
if
you
dont
like
toasted
caramel
flavors
i
loved
it
d
a
decent
american
scotch
ale
that
i
probably
would
buy
again
because
its
so
cheap
4
39
for
this
bottle
on
sale
the
bottle
wasnt
hard
to
finish
but
i
wont
crave
this
one
any
time
soon
d
this
drinks
easily
a
little
too
easily
in
fact
if
thats
possible
it
tastes
really
nice
but
with
a
beer
of
this
style
you
want
it
to
be
a
huge
chewy
sticky
brew
not
some
mildbodied
imitation
pours
a
midcopper
color
a
bit
light
for
a
scotch
ale
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
nice
deep
scent
very
dark
and
rich
good
malt
tones
with
excellent
peat
aromas
deep
peat
flavor
with
good
tangy
malt
flavors
fairly
sweet
with
just
a
tiny
hop
hint
at
the
very
end
mingling
with
the
other
flavors
goes
down
a
bit
rough
the
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
not
my
favorite
scotch
style
ale
but
still
good
md
quite
strong
in
the
alcohol
sense
but
light
in
texture
quite
drinkable
but
not
really
my
style
d
i
wasnt
really
in
the
mood
for
an
boozy
and
sweet
combination
a
syruplike
flavor
really
takes
over
as
the
beer
warms
im
dying
for
a
bit
more
balance
in
this
beer
d
drinks
easily
at
first
but
gets
cloying
relatively
quickly
scotch
style
ales
arent
the
first
thing
you
think
of
with
california
crafts
but
this
is
a
good
take
beer
poured
into
a
douglas
scotch
ale
glass
no
head
whatsoever
gorgeous
burgundy
color
and
a
steady
methodical
flow
of
carbonation
nose
is
heavy
malt
with
some
toffee
notes
simple
but
very
appealing
taste
is
malt
heavy
with
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
the
brew
has
a
thin
appearance
and
mellow
carbonation
so
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
as
i
suspected
but
the
carbonation
surprised
me
and
provided
a
champange
effervescence
i
enjoyed
this
scotch
ale
but
have
had
some
better
ones
22oz
bottle
into
a
half
liter
victory
mug
pours
a
crisp
dark
copper
with
a
thin
diminishing
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
caramel
malts
taste
is
loads
of
malts
both
caramel
and
brown
almost
no
hop
presence
but
you
can
tell
theyre
there
doing
their
job
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
but
the
smooth
carbonation
hides
the
alcohol
well
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
scotch
ale
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
its
flavorful
and
since
this
beer
isnt
as
thick
as
most
in
the
style
its
a
good
one
to
drink
for
a
long
time
the
light
body
makes
this
pretty
drinkable
as
well
as
the
fact
that
for
a
malty
brew
this
isnt
an
overt
malt
bomb
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
a
more
pronounced
fruitiness
than
i
am
used
to
but
is
spot
on
with
the
phenolics
and
hint
of
mineral
this
is
going
to
be
much
easier
to
drink
than
i
had
though
upon
opening
the
bottle
and
that
is
a
good
thing
certainly
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
drinkable
example
very
drinkable
overall
this
could
be
an
everyday
scotch
ale
maybe
even
a
beginner
version
super
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
beer
and
has
a
great
malt
character
dont
be
thrownoff
by
its
appearance
this
scotch
ale
has
great
taste
perhaps
amazing
taste
is
a
better
description
the
malts
are
incredible
the
color
is
as
good
as
it
gets
beautiful
the
head
as
poured
from
the
bottle
is
somewhat
small
and
the
beer
is
not
thick
but
ample
i
could
drink
this
every
night
one
of
my
better
all
time
beers
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
poured
up
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
red
colour
with
a
khaki
coloured
blanket
of
foam
on
top
looks
terrific
smell
is
huge
sweet
malts
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
almost
sort
of
reminds
me
of
j
w
lees
vintage
harvest
actually
taste
of
course
is
huge
malt
as
well
with
extremely
modest
hops
that
you
kind
of
have
to
search
for
after
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
quite
heavy
even
with
the
8
abv
well
concealed
not
exactly
syrupy
but
close
a
very
well
crafted
scotch
ale
as
good
or
better
than
some
scottish
produced
weeheavies
ive
tried
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
decent
this
was
one
of
my
frist
craft
beers
i
had
ever
tried
and
my
second
keg
in
my
kegorator
i
havent
had
this
in
a
while
and
i
cant
figure
out
why
pretty
good
beer
poured
a
seethru
murky
copper
with
a
onefinger
tan
head
that
left
some
lacings
a
caramel
and
bready
malt
smell
with
some
herbal
hops
but
all
is
very
lowkey
and
basic
a
thin
smooth
and
slightly
sticky
beer
with
a
good
caramel
and
bread
malt
base
that
has
some
residual
sweetness
and
chewiness
some
minor
floral
hops
balance
the
beer
and
give
it
a
slight
herbal
dry
finish
also
some
dry
fruitiness
in
the
beer
such
as
apples
and
pears
maybe
grape
a
good
beer
but
a
little
thinweak
for
a
wee
heavy
the
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
nuts
yeast
butter
and
grain
husks
the
appearance
is
dark
amber
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
a
card
board
taste
but
not
much
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
a
fairly
good
beer
like
a
scotch
ale
lite
d
a
bit
rich
and
lacking
complexity
which
would
help
increase
the
drinkability
despite
a
couple
areas
for
improvement
the
beer
is
certainly
a
nice
example
of
this
style
and
ill
easily
finish
the
entire
bomber
with
no
assistance
tonight
im
pairing
it
with
a
manchego
cheese
and
this
seems
to
be
working
well
the
slight
nutty
tart
character
of
this
sheeps
milk
cheese
compliments
the
rich
malty
ale
and
helps
make
for
a
more
interesting
session
d
easy
but
it
doesnt
settle
the
desire
for
beer
for
an
scotch
ale
of
this
strength
the
body
seems
too
thin
and
flaccid
its
needs
more
brawn
to
prevent
the
coup
that
the
alcohol
wreaks
texturally
its
not
where
it
needs
to
be
and
while
most
of
the
other
tangible
elements
are
in
place
it
proves
a
significant
detriment
to
this
beer
drinkability
while
this
beer
has
some
nice
aspects
it
lacks
the
peat
and
full
bodied
mouthfeel
of
the
top
flight
wee
heavies
and
in
failing
to
disguise
the
alcohol
these
flaws
are
accentuated
not
bad
but
not
the
best
one
to
two
finger
head
of
thick
supertiny
bubbles
not
a
great
deal

but
no

occurs
the
aroma
is
all
malt
with
hints
of
toffee
and
caramel
upon
tasting
i
got
pure
malt
at
first
with
doughyness
and
a
sweet
character
that
remnded
me
of
fresh
maple
sap
there
was
a
nutty
profile
on
the
finish
with
a
light
mellowing
hop
finish
this
beer
is
fullbodied
and
does
not
take
no
for
an
answer
i
was
hoping
for
better
but
this
was
a
fun
experience
moylans
has
yet
to
dissappoint
me
wellbalanced
and
soft
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
through
on
a
early
spring
evening
an
ok
brew
for
what
its
worth
but
ill
stick
to
moylans
hoppy
brews
instead
of
reaching
for
any
more
of
this
weakened

to
lift

i
thought
this
was
great
overall
impression
interesting
beer
dangerously
drinkable
considering
the
abv
md
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
was
very
good
its
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
for
this
style
but
still
really
good
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
on
tap
rather
than
bottled
i
have
a
feeling
it
would
be
quite
a
bit
better

the

on

way
to
light
for
the
style
overall
there
are
so
many
better
scotch
ales
out
there
for
me
to
revisit
this
one
oh
yeah
that
nutty
character
really
comes
to
the
front
on
the
palate
its
quite
sweet
and
sticky
with
overtones
of
walnuts
hazelnuts
a
bit

stab
on

back
of
some
dark
zesty
fruit
its
just
a
little
spike
at
the
end
of
the
middle
palate
finish
is
quite
fullbodied
and
syrupy
i
quite
like
this
but
i
also
cant
really
place
it
a
very
welldefined
palate
and
full
marks
for
uniqueness
but
the
flavours
are
a
bit
too
gritty
for
me
to
slam
this
down
and
rub
my
stomach
with
glee
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
but
pleasant
not
all
that
drinkable
just
for
sheer
thick
fullbodiedness
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
bready
slightly
clingy
all
of
it
combined
makes
for
a
good
beer
but
id
have
a
hard
time
drinking
them
end
to
end
d
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
strong
beers
complexity
is
there
but
not
overbearing
at
8
0
abv
not
a
session
beer
well
it
could
be
for
me
but
thats
a
different
story
the
label
does
not
lie
this
beer
is
a
meal
clear
brown
pour
with
minimal
tan
head
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
some
nuts
lots
of
earthy
peatlike
flavor
as
if
the
beer
was
finished
in
a
scotch
barrel
the
caramel
and
nuttiness
there
throughout
compliment
it
nicely
a
really
good
beer
especially
if
you
dont
plan
on
doing
anything
afterward
overall
a
delicious
wee
heavy
and
1
that
would
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
who
doesnt
care
for
this
style
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
tan
frothy
head
the
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
smooth
and
sweet
then
you
get
a
slight
kick
of
alcohol
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
content
i
would
definitely
recommend
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
expected
from
moylans
a
bit
corny
on
the
nose
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
nothing
offensive
dark
ruby
colour
a
bit
of
expected
peat
not
harsh
but
lacking
in
overall
flavor
for
a
wee
heavy
add
a
bit
of
malt
and
this
beer
may
become
special
copper
amber
with
medium
head
that
fades
somewhat
quickly
to
a
ring
spots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
of
faint
sweetness
candied
caramel
light
fruit
and
biscuity
bread
taste
is
nice
good
sweetness
that
isnt
overdone
caramel
some
brown
sugar
light
grain
a
grape
like
flavor
and
possibly
some
apple
as
well
a
little
bready
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
lower
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
i
could
surely
have
a
couple
with
no
problem
thanks
goes
to
scoobydank
for
the
extra
in
a
recent
trade
this
is
one
beer
that
will
ahem
lift
your
kilt
plenty
of
malty
goodness
with
an
array
of
flavors
to
taste
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
moylans
brews
d
a
decent
take
on
the
style
little
hefty
as
it
will
be
but
a
decent
tasting
beer
and
something
worth
going
back
for
another
fairly
clear
medium
amber
colour
with
a
light
beige
cap
composed
of
fine
and
coarse
bubbles
some
lacing
malty
and
fruity
aroma
a
bit
vinous
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
some
caramel
and
toffee
too
mild
bitterness
with
more
malt
in
the
flavour
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
fruit
was
more
muted
than
in
the
aroma
but
was
still
quite
noticeable
with
some
pear
and
grape
character
mild
alcohol
flavour
and
warmth
in
the
finish
maybe
a
bit
more
than
medium
bodied
sort
of
light
for
a
scotch
ale
smooth
though
with
fine
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
though
it
seems
to
miss
the
mark
for
the
style
somewhat
drinkability
is
fairly
good
for
me
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
poured
into
a
tulip
dark
bronzebrown
color
with
decent
head
that
fell
quickly
but
left
some
ok
lacing
sweet
malty
aroma
some
chocolate
notes
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
some
caramel
taste
of
burnt
caramel
some
bakers
chocolate
tootsie
rolls
slightly
roasty
and
a
light
bitterness
starts
out
sweet
and
finished
bone
dry
powdery
yeasty
mouthfeel
with
some
average
carbonation
alcohol
is
pretty
wellhidden
at
8
a
nice
scotch
ale
but
have
had
much
better
from
this
side
of
the
atlantic
its
no
founders
d
decent
drinkability
boozy
dry
though
should
be
experienced
in
a
slow
and
respectable
fashion
progressively
gets
more
easier
and
enjoyable
as
the
drink
progress
nice
very
pleasant
and
sweet
but
very
thick
chewy
and
heavy
too
much
for
more
than
one
but
hearty
in
small
doses
about
two
weeks
before
i
started
writing
reviews
i
had
a
kilt
lifter
for
the
second
time
couldnt
stop
talking
about
it
for
at
least
a
week
just
blew
me
away
when
i
decided
to
start
writing
reviews
this
was
one
of
the
first
i
got
after
every
sip
i
couldnt
wait
for
the
next
try
to
take
your
time
as
you
should
with
beers
like
this
but
its
tough
i
wouldnt
say
the
flavors
are
complex
but
very
distinct
think
of
a
caramel
apple
and
youll
taste
one
in
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
a
sweet
beer
at
all
light
on
the
hops
and
definitely
not
bitter
oddly
enough
by
the
end
as
the
last
few
drops
had
warmed
up
it
maintained
that
original
flavor
i
love
this
beer
maybe
you
will
too
this
scotch
ale
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
whipped
creamlike
head
of
pale
tan
that
is
persistent
sheets
of
lacing
stick
to
the
inner
rim
of
the
glassware
as
the
head
of
foam
slowly
subsides
the
nose
betrays
what
makes
this
beer
interesting
there
is
a
subtle
earthiness
that
leaves
a
slight
twang
in
the
nose
not
unlike
a
singlemalt
scotch
whiskey
dancing
around
the
base
of
roasted
caramel
malt
and
delicate
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
the
distinct
aroma
of
peat
is
revealed
the
palate
is
likewise
interesting
yet
somewhat
lighter
and
thinner
than
id
hoped
for
a
decent
backbone
of
roasted
malts
intermingle
with
the
earthy
peat
notes
youd
expect
from
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
there
is
a
faint
astringency
present
here
as
well
lending
to
the
dry
character
of
this
beer
dryer
than
what
ive
come
to
expect
for
the
style
as
well
only
light
bitterness
and
virtually
no
detectable
alcohol
despite
the
8
abv
in
flavor
this
beer
has
more
in
common
with
a
scottish
ale
than
it
does
with
a
scotch
ale
to
my
taste
my
biggest
knock
on
this
beer
is
its
relatively
thin
mouth
feel
and
slight
overcarbonation
these
dont
combine
to
make
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
they
do
make
this
particular
beer
deviate
from
the
style
parameters
somewhat
id
suggest
letting
this
one
warm
to
cellarambient
temperature
before
drinking
as
this
seems
to
help
round
the
beer
out
just
a
bit
over
all
an
enjoyable
scotch
light
ale
if
youre
not
accustomed
to
tasting
peat
in
a
beer
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
since
the
peat
character
is
kept
subdued
worth
a
try
for
sure
d
not
bad
just
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
d
this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
i
want
to
try
mre
beers
from
moylans
dont
know
that
it
really
reaches
wee
heavy
status
despite
the
alcohol
level
but
comes
close
enough
a
nice
maltaccented
brew
though
yeah
i
dont
know
if
this
was
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
what
a
disappointment
the
smell
of
cabbage
and
celery
just
dominated
the
aroma
from
the
moment
i
opened
it
had
to
end
up
dumping
the
remainder
down
the
drain
decent
carbonation
but
a
bomber
at
8
makes
this
a
decent
night
cap
on
tap
at
fatheads
in
pittsburgh
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
head
smells
and
tastes
of
scotch
whiskey
smoked
wood
and
some
sort
of
licorice
taste
this
is
a
style
that
ive
always
found
kind
of
strange
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
with
a
lot
of
different
dark
flavors
a
lot
of
alcohol
and
not
really
sessionable
this
is
the
second
review
of
a
scottish
style
ale
tonight
i
had
a
smaller
12
oz
bottle
last
week
and
enjoyed
it
so
much
that
i
decided
to
go
back
and
spring
for
the
larger
22
oz
bottle
i
poured
it
into
my
crystal
tasting
snifter
and
prepared
to
enjoy
the
heard
was
rich
creamy
and
opaque
it
quickly
dissolved
but
a
fine
ring
of
bubbles
remained
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
heavenly
a
sweet
mix
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
color
of
the
beer
was
a
deep
amberruby
there
was
also
a
good
bit
of
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
taste
was
very
smooth
rich
and
complex
you
can
definitely
taste
the
roasted
malts
with
a
moderate
amount
of
hopes
in
the
background
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
but
not
overly
boozy
with
a
good
body
it
is
definitely
the
best
scottish
ale
ive
tasted
as
of
yet
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
a
top
notch
scottish
ale
a
good
effort
and
a
nice
beer
on
a
cool
night
warming
and
hearty
ale
nicely
flavorful
beer
warms
up
nicely
just
a
solid
drinking
beer
that
pairs
well
with
my
whisky
of
choice
id
get
this
again
good
effort
appearance
is
hazy
copper
brown
with
red
hues
and
a
creamy
tan
head
good
lacing
full
malty
nose
thats
earthy
musty
grassy
and
a
hint
of
peated
smoke
flavor
has
tons
of
fruity
and
grassy
malts
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
toffee
kind
of
like
a
heath
bar
medium
mouthfeel
way
too
thin
for
a
wee
heavy
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
would
characterize
this
as
a
scotch
ale
rather
than
wee
heavy
drinkability
is
decent
at
8
but
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
scarlet
red
hue
slight
haze
thin
beige
head
moderate
amounts
of
lace
nice
malty
nose
has
that
peaty
aroma
with
earthy
and
dank
malt
tones
flavor
is
actually
kind
of
weak
for
the
style
light
bready
malt
tones
some
yeast
sludge
flavors
slight
hints
of
the
8
octane
level
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lifeless
not
much
co2
or
body
to
it
this
is
a
disappointment
from
this
brewery
compared
to
the
other
scotch
ales
out
there
this
one
feels
bigger
but
not
necessarily
better
the
body
is
closer
to
full
than
moderate
a
light
carbonation
helps
the
malt
out
this
one
is
a
little
rough
more
me
to
rate
there
are
a
lot
of
good
things
but
some
things
are
missing
mainly
the
kettlemaltiness
but
still
enjoyable
to
drink
d
i
know
what
ill
be
picking
up
next
time
im
looking
for
a
wee
heavy
this
is
really
nice
and
highly
recommended
hope
the
beer
i
have
in
fermenter
is
half
as
good
lighter
color
than
most
scotch
ales
unless
i
am
confusing
scotch
with
scottish
this
was
not
brown
but
dark
orange
it
smelled
like
a
strong
ale
and
almost
reminded
me
of
a
barleywine
taste
was
ok
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
revisit
this
again
there
was
just
something
thin
about
it
nicely
drinkable
despite
the
abv
this
one
is
a
smooth
drinking
and
pleasant
scotch
ale
im
enjoying
the
lingering
bready
aftertaste
well
after
ive
finished
it
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
lots
of
better
examples
out
there
one
is
enough
and
not
one
ill
seek
out
again
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
from
moylans
also
cool
to
see
a
beer
like
this
available
in
six
packs
now
name
is
pretty
funny
as
well
might
drink
again
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
this
type
of
thing
worth
trying
way
to
go
again
moylans
damn
glad
this
is
now
available
in
il
next
to
stl
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
would
drink
regularly
or
by
itself
i
am
not
sure
how
to
get
more
of
this
because
i
dont
rememeber
where
i
got
it
colorado
if
i
could
find
more
i
would
love
to
cellar
a
few
away
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
brew
to
seek
out
but
worth
a
try
if
this
is
your
style
prosit
mk
i
am
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
and
this
does
not
let
you
down
tough
to
finish
this
bomber
i
do
admit
though
this
beer
is
probably
far
different
fresh
and
i
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
try
it
again
would
not
recomend
to
anyone
who
loves
scotch
ale
d
easy
to
drink
a
higher
abv
at
8
keeps
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
poured
a
hazy
reddish
copper
then
became
clear
with
hardly
any
foam
the
smell
was
of
a
sweet
fruity
nature
with
a
hint
of
malts
the
taste
was
sweet
creamy
malt
with
fruit
and
had
a
sort
of
a
nutty
flavor
its
an
average
scottish
ale
pikes
kiltlifter
is
great
d
for
8
this
bomber
went
down
quickly
almost
too
quickly
a
decent
scotch
ale
style
beer
the
first
sip
is
decent
sweetly
malty
woody
and
a
bit
musky
but
definitely
onedimensionally
sweet
and
thick
it
also
dramatically
worsens
after
the
first
sip
and
a
definite
faintly
vinegary
alcohol
note
soon
takes
over
along
with
meat
and
gravy
the
alcoholic
harshness
soon
dominates
especially
with
any
food
its
onedimensional
overly
alcoholic
and
very
rough
being
mostly
sweet
alcoholic
thick
and
vinegary
first
scotch
ale
should
be
interesting
poured
a
nice
ruby
copper
tea
color
white
head
dissipates
quickly
to
almost
nothing
smell
carmel
malts
butterscotch
black
lickerish
interesting
taste
like
most
beers
for
is
similar
to
the
smell
malts
are
more
pronounced
overall
not
bad
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
on
the
thick
side
but
this
brew
was
very
drinkable
for
me
the
downside
to
the
brew
was
the
texture
a
little
to
watery
in
my
opinion
but
not
enough
to
ruined
the
enjoyment
of
the
taste
and
smell
drinkability
ayyye
noh
bad
for
a
california
interpretation
of
ab
auld
sod
style
ive
had
a
few
better
scotchstyle
ales
from
america
as
well
as
the
source
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
id
drink
it
again
preferably
with
some
neeps
and
tatties
pours
a
dark
copper
color
and
small
head
carbonation
is
low
i
dont
get
much
hop
or
malt
aroma
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
rich
hop
profile
is
low
really
get
them
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
a
little
on
the
wee
heavy
siderich
and
thick
drinkability
is
high
for
a
8
found
this
beer
at
my
local
beer
store
that
was
offering
it
at
a
tasting
after
a
small
sample
i
was
hooked
bought
every
bottle
they
had
it
is
smooth
buttery
not
too
hoppy
and
just
enough
abv
to
make
the
evening
that
much
nicer
the
22
oz
bottle
makes
its
a
definite
double
thought
before
drinking
but
once
you
pop
the
top
it
is
so
simple
to
finish
d
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
if
it
were
offered
and
i
surely
wouldnt
reccommend
it
a
deep
thick
or
slightly
viscous
amber
cognac
color
makes
me
think
of
the
crust
of
jewel
brnd
white
bread
looks
toasty
no
bubbles
really
and
no
head
the
first
sniff
is
a
little
creamy
warm
toast
with
hints
ofmaple
toasty
malts
the
front
of
the
tongue
is
a
roasted
but
mostly
toasted
malt
the
smoked
bready
malts
become
more
apparent
in
the
middle
along
with
the
slighly
oily
palate
the
finish
tastes
a
little
burnt
with
biscuits
cream
and
caramel
the
palate
is
a
sweet
intense
mla
bomb
with
a
very
well
integrated
alcoholic
warmth
dnot
so
sure
about
this
i
am
enjoying
this
but
once
again
it
kind
of
is
a
mystery
the
label
says
specifically
to
store
in
the
fridge
i
bought
it
room
temo
and
kept
it
in
the
closet
room
temp
maybe
i
let
it
go
bad
but
i
did
the
same
with
their
other
beers
recieved
through
a
bif
who
knows
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
again
but
wouldnt
be
upset
to
be
served
it
reddish
brown
with
an

that
didnt
hold
too
well
or
leave

much

was
georgeous
hazelnut
chocolate
cream
sasparilla
sassafrass
tasted
like
nutty
root
beer
with
a
faint
boozy
finish
very
interesting
and
good
interpretation
of
the
style
mouthfeel
could
have
been
a

creamier
and
finish
could
have
been
a
little
longer
dark
slightly
murky
brown
reddish
color
with
a
thin
and
creamy

head
the
aroma
is
what
rocked
my
world
it
was
constantly
changing
from
filberts
to
brazil
nuts
to
chocolate
milk
and
then
finally
settling
on
toffee
and
chocolate
flavor
is
big
up
on
the
nutty

of

very
mildly
hoppy
finish
eric
my
first
scotch
ale
and
this
ones
a
winner
nothing
to
dislike
about
this
brew
i
could
imagine
this
one
going
down
quite
well
with
a
nicely
grilled
and
seared
steak
dinner
perhaps
next
time
and
there
will
definitely
be
a
next
time
an
ok
beer
but
not
anything
to
revisit
i
wouldnt
mind
another
just
not
real
soon
i
found
that
this
beer
single
handedly
reaffirmed
my
love
affair
with
scotch
ales
the
color
is
nice
a
deep
brown
with
some
orange
hues
to
it
the
hops
really
come
through
in
the
smell
layered
on
top
of
the
roastedcaramelized
barely
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
hoppy
bitter
beer
which
i
absolutely
love
the
caramel
and
biscuit
notes
really
help
to
balance
the
flavors
with
the
high
abv
and
hoppiness
fantastic
cheers
drinks
very
easy
a
bit
dry
otherwise
a
nice
wee
heavy
pours
a
slightly
fogged
deep
amberbrown
nose
is
strong
malts
with
a
sweeter
earthy
edge
to
it
a
lot
of
it
smells
like
grape
soda
flavor
is
sweet
yes
has
a
nice
earthy
edge
to
it
but
it
lacks
a
real
complexity
that
would
make
it
interesting
feel
has
a
low
carbonation
to
it
and
a
slick
liquid
overall
this
is
a
good
wee
heavy
but
not
great
by
any
means
it
doesnt
totally
suck
but
it
wont
blow
you
away
either
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
needs
to
have
its
recipe
reformulated
theres
a
flaw
in
every
facet
of
this
beer
and
it
seems
only
tolerable
when
ice
cold
compare
this
with
alesmiths
wee
heavy
and
you
can
tell
its
very
obviously
deficient
not
one
of
moylans
better
beers
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
ale
but
not
a
great
one
because
i
think
it
is
a
bit
subdued
flavorwise
for
a
wee
heavy
also
high
abv
limits
sessionability
d
not
my
cup
of
beer
maybe
the
style
but
i
think
it
just
comes
up
short
drinkability
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
the
noticable
alcohol
would
stop
me
after
the
second
glass
otherwise
due
to
the
taste
and
the
body
i
would
be
able
to
fly
through
a
bomber
of
this
and
start
working
on
another
d
this
style
is
extremely
hit
or
miss
with
me
and
in
scotland
i
think
i
have
a
low
batting
average
if
anything
is
too
pronounced
the
brew
is
offensive
this
one
pulled
it
off
moylans
pleases
me
again
it
is
an
easy
wee
heavy
to
drink
and
it
is
pleasant
the
brewery
is
close
i
will
definitely
have
to
check
it
out
sometime
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
brew
very
smooth
and
sweet
a
little
light
on
the
mouthfeel
and
the
smokey
flavor
i
expect
in
a
scotch
ale
strong
fruit
character
be
sure
to
let
this
one
warm
a
bit
as
that
is
when
the
flavor
really
comes
out
mouthfeeldrinkability
rich
and
decadent
the
frothy
texture
in
the
mouth
accentuates
all
of
the
flavors
well
it
goes
down
just
a
bit
harshly
in
the
throat
otherwise
its
easy
overall
its
on
par
for
the
style
though
it
lacks
the
lingering
sweet
malty
finish
ive
come
to
love
about
a
scotch
ale
d
awesome
scotch
great
on
cask
warms
well
cheers
usually
have
this
during
the
colder
months
but
couldnt
resist
buying
this
today
as
a
change
of
pace
from
the
summer
aleslagers
i
have
been
consuming
lately
truly
a
treat
this
is
a
one
and
out
experience
for
me
i
think
its
well
made
but
not
something
i
want
a
lot
of
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
good
carbonation
dry
raisin
flavored
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
malty
brew
is
good
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
grab
one
myself
since
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
overall
im
more
interested
in
trying
some
other
variations
on
this
style
im
not
totally
sure
i
like
it
but
it
is
still
a
quality
beer
d
well
balanced
scotch
ale
nice
caramel
malt
feel
with
subtle
roastiness
and
short
finish
easy
to
drink
alcohol
feel
quite
subtle
despite
8
abv
this
is
a
solid
entry
in
the
scotch
ale
genre
but
not
quite
toptier
d
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
and
after
drinking
kilt
lifter
i
am
still
not
the
biggest
absence
was
the
subtle
caramel
malt
flavor
kilt
lifter
was
just
really
sweet
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
drinkable
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
among
an
otherwise
spectacular
lineup
moylans
and
marin
brewing
are
great
for
remembering
that
malt
is
an
important
component
of
beer
love
that
house
style
that
leads
with
malt
even
in
the
superhopped
examples
but
this
scotch
ale
doesnt
rise
above
the
pack
very
good
beer
nice
head
and
retention
great
malty
smell
with
some
alcohol
flavor
is
good
very
malty
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
alcohol
is
kept
in
balance
malts
cling
fairly
well
a
little
dry
aftertaste
however
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
nice
and
sessionable
kilt
lifter
scotch
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
and
a
bit
fruity
malt
dominates
the
flavor
and
is
well
balanced
with
hops
perhaps
a
bit
too
well
balanced
for
the
style
this
seems
like
a
very
american
read
hoppy
version
of
a
scotch
ale
that
being
said
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
this
reddishamber
ale
pours
a
think
tan
head
that
thins
to
bit
of
a
crown
the
smell
is
a
bit
nut
like
with
too
heavy
a
vegetable
scent
the
taste
didnt
catch
me
much
just
maltiness
and
a
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
but
a
bit
thin
not
very
drinkable
for
my
tastes
this
didnt
lift
my
kilt
nor
did
it
fit
the
bill
not
terrible
but
terribly
average
in
the
most
important
departments
goes
fantastic
with
bacon
wrapped
scallops
enjoy
notes
a
decent
scotch
ale
certainly
not
the
best
around
but
solid
i
have
enjoyed
the
moylans
bews
i
have
had
and
this
was
no
different
but
not
earth
shatteringpoured

chill

a
thinner

spotty

with

brown
sugar
almost
like
a
xmas
fruit
cakenot
as
full
bodied
as
most
wee
heavy
styles
i
have
come
across
but
it
adds
to
its
drinkability
flavors
are
on
the
sweeter
side
with
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
dipped
dark
fruit
up
front
as
it
warms
a
little
a
light
leafy
hop
presence
is
noticed
but
it
is
there
only
in
token
form
and
honestly
for
the
style
thats
all
it
should
be
a
quaffing
big
scottish
style
ale
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
acquired
from
goodbyeohio
in
these
go
to
eleven
a
bif
d
it
is
good
interesting
new
flavors
and
quite
a
bit
different
from
the
other
one
i
tried
alesmith
wee
heavy
im
sure
that
this
isnt
as
of
good
of
an
example
of
the
style
but
i
prefer
it
all
in
all
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
scotch
ale
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
but
certainly
was
not
an
issue
as
i
consumed
the
bomber
easily
this
beer
drinks
very
well
but
the
8
will
knock
you
out
for
sure
respect
this
beer
and
enjot
it
slowly
a
fun
offering
maybe
a
secondary
intro
to
someone
recntly
intoduced
to
the
craft
beer
world
this
beer
reminds
me
of
how
a
beer
would
taste
with
a
small
dollop
of
malt
syrup
or
honey
in
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
really
work
for
me
maybe
this
would
have
been
a
better
beer
if
the
brewers
didnt
have
their
hearts
set
on
8
or
were
willing
to
use
more
fermentable
materials
to
get
there
tasty
beverage
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
that
is
worth
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it

purchase

upfront
followed
by
deeply
toasted

and
a
very
mellow

aged
flavor
drying
aftertaste
very
light
on
hop
bitterness
but
the
mild
oak
taste
helps
bring
a
very
good
balance
to
the
overall
flavor
alcohol
is
very
well
concealed
especially
considering
its
thin
body
and
low
carbonation
finishes
semidry
with
lots
of
residual
caramel
and
woody
flavor
but
no
detectable
booze
the
lighter
mouthfeel
allows
an
excellent
drinkability
on
the
other
hand
the
flavor
is
fairly
weak
for
a
weeheavy
decent
scotch
ale
with
a
well
balanced
smooth
flavor
palate
was
disappointing
ill
have
to
review
another
bottle
to
see
if
mine
was
simply

smooth

a
scotch
has
to
do
some
tricks

stand
out
and
this
was
is
a
basic
brew
id
seek
other
scotch
styles
overall
not
bad
but
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
more
some
strong
tasty
scotch
ale
from
beautiful

tried
above
average
drinkability
just
doesnt
hit
the
mark
as
well
as
i
expected
worth
you
trying
to
decide
for
yourself
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
roasted
and
bisquit
malts
its
is
sweet
and
toastey
with
a
breadlike
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
wonderful
toasted
malt
flavor
that
is
breadlike
and
warm
in
the
finish
its
not
as
malty
as
expected
but
quite
complex
and
full
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
i
prefer
scotch
ales
with
a
peated
edge
but
this
has
a
mellow
bisquity
flavor
thats
easy
to
drink
my
cousin
brought
this
bottle
back
to
pa
from
ca
and
we
shared
it
at
a
wedding
over
the
weekend
the
beer
poured
a
brown
color
with
some
redish
tones
and
a
slight
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
malty
sweet
a
bit
toasted
the
taste
is
equally
malty
and
sweet
but
enjoyable
the

is
a
bit
heavy
but
very
drinkable
bomber
bottle
without
freshness

pours

any

minor
malty

smooth
malty

decent
sessioner
if
this
style
is
your
thing
for
me
this
style
is
dull
and
this
version
lives
up
to
my
preconcieved
notions
fairly
dull
well
crafted
and
malty
smooth
but
dull
the
best
thing
i
can
say
for
scotch
ale
is
that
it
works
well
as
a
cooking
or
marinating
liquid
this
scotch
ale
drinks
quite
nicely
and
matchs
the
style
well
a
beer
that
i
will
return
to
again
moylans
kilt
lifter
is
very
drinkable
but
i
imagine
that
the
8
00
abv
would
catch
up
with
you
after
a
while
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ive
got
to
try
some
more
wee
heavys
to
see
how
they
are
off
to
scottland
the
odd
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
tasted
like
wet
wood
and
i
liked
it
lots
of
sticky
candy
flavors
tootoffee
and
brown
sugar
cookies
medium

that
was

cloying

8
abv
i
dont
think
so
plus
very
sweet
nice
beer
to
finish
the
night
off
with
it
may
be
difficult
finishing
the
bomber
but
not
because
i
dont
like
it
just
because
ive
reached
that
point
of
total
satisfaction
and
contentment
amazingly
at
8
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
at
all
at
least
not
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
dark
mahogany

by
a

pretty

the

youre

midway
through
the
drink
finish
has
a
little
fig

this
may
be
the
best
american
version
of
a

ive
had
so
far
da
good
stuff
if
you
cant
get
ahold
of
any
belhaven
all
in
all
this
moylans
offering
was
quite
drinkable
a
pleasant
brew
thats
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
good
brew
im
happy
i
was
able
to
enjoyed
this
staple
of
the
west
coast
and
i
would
buy
it
again
drinkablity
this
is
a
sipper
that
said
ive
brown
bagged
this
one
in
the
park
it
works
for
that
too
just
one
of
those
beers
you
say
ah
kilt
lifter
and
throw
it
in
the
basket
and
just
kick
back
and
enjoy
it
no
worries
a
beer
that
will
be
bought
time
and
time
again
that
and
its
the
scotch
ale
i
can
find
with
any
regularity
drinkabilitynotes
a
wonderfully
pleasant
example
quite
excellent
and
worthy
of
the
effort
to
obtain
it
overall
impression
massively
drinkable
even
for
a
style
i
dont
particularly
care
for
this
is
a
solid
brew
ive
nothing
but
respect
for
the
brew
masters
they
earned
those
metals
this
is
a
big
bold
american
style
scotch
ale
how
does
one
score
a
wee
heavy
thats
tasty
but
falls
outside
the
lower
bounds
of
the
style
oh
the
hell
with
it
this
is
good
beer
and
ill
treat
it
as
such
kilt
lifter
doesnt
lift
my
kilt
but
it
is
improving
as
i
get
deeper
into
the
bomber
perhaps
ill
change
into
clean
underwear
just
in
case
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
from
moylans
it
pours
a
pretty
thick
dark
copper
colour
with
a
thin
head
thick
and
syrupy
appearance
lots
of
caramel
and
sugar
in
the
nose
also
fruity
and
toasty
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
taste
was
a
medley
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
some
fruity
flavours
and
an
earthy
touch
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
wouldve
liked
some
smokiness
to
it
overall
pretty
good
quite
a
nice
beer
so
far
i
am
impressed
with
moylans
offerings
this
is
a
malty
beer
that
has
a
stout
chocolatecoffee
type
finish
very
sweet
malt
taste
appearance
for
an
ale
of
this
type
left
something
to
be
desired
i
gave
it
an
average
ranking
but
it
was
leaning
towards
below
average
hardly
any
lacing
of
the
glass
and
the
head
was
almost
non
existent
drinkability
was
good
one
of
those
beers
where
i
could
sit
down
and
have
a
few
and
the
last
one
is
as
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
as
the
first
very
smooth
beer
with
slick
mouthfeel
deep
reddish
mahogany

throughout
the
middle
taking
on
some
buttery
hints
and
a
noticeable
but
hushed
zip
of
hops
in
the
background
have
they
changed
the
recipe
to
include
more
hops
this
is
better
than
i
remember
middling
carbonation
heavy
mouthfeel
that
feels
good
to
me
drinkability
may
need
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
still
cant
get
a
hold
of
describing
the
flavor
even
though
its
still
in
my
damn
mouth
from
last
night
this
one
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mild
but
there
is
some
peat
and
caramel
malt
in
there
the
flavor
is
not
as
strong
as
expected
but
it
has
some
peat
and
some
sweet
malt
flavors
in
there
the
body
seems
a
bit
thin
but
its
still
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
the
name
implies
going
weewee
a
lot
from
drinking
so
much
of
it
right
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
it
pours
a
dark
murkey
brown
color
with
a
big
bubbly
head
that
falls
to
a
finger
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
caramel
i
dont
get
much
more
than
that
the
flavor
is
actually
slightly
smokey
caramel
with
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
in
there
as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
id
like
a
little
more
body
and
even
a
little
more
smokeyness
this
brew
came
in
a
10
oz
goblet
which
i
didnt
expect
and
hence
pissed
me
off
i
think
the
barman
should
have
told
me
similar
strength
brews
like
bear
republics
hop
rod
rye
come
in
a
full
pint
at
their
pub
anyways
it
was
a
deep
copper
with
good
cask
clarity
head
retention
was
not
good
and
lacing
was
sparse
nice
malty
aroma
that
had
a
smokey

profile
with
same
subtly
smokey
notes
some
roasted
tones
and
dark
fruit
smooth
as
silk
a
bit

on
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
potent
to
have
another

least
on
an
empty
stomach
bottle
yipes
super
sweet
and
sticky

a

dimentionally
sweet
perhaps
scotch

arent
my
favourite
style

i
didnt
like
this
one
in
particular

i
preffered

a

but
not
up
to
what
i
expected
my
least
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
give
it
a
try
if
you
want
but
grab
their

disappeared
very
quickly
caramel

immediately
giving
way
to
some
slight
piney
hop
flavor
not
much
bitterness
at
all
very
malt
heavy
a
bit
thin
low
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
pleasant
not
the
best
scotch
ale
but
a
respectable
one
22oz
bomber
pours
a
hazy
glowing
ruby
with
a
thin
wisp
of
dark
lace
clinging
to
the
edges
aroma
is
robust
and
malty
hinting
at
dark
fruits
and
pineapple
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
in
the
nose
less
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
coating
while
leaving
a
spritz
on
the
tongue
not
as
complex
in
the
flavor
as
i
had
anticipated
but
tasty
nonetheless
despite
the
alcohol
being
not
as
present
on
the
palate
it
warms
the
body
up
nicely
flavor
borders
on
the
sweet
though
is
contrasted
with
spicy
notes
both
clovelike
and
hoppy
not
one
that
lifts
meh
kilt
but
worth
a
stop
definitely
a
good
session

you
will

just
not

scotch
ale
just
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
right
maltiness
and
balance
for
the
style
still
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
just
wouldnt
have
this
one
again
from
a

off
a
slightly
sweet
maltiness
with
soft

a

the

has
lightly
caramelized

in
the

with
a
pleasant
peatlike
smokiness
and
some
fermented

following
just
behind
nice

tang
in
this
one
medium
to
full
bodied
and
full
of
soft
and
sweet
flavors
surely
enjoyable
4s
across
the
board
im
not
sure
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
good
on
its
own
no
matter
what
the
label
says
a
drinkable
brew
this
is
mild
in
flavor
for
a
scotch
ale
but
worth
while
a
pretty
good
scottish
style
ale
though
not
the
best
around
definitely
worth
a
try
by
fans
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
very
thick
beige
head
that
eventually
dissipates
to
nothingness
decent
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
smokey
character
along
with
malt
and
caramel
rich
bodied
and
on
the
carbonated
side
at
first
with
a
strong
malt
presence
there
are
also
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
along
with
a
hint
of
nuts
that
shine
through
as
it
warms
the
finish
is
clean
and
malty
throughout
this
is
a
fairly
good
scotch
ale
that
seems
unbalanced
at
first
but
only
if
it
is
still
too
cold
22
ounce
bottle
this
was
a
decent
scotch
ale
from
the
folks
at
moylans
this
brew
was
a
real
gusher
practically
exploding
all
over
the
place
after
i
popped
the
crown
off
after
i
got
the
head
under
control
this
brew
was
a
dark
garnet
colour
with
a
huge
white
head
after
the
head
died
a
bit
i
started
to
drink
this
concoction
the
aromas
were
very
sweet
malty
and
alcoholic
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aromas
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
bit
watery
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
nice
drinkability

this
went
down
well
and
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
coppered
amber
color
creamy
offwhite
head
with
nice

aroma
features
an
upfront
fruity
maltiness
that
exhibits
notes
of
candied
apples
caramel
and
toffee
toasted
malt
more
candied
apples
the
previously
noted
characters
of
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
appear
on
the
palate
nice
sweet
weeheavy
with
a
clear
emphasis
on
the
sweet
candied
applelike
malt
only
the
faintest
hint
of
hops
hit
the
palate
on
the
finish
very
smooth
and
clean
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
tongue
fullbodied
and
sweet
masking
its
strong
alcohol
content
very
well
a
nice
warming
strong
scotch
ale
that
drinks
quite
nicely
recommended
this
beer
finally
made
it
to
ohio
it
poured
a
dark
amber
color
and
formed
a
small
off
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
toastbiscut
a
flavor
of
malt
and
caramel
with
a
slight
presence
of
alcohol
the
finish
was
medium
in
texture
and
had
a
burnt
astrigent
feel
to
it
not
the
best
that
this
brewer
offers
but
not
a
bad
ale
ah
sometimes
you
find
surprises
in
the
most
unexpected
places
i
hadnt
heard
of
this
brewery
before
but
saw
this
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
california
and
picked
up
typical
scottish
ales
dont
impress
me
much
but
this
was
a
strong
one
and
it
pulled
off
its
strength
very
well
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
huge
billowing
light
tan
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
combined
with
surprisingly
an
almost
bananalike
fruitiness
flavor
starts
of
with
big
toasty
malt
an
applelike
fruitiness
becomes
apparent
midpalate
with
still
more
traces
of
that
surprising
banana
though
only
after
ones
mouth
has
had
time
to
become
accustomed
to
the
peaty
malt
alcohol
lends
a
robust
spiciness
to
the
finish

a
bit
too
present
at
first
though
once
its
worked
its
magic
on
you
funny
you
dont
seem
to
care
much
anymore
significant
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
to
the
finish
with
a
long
lasting
nutty
aftertaste
yummmm
glowing
red
beer
modest
head
but
it
flies
away
back
to
the
homeland
i
guess
smells
sweet
can
detect
the
alcohol
in
the
aroma
but
its
still
pleasant
tastes
malty
intriguing
effect
on
the
tongue
the
sweetness
lingers
as
a
nice
aftertaste
definitely
helps
the
drinkability
as
well
i
think
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
and
complex
scottish
ale
i
just
find
them
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
for
those
of
you
who
enjoy
this
type
of
ale
more
than
i
do
cheers
give
this
one
a
try
this
deep
dark
complex
heavy
brew
pours
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
wafts
a
heavy
peat
smoke
and
light
chocolate
roast
aroma
the
flavor
is
quite
complex
with
an
initial
peat
smoke
and
thin
alcohol
bite
the
body
is
smooth
supporting
a
smoky
roasted
toffee
malt
that
becomes
thinner
toward
the
malty
finish
an
oak
barrel
twang
jumps
up
just
as
the
brew
clears
the
palate
not
heavily
flavored
but
not
too
thin
this
beer
poured
a
rusty
brown
color
that
was
slightly
to
fairly
cloudy
appearance
in
the
glass
the
head
was
thin
to
none
but
what
was
there
was
tan
in
color
the
aromas
were
of
fresh
to
slight
tart
granny
smith
apples
and
pears
sweet
malt
caramel
yeast
and
bread
the
tastes
were
of
sweet
and
sour
apples
malt
ash
yeast
and
alcohol
there
was
a
slight
hop
finish
but
was
more
sourish
in
nature
not
sure
if
it
was
spoiled
there
was
some
carbonation
to
it
it
was
drinkable
better
as
it
warmed
which
seemed
to
calm
all
the
flavors
down
and
bring
them
together
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
imo
but
then
again
she
might
have
been
on
her
last
leg
well
worth
the
money
only
3
70
for
the
bomber
it
poured
a
hazy
reddish
copper
then
became
clear
with
hardly
any
foam
the
smell
was
of
a
sweet
fruity
nature
with
a
hint
of
malts
the
taste
was
sweet
creamy
malt
with
fruit
and
had
a
sort
of
a
nutty
flavor
this
is
the
best
scotch
ale
that
i
have
tasted
so
far
i
will
buy
this
ale
again
soon
lives
up
to
its
name
i
had
my
kilt
on
and
boy
did
it
lift
but
seriously
its
a
good
strong
scotch
ale
red
in
color
with
a
brownlight
red
head
which
was
about
14
inch
thick
clean
refreshing
taste
of
nutsfruit
no
after
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
and
goes
down
smooth
give
it
a
shot
you
wont
be
disappointed
better
than
average
but
immediately
off
the
tongue
i
noticed
something
not
what
i
expected
this
is
full
of
alcohol
taste
the
appearance
is
great
a
nice
deep
ruby
mohagany
color
clear
and
bright
slightly
smaller
head
but
probably
the
pour
color
was
a
hint
off
white
but
stayed
after
a
thinning
the
entire
time
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
smoked
little
floral
and
big
in
alcohol
first
sip
was
wow
way
off
what
i
thought
i
was
getting
into
not
bad
but
not
great
to
style
this
beer
was
nothing
but
alcohol
on
the
first
sip
after
letting
warm
a
little
bit
the
malt
showed
its
head
almost
no
hop
flavor
was
to
be
found
it
did
have
a
nice
sweet
sweet
malt
though
the
body
was
rather
weak
but
the
mouthfeel
was
alright
if
the
body
was
stronger
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
added
not
bitter
or
aroma
but
flavor
this
would
be
great
it
would
balance
the
alcohol
down
a
bit
way
to
much
alcohol
flavor
for
this
style
deep
garnet
hue
w
excellent
clarity
the
light
beige
head
settles
readily
into
a
thin
ring
that
manages
spotty
lace
assertive
dark
caramel
and
molasses
sweetness
hit
the
nose
upfront
and
are
ensued
by
signature
moylans
jackfruit
like
fruity
esters
hints
of
raisin
and
peated
malt
a
mellow
floral
goldings
hop
nose
rounds
out
the
aroma
butterscotch
diacetyl
emerges
as
the
beer
breathes
a
combination
of
date
like
and
dark
caramel
sweetness
is
perceived
initially
then
fades
into
a
melange
of
roasted
unmalted
barley
mild
hop
bitterness
and
mild
butterscotch
jackfruit
like
esters
emerge
mid
palate
and
although
odd
for
a
scotch
ale
provide
an
enjoyable
contrast
to
the
initial
sweetness
unfortunately
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
doesnt
adequately
support
the
rich
malt
profile
hop
bitterness
is
appropriately
low
leaving
overall
balance
skewed
towards
malt
sweetness
finishes
with
light
toffee
notes
slowly
fading
kilt
lifter
is
quite
an
enjoyable
and
unique
brew
its
much
fruitier
than
a
scottish
ale
or
wee
heavy
yet
still
has
a
rich
malt
profile
my
only
qualm
is
the
relatively
weak
body
its
definitely
worth
a
try
hazy
amber
with
an
orangishbrown
tint
topped
by
a
thin
but
creamy
very
light
goldentan
head
that
drops
but
leaves
a
good
collar
and
some
nice
lace
i
give
them
great
credit
for
nailing
the
fruit
and
malt
character
of
a
true
scottish
ale
very
nice
big
fruit
some
nice
strawberry
with
a
caramelized
maltiness
medium
body
with
a
gentle
carbonation
lending
to
a
supple
silky
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
a
bitterness
that
is
omnipresent
but
never
really
emerges
clearly
playing
a
supporting
role
to
the
malt
the
maltiness
is
light
and
has
a
lightly
burnt
or
caramelized
sugar
quality
to
it
my
guess
is
that
theyre
using
mainly
pale
malt
with
a
small
dose
of
roasted
barley
that
is
caramelized
in
the
kettle
rather
than
using
british
crystal
although
there
may
be
a
small
percentage
the
peat
smokiness
is
most
apparent
in
the
finish
but
quite
restrained
amongst
a
somewhat
sticky
malt
it
becomes
much
more
apparent
however
as
you
move
through
the
glass
eventually
leaving
you
with
a
light
mouthfull
of
smoke
very
authentic
not
exactly
what
i
would
call
a
scotch
ale
but
not
as
thin
and
slippery
a
very
good
beer
good
scottish
ale
feel
smooth
a
little
on
the
thin
side
very
very
thin
to
be
consider
a
scotch
ale
still
not
so
bad
for
magic
hat
really
poor
excuse
for
a
scotch
ale
tastes
more
like
a
bock
than
scotch
to
me
overall
my
first
scotch
ale
and
i
am
impressed
smooth
creamy
mouth
with
a
chocolate
caramel
taste
very
good
overall
this
is
a
well
made
brew
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
taste
has
a
lightly
toasted
and
sweet
malt
note
with
a
mild
bitterness
taking
up
the
rear
not
as
malty
sweet
as
what
i
like
in
scotch
ales
but
it
is
likable
in
it
way
this
is
an
interesting
beer
smells
kind
of
nutty
and
malty
taste
is
like
bluegorgonzola
cheese
mix
in
hops
very
interesting
taste
that
i
kind
of
like
not
a
beer
youd
want
all
the
time
but
definitely
one
worth
speaking
out
once
and
awhile
if
you
like
different
tasting
beers
you
should
definetly
give
this
beer
a
pour
overall
ok
brew
glad
i
tried
it
out
good
beer
enjoyed
it
in
the
variety
pack
o
aside
from
a
weak
nose
this
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
smoke
never
overwhelming
or
cloying
just
enough
to
make
it
different
glad
they
brought
it
back
for
this
fall
the
smoke
seems
to
open
up
more
and
more
as
time
goes
by
which
is
not
a
problem
for
me
i
actually
think
the
use
of
peat
here
is
quite
smart
considering
how
it
blends
with
the
other
malt
flavors
not
for
those
who
dont
like
smoke
but
i
actually
think
its
one
of
magic
hats
better
brews
in
recent
times
aroma
is
a
bit
fruity
malt
pour
is
deep
amber
orange
with
thick
white
head
head
dissipates
quickly
leaves
a
very
spotty
lacing
taste
is
warm
and
mellow
fig
and
datenut
bread
nice
for
a
chilly
evening
i
like
this
its
good
for
a
cold
fall
night
lots
of
malty
sweetness
without
being
cloying
pretty
good
for
magic
hat
might
make
a
better
winter
ale
the
body
just
does
run
into
full
territory
but
it
just
skirts
the
edge
there
its
crisp
and
creamy
carbonation
staying
even
and
the
feel
keeping
to
the
sweeter
end

with
an
abv
of

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
sweetness
and
some
grains
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
so
far
now
for
the
taste
it
is
bold
with
caramel
taste
and
some
grains
at
the
end
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
the
taste
is
great
and
the
color
is
nice
i
have
to
say
that
magic
hat
brewing
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
for
being
6
9
abv
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
this
brew
was
great
choice
overall
a
nicely
done
3
75
for
jinx
magic
hat
brewing
company
if
the
bite
were
just
slightly
less
wee
heavy
then
i
would
drink
this
regularly
came
as
part
of
the
night
of
the
living
dead
sampler
pack
so
i
doubt
this
brew
will
have
a
recurrence
in
my
fridge
a
very
unique
scotch
ale
to
say
the
least
smokey
and
sweet
malty
and
bold
smells
sweet
like
gummy
bears
tastes
like
scotch
not
to
overpowering
as
with
many
scotch
ales
right
on
the
money
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
thin
head
and
minimal
lacing
may
be
my
new
favorite
magic
hat
beer
this
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
has
a
chemical
after
taste
i
love
all
styles
of
beers
i
can
not
understand
the
high
ratings
its
gotten
on
here
i
had
to
pour
8
oz
out
i
just
couldnt
drink
it
i
like
all
the
other
beers
magic
hats
has
but
wow
overall
a
good
solid
brew
but
i
was
expecting
something
closer
to
a
scotch
wee
heavy
had
a
bottle
of
this
back
on
4808
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
new
style
for
me
when
i
had
just
started
trying
beers
not
really
know
what
a
scotch
ale
was
i
proceeded
to
did
out
the
beer
was
rather
nice
shade
of
red
with
a
really
nice
head
that
lasted
for
a
little
bit
the
smell
was
a
little
roasted
and
sweet
i
found
it
to
be
fairly
inviting
the
taste
was
sweet
at
first
which
faded
into
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
overall
i
wish
this
beer
hadnt
been
retired
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
one
day
d
not
a
bad
session
ale
at
all
the
flavors
were
strong
enough
to
keep
you
intrested
while
never
overwhelming
or
become
too
sweet
to
drink
would
not
have
been
hard
to
throw
down
more
then
a
fw
of
these
in
a
sitting
poured
into
a
snifter
the
color
is
a
moderatelydark
brown
color
with
a
light
head
the
nose
brings
some
dark
fruits
roasted
malt
light
toffee
and
some
caramel
the
taste
has
some
dark
fruits
and
also
includes
a
bit
of
light
candied
toffee
feel
is
nice
and
a
bit
heavy
drinks
well
enough
but
nothing
to
really
pull
me
back
for
seconds
a
bit
of
old
school
craft
beer
here
packed
with
flavor
yet
not
overkill
without
a
doubt
a
choice
pick
for
the
fall
season
though
we
would
not
be
against
magic
hat
brewing
it
year
round
just
had
the
2008
jinx
had
about
half
of
the
flavors
at
about
half
the
intensity
worthy
of
about
half
the
rating
went
downhill
fast
d
mild
and
smooth
decent
overall
ale
but
towards
the
weaker
end
of
the
scotch
ale
category
d
could
drink
this
all
night
while
siting
by
a
campfire
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
or
a
2atthemost
type
beer
for
me
due
to
the
predominance
of
sweetness
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
would
definitely
try
again
poured

a

mouthfeel

seems
like
a
well
rounded
beer
starts
with
a
hoppy
taste
then
turning
to
a
malty
sweetness
i
cant
make
my
mind
up
about
this
brew
i
usually
enjoy
most
magic
hat
offerings
but
this
one
may
need
another
taste
later
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
although
its
not
bad
final
thoughts
perfect
autumn
beer
i
always
look
foward
to
picking
up
a
twelve
of
this
a
unique
brew
from
magic
hat
that
deserves
at
least
one
purchase
the
flavor
of
smoke
and
whiskey
work
well
together
and
provide
a
synergistic
relationship
give
it
a
try
in
the
fall
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
me
i
certainly
wont
have
another
final
thought
a
great
offering
to
those
beer
connoisseurs
looking
some
something
original
and
not
overpowering
very
pleased

on

a

that
arched
over

held
for
a

the
cream

a

mingles
with
a
mediumfull
body
the
flavors
of
this
beer
while
good
would
prove
to
be
a
bit
overbearing
after
a
while
for
me
along
with
the
nearly
7
drinkability
tastes
fine
good
mouthfeel
so
this
works
poured

color
with
a

head
that
enjoys
hanging
around
for
a
while
complimented
by
suspended
yeast
sediment
aroma
is
that
of
caramel
and
alcohol
for
the
most
part
taste
definitely
consists
of
caramel
malt
and
interestingly
enough
a
bit
of
smoke
as
well
and
maybe
even
moss
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
like
a
scotch
ale
should
be
drinkability
is
very
easy
due
to
creaminess
but
this
beer
is
just
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
due
to
the
earth
flavor
the
malts
impart
on
it
would
drink
this
beer
again
without
having
to
twist
my
arm
though
jinx
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
has
its
flaws
the
nose
could
use
some
work
carbonations
a
little
high
and
it
could
really
use
somthing
to
add
depth
and
character
something
spicy
maybe
all
in
all
its
better
than
i
expected
and
is
well
worth
a
try

a

with
a
quater
inch
thick
head
forming
on

the
head
is
beige
in
color
showing
tremendous
retention
staying
there
longer
than
one
would
expect
a
malty
scent
at
the
front
with
a
touch
nof
smokiness
with
woody
green
fragrance
at
the
end
the
malt
is
straight
out
strong
in
the
taste
sweet
but
not
over
bearing
then
the
smoke
comes
foward
and
gives
you
what
you
expect
from
a
scotch
ale
then
a
grassy
green
flavor
comes
in
right
the
end
is
a
bit
of
a
put
off
from
the
smokiness
a
medium
bodied
feel
with
a
chewy
finish
with
a
slight
dryness
at
the
end
a
solid
to
good
scotch
ale
the
smoky
flavor
does
make
it
a
good
choice
to
go
with
any
smoked
food
d
i
found
this
moderately
drinkable
not
difficult
to
drink
but
i
doubt
id
have
more
than
23
in
a
session
i
did
like
the
smoked
scent
and
flavor
but
it
didnt
last
long
enough
in
my
experience
my
first
review
on

great
dark

occasional
scent
of
spiced
rubbing
alcohol
but
not
on

sip
smooth
with
a
nice
silky
mouthfeel
bitter
but
not
overwhelming
aftertaste
with
a
nice
warming
hit
from
the
alcohol
content
glad
i
picked
one
up
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
me
i
like
the
wee
bit
of
smoke
the
smoothness
the
lighter
body
the
well
hidden
abv
pretty
much
everything
about
this
beer
save
for
the
nose
which
isnt
bad

its

thumbs
up
matched
with
the
malty
taste
of
the
beer
there
is
also
a
sweet
and
caramel
element
at
play
that
comes
through
nicely
this
is
where
it
seems
as
though
jinx
stands
apart
from
the
rest
because
the
sweet
complexity
within
the
taste
does
not
seem
to
be
syrupy
or
fake
there
is
also
a
hint
of
both
dark
berries
and
nuts
at
work
within
the
taste
d
this
most
striking
thing
about
this
pint
was
the
mellowness
and
smoothness
while
the
individual
parts
appearance

taste
were
all
solid
the
sum
of
the
parts
worked
together
to
create
a
great

i
could
enjoy
this
one
after
another
edit
holy
crap
as
this
brew
warms
and
i
scan
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
hits
me
this
does
taste
like
a
tootsie
pop
crazy
im
not
changing
the
flavor
rating
but
just
thought
id
mention
d
one
or
two
is
nice
mybe
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
alcohol
taste
for
me
d
this
is
underpowered
and
pretty
boring
honestly
its
more
like
a
mild
brown
ale
than
a
wee
heavy
the
nutty
aftertaste
isnt
bad
and
its
a
damn
good
looking
beer
but
it
somehow
fails
to
deliver
mediocre
really
taste
is
well
balanced
between
maltiness
and
hoppiness
earthy
after
taste
little
thickness
in
the
mouth
its
eminently
drinkable
and
when
im
in
vt
its
an
enjoyable
wither
beer
if
this
isnt
readily
accessible
though
its
probably
not
worth
seeking
outpaying
12asix
for
nothing
special
here
imo
not
worth
the
money
or
the
calories
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
hard
for
me
to
say
anything
to
negative
about
it
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
copper
highlights
and
a
twofinger
tan
head
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
some
smokiness
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
nice
sweetness
and
smokiness
that
is
cut
in
the
middle
by
some
hops
that
leads
into
a
pretty
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
with
a
little
bit
of
creaminess
and
some
fine
carbonation
this
beer
sits
a
little
heavy
so
i
probably
wont
go
immediately
for
another
however
it
is
remarkably
tasty
and
complex
d
very
drinkable
ill
have
to
find
more
of
this
yet
another
beer
i
could
find
here
in
co
drinkability
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
ive
had
but
no
comparison
to
skullsplitter
so
far
the
king
of
scotch
ales
at
least
in
my
opinion
and
talisker
is
where
its
at
drinkability
surprisingly
good
and
it
has
most
everything
you
could
be
looking
for
a
good
dose
of
malts
fruity
yeasty
notes
smoke
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
spot
on
for
the
style
even
a
little
low
perhaps
and
wellhidden
just
a
nice
drinkable
sessionable
seasonal
from
magic

and
one
of
their
more
enjoyable
beers
imo
at
6
9
this
beer
catches
you
completely
offguard
you
think
its
a
typical
magic
hat
session
beer
but
it
turns
out
its
a
bigger
beer
honestly
its
just
a
perfect
american
oldscotch
not
at
all
smokey
not
at
all
overly
malty
and
muted
just
very
drinkable
a
fabulous
beer
from
magic
hat
d
a
session
beer
for
sure
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
one
from
magic
hat
smooth
drinker
and
a
damn
fine
beer
this
is
the
second
brew
i
have
had
from
magic
hat
that
has
made
me
just
want
to
keep
drinking
it
to
try
to
figure
out
how
they
heck
they
did
that
easily
drinkable
with
the
flavors
beautifully
masking
the
near
7
abv
check
this
one
out
d
lots
of
complexity
here
with
layers
of
unique
flavors
this
is
a
really
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
its
also
not
difficult
to
drink
despite
a
relatively
robust
abv
and
strong
flavors
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
this
poured
a
clear
auburn
with
nice
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
honey
and
caramel
malts
with
lemon
yeast
and
salty
cashews
and
a
bit
of
roasted
cinnamon
it
tasted
like
nutty
malt
with
caramel
and
copper
hops
and
some
sweet
yeast
and
spices
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
tasty
malty
beer
with
nice
flavor
and
good
body
there
was
nothing
too
unique
about
it
but
it
was
clean
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
definitely
more
enjoyable
than
other
magic
hats
ive
tried
easy
drinker
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
not
my
favorite
scotch
ale
you
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
not
impressed
small
head
with
minimal
lacings
on
a
light
brown
body
a
sweet
sugary
malt
smell
with
some
smokedroasted
malts
tucked
in
there
and
a
decent
amount
of
hops
in
the
background
a
heavy
roasted
malt
like
taste
that
is
also
creamy
and
smooth
fullbodied
w
a
drying
backbite
with
minor
hopiness
as
this
beer
tucks
in
a
dark
fruitlike
taste
to
mix
things
up
comes
across
as
really
balanced
an
interesting
beer
that
i
could
have
anytime
its
complex
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
it
glad
there
were
only
three
bottles
of
this
in
the
participation
12er
below
average
d
very
nice
drinkable
and
approachable
without
losing
the
malty
focus
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
complex
and
challenging
yet
satisfying
and
very
drinkable
feel
is
really
nice
smooth
and
creamy
full
bodied
with
carbonation
that
keeps
the
malt
from
sticking
to
the
tongue
i
could
drink
many
of
these
constantly
the
color
was
a
nice
dark
amber
color
the
aroma
was
of
a
great
roast
on
the
malt
the
flavor
had
that
delicious
cereally
malty
flavor
loved
the
roasted
aspect
a
little
sweet
but
not
too
bad
a
little
spice
with
little
hop
flavor
a
nice
medium
bodied
fall
beer
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
fall
beers
d
magic
hat
has
crafted
a
beer
in
its
own
class
ive
never
had
anything
similar
to
this
very
strong
to
say
the
least
but
definetley
drinkable
again
look
out
for
the
slight
alcohol
taste
youll
get
on
the
backdrop
of
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
hate
it
or
love
it
but
it
definetley
makes
this
brew
stand
out
from
other
autumn
selections
d
i
had
two
of
these
and
could
easily
have
had
more
abv
a
bit
high
for
this
to
be
a
session
beer
but
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
im
very
impressed
with
the
overall
goodness
of
this
brew
i
will
look
forward
in
the
future
to
bringing
home
a
sixer
my
only
hope
is
that
im
able
to
find
it
locally
this
brew
poured
a
dark
brownish
copper
with
barely
any
head
it
smells
of
very
sweet
malt
its
sweet
and
mediumbodied
in
the
mouth
and
finishes
sweet
and
almost
smoky
i
find
it
strange
the
flavors
seem
both
strong
but
subtle
its
a
pretty
interesting
concoction
that
i
cant
say
i
like
a
ton
but
it
was
still
worth
a
try
dark
amber
colored
ale
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
burnt
oak
taste
is
oakcitrus
and
atouch
of
caramel
or
toffee
for
a
6
90
abv
this
goes
down
very
smooth
i
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
this
one
highly
recommended
and
would
purchase
again
lagniappe
the
explanation
on
the
bottle
mighnt
not
mean
much
but
i
wouldnt
really
know
how
to
describe
this
beer
anyway
aparrently
magic
hat
didnt
either
and
thats
ok
d
there
is
a
lot
of
complexity
here
that
makes
it
fun
to
drink
and
the
considerable
alcohol
does
not
deter
this
is
a
different
magic
hat
offering
from
what
im
used
to
but
good
albeit
not
my
favorite
of
styles
but
i
like
the
smokiness
d
good
beer
jinx
has
made
me
reevaluate
my
opinion
of
magic
hat
before
this
i
had
tried
a
few
of
their
other
beers
9
and
circus
boy
and
had
been
underwhelmed
but
this
was
great
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
of
magic
hats
other
seasonals
as
well
as
their
higher
gravity
line
d
notwithstanding
my
complaint
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
just
sit
back
and
drink
further
while
at
6
9
abv
it
cannot
be
pounded
it
is
a
beer
that
one
could
have
a
couple
of
without
being
in
danger
and
it
goes
well
on
a
cool
evening
i
liked
this
now
im
regretting
its
a
fall
seasonal
id
like
to
have
some
of
this
around
through
the
winter
cheaper
than
dirty
bastard
broughton
and
belhaven
and
conveniently
available
at
trader
joes
certainly
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
magic
hat
d
an
excellent
treat
but
the
bold
smokiness
can
become
tiring
after
awhile
d
a
tasty
pick
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
scotch
ale
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
to
come
out
of
the
northeast
once
again
robust
with
a
good
bit
of
complexity
recommended
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
in
the
wee
heavy
territory
is
it
now
along
with
magic
hats
hi
p
a
jinx
is
amongst
this
breweries
best
beers
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
falling
somewhere
between
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
and
a
normal
english
one
unusual
and
delicious
d
this
is
a
good
session
beer
and
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
a
good
seasonal
offering
this
was
a
great
beer
so
far
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
magic
hat
the
smell
and
taste
of
smoked
malts
and
hops
is
just
so
delicious
and
refreshing
it
smells
great
looks
great
tastes
great
its
got
a
very
unnoticeable
high
abv
solid
beer
overall
this
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
that
good
theres
a
chance
that
because
i
got
this
from
a
grocery
store
itd
been
exposed
to
the
sun
for
a
while
but
i
just
wasnt
very
impressed
by
no
means
is
this
an
avoid
beer
but
i
will
probably
not
be
buying
this
again
drinkability
its
soso
its
okay
but
geez
that
label
is
a
bit
on
the
creepy
side
one
awesome
and
complex
brew
a
fairly
standard
amber
ale
with
some
nice
smokiness
but
some
issues
as
well
amber
color
with
a
minimal
head
the
flavor
is
solid
some
caramel
and
smoke
but
the
aftertaste
has
a
very
soapy
cleaning
fluid
vaguely
perfumey
quality
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
which
is
neither
a
negative
nor
in
this
case
much
of
a
positive
whats
good
is
not
original
and
whats
original
is
not
good
d
good
stuff
even
with
the
slightly
higher
abv
and
the
slightly
sweet
taste
it
doesnt
feel
like
too
much
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
nice
stuff
i
purchased
a
few
of
these
and
the
first
one
was
served
into
a
pint
glassnot
such
a
good
taste
there
then
i
poured
into
a
thistle
glass
and
that
seemed
to
do
the
trick
d
a
very
good
and
drinkable
scotch
ale
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
beige
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
medium
sweet
earthy
dark
fruits
and
light
spices
flavor
is
medium
sweet
cherry
earthy
nutty
and
some
alcohol
burning
light
to
medium
body
a
very
pleasant
beer
cant
call
it
scotch
ale
however
you
know
its
leafpeeping
time
fall
here
in
vt
when
this
one
hits
the
shelves
out
of
the
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
was
roasted
malt
toffee
and
a
smokyness
like
wood
chips
the
flavors
were
distinctly
smoky
caramel
malt
hazelnut
hints
the
malts
are
rich
and
deep
and
balanced
at
the
end
by
some
bitter
hops
that
coat
the
tongue
medium
body
and
a
good
mouthfeel
the
higher
alc
is
also
well
hidden
i
think
this
is
a
fine
example
of
scotch
heavy
and
very
apropos
to
the
season
amber
looks
and
little
head
to
show
some
chocolate
smell
with
initial
tart
to
sweeten
things
up
lacks
carbonation
to
make
for
a
more
pleasant
mouthfeel
it
feels
more
like
a
dark
fruit
syrup
with
some
sourness
a
good
beer
overall
with
a
interesting
balance
of
fruit
and
roast
mouthfeel
is
roasty
lingering
a
decent
weight
lots
of
flavor
probably
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
magic
hat
done
was
enough
9102004
just
sampled
this
on
tap
at
our
local
pub
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
red
actually
let
it
be
noted
that
my
buddy
ordered
a
newcastle
and
this
beer
looked
exactly
like
a
newcastle
color
head
lace
all
the
same
the
flavor
is
very
malty
smokey
burned
and
sweet
theres
a
good
amount
of
flavor
here
turns
a
little
bitter
in
the
finish
pretty
good
beer
for
the
fall
but
nothing
too
exceptional
d
it
hides
its
avb
very
well
if
you
didnt
see
the
bottle
you
wouldnt
know
this
was
just
shy
of
7
it
drinks
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
you
could
easily
drink
several
during
a
poker
game
a
fairly
good
effort
from
magic
hat
not
the
strong
ale
on
the
six
pack
that
i
hoped
to
enjoy
but
a
decent
scotch
ale
id
prefer
a
broader
malt
base
but
this
is
worth
the
effort
drinkability
medium
drinkability
i
could
have
two
or
three
of
these
without
hesitation
but
would
not
want
more
than
that
in
one
sitting
as
it
is
fairly
filling
the
taste
is
quite
pleasing
with
a
decent
smokiness
but
nothing
crazy
light
carbonation
allows
for
a
medium
body
to
stay
very
drinkable
and
tasty
this
isnt
as
big
as
6
9
could
be
in
flavor
and
body
but
still
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
not
really
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
i
dont
think
magic
hat
really
likes
conforming
to
standards
anyways
d
an
ok
but
slightly
underwhelming
beer
that
could
use
a
flavor
upgrade
however
for
the
abv
it
is
quite
smooth
and
i
could
imagine
a
lot
of
people
getting
pretty
housed
off
of
these
drinkability
quite
drinkable
thoroughly
enjoyable
drinkability
this
style
doesnt
show
up
much
in
vt
but
i
feel
that
jinx
is
a
good
introduction
to
it
its
not
too
filling
or
overwhelmingly
smoky
ive
enjoyed
it
from
tap
before
but
never
had
the
bottled
version
i
like
this
beer
though
i
have
friends
that
hate
it
oh
well
d
pretty
decent
a
nice
unique
flavor
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
really
liked
this
take
on
it
i
still
couldnt
have
a
bunch
of
these
because
the
over
powering
presence
of
malts
overall
a
tasty
and
full
bodied
scotch
ale
dont
drink
and
review
thanks
to
hurleymanvw
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
at
his
home
d
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
it
reminds
me
of
some
homebrews
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
in
the
past
taste
rushes
into
a
smokey
caramel
twist
and
finishes
dry
low
carbonation
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
profile
alcohol
is
also
slightly
noticeable
which
is
surprising
this
is
my
first
offering
from
magic
hat
since
1996
the
beer
poured
a
brownish
red
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smill
is
sweet
and
buttery
and
citrusy
the
taste
is
consistant
with
the
smell
but
i
also
pick
up
pitted
fruits
perhaps
the
taste
is
a
bit
peppery
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
consistant
with
what
i
expect
from
this
style
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
d
ok
admittedly
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
didnt
find
this
objectionable
at
all
for
what
it
is
a
solid
version
of
a
scotch
ale
ok
smoke
was
well
done
in
that
it
accented
rather
than
overpowered
not
terribly
impressive
though
weakest
wee
heavy
i
have
tasted
must
be
spoiled
by
alesmith
first
magic

pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
cannot
recommend
it
to

nah
glad
i
only
bought
the

way
too
smoky
and
not

a

at
least
poured
out
to
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
maintained
a
huge
level
of
density
nice
aroma
is
smokey
and
earthy
with
some
red
wine
qualities
and
dark
fruit
aromas
tastes
was
right
on
flavors
of
sweet
and
rich
malts
smoked
wood
unsweetened
dark
fruits
and
spices
toward
the
finish
amazing
complexity
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
lighter
than
many
other
smoked
beers
but
still
held
on
to
a
rich
creamy
character
that
is
missing
from
so
many
beers
good
drinkability
wish
magic
hat
was
available
in
mi
special
thanks
to
conneticutpoet
for
the
sample
i
enjoyed
this
ale
very
much
would
make
for
a
good
pub
pint
i
would
gladly
bend
my
elbow
for
this
again
pours
a
dark
amber
with
almost
no
head
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
mild
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
malty
but
not
very
strong
there
is
some
smoke
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
much
lighter
than
id
like
it
but
the
drinkability
is
ok
poured
a
ruby
brown
with
an
offwhite
smallish
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lace
nose
was
a
light
hint
of
smoky
malts
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
a
sweet
fruit
taste
was
a
hint
of
smoky
malts
with
a
sweep
slightly
hoppy
finish
mothfeel
was
good
decently
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
overall
drinkability
was
good
as
this
brew
grew
on
me
because
of
the
subtle
complexities
pours
deep
amber
color
with
no
head
i
expected
a
touch
of
head
nose
is
very
light
with
smoke
i
get
some
brown
sugar
light
smoke
not
a
whole
lot
more
flavor
is
a
little
more
smokey
a
touch
of
smoked
meat
marinaded
in
brown
sugar
rub
still
a
touch
light
in
the
flavor
as
well
just
a
bit
lacking
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
its
a
tasty
but
really
subtle
in
both
i
like
more
agressiveness
in
a
smoked
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
the
dark
amber
offering
quickly
settles
with
a
light
creamy
head
that
soon
dissipates
initial
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
carmel
accents
and
a
slightly
smoky
overtone
medium
to
light
body
makes
this
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
could
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
the
second
was
definitely
better
than
the
first
the
upfront
malt
qualities
does
not
stay
around
long
and
i
found
the
finish
to
be
less
than
desired
still
a
decent
beer
by
any
means
12
oz
with
drink
before
the
end
of
dec
notched
on
the
label
pours
into
the
nonic
a
clear
ruby
brown
with
an
offwhite
1
finger
head
that
leaves
some
wisps
of
lace
smokyearthy
in
the
nose
with
caramel
malts
appearing
later
and
at
one
point
while
swirling
i
swear
i
smelled
blueberries
it
has
earthy
and
smoky
malts
mild
hopshop
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
toward
the
end
with
a
body
that
is
medium
and
smooth
seems
like
a
scottish
because
of
all
the
malts
and
even
though
the
maltiness
does
what
they
intended
it
to
id
opt
for
something
more
hoppy
a
nice
deep
amber
with
a
linger
off
white
head
that
yeilded
a
little
lacing
it
has
a
hint
of
smoke
in
the
nose
in
fact
if
you
arent
careful
you
might
not
even
notice
especially
in
a
smoky
bar
a
flavorful
if
almost
bland
amber
ale
with
the
ringwood
yeast
with
small
amounts
of
smoke
seeping
through
it
is
a
little
thin
it
could
have
used
some
more
strength
in
the
legs
the
more
i
had
in
a
row
the
better
this
beer
was
and
it
could
be
a
session
beer
but
it
is
not
something
to
seek
out
as
it
barely
gets
a
shrug
i
first
had
this
beer
in
a
growler
from
the
brewery
several
years
ago
at
the
time
i
preferred
it
to
blind
faith
magic
hats
ipa
thats
not
really
true
anymore
but
still
i
recommend
it
drinkability
was
good
this
went
down
smooth
and
easy
i
could
have
a
few
more
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
if
it
were
offered
at
a
party
id
probably
preferentially
go
for
this
one
just
recently
offered
around
here
and
nobody
seems
to
know
what
kind
it
was
and
the
label
is
very
true
to
form
for
magic
hat
and
basically
tells
you
jack
about
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
with
a
small
light
tan
silky
mostly
diminishing
head
the
smell
is
moderately
malty
with
aromas
of
caramel
lemongrass
and
smoke
the
taste
is
very
smoky
with
earthy
toasted
malts
and
some
peat
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
im
not
a
very
big
fan
of
smoke
beers
but
this
one
was
done
very
well
too
often
i
find
the
smoke
in
beers
of
this
style
to
be
too
bug
and
distracting
but
this
one
doesnt
go
overboard
pours
a
dark
orangelight
brown
color
with
a
very
light
whispy
white
head
aroma
of
dried
apricots
peat
smoke
and
something
oddly
though
not
unpleasantly
like
sweaty
feet
palate
is
quite
interesting
rather
fruity
with
notes
of
apricots
and
light
hops
blended
with
a
bit
of
peaty
smoked
malt
the
alcohol
is
rather
prevalent
on
the
finish
body
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
hope
for
to
hold
up
the
assertive
flavor
still
its
the
first
beer
in
the
smoked
ale
category
that
ive
been
able
to
even
drink
more
than
one
sip
of
so
thats
got
to
count
for
something
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
original
and
has
a
nice
individual
character
a
good
try
by
magic
hat
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
again
this
is
my
favorite
mh
beer
it
brings
to
mind
memories
of
fallen
leaves
crunching
underfoot
and
wood
smoke
lingering
in
the
air
first
of
all
their
labels
are
genius
this
is
some
weird
joker
dude
made
out
of
hearts
but
it
sorta
looks
like
a
6
balled
ballsack
anways
this
12oz
bottle
pours
a
unique
goldenorange
red
color
with
a
nice
head
that
doesnt
stay
the
aroma
consists
of
sweet
malts
and
smokeroastiness
nice
not
as
strong
as
the
taste
by
far
mmmm
the
smokiness
hits
you
at
different
times
throughout
the
taste
this
is
so
creamy
fairly
smooth
very
drinkable
while
magic
hats
ubiquitous
9
is
a
fairly
mediocre
brew
the
company
is
clearly
capable
of
churning
out
exciting
offerings
jinx
joins
ravel
and
thumbsucker
as
examples
of
ambitious
wellexecuted
very
drinkable
beers
a
great
fall
offering
the
beer
combines
many
of
the
characteristics
of
oktoberfest
lagers
with
the
flavor
profile
of
an
ale
highly
recommended
clear
dark
brown
body
with
amber
hues
topped
with
a
1finger
slightly
offwhite
head
fluffy
with
low
retention
little
to
no
lacing
spotty
in
some
areas
sweet
malt
nose
maple
and
fudge
hints
of
smoke
good
carbonation
up
front
nice
feel
medium
and
full
but
not
slick
tongue
awash
with
caramel
sweetness
a
hint
of
apple
some
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
fully
emerging
on
the
way
down
with
just
a
tiny
dab
of
smoke
extremely
sweet
with
complex
flavors
just
bubbling
under
and
smoke
unfortunately
not
forceful
enough
makes
it
interesting
but
doesnt
overly
impress
this
is
a
fantastically
unique
beer
combining
the
crispness
of
a
pale
ale
and
the
huge
heft
of
a
stout
or
porter
or
even
doppelbock
but
in
flavor
only
ive
liked
number
9
and
thought
that
that
was
innovative
as
well
however
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
nonetheless
from
magic
hat
nice
to
drink
can
enjoy
a
few
of
these
among
some
other
octoberfest
favorites
a
nice
variety
to
the
style
a
nice
frothy
thick
offwhite
head
forms
on
top
of
a
deep
dark
brown
colored
beer
light
seeps
in
gently
at
the
edges
the
smell
is
very
malty
supporting
a
touch
of
sweetness
there
is
a
note
of
smoke
in
the
background
but
i
wish
it
was
stronger
the
taste
is
very
malty
as
are
most
fall
seasonals
there
is
a
sweetness
in
the
background
that
dances
around
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
i
think
maybe
if
the
sweetness
died
down
a
bit
the
smoke
would
be
more
apparent
at
the
end
the
dreaded
diacetyl
makes
a
presence
it
isnt
really
offputting
but
i
wonder
if
this
is
the
sweetness
i
tasted
in
the
beginning
after
the
swallow
it
leaves
a
sticky
residue
in
my
mouth
i
remember
liking
this
beer
much
more
than
i
do
now
its
still
a
nice
beer
but
its
lacking
some
sort
of
individuality
a
stronger
smokiness
would
go
a
long
way
towards
making
it
a
great
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
bone
white
head
that
turns
into
a
thin
film
very
quickly
smell
of
caramel
and
nuts
taste
is
sweet
malty
caramel
with
just
the
slightest
smokeyness
the
smokeyness
does
become
more
pronounced
as
you
drink
but
wasnt
as
prominent
as
i
would
have
liked
some
bitterness
to
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
level
on
the
tongue
i
would
recomend
this
for
a
try
especially
in
the
variety
pack
from
magic
hat
wont
make
my
list
of
regulars
but
i
would
buy
the
variety
pack
again
for
the
change
of
pace
poured
out
a
small
head
but
that
could
of
been
the
pour
tiny
amounts
of
lacing
the
color
is
a
light
brown
and
is
clear
with
some
bubbling
carbonation
i
bought
this
at
tullys
while
in
maine
on
vacation
has
a
strong
aroma
and
taste
not
much
of
a
head
but
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
thicker
as
it
is
a
little
watery
for
my
liking
leaves
a
lingering
bitterness
nicely
malted
with
a
slight
smoke
aroma
and
taste
tastes
of
molasses
with
a
hint
of
raisins
more
lacing
with
every
sip
so
the
appearance
goes
up
a
bit
this
beer
is
very
hard
to
find
in
my
area
and
i
was
lucky
to
find
it
in
maine
overall
not
a
bad
beer
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
end
d
on
label
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
introduce
people
to
smoked
beers
its
sweet
the
smokiness
is
just
there
and
its
very
well
balanced
and
at
6
9
itll
get
the
job
done
if
thats
what
youre
seeking
recommended
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
howeverthe
carbonation
goes
away
too
fast
a
nice
spicey
smokey
aroma
this
is
a
nice
octoberfest
like
smokey
beer
thats
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
this
has
a
very
nice
flavor
i
can
see
having
a
few
of
these
a
nice
offering
from
magic
hat
this
is
my
first
smoked
brew
and
a
good
one
at
that
quite
enjoyable
overall
interesting
beer
i
do
think
the
flavor
is
good
and
recommend
you
try
it
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
a
couple
of
these
as
the
6
8
is
noticable
still
a
quality
brew
from
magic
hat
which
has
impressed
me
greatly
with
the
last
several
beers
ive
sampled
got
this
bottle
from
the
fall
sampler
pack
pours
a
nice
amber
garnet
color
with
a
thin
white
head
moderate
lacing
smell
is
rather
light
just
slightly
smokey
more
of
a
malty
prune
and
fig
scent
taste
is
a
sweet
toffeish
malt
with
nice
woody
flavors
and
just
a
hint
of
smokemuch
more
subtle
than
any
other
smoked
beer
ive
had
there
is
a
slight
hop
finish
and
as
the
beer
warms
some
of
the
dark
fruits
start
to
come
in
on
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
ive
been
starting
to
get
into
smoked
beers
recently
but
usually
i
cant
handle
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
is
probably
the
first
sessionable
one
ive
hadi
really
like
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
now
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
fall
beers
certainly
at
least
worth
a
shot
even
if
you
may
be
hesitant
and
i
was
because
smoked
beers
as
i
said
arent
usually
my
favorite
a
solid
brew
interesting
and
enjoyable
actually
exceeded
my
expetations
thankfully
the
smokiness
is
not
overdone
a
nice
addition
to
the
fall
magic
hat
mixed
12
for
what
it
is
and
who
is
buying
it
this
is
a
great
beer
in
the
world
of
smoked
beers
this
is
average
however
mh
deserves
big
testicle
points
for
throwing
this
into
a
mix
pack
notld
that
overall
tries
to
educate
the
beer
drinker
instead
of
simply
intoxicating
himher
would
like
ot
try
this
on
tap
some
day
a
good
sized
creamy
tan
colored
head
fades
slowly
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
pint
glass
dark
glowing
chestnut
colored
beer
shows
barely
a
sign
of
carbonation
gentle
aroma
of
roasted
malt
sharp
caramel
notes
and
mildly
sweet
caramel
malt
and
cocoa
up
front
in
the
flavor
a
hint
of
tea
joins
in
just
before
the
faint
smoked
peat
flavor
takes
it
all
into
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
just
a
hair
undercarbonated
im
on
the
fence
with
this
one
the
smoked
malts
add
a
nice
dimension
to
the
beer
and
the
almost
7
abv
is
undetectable
drinkability
is
good
hides
the
6
9
very
well
if
youre
a
bourbon
fan
and
a
beer
lover
i
suggest
checking
this
one
out
its
a
nice
mix
that
wages
an
unusual
battle
on
the
palate
one
of
my
favorite
magic
hat
brews
very
drinkable
if
you
care
for
that
smoked
flavor
certainly
not
a
beer
for
all
tastes
but
one
i
enjoyed
greatly
and
one
i
could
easily
have
many
of
this
is
a
very
drinkable
fall
seasonal
poured
a
reddishcopper
color
with
average
tannish
head
smell
is
toasty
malty
dark
fruity
smokey
and
very
enjoyable
taste
is
complex
being
a
mixture
of
toasted
malt
prunes
figs
and
smokiness
great
finish
and
very
smoothnin
the
mouth
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
a
fairly
interesting
beer
it
tastes
like
a
robust
scottishstyle
ale
maybe
even
a
weeheavy
that
is
unusually
smokey
the
peat
flavor
imparts
that
nice
appleysmokiness
found
in
scotch
whiskey
a
unique
beer
and
a
decent
one
too
but
not
one
that
i
imagine
buying
again
anytime
soon
the
beer
has
a
buttery
sweetness
that
makes
hard
to
want
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
imho
still
its
worth
a
try
recommended
big
head
of
bubbles
on
top
of
a
brassy
pour
smell
is
roasty
malt
with
some
smoke
notes
that
arent
too
overwhelming
taste
is
roasty
the
smoke
flavors
are
in
there
on
the
malt
theres
also
a
pretty
strong
fruit
flavor
and
a
syrupy
sweetness
some
herbal
notes
too
the
flavor
comes
together
in
a
pretty
interesting
way
its
all
just
kind
of
thrown
in
there
together
but
comes
out
nice
its
sort
of
hard
to
drink
due
to
this
quality
but
its
definitely
a
neat
beer
thats
worth
trying
mediumfull
bodied
jinx
noun
a
person
or
thing
that
is
believed
to
bring
bad
luck
this
is
a
beer
that
is
wholly
in
keeping
with
magic
hats
stated
mission
to
brew
interesting
offbeat
beer
and
to
do
it
with
style
i
find
myself
with
mixed
feelings
regarding
their
beer
more
often
than
not
and
jinx
is
a
mixed
bag
of
an
effort
in
my
mind
it
doesnt
have
enough
positive
attributes
to
be
more
than
a
curiosity
to
me
but
i
do
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
have
given
it
a
go
thanks
far333
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
especially
in
the
colder
months
recommended
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
have
to
try
again
in
warmer
weather
medium
bodied
brew
smooth
at
the
start
and
finish
the
smokiness
is
pleasant
and
lasts
briefly
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
for
a
smoked
beer
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
version
and
nicely
drinkable
this
is
a
decent
fall
weather
beer
but
not
one
thatll
have
you
running
back
for
too
many
more
than
one
very
well
done
a
pretty
hefty
beer
at
6
9
abv
for
the
style
a
very
interesting
and
flavorful
effort
by
magic
hat
this
is
one
that
ill
go
back
to
in
the
future
the
beer
pours
out
a
perfect
brown
color
with
a
good
amount
of
head
nice
aroma
and
taste
with
a
lot
of
complexity
lots
of
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
here
but
they
were
hard
for
me
to
pick
out
the
taste
is
definitely
smoky
but
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
beer
in
a
way
as
well
maybe
its
the
dry
aftertaste
it
leaves
in
your
mouth
despite
that
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
and
it
held
up
nicely
as
a
session
beer
for
me
that
night
this
beer
leaves
you
wondering
exactly
what
it
was
you
just
drank
oh
my
god
dont
drink
a
smoked
beer
without
first
knowing
its
a
smoked
beer
it
almost
made
me
throw
up
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
amber
a
finger
of
head
that
was
moderately
retained
smell
had
some
hops
malt
and
fruit
with
smokiness
around
the
edges
so
i
take
a
sip
oy
has
a
little
chewy
fruitiness
dominated
by
smokiness
balance
of
hops
and
malt
is
good
but
i
cant
get
past
this
supreme
smokiness
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
then
great
for
me
i
couldnt
get
past
14
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
quality
of
course
its
magic
hat
tried
hard
to
not
rate
it
from
my
likes
but
it
cost
the
beer
points
very
strange
beer
after
being
disappointed
with
my
first
magic
hat
offering
my
interest
is
rekindled
as
is
my
interest
in
another
bottle
body
is
just
barely
medium
with
a
smooth
texture
and
cfreamy
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
magic
hats
thin
sheet
of
almostcreamy
head
to
start
clear
deep
mahogany
hue
that
was
frankly
enchanting
focused
malt
crank
at
nose
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
raspberry
note
that
raised
a
nodding
eyebrow
holy
burnt
ochre
on
tongue
that
without
knowing
what
style
this
was
before
ordering
it
was
an
excellent
surprise
also
a
slight
hop
bunch
seemed
to
loop
around
as
well
pleasantly
drinkable
and
perhaps
more
so
for
me
as
i
generally
do
not
go
for
mh
offerings
drinkability
i
got
a
six
of
this
by
trade
and
while
i
wont
let
it
go
to
waste
this
will
not
be
my
beer
of
choice
from
the
fridge
a
rather
average
beer
wont
look
for
this
again
clarks
ale
house
in
syracuse
on
tap
a
scotch
style
with
significant
peat
full
of
flavour
without
the
smokiness
of
a
true
smoked
beer
more
like
a
smooth
single
malt
scotch
flavour
had
again
a
year
later
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
wasnt
as
good
i
sampled
this
one
years
ago
whilst
living
in
boston
and
despised
it
clearly
the
worst
brew
in
the
mh
family
i
though
at
the
time
and
have
avoided
it
since
until
now
its
certainly
better
than
i
remember
it
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
guess
maybe
i
just
dont
get
this
one
it
pours
a
very
nice
ruby
colour
with
a
farily
thin
head
that
leaves
virtually
no
residue
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
odd
somewhat
smokey
some
what
rubbery
somewhat
malty
but
totally
average
the
flavour
is
equally
perplexing
as
while
it
does
have
smoke
notes
to
it
that
are
pronounced
at
times
especially
at
the
start
of
the
brew
there
are
too
many
other
weird
flavours
thrown
into
the
mix
to
call
it
a
true
smoked
brew
i
think
like
with
the
smell
there
is
a
rubber
flavour
at
times
which
is
quite
out
of
place
i
picked
up
some
cooked
vegetable
flavouring
as
well
odd
but
it
works
for
the
most
part
i
guess
this
one
is
quite
simply
hard
to
pinpoint
its
too
scattered
for
me
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
but
theres
nothing
glaringl
wrong
with
it
try
it
for
a
change
of
pace
but
i
cant
imagine
myself
sampling
more
than
one
per
season
at
best
12
oz
bottle
best
before
122004
pours
a
clear
cola
brown
color
with
a
beige
shortlived
head
some
graininess
and
scorched
caramel
in
the
nose
pretty
subdued
is
this
a
smoked
beer
tastes
more
like
a
brown
ale
with
some
browned
apple
fruitiness
smokiness
is
very
minimal
but
plays
pretty
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
earthy
and
woody
with
some
tealike
tannins
that
balance
out
the
malt
rather
unique
brew
pretty
drinkable
im
a
little
surprised
the
abv
is
6
9
its
well
hidden
overall
its
a
pretty
nice
beer
smoked
in
the
medieval
sense
that
all
beer
used
to
be
boiled
via
a
wood
stoked
fire
hardly
any
smoke
in
the
nose
which
came
as
a
surprise
nose
is
weak
beer
is
good
happy
almost
smoky
beering
the
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
14
tan
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
barley
it
has
a
dry
yet
fruity
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
refreshingly
fruity
yeast
finish
it
seems
to
have
some
peated
malts
as
well
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
bitter
and
toasted
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
seasonal
it
has
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
this
is
a
well
balanced
nicely
flavored
beer
theres
a
background
taste
during
each
sip
that
reminds
me
of
lemon
tea
its
a
spice
that
im
having
a
hard
time
identifying
ive
got
to
get
me
some
more
of
this
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
in
my
mind
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
in
nyc
my
first
time
trying
this
seasonal
offering
from
magic
hat
dark
brown
orange
color
body
with
a
nice
looking
white
lacy
head
smokey
light
malt
aroma
taste
was
exceptional
smokey
whisky
flavor
pairs
with
the
light
hop
finish
well
i
was
impressed
with
this
brew
considering
im
not
one
of
magic
hats
biggest
fans
on
tap
at
the
btah
in
nyc
pours
a
nice
rich
almond
off
white
head
nose
of
malt
smoke
nuts
deeply
malty
and
flavorful
rich
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
this
was
sold
as
an
octoberfest
brew
on
steroids
so
there
seems
to
be
some
style
bending
going
on
here
smoke
notes
fairly
subtle
malt
caried
the
freight
here
tasty
seasional
creation
from
mh
im
always
happy
to
see
this
beer
hit
the
shelves
in
early
fall
jinx
was
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
cute
label
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
rich
clear
mahogany
color
and
was
adorned
with
an
offwhite
head
that
left
sticky
sheet
lacing
the
nose
was
quite
enticing
with
roasty
peat
smokey
developed
malts
and
a
zippy
citirc
hoppiness
the
taste
offered
delicous
smokeyroasty
oakywoody
malts
that
pleased
the
tastebuds
right
through
to
the
lightly
astringent
zippy
citric
finish
that
left
residual
citrussmoked
roasty
malty
flavors
the
body
was
appropriately
full
and
the
peppy
carbonation
worked
well
in
such
a
malty
beer
jinx
is
a
very
tasty
and
wellcrafted
beer
that
id
love
to
have
available
in
my
local
this
brew
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
mahogany
and
ruby
hues
a
light
fluffy
white
head
appears
about
an
18
inch
high
and
quickly
recedes
leaving
no
lace
whatsoever
aromas
are
initially
malty
and
smokey
with
an
almost
molasses
like
characteristic
for
flavor
this
brew
is
initially
very
malty
with
a
slight
carob
flavor
following
a
chimney
like
smokey
flavor
is
quite
present
and
adds
a
nice
flavor
to
the
brew
followed
by
an
almost
nutty
characteristic
which
added
to
an
even
more
complex
flavor
profile
there
is
also
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
creaminess
to
the
brew
which
adds
quite
a
nice
mouthfeel
finally
the
brew
finishes
just
slightly
hoppy
but
not
bitter
overall
this
brew
is
incredibly
complex
with
a
splendid
smoke
flavor
that
isnt
like
barbeque
but
more
like
a
burning
pile
of
wood
truly
a
great
beer
get
some
i
hope
you
agree
this
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
chestnut
color
with
offwhite
foam
that
settled
and
left
a
thin
coat
on
the
surface
the
smell
was
floral
and
fruity
hops
with
some
slightly
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
a
pleasant
aroma
but
no
smokiness
the
taste
was
dominated
by
fruity
floral
hops
up
front
and
then
caramel
maltiness
and
then
some
low
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
phenols
could
be
tasted
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
a
bit
warming
the
body
was
medium
with
low
carbonation
feel
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
the
smoke
was
not
really
detectable
knowing
that
this
was
a
smoked
beer
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
a
little
darker
than
it
is
but
nevertheless
its
a
good
beer
from
magic
hat
poured
out
a
copper
color
with
some
decent
enough
carbonation
decent
amount
of
caramel
aroma
in
there
some
fruit
pokes
in
there
as
well
with
a
light
smoke
aroma
very
nice
good
fruity
tastes
in
here
as
well
as
some
caramel
undertones
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
long
lasting
rye
bread
aftertaste
kicks
in
its
like
eating
a
whole
loaf
of
rye
bread
also
that
smokiness
mixes
in
with
it
very
complex
beer
but
in
a
good
way
quite
interesting
give
it
a
try
its
worth
it
this
beer
defines
the
color
amber
thick
delicious
yellowy
head
billows
from
the
top
smell
is
crisp
and
clean
taste
is
great
burnt
flavors
spice
flavors
malt
flavors
combine
yet
the
aftertaste
is
just
hoppy
and
burnt
thick
and
yummy
this
beer
is
an
unexpected
treat
never
had
a
smoked
beer
before
until
magic
hat
came
along
and
showed
me
whats
up
thanks
m
h
quite
a
nice
little
smoked
beer
this
probably
would
be
an
introduction
to
a
smoky
beer
gotta
love
magic
hat
and
i
may
well
have
this
one
again
hazy
copper
tinted
dark
amber
beer
topped
by
a
minimal
amount
of
off
white
head
peat
and
some
type
of
disinctive
hop
aroma
slightly
earthy
seems
much
like
some
brown
ales
ive
had
aromawise
northern
brewer
perle
i
dont
know
at
this
point
worries
about
similartes
to
bells
amber
andor
cottonwood
low
down
brown
are
surfacing
ahh
true
to
form
taste
is
dominated
by
a
woody
earthy
bitterness
that
reminds
me
of
eating
dirt
a
bit
of
smoky
peat
and
malt
sweetness
saves
it
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
and
grainy
drinkability
is
ok
i
just
cant
get
past
the
dominant
earthiness
every
once
in
a
while
i
find
a
beer
with
this
flavor
profile
the
previous
two
similarities
were
mentioned
above
time
to
start
investigating
this
beer
in
relation
to
the
otehr
two
to
make
sure
i
dont
make
something
like
this
its
a
solid
beer
i
just
dont
care
for
it
some
people
like
blondes
others
brunettes
well
i
like
the
latter
and
this
is
more
like
a
redhead
or
maybe
a
punk
chick
with
pink
hair
just
not
my
type
much
nicer
from
the
cask
the
subtle
flavors
seem
to
have
matured
somewhat
and
come
through
much
better
with
a
better
profile
to
the
hops
the
malt
works
much
better
with
the
low
carbonation
im
a
fan
this
is
a
dark
redbrown
brew
with
a
small
head
of
tan
foam
the
aromas
are
interesting
and
consist
of
a
weird
fruitiness
figs
as
well
as
some
dark
roasted
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
and
smoke
the
taste
picks
up
where
the
aroma
left
off
a
bit
of
a
smoky
taste
combined
with
weird
tasting
whisky
or
rye
malts
their
are
some
hops
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
long
and
smoky
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
which
makes
this
beer
an
easy
drinker
kind
of
like
a
malty
smoked
octoberfest
brew
and
one
of
the
best
fall
seasonals
to
pass
my
lips
this
year
the
taste
is
rather
pleasant
and
highly
malty
lots
of
dark
fig
cherry
and
plum
with
a
slight
astringency
doesnt
taste
as
smoky
as
the
smell
would
lead
you
to
believe
not
a
bad
brew
kind
of
like
a
soft
porter
that
took
a
weird
detour
and
mated
with
a
scotch
ale
all
around
a
very
good
beer
nice
dark
caramel
color
with
a
decent
lace
after
the
head
disappears
smell
is
malty
with
some
alcohol
presence
taste
was
sweet
with
a
dryness
on
the
finish
with
some
hop
presence
nice
touch
mouthfeel
was
substantial
with
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
consistency
a
good
touch
for
a
winter
brew
for
the
6
9
abv
very
drinkable
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
a
few
on
a
winters
evening
sounds
just
right
tastes
like
a
wee
heavy
to
me
or
maybe
a
wee
medium
as
the
body
is
not
quite
thick
enough
to
score
in
the
wee
heavy
range
anyhow
very
good
beer
very
enjoyable
i
would
drink
this
again
cheers
to
the
36lblovechild
for
the
bottle
hmm
what
a
shocker
to
sit
down
to
review
this
one
and
find
it
its
supposed
to
be
a
smoke
beer
i
think
they
forgot
to
put
some
in
the
keg
that
was
on
at
redbones
or
maybe
i
didnt
notice
it
because
i
was
at
redbones
all
that
smoked
meat
and
everything
anyway
the
pour
was
a
medium
dark
copper
color
this
is
what
i
think
is
so
funny
my
notes
say
clean
aroma
uhh
i
tasted
a
malty
base
no
smoke
detected
alas
with
a
flowery
hop
aroma
some
slight
astringency
in
the
finish
i
remember
i
was
out
with
a
few
fellow
bas
and
we
were
all
like
what
is
it
i
cant
believe
this
was
a
smoked
beer
i
found
this
an
average
beer
not
bad
not
outstanding
pat
the
jinx
was
on
cask
last
night
at
eli
cannons
for
the
magic
hat
tasting
a
nice
variation
poured
into
the
pint
glass
it
appears
at
first
to
be
nitrogenated
because
it
has
a
beatiful
cascade
effect
and
a
nice
thick
and
creamy
off
white
head
color
is
a
smoky
quartz
and
garnet
good
clarity
aroma
is
a
little
malty
and
sweet
a
little
buttery
with
just
a
little
bit
of
chutney
medium
to
light
bodied
and
incredibly
smooth
on
cask
taste
is
a
mix
of
lightly
smoked
malt
and
a
raisiny
sweetness
with
a
little
hop
tang
coming
in
the
end
to
blend
with
finishing
notes
of
alcohol
the
pronounced
yeast
flavor
of
some
mh
beers
is
not
evidenced
in
this
cask
beauty
pour
me
another
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
hue
topped
by
a
nice
sized
cream
colored
head
lacing
is
present
in
thin
sporadically
patterned
rings
smells
of
deep
roasted
malts
with
a
nut
characteristic
and
smokey
peated
malts
nice
and
robust
even
a
presence
of
hops
here
slightly
piney
nose
flavor
mildly
smoked
deep
woody
malts
a
slightly
chocolate
flavored
with
an
herbal
quality
about
it
tasty
and
quite
different
medium
bodied
smooth
light
carbonation
here
simple
drinkability
is
quite
effortless
i
could
drink
a
few
before
the
smoked
effect
would
ware
down
my
palate
nice
deep
burgandy
color
slight
off
white
head
lacing
is
sporadic
but
nice
aroma
has
a
nice
faint
sweetness
to
it
seems
like
bubblegum
esters
and
hard
candy
the
taste
follows
suit
with
more
of
the
same
sweet
character
but
unlike
the
nose
there
is
a
dose
of
smoke
flavor
added
to
the
flavor
ever
so
delicate
it
makes
its
presence
knows
and
integrates
into
the
flavor
profile
nicely
theres
a
bit
of
a
dryness
on
the
finish
that
has
me
going
back
for
more
nice
beer
here
again
i
have
had
teh
pleasure
of
enjoying
a
new
mh
brew
pours
a
deep
smoky
chocolate
color
with
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
an
mellow
aroma
wafts
a
moderate
peet
smokiness
with
a
caramel
background
a
smooth
body
supports
a
mellow
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
with
a
building
eclipsing
smoke
that
brows
right
through
the
finish
all
the
flavors
meld
well
to
present
a
great
not
overly
smoky
concoction
big
thanks
to
xgrigorix
for
the
sample
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
deep
amberbrown
color
and
was
topped
off
with
a
thin
white
head
this
is
weak
for
a
smoked
beer
but
holds
its
own
in
the
nose
theres
roasted
chestnuts
fermented
fruit
and
alcohol
the
flavor
holds
some
orange
liqueur
and
sweet
caramel
finishes
clean
and
dry
and
is
light
to
medium
bodied
a
flavorful
ale
but
not
in
the
same
category
as
some
other
german
rauchbiers
that
i
have
tried
not
bad
highly
drinkable
i
would
never
have
expected
to
like
this
beer
this
much
glad
i
tried
it
think
ill
pick
up
a
sixer
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
small
tan
head
that
quickly
becomes
just
a
ring
leaves
small
amounts
of
lacing
aroma
is
butter
cookies
earth
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
little
buttery
a
little
chocolate
and
a
but
of
hops
in
the
finish
mediumthin
bodied
very
tounguetingling
carbonation
if
there
was
smoke
there
it
was
very
much
in
the
background
ive
called
magic
hat
a
fruity
brewery
in
the
past
but
this
one
is
quite
an
achievement
an
excellent
autumn
beer
to
enjoy
the
end
of
baseball
season
the
start
of
hockey
season
according
to
the
brewerys
website
this
beer
uses
a
peatsmoked
whisky
malt
the
smoke
was
so
delicate
that
i
really
didnt
perceive
it
as
such
rather
it
registered
as
a
malty
slightly
chocolately
essence
woven
among
the
malt
this
beer
is
sort
of
a
classification
buster
at
first
it
struck
me
as
a
vienna
then
the
malt
kicked
in
sort
of
oktoberfest
the
malt
softened
and
seemed
more
scottish
and
finally
when
the
beer
was
fairly
warm
it
had
hints
of
english
brown
ale
a
beer
chameleon
also
according
to
the
website
abv
of
7
which
i
never
would
have
believed
a
very
mellow
beer
on
purpose
and
quite
well
made
deep
dark
red
in
color
with
an
off
white
to
light
tan
head
nice
lacing
im
quaffing
cherries
pepper
and
leafy
hops
taste
is
of
bitter
cherries
and
an
earthy
fall
leaves
complexity
in
the
hops
unrecognizable
spices
are
also
in
here
pepper
etc
and
there
is
cherry
candy
sweetness
present
as
well
im
not
detecting
much
smoke
here
though
at
all
ill
have
to
try
another
my
favorite
magic
hat
offering
thus
far
and
a
good
beer
to
celebrate
the
beginning
of
fall
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
had
medium
retention
the
aroma
was
kind
of
woodsy
oak
maybe
also
with
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
the
taste
had
no
indication
of
the
high
abv
it
was
slightly
smokey
not
much
though
along
with
a
balanced
hop
crispness
that
gave
a
relatively
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
to
get
settled
into
the
fall
season
with
complex
ale
very
good
for
those
cool
fall
nights
warms
you
a
bit
brown
with
a
s
light
reddish
tinge
thin
not
quite
white
head
a
smokey
smell
dominates
here
faint
hops
on
closer
inspection
some
nuttiness
and
maybe
sort
of
sweet
spice
pleasant
smoke
and
malt
up
front
then
some
well
balanced
hops
mellowing
into
some
chocolate
malt
flavors
with
that
spicey
like
cooking
spices
flavor
vaguely
apparent
once
again
hops
and
smokey
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
if
not
a
little
watery
for
the
style
overall
a
good
fall
seasonal
this
almost
got
much
lesser
scores
but
this
beer
really
got
better
once
it
sat
out
a
little
let
sit
5
min
or
so
before
drinkning
it
enhances
the
smell
and
taste
greatly
poured
with
a
superfine
off
white
collar
akin
to
whipped
cream
almost
the
head
settled
over
clear
redamber
brown
hightlighted
liquid
the
interesting
nose
gave
hints
of
caramel
roasted
maltiness
and
very
slight
but
noticeable
smokiness
the
taste
started
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
complex
blend
of
delicate
smoke
malt
and
background
hop
bitterness
with
lingering
peppery
spiciness
and
small
amounts
of
phenols
finishes
long
silkysmooth
and
superbly
balanced
with
no
hint
of
the
7
percent
alcohol
noticed
a
very
distinctive
ale
recommended
if
found
on
tap
at
the
brewery
1st
bottling
run
of
the
03
jinx
its
been
way
too
long
since
the
02
jinx
was
around
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
creamy
head
big
malt
flavor
with
a
spicy
smoked
touch
very
well
balanced
and
complex
very
smooth
this
is
my
favorite
of
magic
hats
regular
seasonal
brews
i
wish
it
were
available
all
the
time
i
cant
wait
until
the
bottles
start
showing
up
in
the
stores
in
a
few
weeks
finish
is
medium
long
with
a
sour
note
very
pleasant
unique
jinx
yeah
hughi
dont
know
this
beer
hold
true
to
its
name
it
is
truly
confusing
i
cant
identify
its
style
other
beyond
the
broad
ale
category
nor
does
magic
hat
describe
it
as
belonging
to
a
particular
genera
it
has
a
dark
caramel
color
and
a
small
white
head
smells
a
bit
sweet
the
taste
is
smoky
like
a
stout
but
gives
way
to
dryness
similar
to
a
an
english
bitter
kinda
strange
also
good
uniqueness
is
always
cool
another
excellent
ale
from
magic
hat
slightly
smokey
due
to
the
peat
smoked
malt
theres
also
some
wheat
malt
and
chocolate
in
the
recipe
which
all
make
for
a
unique
flavor
its
not
out
for
long
so
buy
it
when
you
can
my
wife
figured
out
the
logo
i
thought
it
was
a
funky
falling
leaf
but
she
informed
me
that
if
you
look
close
its
actually
three
overlapping
hearts
around
the
smiling
face
hazyamber
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
some
wipsy
lacing
floral
hop
aroma
with
some
herbal
hints
and
sweetness
and
hints
of
smoke
in
the
backround
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
sweet
malt
flavors
with
a
butter
cookie
characteristic
hops
balance
with
some
bitterness
and
herbal
notes
smoke
lies
in
the
backround
and
does
not
overtake
the
brew
but
adds
nice
complexity
highly
drinkable
and
almost
begs
to
be
finished
but
you
want
this
to
last
drinkability
notes
this
is
one
of
those
sip
and
savour
brews
as
the
complex
flavours
do
not
deter
the
palate
from
being
overwhelmed
yet
the
after
taste
is
neverending
pot
roast
with
sweet
potatoes
and
roasted
root
veggies
is
a
perfect
match
for
this
brew
great
amber
color
with
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
an
aroma
that
is
very
inviting
and
the
taste
that
leaves
you
asking
for
more
reddish
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
i
thought
the
brew
had
a
very
hoppy
smell
and
the
initial
taste
was
of
strong
hops
followed
by
a
mild
smoky
spiciness
quite
an
interesting
ale
another
delicious
magic
hat
beer
a
goodlooking
malty
beer
tastes
mildly
spiced
and
smoky
almost
like
a
beef
sate
from
a
good
chinese
restaurant
an
interesting
complex
beer
though
not
necessarily
one
that
ill
drink
a
lot
of
tried
this
one
on
tap
in
their
brewery
in
vt
loved
it
so
much
i
left
with
a
half
gallon
jug
of
it
filled
straight
from
the
tap
at
the
bar
notes
one
of
the
most
interesting
ales
brewed
in
new
england
if
not
in
the
us
o
a
wellcrafted
and
perfectly
balanced
malt
forward
ale
duck
rabbit
knows
how
to
knock
these
styles
out
of
the
park
i
was
inspitred
to
break
out
a
goblet
the
other
day
as
opposed
to
my
usual
shaker
pint
the
greater
surface
area
means
that
the
head
does
not
rise
as
high
but
i
still
got
a
finger
of
dense
lighttan
head
for
my
efforts
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
srm
22
27
allowing
for
little
light
penetration
nose
had
a
toffeelike
candy
sweetness
underlain
with
alcohol
heat
ah
an
8er
to
begin
the
day
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
and
i
felt
like
i
had
placed
a
dollop
of
cream
on
my
tongue
the
taste
was
quite
sweet
very
much
like
toffee
but
with
dried
dark
fruits
also
plus
the
heat
was
not
lost
on
me
phew
this
is
no
playing
around
as
i
watched
the
lacing
begin
to
form
a
ring
around
the
inside
of
the
goblet
i
was
given
pause
to
consider
the
prevalence
of
aipas
and
my
propensity
for
drinking
them
i
really
enjoy
their
bitter
citrusy
flavors
but
it
is
also
nice
to
partake
of
a
maltdriven
beer
on
occasion
the
finish
was
maltysweet
certainly
but
the
fusel
alcoholic
heat
on
the
extreme
finish
gave
it
a
breathtaking
dryness
my
my
my
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
like
the
most
traditional
of
scottish
wee
heavy
brews
kind
of
on
the
mellow
side
considering
the
8
abv
and
that
higher
abv
is
well
masked
the
feel
is
firm
with
a
nice
thickness
and
what
appears
to
be
a
low
carbonation
i
did
detect
a
slight
bite
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
which
could
have
been
the
8
pct
abv
or
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
a
light
brownish
body
with
good
head
and
lace
retention
the
nose
is
sturdy
and
strong
with
a
good
amount
of
both
sweetness
and
breadiness
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
booze
in
the
aroma
beer
isnt
exactly
chewey
but
it
is
a
filling
body
goes
down
smooth
slightly
creamy
and
there
is
good
balance
between
what
appears
to
be
sweet
malts
like
caramel
and
toffee
and
dark
fruits
and
some
heavier
roasted
malts
minor
hoppiness
on
end
adds
a
little
sharpness
to
finish
d
not
a
bad
scotch
here
really
similar
to
a
belgian
ale
to
me
if
there
was
a
little
bit
of
peat
in
here
it
would
set
it
apart
and
really
set
it
off
imo
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
that
enjoyed
some
retention
around
the
very
edges
of
the
glass
the
nose
includes
caramel
nuts
bread
and
an
odd
note
that
was
hard
to
place
this
offering
has
a
malty
sweetness
to
it
that
gives
way
to
a
chewy
bitterness
that
includes
a
trace
of
alcohol
this
is
a
pretty
decent
scotch
ale
a
bit
of
roast
and
light
bready
toasted
malt
with
mildly
sweet
almost
caramel
and
nutty
with
a
gentle
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
but
the
alcohol
comes
forward
slightly
in
the
flavor
as
it
warms
not
bad
which
might
be
expected
of
a
beer
8
or
higher
i
like
the
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
ale
not
one
i
would
want
more
than
1
snifter
of
however
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
drink
i
must
say
a
bit
on
the
candy
sweeter
side
even
for
a
wee
heavy
but
very
enjoyable
and
pleasant
to
drink
o
shit
along
with
bear
republics
heritage
ale
one
of
the
best
most
textbook
not
quite
the
word
i
was
looking
for
but
close
scotch
ales
from
an
american
brewery
very
well
done
overall
surprised
how
well
this
held
up
quite
a
nice
beer
with
great
dark
malts
sweet
flavors
fruits
etc
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
a
belgian
strong
aged
beer
at
this
point
with
the
flavor
profile
it
brings
which
is
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
good
full
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
level
rich
buttery
and
only
a
slight
bite
to
it
well
balanced
for
the
style
super
drinkable
you
could
easily
drink
this
faster
than
intended
but
its
a
nice
sipper
too
another
solid
example
of
what
duck
rabbit
is
doing
and
doing
right
o
never
had
a
wee
heavy
before
but
i
think
this
was
a
good
one
to
start
with
definitely
very
interested
in
the
style
now
and
want
to
try
more
o
a
nice
take
on
the
style
that
doesnt
follow
the
crowd
duck
rabbit
rarely
disappoints
overall
a
nice
sawh
that
i
scored
over
thanksgiving
happily
to
have
finally
enjoyed
some
beers
from
this
nc
brewery
i
liked
this
beer
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
a
pretty
good
rendition
of
the
style
o
a
bit
disappointing
duck
rabbit
wee
heavy
pours
a
clear
maroon
with
plentiful
cherry
highlights
maybe
two
fingers
of
khaki
colored
foam
forms
on
top
of
the
beer
head
retention
is
just
ok
but
lacing
is
left
stuck
to
the
glass
in
good
sized
chunks
the
nose
is
fairly
one
dimensional
but
whats
there
is
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
similarly
i
wish
the
flavor
profile
was
a
bit
more
varied
some
nutty
or
light
chocolaty
malty
notes
or
a
touch
of
fruity
esters
from
the
yeast
would
really
liven
things
up
but
its
all
caramel
and
brown
sugar
all
the
time
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
for
the
style
with
a
full
body
and
subtle
carbonation
duck
rabbits
wee
heavy
is
an
alright
beer
but
its
one
of
the
least
impressive
from
a
brewery
who
puts
out
a
lot
of
beers
that
i
enjoy
this
is
a
solid
flavorful
drinkable
beer
its
not
extremely
complex
but
it
is
to
style
in
my
opinion
its
worth
checking
out
somehow
that
tam
works
on
that
creature
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
garnetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
lightly
toasted
toffee
light
belgian
candi
sugar
and
an
underlying
suggestion
of
dark
earthy
spinachy
greens
the
taste
follows
suit
though
now
everything
comes
off
a
touch
sweeter
save
the
greens
which
now
come
off
fruiter
figgier
some
mild
maple
syrup
seems
to
bubble
up
in
some
spots
in
the
back
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
generally
creamy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
wee
heavy
though
one
that
just
pleasantly
satisfies
it
doesnt
really
impress
id
take
another
but
not
excitedly
another
real
winner
by
duck
rabbit
a
terribly
underrated
brewery
in
my
book
o
good
representation
of
the
style
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
sweet
and
boozy
so
not
a
real
easy
drinker
overall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
havent
had
a
beer
of
this
style
that
i
didnt
like
but
this
one
represents
well
super
sweet
and
a
bit
boozy
how
cant
you
like
this
thanks
to
mcnuts
for
this
extra
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
with
plenty
of
traditional
character
to
offer
the
senses
o
duck
rabbit
has
made
a
really
good
wee
heavy
here
highly
recommended
thanks
redliner8
o

5
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
cold
winter
months
very
sweet
and
slightly
warm
o
8
super
drinkable
and
tastes
amazing
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
o
the
alcohol
is
nice
the
malts
complex
some
aspects
of
the
beer
leave
a
little
to
be
desires
and
the
sweetness
isnt
kept
in
check
well
enough
fr
my
taste
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
but
could
use
some
tuning
the
overall
is
ive
had
better
wee
heavys
and
ive
had
much
better
duck
rabbit
beers
medicinal
notes
and
booziness
out
of
balance
and
throws
things
off
from
the
style
interesting
and
noteworthy
but
not
my
favorite
wee
heavy
ive
got
five
left
though
overall
very
nice
concoction
would
love
to
dig
into
an
amped
up
barrel
aged
version
o
yet
another
score
from
a
great
brewery
4
o
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
nonetheless
its
a
good
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
overall
a
good
beer
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
much
as
i
got
into
it
but
enjoyable
overall
this
wee
heavy
pours
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
yellowish
white
head
the
lacing
isnt
too
bad
all
together
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
earthy
and
sweet
the
malts
give
off
an
earthy
and
caramel
like
aroma
which
i
found
to
be
very
nice
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
dry
with
some
light
herbal
notes
the
mouthfeel
i
founf
to
be
pretty
smooth
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
the
brew
a
little
bite
overall
i
founf
this
to
be
an
above
average
scottish
ale
i
would
drink
it
again
a
cloudy
yellowish
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
offwhite
head
and
similarly
healthy
lacing
the
aroma
brings
tart
rhubarb
red
wine
and
near
chocolatypeat
malt
nice
the
flavor
says
bright
tart
lemon
rhubarb
with
a
juniper
malt
that
rolls
over
the
tongue
with
a
medium
body
and
slightly
viscous
feel
the
tart
dominates
but
mellows
nicely
offering
more
of
the
peaty
malt
as
it
warms
its
got
medium
drinkability
medium
body
and
plenty
of
tingly
carbonation
theres
an
unusual
clove
overtone
that
makes
this
pretty
unique
not
up
to
my
expectations
for
the
style
but
a
likeable
option
none
the
less
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
ewright
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
has
loads
of
dried
pit
fruit
apricot
date
and
fig
along
with
caramel
bread
and
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
more
of
the
breadiness
coming
through
initially
followed
by
the
fruit
full
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
finish
is
quite
smooth
with
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
this
is
a
shame
for
me
because
i
adore
the
dr
milk
stout
and
the
dr
amber
and
the
baltic
porter
oh
well
cant
win
em
all
o
a
good
example
of
style
malty
smooth
sweet
estery
fermentation
complex
and
veyr
good
a
bit
of
a
slow
drinker
somewhat
of
a
dessert
beer
for
me
cant
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
session
but
one
at
a
time
is
an
enjoyable
experience
overall
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
not
because
its
bad
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
i
think
i
got
this
one
from
bulbman
in
a
trade
cant
remember
anyway
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
lighter
in
color
than
most
wee
heavy
beers
i
have
had
this
was
not
brown
but
more
of
a
light
amber
color
smells
very
malty
and
then
the
taste
backs
it
up
malty
and
good
the
alcohol
was
very
well
concealed
so
i
had
no
trouble
polishing
this
one
off
in
a
short
amount
of
time
m
slightly
under
medium
bodied
syrupy
viscous
mouthfeel
is
good
fairly
heavy
bodied
and
sticky
not
quite
as
creamy
as
would
be
ideal
this
is
a
beer
to
be
consumed
sans
food
or
it
should
be
enjoyed
following
a
nice
dinner
md
somewhere
between
medium
bodied
and
heavy
somewhat
thick
and
syrupy
wee
heavies
in
general
are
a
bit
on
the
thicker
side
i
did
enjoy
this
one
the
sweetness
wasnt
too
cloying
but
a
bit
heavy
aftertaste
was
a
bit
bittery
and
tangy
solid
offering
for
the
style
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
from
dr
kind
of
follows
suit
with
others
ive
tried
from
them
good
but
not
great
this
one
definitely
had
some
good
potential
id
say
try
if
you
have
access
but
no
need
to
hunt
many
better
in
the
style
very
nice
example
of
some
of
the
classic
flavors
of
the
style
toffee
caramel
dark
fruit
but
with
a
slight
tang
at
the
finish
ideally
id
like
a
slightly
deeper
malt
toastiness
to
provide
a
base
flavor
for
the
rest
to
sit
on
top
of
but
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
finger
plus
head
of
creamy
foam
full
tan
color
with
a
light
orange
tint
dissolves
until
it
reaches
a
steady
thick
coating
across
the
surface
no
lack
of
sticky
grip
to
the
sheets
of
lacing
deep
amber

about
equally
red
and

the
high

its

the
sweetness

the

packed
into

out
into

peat

charcoal
dry
it
out
a
touch
more
it
wears
its
complexity
with
ease
and
comes
close
to
convincing
you
its
not
even
that
complex
for
its
burly
demeanor
good
drinkability
needs
a
heaping
of
beef
brisket
and
potatoes
the
taste
is
dark
fruit

with

brandy
and
sourdough
malts
flavor
is
silky
slightly
sweet
notes
of
toffee
and
smoked
malts
coming
through
in

of
fruity
notes
of
apple
raisin
and
fig
with
a
dry
slightly
warming
brandy
essence
on
the
swallow
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
solid
carbonation
and
a
lingering
bittersweet
fruity
finish
this
is
too
fruity
and
syrupy
for
my
tastes
especially
for
a
wee
heavy
scotch
ale
d
the
first
bottle
was
almost
definitely
oxidized
but
the
second
bottle
was
good
interestingly
both
looked
and
smelled
about
the
same
most
of
the
flavor
elements
were
similar
but
much
fresher
and
more
vibrant
in
the
second
bottle
the
body
had
the
biggest
difference
the
first
bottle
was
a
drain
pour
mostly
due
to
how
flat
it
was
totally
undrinkable
the
second
bottle
was
easy
enough
to
drink
with
decently
hidden
alcohol
but
ultimately
even
the
good
bottle
was
only
a
mediocre
wee
heavy
a
solid
scotch
ale
and
another
win
for
duck
rabbit
d
easily
consumed
even
at
8
0
alcohol
makes
for
a
pleasant
refreshment
or
accompaniment
for
food
d
a
little
too
sweet
even
for
me
and
a
little
bit
too
much
heat
from
this
one
very
smooth
and
not
something
i
would
ever
decline
definitely
has
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
but
a
little
disorganized
i
would
still
give
this
one
another
go
as
i
really
enjoy
scotchscottish
ales
but
may
do
a
tastetest
comparison
alongside
one
of
my
staples
next
time
just
to
get
to
see
if
this
is
still
a
beer
worth
keeping
around
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
ideal
to
sip
and
enjoy
slowly
at
the
end
of
the
evening
d
id
put
it
on
par
for
drinkability
with
a
good
winter
warmer
basically
im
saying
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
level
by
far
this
is
my
favorite
wee
heavy
i
like
dirty
bastard
and
skullsplitter
but
i
think
this
has
the
best
balance
of
all
three
there
is
sweet
savory
salty
and
fruity
aromas
that
the
other
two
lack
on
some
degree
might
have
to
do
some
bartering
but
anything
to
get
another
sixpack
or
two
is
definitely
fair
game
at
this
point
duckrabbit
you
are
in
the
winner
circle
d
oh
my
what
a
dangerous
beer
if
youre
not
careful
youll
have
the
six
pack
all
drank
up
without
realizing
it
then
youll
be
making
a
fool
of
yourself
there
isnt
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
and
after
the
first
taste
you
wont
want
to
stop
drinking
it
very
nice
scotch
ale
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
tried
duckrabbit
here
has
a
decent
take
on
the
style
too
rough
and
sharp
tasting
for
my
personal
preference
but
your
mileage
may
vary
this
is
the
third
duck
rabbit
ive
had
in
as
many
nights
and
im
very
pleased
with
the
experience
this
particular
brew
would
have
perfect
drinkability
if
the
abv
werent
so
high
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
really
liked
it
overall
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
scotch
ale
so
far
granted
i
havent
tried
many
and
none
from
outside
america
but
founders
dirty
bastard
is
the
only
wee
heavy
ive
tried
so
far
thats
better
than
this
one
d
there
is
a
light
alcohol
burn
as
this
warms
but
it
is
pretty
airtight
for
the
wee
heavy
style
good
representation
d
i
could
and
may
drink
this
whole
sixpack
tonight
but
it
doesnt
hurt
that
this
is
currently
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
very
good
example
a
bit
sweeter
than
dirty
bastard
which
is
my
current
favorite
but
it
goes
over
well
too
carbonated
and
more
importantly
way
too
fruity
for
me
to
each
their
own
though
about
the
only
one
from
their
lineup
i
havent
cared
for
and
ive
had
almost
every
one
d
its
an
unconventional
take
on
a
wee
heavy
but
an
enjoyable
brew
nonetheless
overall
i
like
but
dont
love
it
its
fairly
sweet
and
warming
but
theres
enough
counteracting
bready
maltiness
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
flavors
strike
me
as
slightly
muddled
i
think
im
secretly
wanting
a
little
more
berry
fruit
character
or
on
the
other
hand
more
of
a
peat
presence
sometimes
found
in
the
style
curious
to
try
it
with
a
little
age
this
was
a
very
nice
enjoyable
beer
another
fine
beverage
from
duck
rabbit
beautiful
color
dark
brown
color
with
a
smaller
head
to
it
smell
is
not
very
potent
but
you
can
smell
the
malt
this
scotch
ale
has
a
very
bold
flavor
with
its
malty
flavors
very
nicely
balanced
with
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
undertones
finishes
with
a
sweet
alcohol
kick
that
for
me
was
enjoyable
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
just
due
to
the
weight
but
it
sure
is
a
delicious
brew
id
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
one
and
order
at
least
one
more
it
makes
me
want
to
go
back
and
give
their
milk
stout
another
shot
as
a
scotch
ale
not
a
prime
example
but
as
an
amazingly
complex
wee
heavy
or
barleywine
or
real
ale
fantastic
brew
poured
into
a
snifter
color
is
a
very
dark
mahogany
with
a
tan
head
nose
brings
some
dark
fruits
caramel
brown
sugar
chocolate
molasses
and
some
slight
roast
the
taste
is
dark
fruits
and
boozesoaked
cherries
along
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
chocolate
good
heavy
feel
with
a
good
booze
presence
nice
when
fresh
and
i
laid
a
few
down
hoping
that
these
is
going
to
be
quite
nice
in
a
year
or
two
d
drinkability
is
low
just
almost
overbearingly
sweet
and
earthy
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
very
well
ill
continue
to
explore
the
style
and
this
brewery
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
drinkability
i
could
definitely
sip
on
this
beer
all
night
long
but
it
would
really
have
to
be
sipped
as
the
alcohol
would
certainly
catch
up
and
its
definitely
a
weighty
beer
great
flavors
and
scents
though
one
of
my
new
favorite
representations
of
the
style
and
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
anytime
im
in
duckrabbit
territory
pours
a
deep
murky
mahogany
brown
hue
with
a
light
beige
thicket
of
foamy
head

has
deep
fruit
notes
includig
raisin
brown
sugar
and
other
malt
driven
tones
going
on
flavor
has
apple
cider
tartness
with
deep
raisin
notes
and
alcohol
influenced
tones
what
a
complex
scottish
wee
heavy
again
sweet
dry
tartness
is
reminiscient
of
dry
apple
cider
big
malty
layers
leave
a
layer
of
dirty
dryness
like
apple
skins
compared
to
other
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
dry
astringent
layers
of
complexity
drinkability
for
me
provides
a
deafening
layer
of
wow
and
yes
i
can
deal
with
this
drinkability
is
incredible
definitely
glad
this
beer
is
complex
enough
in
detail
and
reputation
to
gain
some
appreciation
in
the
beeradvocate
realm
beers
of
this
stature
and
size
need
some
care
when
pouring
this
one
is
best
at
cellar
temperature
amazing
ale
here
enjoyable
and
drinkable
in
the
context
of
the
style
maltbomb
fanatics
should
flock
to
this
treat
nicely
carbonated
and
mediumbodied
it
does
sip
nicely
i
definitely
am
enjoying
this
and
wish
i
had
put
the
other
one
into
the
fridge
to
enjoy
after
this
one
dpretty
dry
for
a
scotch
and
the
hot
alcohol
notes
dont
help
the
drinkability
on
this
one
at
all
treacley
goodness
pours
a
translucent
ruby
brown
color
with
a
billowy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
cap
and
film
with
thick
webs
of
lacing
mild
yet
pleasant
aroma
of
dark
fruits
vanilla
figs
and
bready
malts
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
ripe
sweet
fruits
with
a
weaker
than
hoped
for
malt
presence
there
are
also
notes
of
caramel
coffee
and
smoke
in
the
body
thick
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
lingering
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
though
my
score
might
not
reflect
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
duck
rabbit
beers
and
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
wee
heavy
even
if
its
not
true
to
style
thanks
again
grant
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
burnt
toffee
scent
along
with
a
slight
peated
aroma
its
dry
with
some
caramel
warmth
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
dry
burnt
toffee
flavor
that
goes
down
slow
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
warmth
its
sweet
with
caramel
flavor
and
a
touch
of
peated
smoke
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
the
caramel
flavor
is
good
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
peated
malt
d
very
nice
example
of
a
style
i
dont
come
across
often
enough
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
pa
2
35
i
always
thought
that
if
id
get
this
it
would
be
in
the
south
but
here
i
am
in
eastern
pa
the
beer
is
clear
dark
reddish
copper
color
thick
frothy
tan
head
a
very
malty
and
boozy
aroma
some
dark
fruits
too
maybe
a
little
like
a
rum
cake
big
malt
flavors
figs
and
plums
caramel
and
a
taste
of
ethanol
in
the
aftertaste
so
boozy
feeling
that
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
good
tasting
and
relatively
balanced
for
the
malt
presence
in
it
a
very
good
scotch
ale
that
i
would
buy
again
if
i
drank
scotch
ales
that
often
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
dark
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
caramel
apple
taste
is
applebiscuit
and
caramel
malts
i
by
no
means
is
an
expert
but
i
dont
ever
remember
a
scotch
ale
that
taste
so
fruity
it
is
a
decent
beer
that
was
nice
to
try
oncebut
i
think
once
is
enough
d
this
is
a
rich
and
complex
beer
the
aroma
doesnt
pop
out
immediately
but
it
comes
to
life
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
rich
and
intense
with
a
great
malt
character
there
is
a
large
variety
of
cooked
sugar
characteristics
that
create
warmth
and
complexity
the
warming
alcohol
that
lasts
through
the
finish
isnt
necessarily
a
problem
for
this
style
though
it
eventually
becomes
a
bit
to
spicy
and
hurts
the
pleasant
smoothness
that
the
beer
otherwise
exhibits
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
helps
the
brewery
live
up
to
its
claim
of
being
the
dark
beer
specialists
drinkability
i
usually
find
strong
wee
heavies
too
sweet
to
go
beyond
a
few
bottles
although
i
havent
quite
made
it
a
third
bottle
i
am
confident
i
could
put
a
number
of
these
down
on
a
cold
night
pours
with
a
rich
auburn
red
head
that
holds
together
nicely
one
can
smell
the
scottish
peatness
in
the
flavor
mixing
with
other
earthy
and
somewhat
flowery
overtones
the
beer
tastes
well
without
the
overwhelming
smokiness
one
expects
from
the
peat
the
taste
does
not
linger
in
the
mouth
as
long
as
one
would
like
but
overall
a
good
introduction
for
those
unfamiliar
with
this
style
of
beer
d
one
of
my
favorite
duckrabbit
offerings
they
do
these
dark
malty
beers
very
well
and
this
one
matches
up
to
the
best
in
their
lineup
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
slow
sipper
but
one
i
could
enjoy
for
a
long
time
duckrabbit
wee
heavy
scotch
ale
is
ale
with
a
capital
a
nice
ruby
color
tons
of
bready
malt
character
hops
are
only
there
in
spirit
a
bit
dryer
than
others
ive
had
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
no
smokiness
some
raisins
and
brown
bread
flavors
give
way
to
a
slightly
mineralmetallic
finish
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
as
forward
as
other
examples
certainly
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
d
i
think
i
would
only
want
one
of
these
at
a
time
because
it
is
a
bit
bigger
and
sweet
md
the
feel
is
above
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
felt
but
enough
to
keep
this
beer
on
the
up
and
up
scotch
style
is
not
dead
in
the
water
there
is
some
slight
fizz
felt
with
a
sweet
coating
around
the
palate
the
taste
stays
with
you
for
a
bit
some
metallic
taste
coming
out
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
drink
on
this
is
nothing
great
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
and
the
taste
is
so
so
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
but
if
i
see
it
on
tap
i
may
change
my
mind
i
still
think
dr
is
a
good
brewery
perhaps
in
time
they
will
nail
certain
styles
down
taste
is
sharp
and
boozy
but
very
drinkable
with
some
really
solid
toastymaltiness
as
well
a
real
sweet
and
drinkable
wee
awesome
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
get
some
thick
film
sense
in
the
back
of
the
mouththroat
on
the
second
one
but
so
far
still
enjoyable
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
wee
heavy
drinkers
pretty
easy
drinking
very
creamy
and
full
in
the
mouthfeel
decent
sipper
havent
had
a
lot
from
this
brewery
but
what
ive
had
has
been
impressive
overall
a
nice
wee
heavy
ever
so
slightly
hot
but
it
is
8
0
abv
it
was
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
was
average
there
were
no
off
flavors
and
the
beer
was
well
balanced
especially
for
the
high
abv
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
people
the
beer
is
a
bright
reddish
brown
color
with
an
extremely
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
bourbon
caramel
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
with
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
hops
honestly
it
smells
a
lot
like
a
barley
wine
the
taste
has
lot
to
it
there
are
flavors
of
brown
sugar
caramel
and
vanilla
theres
a
mild
alcohol
sting
as
it
goes
down
if
the
label
didnt
read
wee
heavy
scotch
style
ale
thin

the
smell
is
sweet
leaving
hardly

a

hazelnut

and

the

is
loads
of
sticky

with
a
lackluster
mouthfeel

not
a
bad
brew
yet
again
from
the
great
duck
rabbit
brewery
this
beer
is
tasty
and
it
intrigues
you
drink
another
sip
this
is
absolute
a
sipper
to
be
savored

enjoyed
the
alcoholic

really
makes
you

this
on

of
those

some

flavors
also
show

a

nc
brew
that
im
proud
to
drink
every

but
its
pretty
suitable
for
the
flavour
profile
id
be
a
little
more
likely
to
do
more
of
these
if
the
abv
were
a
little
lower
with
tons
of
interesting
fruit
overtones
a
very
enjoyable
scotch
ale
not
sure
if
this
is
100
true
to
style
but
i
love
the
caramel
sweetness
and
the
warming

this

ale
and
being
a
style
im
not
a

of
thats

a

right
there
the

a
very
nice
offering
from

o
dang
good
beer
at
times
feels
like
an
american
stout
but
the
wood
notes
and
almost
peatlike
notes
give
it
a
scotchale
feel
the
aftertaste
is
as
good
as
the
taste
also
feels
a
bit
like
a
winter
warmer
but
thats
not
so
bad
its
keeping
in
the
uk
ale
family
right
its
both
sweet
and
noticeably
not
sweet
at
the
same
time
interesting
brew
excellent
straightforward
nice
sweetness
very
well
made
beer
o
nice
scotch
ale
maybe
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
would
have
again
for
sure
great
stuff
2015
is
better
than

not
many
top
tier
scottish

out
there
much

most
with

distinct
flavor
very
easy
drinking
great
beer
very
nice
scottish
ale
i
generally
find
rahr
products
to
have
more
bitter
hop
flavor
than
i
like
the
hops
in
this
one
are
very
nicely
balanced
by
the
heavy
malt
flavors
awesome
scotch
ale
pours
a
very
deep
amber
with
little
to
no
head
and
very
little
lacing
as
you
drink
it
the
aroma
is
that
of
sarsparilla
or
a
root
beer
smell
followed
by
an
definite
caramel
aroma
and
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
it
starts
off
like
a
childhood
memory
a
simple
glass
of
root
beer
on
a
summer
night
then
it
quickly
transitions
into
a
caramel
creaminess
again
with
the
hint
of
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
although
a
seemingly
medium
bodied
beer
is
quite
full
with
the
powerful
bubbles
lingering
on
the
tongue
for
quite
awhile
this
is
a
great
example
of
scotch
ale
many
thanks
to
kjkinsey
decent
beer
overall
impression
a
sipping
scotch
ale
that
is
firmly
bitter
i
was
surprised
at
the
bitterness
due
to
prior
reviews
i
read
maybe
i
had
a
fresh
sample
i
would
decrease
the
carbonation
and
decrease
the
fusels
to
allow
the
rich
malt
character
to
shine
enjoyable
but
probably
needs
some
age
on
it
in
my
humble
opinion
this
is
not
the
best
example
of
a
scottish
style
ale
that
said
its
a
fine
beer
it
really
does
grow
on
you
over
time
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
which
seemed
overpowering
at
first
begins
to
subside
and
mellow
out
after
a
few
sips
andor
pints
its
not
for
everyone
of
course
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
want
a
better
albeit
stronger
example
of
the
style
try
old
chub
but
if
you
want
a
nice
easysipping
scottish
style
beer
and
you
dont
mind
some
sweetness
give
this
a
go
cheers
its
an
excellent
scotch
ale
this
beers
alright
it
was
a
throw
in
so
i
cant
complain
bit
it
doesnt
make
sense
how
this
has
a
higher
rating
than
banhofs
berliner
weisse
per
say
i
know
its
different
styles
but
for
a
wee
heavy
this
is
pretty
damn
bland
and
that
other
beer
is
sour
and
salty
as
shit
and
has
a
lower
rating
mind
control
think
of
just
this
beer
on
its
own
still
a
meh
example
on
the
style
serving
type
bottle
pours
with
a
very
dark
brown
color
almost
black
it
has
a
little
clarity
but
hardly
noticeable
unless
you
hold
it
up
to
a
light
it
smells
malty
and
chocolatey
but
is
light
to
the
nose
i
enjoyed
the
lightness
to
this
beer
it
has
aromas
of
a
stout
but
is
a
smooth
more
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
cant
wait
for
their
next
seasonal
really
enjoyable
beer
i
like
how
smooth
and
rich
it
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
o
decent
i
need
to
try
this
again
except
not
on
tap
im
thinking
it
may
be
better
from
a
bottle
really
enjoy
the
chocolate
malt
going
on
great
scotch
ale
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
ogreat
beer
i
see
why
it
won
a
medal
at
the
gabf
overall
a
decent
brew
but
not
my
favorite
selection
from
rahr
malty
and
fairly
rich
just
a
touch
of
smokiness
and
a
little
butterscotch
on
the
dry
side
almost
like
a
belgian
beer
after
the
malty
start
dark
roasted
malt
with
some
charred
grain
and
burnt
sugar
slightly
woody
with
a
hint
of
grape
leaf
tannins
quite
tasty
overall
i
like
the
restrained
sweetness
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
texas
wine
in
fredericksburg
o
a
solid
scotch
ale
for
sure
without
being
too
overly
sweet
or
cloying
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
taupe
colored
head
nice
aroma
of
milk
chocolate
liqueur
the
moutfheel
is
not
adequate
for
the
style
not
watery
but
not
all
the
way
creamy
either
the
flavors
are
nice
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
some
christmas
pull
candy
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
not
true
to
style
but
good
nonetheless
i
have
now
had
the
regular
beer
from
a
bottle
and
it
stands
tall
with
the
cask
version
a
very
very
good
beer
o
definitely
good
its
interesting
to
taste
this
side
by
side
with
an
old
chub
this
one
is
more
nutty
and
has
the
bite
in
the
finish
o
i
believe
this
is
truly
one
of
if
not
my
first
beer
in
the
scottishstyle
ale
category
wish
i
had
some
background
to
compare
it
against
however
that
being
said
this
is
a
good
beer
i
could
see
it
be
a
steady
go
to
for
a
little
while
during
the
late
winterearly
spring
overall
an
award
winning
beer
from
rahr
o
when
someone
told
me
that
rs
won
the
gabf
for
this
scotch
ale
i
wasnt
surprised
after
first
trying
this
beer
months
ago
i
touted
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
wee
heavys
the
state
of
texas
has
to
offer
dont
worry
real
ale
youre
way
up
there
too
this
beer
will
likely
be
peddled
as
rs
showy
beer
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
from
trying
their
other
staples
rs
has
exciting
stuff
to
offer
making
a
great
name
for
forth
worth
in
the
craft
beer
world
overall
tasty
and
not
overdone
some
brewers
dial
up
the
smoky
flavor
in
their
scotch
ales
and
the
result
is
a
beer
that
tastes
like
caramelcoated
bacon
iron
thistle
is
not
one
of
those
beers
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
smokier
than
i
expected
strong
throughout
a
decent
finish
a
little
malty
strong
but
probably
not
a
repeat
with
me
poured
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
with
only
a
small
head
has
a
floral
pine
smell
not
too
faint
but
not
strong
there
is
a
nice
toasted
malt
and
caramelized
flavor
with
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
we
havent
had
many
scottish
ales
but
we
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
definitely
try
others
o
as
a
lover
of
the
wee
heavyscotch
ale
style
i
was
missing
the
peat
smokiness
and
hint
of
scotch
im
used
to
if
not
for
those
expectations
i
wouldve
enjoyed
this
more
above
average
and
worth
a
try
overall
i
hate
to
do
it
but
ive
got
to
dock
this
one
points
for
style
even
if
the
style
originated
as
general
indicator
of
alcohol
content
its
scottish
seeming
for
sure
and
packs
an
alcohol
punch
that
you
dont
feel
coming
but
it
falls
a
bit
short
in
the
complex
malty
flavor
department
still
pretty
darn
good
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
specimens
of
the
furtheryetnorth
atlantic
style
ive
had
despite
this
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
unless
i
wanted
a
buzz
or
was
trying
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
o
as
long
as
youre
not
adhering
strictly
to
the
style
guidelines
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
some
writers
have
put
paid
to
the
idea
that
scottish
beers
are
sweeter
and
less
hopped
than
english
beers
and
this
is
one
that
helps
to
crush
that
myth
the
sweetness
is
nicely
held
in
check
and
theres
a
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
finish
another
rahr
beer
thats
damn
good
and
another
scotch
ale
that
i
really
like
rahr
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
texas
breweries
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
in
a
style
i
usually
dont
gravitate
to
lots
of
flavor
and
drinks
easier
than
expected
o
its
good
not
great
like
a
lot
of
rahr
beers
id
certainly
drink
it
again
and
even
buy
a
six
pack
but
it
wont
overwhelm
you
serving
type
bottle
o
i
cant
believe
the
ratings
arent
higher
on
this
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
tastes
great
looks
and
smells
great
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
rahr
has
ever
put
on
the
market
and
i
am
glad
that
i
can
find
it
anywhere
iron
thistle
is
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
certainly
worth
a
shot
if
you
happen
across
it
now
back
to
the
house
chores
for
the
most
part
this
is
enjoyable
a
little
disappointed
this
being
my
favorite
style
to
much
buttery
diacetyl
and
a
metallic
flavor
is
the
down
fall
though
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
and
has
a
small
amount
of
tan
colored
head
perched
above
this
scotch
ale
is
all
malt
in
a
wonderful
way
my
nose
picks
up
gobs
of
caramel
a
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
a
dab
of
vanilla
nice
sweet
maltiness
here
the
taste
follows
through
and
adds
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
and
a
quick
waft
of
smoke
the
body
is
medium
and
is
laced
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
i
was
happy
with
this
interpretation
smooth
mellow
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
i
would
have
another
were
it
available
to
me
d
this
is
a
delicious
wee
heavy
full
flavored
yet
goes
down
really
easy
it
basically
has
one
flavor
but
its
one
hell
of
a
flavor
drink
is
good
doesnt
quite
drink
like
8
but
has
a
touch
of
booze
creamy
a
nice
dry
finish
smooth
and
drinkable
d
pretty
drinkable
not
really
noticing
the
abv
this
was
a
nice
surprise
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
brewery
drink
ability
is
good
feel
aside
its
a
right
tasty
wee
heavy
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
winter
beer
dont
think
i
could
drink
very
many
though
d
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
dangerously
so
considering
the
abv
there
is
some
room
for
improvement
but
rahr
has
produced
a
very
good
beer
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
i
ordered
a
shiner
ontap
and
the
bartender
asked
if
id
ever
tried
rahr
i
said
no
and
he
let
me
sample
several
my
favorite
was
iron
thistle
went
to
the
brewery
in
fort
worth
yesterday
for
their
saturday
tasting
and
confirmed
that
its
my
favorite
in
act
they
didnt
put
it
out
until
30
minutes
before
closing
because
thats
what
everyone
wants
and
they
run
out
d
quite
drinkable
despite
high
abv
solid
effort
by
rahr
overall
a
good
beer
would
like
a
little
more
of
a
smoky
character
but
certainly
would
have
this
again
d
dangerous
im
taking
large
pulls
and
enjoying
them
a
gentle
giant
this
one
easy
laid
back
smooth
talker
solid
work
rahr
malty
and
smooth
with
a
bit
more
roast
than
most
scotch
ales
more
chocolate
as
well
peat
is
on
the
low
end
and
does
not
display
a
whole
lot
of
smoky
flavor
hops
and
a
touch
of
burnt
toast
contribute
a
much
needed
bitter
kick
on
the
finish
abv
seems
nowhere
near
8
pretty
damn
drinkable
i
must
say
this
might
be
my
second
favorite
rahr
beer
behind
the
winter
warmer
pretty
tasty
beverage
here
d
eh
not
my
favorite
rahr
beer
thanks
to
a
jjfoodie
for
this
texas
extra
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
moderate
caramel
colored
head
aromas
of
chocolate
smoke
and
thick
chewy
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
anticipated
but
still
malty
and
chocolatey
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
and
fairly
tasty
thanks
ericandersnavy
for
the
oppportunity
d
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
its
surprisingly
drinkable
for
8
with
no
hints
of
alcohol
whatsoever
definitely
worth
a
try
d
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
style
but
if
this
was
available
here
id
get
more
of
it
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
formed
a
14
beige
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
brown
brew
head
is
quickly
down
to
a
small
layer
of
bubbles
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
but
then
a
tinge
of
sour
taste
starts
malty
a
touch
leathery
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
a
slight
tartness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
bad
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
almost
creamy
and
not
as
full
bodied
as
i
would
like
while
it
isnt
watery
it
is
slightly
thin
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
a
known
fresh
version
to
compare
thanks

d
a
great
scotch
ale
the
alcohol
level
is
held
in
check
and
the
flavors
are
really
nice
a
surprisingly
great
seasonal
from
rahr
the
beer
seems
a
little
thin
to
be
a
wee
heavy
but
its
a
pleasant
drinkable
beer
not
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
but
an
accessible
example
drinkability
without
a
doubt
the
best
six
pack
offering
from
rahr
in
my
opinion
well
masked
high
session
abv
and
an
awesome
unique
flavor
i
will
most
definately
be
picking
this
one
up
again
pours
with
a
very
dark
brown
color
almost
black
it
has
a
little
clarity
but
hardly
noticeable
unless
you
hold
it
up
to
a
light
it
smells
malty
and
chocolatey
but
is
light
to
the
nose
i
enjoyed
the
lightness
to
this
beer
it
has
aromas
of
a
stout
but
is
a
smooth
more
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
cant
wait
for
their
next
seasonal
d
overall
a
very
solid
beer
certainly
worth
trying
tasty
beer
to
say
the
least
always
glad
to
support
the
local
boys
poured
into
a
pint
glass
black
with
what
seemed
to
be
very
little
carbonation
creating
nearly
no
head
what
so
ever
ive
poured
three
of
these
with
the
same
results
the
scent
is
rather
strong
for
a
rahr
which
is
strong
of
sweet
malts
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
a
sweet
front
that
mellows
out
to
a
bitter
hop
taste
the
aftertaste
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
good
either
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
which
is
par
for
rahr
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
rahr
but
that
doesnt
make
it
a
very
good
beer
rahr
is
starting
to
make
some
really
nice
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
glad
to
see
they
will
be
releasing
this
as
a
seasonal
from
january
through
february
every
year
i
had
this
on
cask
at
the
plano
gingerman
and
it
was
good
but
from
the
bottle
is
much
better
cask
beers
seem
to
just
taste
creamy
and
not
allow
you
to
experience
all
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
definitely
recommended
not
a
lot
of
head
to
this
one
but
great
cascading
effect
as
the
glass
tilts
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
beige
head
there
is
a
sour
malt
smell
tastes
like
a
caramel
plum
tea
with
a
squeeze
of
lemon
the
mouthfeel
is
wellbalanced
and
rounded
between
carbonation
thickness
and
smoothness
i
dont
like
drinking
this
beer
too
much
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
if
i
wanted
had
it
again
1
week
later
surprisingly
more
of
a
coffee
stout
flavor
i
continue
to
be
surprised
by
this
beer
smell
category
bumped
a
score
higher
had
on
tap
at
the
brewery
during
july
2009
pours
a
darker
brown
with
a
creamy
head
smells
of
malt
with
a
little
smoke
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
some
peat
and
smoke
this
is
not
a
very
heavy
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
for
a
scotch
ale
this
is
the
only
time
i
ever
saw
this
beer
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
became
a
seasonal
or
yearround
offering
fresh
off
winning
the
15th
annual
us
beer
tasting
championships
national
grand
champion
award
sampled
at
the
flying
saucer
in
fw
from
its
victory
lap
brewing
it
is
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
white
creamy
head
the
smell
is
coffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
is
strong
malt
slight
roasted
bitterness
lemons
carob
and
a
smoky
finish
it
is
mellower
than
many
scotch
ales
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
wth
nice
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
smoky
to
settle
into
an
afternoon
of
them
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
had
maybe
the
best
