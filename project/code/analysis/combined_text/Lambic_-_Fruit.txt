cheers
this
might
be
the
tartest
most
acidic
beer
ive
ever
had
typical
upland
sour
my
wife
and
i
split
the
bottle
as
we
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
felt
like
our
mouths
were
blistering
was
crazy
excited
after
the
pour
which
was
beautiful
thinking
the
color
suggested
some
serious
fruit
flavors
but
theyre
just
not
forward
enough
its
a
very
good
lambic
with
a
hint
of
blackberry
bottled
51514
from
trade
poured
on
113014
pours
beautiful
deep
reddish
purple
with
a
pink
fizzy
head
in
my
cantillon
glass
awesome
aroma
of
big
lush
blackberry
lots
of
vinegar
and
funk
oak
sour
flavor
is
big
fruity
blackberries
sharp
sourness
some
vinegar
notes
oak
dry
but
not
super
dry
definite
jamminess
here
light
to
medium
bodied
spritzy
carbonation
juicy
berries
yet
dry
finish
whoah
this
is
really
excellent
have
heard
it
is
overly
sour
but
im
not
getting
that
at
all
this
is
just
right
and
on
par
with
some
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
including
fruited
cantillon
how
this
isnt
higher
rate
is
beyond
me
incredible
nose
wonderful
extreme
tartness
this
is
like
blackberry
atrial
rubicite
split
amongst
family
to
celebrate
the
birth
of
my
sisters
first
child
nice
blackberry
notes
but
like
previous
uplandic
experiences
the
vinegar
and
sour
serve
to
minimize
rather
than
compliment
the
fruit
the
taste
of
this
wild
ale
is
acidic
at
first
with
juicy
and
tangy
fruit
flavor
of
the
berry
with
a
mild
spicelike
flavor
and
woody
almost
balsamic
taste
of
acidity
and
woody
tannin
with
a
very
dry
yeast
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
i
think
this
is
a
wonderful
american
wild
ale
with
blackberry
not
extremely
sour
and
very
drinkable
with
a
lot
of
fruit
flavor
california
overall
its
good
but
not
great
and
its
only
good
if
you
like
sourness
to
overpower
the
fruit
and
funk
that
should
be
present
in
spades
in
any
lambic
this
is
the
last
upland
sour
im
going
after
and
i
really
cant
recommend
trying
more
than
a
few
sour
reserve
is
the
only
one
id
recommend
going
for
really
mouth
med
to
a
little
lighter
bod
nice
carb
tart
little
flemmy
and
acidic
too
wild
and
unbalanced
uses
belgian
yeast
but
doesnt
match
typical
belgian
quality
great
flavors
but
the
tartness
is
overpowering
really
lovely
pinkmagenta
color
with
lots
of
white
headbubbles
the
smell
jumped
out
of
the
bottle
immediately
it
was
a
yogurtfunk
mix
that
was
pretty
overpowering
the
taste
was
described
as
sour
patch
kid
meets
shock
tart
not
a
lactic
sour
like
the
nose
led
you
to
believe
it
is
an
intense
puckering
sour
that
isnt
for
folks
who
get
indigestion
the
mouthfeel
was
very
effervescent
and
quite
nice
overall
i
want
more
fruit
flavor
for
the
price
point
and
the
hunt
the
extreme
tartness
mellowed
a
bit
as
the
day
went
on
but
it
just
wasnt
a
top
notch
sour
for
me
o
this
is
the
perfect
level
of
sournesstartness
for
my
tastes
not
nearly
as
sour
as
the
kiwi
but
just
enough
the
blackberry
isnt
overly
distinguishable
but
its
clear
that
this
is
a
fruited
sour
very
nice
pours
a
reddish
clear
with
white
ring
of
head
smell
is
straight
vinegar
and
acid
with
notes
of
berry
mixed
in
pungent
notes
of
earth
and
berry
are
present
along
side
the
sourness
the
taste
is
enamel
removing
sour
with
dashes
of
berry
which
seem
to
add
to
the
overall
acidic
notes
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
with
and
effervescent
feel
overall
this
is
one
fine
sour
it
lacks
the
restraint
and
the
delicate
showing
that
vsb
so
excellently
does
but
it
does
deliver
in
the
face

another
fruit
lambic
hit
from
upland
ive
yet
to
find
one
i
didnt
enjoy
fantastic
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
american
sours
terrific
finally
got
to
try
one
of
the
highly
regarded
upland
lambics
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
was
an
older
vintage
2006
and
there
was
still
so
much
more
development
that
could
occur
great
lambic
decanted
into
a
properglassware
upland
goblettulip
bubbles
rose
to
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
and
some
of
the
beer
started
to
seep
out
but
id
hardly
call
this
a
gusher
poured
a
dark
purplishbrown
color
lively
carbonation
with
about
an
inch
of
rocky
offwhite
head
loaded
with
chunky
bits
of
blackberry
all
right
sour
fruits
in
the
nose
blackberry
apple
a
little
acetic
and
lactic
the
first
thing
that
jumped
out
at
me
was
the
carbonation
it
seemed
way
too
high
and
almost
made
this
more
sodalike
than
beerlike
blackberry
was
the
main
player
in
the
flavor
department
as
would
be
guessed
tart
and
tangy
though
not
overly
puckering
lactic
drying
onedimensional
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
this
particular
beer
not
a
complaint
just
an
observation
mouthfeel
was
light
and
spritzy
and
i
feel
it
lost
a
bit
by
being
too
carbonated
but
overall
that
was
just
a
minor
setback
it
was
a
nice
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
omore
tart
than
sour
the
blackberries
are
perfect
they
provide
great
flavor
without
making
the
beer
too
sweet
o
a
tough
flavor
to
impart
but
this
was
delicious
probably
best
not
to
age
this
one
as
long
as
i
think
it
would
have
been
much
better
when
the
fruit
was
brighter
poured
into
the
sampler
glass
from
the
bottle
the
beer
was
a
ruby
reddish
hue
with
a
nice
tinted
white
head
the
aroma
smelled
of
sour
fruits
with
a
variety
of
berry
notes
observable
in
the
initial
taste
one
notes
this
is
incredibly
sour
while
i
was
able
to
enjoy
it
i
almost
thought
it
was
too
sour
as
it
moves
to
the
aftertaste
it
becomes
progressively
more
tart
and
acidic
i
had
difficulty
appreciating
blackberries
since
i
believe
them
to
be
sweeter
than
they
are
here
the
aftertaste
further
displays
quite
a
bit
of
natural
seedy
blackberry
flavor
it
is
easy
to
tell
his
is
made
with
real
berries
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
mild
level
of
carbonation
that
visually
seems
missing
but
is
felt
tingly
enough
in
the
mouth
to
keep
it
lively
feeling
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinking
brew
with
seemingly
no
alcohol
impact
however
the
acidic
nature
started
to
get
to
me
and
i
could
not
see
myself
drinking
a
significant
amount
of
this
by
myself
this
is
one
to
be
shared
much
appreciation
for
the
share
heath
glad
to
get
to
try
it
definitely
one
of
the
better
fruited
lambics
i
put
it
only
behind
kiwi
slightly
better
when
fresh
although
a
lot
of
that
jammy
goodness
was
still
here
vinegar
has
started
to
take
over
a
bit
more
now
i
loved
the
sourness
in
the
flavor
although
drinkability
is
a
bit
low
i
was
reaching
for
the
tums
after
splitting
a
bottle
as
my
stomach
was
not
agreeing
with
my
taste
buds
about
the
deliciousness
of
this
even
though
its
not
as
flavorfully
complex
as
many
of
the
standard
belgian
examples
upland
still
does
better
than
a
standup
job
with
this
beer
excellent
representation
of
the
fruit
and
the
funk
and
with
a
commanding
tartness
that
never
goes
overthetop
cheers
o
solid
lambic
that
is
more
tart
and
vinegary
than
fruity
this
is
a
good
one
but
nothing
great
however
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
ahold
of
one
i
do
wish
it
was
a
bit
fruiter
instead
of
so
much
overpowering
vinegar
since
its
a
fruit
lambic
not
my
favorite
upland
lambic
but
certainly
a
beer
i
loved
they
knock
it
out
of
the
park
each
time
but
id
take
peach
or
raspberry
over
this
4
5
o
i
like
this
but
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
not
a
beginners
sour
beer
as
it
warms
the
acidity
diminishes
somewhat
which
allows
the
sweetness
to
come
through
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
overall
a
very
good
lambic
but
by
no
means
the
best
from
upland
or
anywhere
close
to
the
best
berry
fruited
one
upland
seems
to
do
a
much
better
job
with
their
lighter
fruited
lambics
than
the
darker
berried
ones
from
my
experience
this
batch
is
light
effervescent
and
allaround
excellent
very
glad
i
have
a
second
bottle
stashed
away
well
worth
the
cost
and
i
cant
wait
for
upland
to
have
the
devoted
sour
space
up
and
running
soon
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
dark
blue
color
lambic
with
a
large

color
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
strong
blackberry
notes
with
some
light
funky
notes
and
some
tart
notes
also
discernable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
tart
blackberry
notes
with
some
notes
funky
barnyard
notes
and
a
sour
finish
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
great
carbonation
this
one
is
well
balance
with
great
notes
of
blackberry
this
is
one
brewery
that
i
never
know
what
to
expect
but
in
this
particular
case
it
is
a
real
winner
easy
to
drink
with
huge
amount
of
complexity
dark
purple
with
a
decent
amount
of
lavender
head
full
on
black
berries
good
amount
of
tart
lactic
sour
flavor
is
delicious
sweet
and
sour
black
berries
just
a
touch
of
funk
lively
carbonation
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
it
was
a
turning
point
for
the
upland
lambic
series
in
my
eyes
one
of
there
best
efforts
taste
is
all
berries
and
tart
but
its
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
mouhfewl
is
really
creamy
and
mellow
with
a
crisp
fruity
finish
overall
trying
more
and
more
sours
lately
upland
is
really
awesome
i
enjoy
this
sour
beer
because
its
a
great
blend
of
sour
funkiness
and
fruity
flavors
i
have
tried
this
beer
on
2
seperate
occasions
and
continue
to
enjoy
it
upland
does
a
top
notch
job
on
this
beer
style
for
sure
do
very
nice
great
introduction
to
upland
lambics
would
loveto
try
the
other
variations
to
compare
thanks

d
another
solid
addition
to
the
lambic
lineup
good
overall
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
area
interesting
note
i
change
some
of
the
scores
after
my
second
glass
for
whatever
reason
the
second
glass
was
much
better
d
i
always
enjoy
winey
spritzy
lambics
and
saisons
this
was
great
but
i
doubt
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
drink
another
beer
i
was
very
glad
to
try
at
cf6
this
was
nice
new
taste
and
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
tart
i
would
love
to
try
more
of
the
varieties
d
easily
my
favorite
of
the
uplands
i
have
had
thus
far
sour
yet
a
nice
fruit
profile
too
this
bottle
did
not
last
long
at
all
the
fruit
is
very
prominent
in
this
upland
offering
and
although
simple
it
packs
a
big
flavorful
punch
a
solid
and
very
unique
take
on
the
lambic
style
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
a
gusher
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
ruby
red
with
a
half
finger
pinkish
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
blackberry
slight
sour
and
slight
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
blackberry
bitter
blackberry
seeds
and
slight
sour
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
quite
good
to
say
the
least
the
flavor
really
only
had
one
flaw
in
that
the
blackberry
seed
flavor
was
very
apparent
throughout
and
left
a
bitter
taste
on
your
palate
after
each
sip
while
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
still
not
pleasurable
definitely
worth
trying
given
the
chance
the
aroma
of
berry
funk
with
a
hint
of
crust
that
smells
delicious
the
appearance
is
rich
pinot
wine
color
with
a
white
head
and
tons
of
berry
sediment
floating
on
top
flavors
of
sour
funk
berry
lambic
on
a
bubbly
smooth
body
with
tart
smoothness
to
end
an
american
lambic
and
a
new
classic
silverxs
bottle
grape
coloured
body
with
a
great
foamy
pinkish
head
tart
a
little
acidic
funky
great
drinkability
aboe
average
mouthfeel
as
lots
of
real
blackberry
sediment
in
here
seeds
in
my
glass
a
power
shake
lunch
a
great
bottle
to
share
o
i
actually
liked
this
one
a
bit
blackberry
flavor
is
good
and
its
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
mind
another
bottle
or
two
o
a
solid
refreshing
lambic
but
needs
more
sourtart
notes
very
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
earthshattering
about
this
beer
decent
but
not
the
best
work
theyve
done
would
be
better
if
it
was
a
little
more
bretty
and
had
that
barnyard
funk
to
it
currently
tart
fruit
dominant
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
might
be
drinking
a
tad
too
sweet
right
now
but
a
little
age
would
do
it
good
overall
a
good
attempt
at
a
traditional
lambic
but
i
feel
like
it
was
lacking
in
aroma
and
funk
but
still
a
good
beer
i
say
drink
it
fresh
because
the
fruit
flavors
are
just
going
to
fade
which
are
the
focus
of
this
beer
o
excellent
flavor
with
great
incorporation
of
the
blackberries
very
good
offering
from
uplands
the
beer
is
a
plum
shade
of
purple
with
a
pink
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
very
little
lacing
behind
the
aroma
brings
a
delightful
funk
and
a
almost
reminiscent
of
blackberry
pie
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
compared
to
other
upland
lambics
ive
had
its
got
a
perfectly
balanced
fresh
not
ripe
enough
blackberry
tartness
not
overly
tart
slight
sweetness
just
like
a
sour
blackberry
pie
in
liquid
form
mouth
feel
and
finish
are
refreshing
light
watery
syrup
bottle
exploded
when
opened
lost
a
good
amount
to
the
ground
enough
left
for
4
sample
pours
with
family
on
memorial
day
pretty
huge
bummer
to
lose
about
half
the
bottle
at
least
i
opened
it
indoors
beer
was
a
pinkish
purpleish
reddish
lots
of
head
at
first
with
almost
berry
look
to
it
stinks
like
berry
fruitpunch
taste
is
much
of
the
same
but
lots
of
tart
to
it
almost
too
much
carbonation
isnt
overboard
but
iy
is
a
bit
tart
in
the
mouth
thick
and
filling
pretty
annoyed
anbout
the
guyser
when
i
opened
the
bottle
didnt
blow
me
away
it
is
a
good
brew
probably
wouldve
like
it
a
lot
more
if
more
than
half
didnt
go
to
waste
doverall
this
was
way
more
enjoyable
than
my
first
upland
lambic
managed
to
not
spill
34
of
this
one
down
the
drain
has
a
nice
blackberrie
flavor
to
it
but
not
to
overpowering
and
not
too
sour
really
liked
the
little
pieces
of
blackberry
that
were
in
the
glass
too
i
seem
to
like
upland
fruit
lambics
more
than
the
norm
i
do
not
compare
them
to
the
amazing
lambic
breweries
like
cantillon
and
drie
fonteinen
but
rather
appreciate
uplands
beers
as
delicious
american
fruit
lambics
modeled
after
the
traditional
belgian
greats
mentioned
above
o
overall
one
of
the
better
upland
lambics
ive
had
so
far
like
the
overs
not
overly
sour
but
still
very
enjoyable
would
like
to
have
again
gushed
from
a
750
ml
bottle
in
to
a
boulevard
brewing
tasting
glass
a
light
bubbly
head
formed
pretty
quickly
and
was
gone
just
as
quick
the
aroma
was
interesting
on
this
particular
lambic
as
it
was
not
bursting
with
to
much
funk
the
funk
was
there
mixed
with
the
blackberrys
which
were
in
the
background
i
have
been
on
a
lambic
tasting
spree
and
have
to
say
i
have
thourghly
enjoyed
taste
of
the
cherry
and
blackberry
form
this
brewery
the
acidic
bite
and
flavor
was
there
but
extremly
minimal
for
me
as
the
funk
and
blackberry
were
in
the
front
row
the
blackbery
and
sourness
were
dull
and
mixed
very
well
the
body
of
this
brew
did
not
destroy
my
mouth
which
i
appreciated
being
at
a
tasting
i
had
early
decided
not
to
go
through
with
a
ba
muleing
for
me
on
this
release
but
will
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thinner
side
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
the
cherry
version
it
did
show
some
nice
subtle
fruit
character
while
also
having
some
bold
sour
and
tart
flavors
to
it
though
pretty
nice
beer
overall
it
should
be
noted
that
the
ba
who
brought
this
to
our
tasting
session
contacted
uplands
and
told
them
of
the
two
gushing
bottles
we
opened
on
the
7th
after
hearing
our
story
uplands
kindly
offered
to
replace
the
bottles
md
not
crazy
carbonated
like
some
of
them
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
this
is
personally
my
favorite
in
the
lambic
series
i
think
they
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
with
every
batch
this
is
the
first
one
that
i
am
willing
to
buy
multiple
bottles
of
in
the
same
batch
pretty
darn
good
if
you
like
blackberries
it
really
feels
wild
in
a
way
suitable
for
berrybased
american
wilds
from
the
tartsweet
blackberry
to
the
earthy
dirty
funk
a
nice
showing
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
upland
i
have
tried
either
blackberry
is
their
best
offering
or
they
are
improving
with
each
batch
it
could
be
some
of
both
the
pour
is
absolutely
beautiful
with
a
great
bright
deep
purple
color
really
gorgeous
pinkhued
head
is
light
and
bubbly
sticking
around
for
a
bit
the
nose
brings
forward
plenty
of
blackberry
character
along
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
and
light
acidity
the
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
and
reminds
me
of
the
blueberry
lambic
in
that
regard
its
currently
really
fruitforward
but
i
dont
like
the
berry
flavor
as
much
in
this
one
on
the
other
hand
it
does
have
some
funk
and
acidity
there
is
really
a
lot
of
fruit
in
this
right
now
and
i
think
it
has
the
makings
of
a
really
nice
beer
it
just
needs
some
time
to
develop
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
a
solid
brew
and
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
ages
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
middle
of
the
road
in
terms
of
upland
lambics
i
find
upland
lambics
very
hit
or
miss
but
applaud
the
experimentation
of
the
different
fruits

d
a
really
easy
to
drink
sour
beer
and
quite
nice
all
around
i
wish
i
could
have
had
this
one
fresher
to
get
the
full
effect
of
the
fruit
but
still
quite
nice
the
flavor
opens
lightly
tart
with
blackberry
skins
and
a
strong
wood
quality
its
lactic
and
tannic
with
a
low
acidity
and
a
nice
fruit
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
lightly
tannic
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
drinkability
is
moderate
and
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
is
throughout
the
mouth
carrying
the
sour
to
tart
overall
the
beer
is
ok
id
be
interested
in
trying
other
lambics
from
the
this
brewery
a
750ml
bottle
thanks
to
mymrnngjckt
for
sharing
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
snifter
the
lambic
appears
a
hazed
deep
crimson
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
tart
blackberries
a
bit
acidic
oak
some
funk
light
vinegar
musty
hay
decent
medium
body
with
adequate
carbonation
and
a
dry
tart
finish
pretty
nice
i
had
never
tried
an
american
made
blackberry
lambic
until
this
one
the
colour
was
an
amberorange
with
little
head
the
aroma
was
highly
acetic
with
some
general
berry
fragrance
on
the
palate
there
was
a
burst
of
bubbles
a
quick
shot
of
blackberry
then
vinegar
the
finish
was
rather
quick
note
the
scores
for
aroma
and
taste
should
both
be
about
4
20
but
i
felt
this
was
the
best
way
to
balance
them
d
not
as
complex
or
even
fruity
as
i
expected
but
its
not
a
bad
lambic
i
certainly
didnt
want
anything
lindemansesque
but
some
more
blackberry
flavor
and
aroma
would
have
been
nice
hopefully
upland
will
keep
improving
this
one
over
the
next
couple
years
till
they
really
nail
it
abv
seems
low
and
very
manageable
although
the
tartness
can
be
a
bit
much
after
more
than
a
glass
of
this
beer
drinkability
low
abv
and
quite
tasty
but
acidic
and
tart
so
it
depends
on
how
much
you
like
lambics
if
you
do
seek
this
one
out
drinkability
okay
okay
so
maybe
its
not
the
most
authentic
truetostyle
fruit
lambic
out
there
but
come
on
its
very
tasty
very
drinkable
and
really
who
wouldnt
take
this
over
a
chapeau
lambic
any
day
of
the
week
a
fantastic
lambic
style
beer
that
doesnt
seem
to
resemble
blackberries
in
the
least
to
me
strawberry
is
what
id
believe
if
you
told
me
since
i
love
strawberries
this
is
great
if
youre
looking
for
sweetness
forget
this
beer
if
you
like
sour
then
this
is
amazing
reminds
me
of
sour
patch
kids
balanced
with
a
vinegar
sour
and
sweetness
but
no
flavor
overpowers
any
other
except
maybe
the
sour
highly
recommended
for
any
beer
or
wine
drinker
or
someone
youre
looking
to
convert
to
sours
overall
i
am
floored
after
being
underwhelmed
by
the
entire
series
here
this
one
was
a
sure
winner
finally
some
semblance
of
the
fruit
flavor
was
left
and
it
was
brilliant
i
think
i
really
enjoy
the
style
more
fresh
as
the
cantillon
i
had
last
week
would
be
evidence
of
if
i
were
to
recommend
anything
from
the
series
this
one
is
it
d
not
really
have
not
been
real
impressed
with
the
upland
sours
they
need
to
bring
more
fruit
to
the
bottle
on
the
next
go
around
just
the
smell
of
the
cork
previews
the
lovely
tartness
to
come
three
fingers
of
biscuity
light
tan
head
sits
on
a
murky
apple
cider
brown
body
that
is
cloudy
from
the
yeast
sediment
nose
is
tart
and
sharply
acidic
almost
making
you
pucker
the
wet
yeast
is
there
with
apple
skin
and
white
vinegar
the
vinegar
comes
through
slightly
at
first
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
a
layer
of
barnyard
funk
lays
on
the
mouth
like
a
blanket
the
sour
feel
is
nice
consistent
and
well
balanced
throughout
but
you
really
hunt
for
the
fruit
to
come
through
yeasty
on
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
thickness
that
comes
through
well
done
lambic
and
nicely
drinkable
d
damn
good
could
be
more
sour
for
sure
but
a
great
start
pours
a
simply
beautiful
copperred
color
with
almost
no
head
whatsoever
smells
mostly
brett
with
the
funk
eating
and
eliminating
almost
all
of
the
blackberries
first
sip
is
all
brett
that
perfectly
compliments
what
is
left
of
the
sweetness
this
is
what
sours
are
all
about
it
puckers
the
lips
to
perfection
and
feels
simply
wonderful
on
the
tongue
tartness
rules
id
say
this
beer
is
a
very
decent
american
made
representation
of
the
style
and
i
can
see
this
one
aging
well
for
some
time
d
all
day
i
think
this
is
my
first
real
american
lambic
i
must
say
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
hopefully
more
will
be
made
the
one
thing
i
do
not
get
is
how
this
bottle
costs
the
same
as
those
imported
from
europe
great
beer
though
might
improve
as
it
clearly
has
compared
to
other
reviews
this
was
a
nice
treat
good
to
see
the
us
producing
quality
lambics
even
if
theyre
challenging
to
procure
i
totally
want
to
try
out
the
other
flavors
now
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
and
served
in
a
tumbler
this
beer
poured
a
clear
redtinged
orange
hue
with
a
onefinger
thin
head
of
offwhite
foam
that
slightly
lasted
a
small
amount
of
slippery
lacing
was
left
around
the
glass
the
aroma
included
sweetened
berries
wet
hay
oak
and
a
faint
sourness
the
flavor
was
also
lightly
sour
and
fruity
sweet
just
enough
acidity
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
a
hint
of
oak
and
clean
wheat
are
also
present
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
had
moderate
carbonation
crisp
and
aggressive
on
the
tongue
this
was
by
far
the
best
carbonation
out
of
all
the
upland
lambics
i
have
tried
all
in
all
another
solid
beer
not
the
funkiest
or
most
interesting
lambic
but
still
enjoyable
d
enjoyable
in
small
amounts
the
acidity
is
a
bit
more
than
id
like
taste
mouthfeel
up
front
berry
flavor
light
on
the
sourness
but
not
sweet
either
balsamic
vinegar
flavors
are
pretty
prevalent
and
i
could
see
the
acetic
acid
doing
some
bad
things
to
the
stomach
if
large
quantities
of
this
were
consumed
fairly
simple
and
straightforward
on
the
whole
very
light
on
the
funk
and
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
acetic
acid
the
finish
is
semidry
leaving
a
trace
of
berrylike
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
750ml
bottle
it
bubbled
through
the
cork
when
i
pried
off
the
cap
nice
orangeredpinkish
color
nice
fruity
funky
sour
smell
butter
the
flavor
is
quite
interesting
some
fruitiness
a
hint
of
sour
but
barely
and
a
strange
buttery
flavor
carbonation
is
fine
and
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
this
isnt
as
good
as
the
strawberry
or
cherry
upland
lambics
i
believe
i
got
these
in
trade
with
travisd13
but
i
may
be
wrong
i
lost
my
notes
on
this
one
in
any
case
i
love
lambics
and
for
that
matter
blackberries
and
im
very
interested
in
trying
this
pours
a
reddish
brown
maybe
even
with
a
splash
of
purple
somewhere
in
the
depths
or
is
that
my
imagination
capped
and
corked
bottle
opens
with
a
pop
and
there
is
plenty
off
carbonation
but
no
spewing
and
the
head
is
slight
somewhat
murky
with
sediment
and
there
is
a
lot
of
yeasty
gunk
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
smells
nicly
sour
with
just
the
barest
hint
of
sweetness
a
bit
of
briney
creaminesss
and
some
acidic
blackberry
aromas
no
real
funk
but
clean
tart
and
nice
the
taste
has
more
blackberry
up
front
and
a
lingering
sourness
and
more
of
that
creamy
salinity
that
adds
a
savor
to
the
whole
package
but
still
no
real
funk
it
drops
away
a
bit
after
the
initial
hit
of
sour
and
becomes
more
tart
and
fizzy
than
sour
the
blacberry
is
restrained
but
more
noticeable
than
in
the
aroma
quite
fizzy
and
fairly
soft
in
the
mouth
but
with
a
nice
lingering
tartness
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
but
id
like
to
see
it
again
in
a
few
years
and
see
what
its
done
dan
interesting
take
on
the
style
fairly
well
balanced
in
its
sour
and
sweet
tones
it
also
manages
to
be
fairly
nuanced
as
well
it
lacks
the
funk
of
some
of
the
great
belgian
examples
though
which
i
would
like
the
overall
prodcut
however
is
quite
tasty
and
is
perhaps
a
different
animal
all
together
very
good
beer
taste
is
pretty
much
right
on
point
berries
come
through
slightly
stronger
in
flavor
but
this
is
mostly
a
tart
vinegary
earthy
oaky
beer
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
well
carbonated
notes
from
and
tasted
on
72108
not
the
best
appearance
on
these
lambics
bright
orange
color
and
the
heads
of
these
lambics
never
take
on
any
of
the
color
from
the
fruit
sour
blackberry
aromaflavor
has
a
nice
balance
of
mostly
sweet
but
also
sour
elements
pielike
with
notes
of
vanilla
cream
as
well
as
some
fairly
authentic
blackberry
notes
really
nice
ale
tonight
is
a
special
night
so
why
not
try
a
special
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
pinkish
red
with
a
thin
off
white
head
aroma
of
tart
blackberries
a
touch
of
wood
and
a
bit
of
funk
begins
sweet
finishes
tart
acidic
a
very
nice
example
of
a
fruit
lambic
thanks
josh
paired
with
a
cheese
plate
of
morbier
cowgirl
creamery
mt
tam
triplecream
and
jasper
hills
constant
bliss
the
lambic
went
best
with
the
buttery
triple
cream
and
the
raw
cows
milk
constant
bliss
cutting
through
the
light
saltiness
and
creamy
texture
this
was
the
first
of
the
upland
lambics
i
have
tried
it
was
pretty
darn
good
and
quite
tart
already
for
being
so
young
i
originally
expected
a
much
sweeter
and
fruitier
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
first
blackberry
lambic
i
can
remember
having
too
hope
to
drink
again
in
upcoming
years
recommended
this
is
much
better
than
i
anticipated
though
it
is
not
really
a
lambic
in
character
it
has
a
much
softer
sourness
and
does
not
have
the
complexity
funkiness
of
a
well
made
lambic
in
fact
that
is
the
glaring
flaw
here
it
really
needs
some
brett
character
to
be
a
great
example
of
a
lambic
this
is
definitely
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
and
the
fruit
expression
is
almost
perfect
right
now
any
more
and
it
could
get
cloying
les
and
it
wouldnt
have
the
requisite
fruit
levels
drinkability
ive
been
super
excited
to
try
these
for
about
the
last
couple
months
and
i
wasnt
let
down
in
the
least
the
first
couple
drinks
are
pretty
intense
but
as
you
acclimate
yourself
its
terribly
drinkable
cool
to
know
that
such
great
belgian
style
sours
are
being
created
right
here
in
the
heart
of
america
take
that
cali
big
thanks
again
to
matt
for
his
generosity
had
this
one
with
all
the
others
last
night
and
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
lots
of
flavor
and
a
very
nice
pleasant
oak
presence
the
after
taste
was
a
treat
leaving
a
very
pleasant
almost
barn
yard
effect
on
the
palette
blueberry
flavor
and
the
oak
barrel
blended
nicely
to
give
this
beer
great
flavor
and
exceptionally
pleasant
treat
if
youre
after
the
upland
lambic
this
one
is
one
worth
seeking
out
im
going
to
age
one
of
these
in
the
celler
and
try
it
again
in
a
year
or
2
mmmhhh
i
guraentee
ya
its
going
to
only
get
better
as
the
brett
does
its
thing
not
as
colorful
as
most
lambics
ive
tried
this
still
has
a
nice
copper
belgian
ale
appearance
with
a
nice
hit
of
carbonation
smells
good
like
a
nice
belgian
ale
but
again
not
as
fruity
as
i
expected
nice
taste
a
great
mix
of
ale
with
a
nice
hit
of
blackberry
with
a
bit
of
cask
aging
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
pop
from
the
carbonation
this
seems
more
like
a
blackberry
wine
in
a
lot
of
aspects
such
as
taste
and
smell
but
is
worth
it
if
you
can
find
it
an
excellent
lambic
that
felt
like
a
cross
between
a
fruit
champagne
and
ale
in
a
good
sense
its
only
out
for
a
short
time
so
get
it
while
you
can
but
be
prepared
for
the
rubbery
cork
to
be
a
bit
of
a
pain
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
less
sour
so
that
the
strawberry
was
at
the
forefront
i
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
to
see
if
its
the
age
that
has
made
this
beer
so
sour
this
is
good
but
upland
makes
many
other
products
that
are
less
labor
intensive
and
dont
cost
27
50
a
bottle
consider
this
a
once
or
twice
a
year
treat
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
lambic
the
sour
strawberry
is
aggressive
and
is
the
main
character
of
this
brew
it
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
hint
of
vinegar
acidic
sourness
and
bready
yeast
this
is
my
second
upland
sour
and
after
years
of
reading
that
upland
sours
are
overrated
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
i
think
this
brew
competes
with
the
best
of
them
i
would
now
love
to
seek
out
and
try
more
upland
sours
the
blueberry
was
kind
of
a
disappointment
but
this
one
is
great
o
an
excellent
lambic
and
an
impressive
strawberry
fruit
beer
this
fruit
tends
to
fail
in
beer
more
than
it
succeeds
making
this
brew
even
more
impressive
what
i
most
like
about
this
one
is
that
it
combines
sweet
refreshing
notes
of
strawberry
with
very
tart
acidic
funky
notes
typical
of
the
lambic
style
upland
can
chalk
up
another
success
in
its
lambic
series
o
this
is
my
first
upland
sour
i
am
not
wholly
won
over
by
this
one
the
funk
and
the
sour
eclipse
the
fruit
leaving
the
namesake
strawberry
to
play
a
secondary
role
if
the
balance
of
the
fruit
and
funk
were
reversed
and
the
fruit
played
top
bill
while
the
funk
was
underlying
with
highlights
this
would
be
a
worldclass
brew
but
as
it
is
im
not
sure
id
seek
this
one
out
again
pours
a
murky
reddishorange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
with
malt
strawberry
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
super
sour
malt
strawberry
and
acidic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
great
strawberry
aroma
and
super
sour
flavors
cheers
o
nice
but
simple
pours
an
opaque
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
brings
out
loads
of
strawberries
acidity
and
moderate
funk
flavor
brings
out
shitloads
of
strawberry
like
a
puree
or
jam
with
moderate
acidity
and
low
funk
huge
strawberry
jammy
notes
without
much
funk
but
without
a
decent
amount
of
acidity
ojust
a
tad
bit
more
tartsour
notes
would
have
greatly
improved
the
beer
the
strawberries
where
great
but
it
did
have
the
sour
punch
to
round
everything
out
overall
very
nice
fruit
lambic
being
the
first
ive
tried
from
them
its
quite
delicious
and
id
love
to
try
more
of
uplands
lambics
overall
a
somewhat
unusual
fruit
for
a
lambic
but
it
works
frankly
the
natural
sour
qualities
of
the
strawberry
make
its
flavor
somewhat
difficult
to
pick
out
of
the
lambic
but
once
you
do
its
delicious
m
medium
bodied
relatively
drinkable
for
how
fantastically
tartsour
it
is
decent
carb
overall
this
upland
does
not
get
much
loveprobably
due
to
last
batch
of
strawberry
lambic
aging
poorly
but
its
by
far
the
best
strawberry
sour
that
i
have
drank
its
really
hard
to
make
a
sour
carry
that
strawberry
flavor
really
well
but
upland
has
this
one
dialed
in
very
well
with
this
new
batch
of
strawberry
lambic
it
really
exceeded
my
expectations
the
new
batch
of
strawberry
lambic
will
be
getting
some
well
deserved
attention
my
advice
on
this
sour
is
not
to
age
it
at
all
this
beer
is
a
drink
it
fresh
if
you
got
a
bottle
of
sour
beer
i
dont
see
this
sour
improving
with
age
pours
a
hazy
pinkreddish
blonde
with
some
offwhite
head
the
body
looks
just
like
a
strawberry
beautiful
hue
this
beer
smells
like
fresh
picked
strawberries
the
nose
jumps
out
of
the
glass
with
some
tartness
but
loads
of
fruit
the
6
of
strawberries
per
bottle
pays
off
this
beer
tastes
like
fresh
picked
strawberries
that
are
slightly
unripe
great
tartness
is
completely
in
balance
with
the
fruit
and
they
play
well
together
worthy
of
a
second
glass
at
an
event
with
other
great
sours
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
cant
speak
to
the
other
batches
but
the
current
batch
is
fantastic
i
would
like
to
try
a
newer
bottle
now
for
comparison
o
good
but
definitely
a
difficult
flavor
to
impart
not
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
perhaps
better
fresh
aside
from
only
getting
to
drink
half
the
bottle
a
decent
sour
although
far
from
uplands
best
offering
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
but
small
bubbly
white
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
smells
of
lemons
old
cheese
gym
socks
and
a
hint
of
berry
if
i
strain
a
bit
yeah
theres
some
funk
in
here
the
flavor
is
nice
not
as
harsh
as
i
was
expecting
theres
a
solid
dose
of
lemony
tartness
prickling
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
the
strawberry
comes
through
subtly
theres
some
still
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
a
solid
funky
flavor
and
a
lot
of
lactic
acid
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
acidic
mouthfeel
this
is
quite
a
nice
sour
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
big
thanks
goes
out
to
aasher
for
handing
this
one
off
to
me
in
our
most
recent
massive
inperson
trade
thanks
al
this
one
was
shared
during
the
big
upland
sour
tasting
amongst
a
large
group
of
bas
served
from
bottle
into
a
boulevard
tulip
poured
a
hazy
orange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
strawberry
funk
tart
and
diaper
now
thats
some
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
strawberry
funk
sour
tart
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
upon
smelling
this
one
and
picking
up
on
a
note
of
diaper
with
others
in
the
group
agreeing
i
knew
this
brew
was
going
to
bring
the
funk
sure
enough
it
was
rather
funky
with
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
strawberry
to
balance
it
out
a
really
well
put
together
brew
that
i
would
love
to
drink
everyday
if
possible
pour
is
dark
hazy
orange
and
thin
bubbly
white
head
the
nose
is
heavy
band
aid
and
plastic
dusty
brett
and
seedy
strawberry
with
a
light
lactic
note
the
taste
is
solid
strong
seedy
strawberry
light
band
aid
dusty
brett
fairly
sour
light
lactic
note
assertive
carbonation
fairly
dry
light
body
o
its
a
decent
beer
but
id
love
to
see
how
a
belgian
lambic
brewery
would
make
a
strawberry
lambic
i
think
they
would
do
a
better
job
the
taste
was
powerfully
sour
lip
puckering
sour
wonderful
fresh
strawberries
and
oak
there
was
a
sweettarts
candy
like
character
in
this
one
however
there
were
enough
grainy
malts
to
give
it
a
solid
core
a
nice
bonedry
finish
to
this
one
the
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
with
a
medium
heft
to
the
body
i
enjoyed
it
despite
some
off
notes
in
the
aroma
overall
really
nice
except
losing
half
the
bottle
in
the
eruption
d
this
is
pretty
solid
but
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
upland
lambics
along
with
blueberry
and
peach
theres
more
strawberry
than
i
was
expecting
based
on
some
of
the
other
reviews
but
it
kinds
of
lacks
in
complexity
o
excellent
lambic
i
am
continually
impressed
by
uplands
lambic
series
the
sourtartness
of
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
by
the
presence
of
strawberry
i
will
buy
these
whenever
possible
gusher
after
it
can
be
controlled
pours
a
hazy
pinkish
orange
with
no
head
aroma
is
gross
funk
and
medicinalacetone
notes
im
glad
i
got
past
the
aroma
because
the
taste
is
pretty
good
funk
and
strawberries
tart
but
not
crazy
pretty
smooth
not
bad
but
nothing
too
exciting
this
beer
was
what
i
expected
when
i
traded
for
it
but
its
not
something
im
a
huge
fan
of
i
liked
the
blueberry
version
from
these
guys
better
but
this
one
may
be
closer
to
what
the
boys
at
upland
were
going
for
glad
i
tried
it
but
even
more
glad
i
split
it
notes
despite
this
beers
amazing
ability
to
capture
the
strawberry
in
all
of
its
glory
including
the
green
top
its
a
tadbit
one
dimensional
the
overflowing
was
a
bit
annoying
too
but
so
goes
experimentation
and
i
wish
them
the
best
of
luck
and
will
gladly
buy
this
if
i
ever
see
it
for
sale
the
feel
is
light
but
the
carbonation
is
just
a
bit
sharp
overall
not
bad
here
the
aroma
could
use
some
work
i
like
his
but
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
the
sourness
is
heavy
up
front
thanks
baron
o
not
bad
but
not
one
id
probably
drink
again
and
would
be
hesitant
to
purchase
on
their
next
release
although
the
upland
lambics
do
seem
to
get
better
every
batch
as
far
as
strawberry
beers
go
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
33
d
definitely
the
most
sour
of
the
uplands
i
have
had
so
far
fruit
has
been
quick
to
disappear
but
this
sure
has
already
matured
into
a
rather
nice
souroaky
example
o
not
my
favorite
of
the
various
lambics
really
muted
and
not
the
best
ive
had
from
upland
the
explosion
of
this
one
was
disappointing
as
well
slightly
above
average
bottle
took
the
cork
off
and
this
foamed
up
quite
a
bit
glad
i
was
over
the
sink
and
had
a
glass
ready
to
capture
this
eruption
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
cloudy
hazed
orange
amber
color
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
that
quickly
settles
muted
fruit
notes
but
has
some
brett
floral
type
notes
i
would
say
the
strawberry
aroma
is
mild
at
best
light
mouthfeel
light
strawberry
flavor
as
well
with
lemon
wheat
and
florals
i
was
looking
for
and
hoping
for
this
to
be
a
little
more
strawberry
forward
but
thats
not
what
you
really
get
the
wood
barrel
treatment
imparts
so
earthiness
notes
as
well
mildly
sour
overall
but
not
overpowering
overall
funky
a
tasty
lambic
that
would
be
improved
if
the
brewers
stepped
up
the
strawberry
involvement
bottle
shared
at
hill
farmstead
very
fruity
aroma
strawberries
are
very
present
with
a
nice
little
funky
touch
fruity
sourness
nicely
balanced
with
oak
and
lactic
notes
could
have
leaned
more
towards
the
fruit
light
mouthfeel
with
lively
carbonation
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
could
try
more
of
their
offerings
in
the
future
the
reveal
upland
strawberry
lambic
no
shit
after
drinking
more
after
the
reveal
i
guess
i
can
strain
to
find
some
strawberry
but
im
still
hardpressed
to
find
it
still
a
good
beer
in
any
case
i
actually
really
enjoyed
the
much
maligned
upland
peach
this
one
is
on
my
naughty
list
very
dry
very
oak
and
funky
in
the
finish
the
brett
b
in
the
finish
is
super
strong
its
mildly
sweet
with
some
fruit
in
the
front
mild
strawberry
flavor
overall
decent
but
really
strong
doverall
im
ok
that
more
than
half
of
this
went
down
the
drain
as
it
wasnt
very
tasteful
and
really
funky
tasteing
im
excited
to
try
more
better
flavors
from
upland
as
i
know
other
will
be
better
but
the
strawberry
was
dissapointing
bottle
opened
over
the
sink
fired
two
feet
into
the
air
pours
big
bubbles
into
a
orangeypink
color
with
a
large
head
smells
funky
lactic
and
a
touch
medicinal
not
really
much
of
any
strawberry
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
funky
and
sour
but
not
overly
so
with
just
a
hint
of
a
strawberry
presence
not
really
as
much
as
i
would
like
moves
it
way
down
somewhat
easily
for
a
sour
kind
of
a
let
down
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
really
hugely
carbonated
as
the
first
sentence
elludes
to
4
0
d
this
is
pretty
tame
right
now
but
it
has
a
good
aroma
and
taste
to
it
i
wish
i
waited
six
months
longer
to
open
this
i
think
this
will
be
a
much
better
beer
then
in
any
case
it
scratched
the
sour
itch
that
i
caught
tonight
d
complicated
yet
refeshing
not
overly
sour
and
has
a
low
abv
this
lambic
scores
handsomely
for
drinkability
clean
body
drink
well
but
a
bit
thin
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
ok
it
is
tasty
and
easy
drinking
is
this
worth
the
pricetag
probably
not
was
it
fun
to
try
yeah
definitely
worth
trying
i
do
wonder
how
this
one
might
develop
over
the
years
d
good
first
lambic
tasted
more
along
the
lines
as
a
wild
ale
though
would
have
hoped
for
a
bit
more
strawberry
flavor
but
still
very
good
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
of
their
lambics
d
easy
drinking
d
a
very
nice
lambic
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
would
like
to
have
again
nice
mouthfeel
and
spritzy
carbonation
pretty
smooth
solid
but
not
amazing
lambic
this
is
quite
drinkable
the
nose
didnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
but
the
taste
was
good
and
the
strawberries
came
through
nicely
this
is
my
first
upland
lambic
and
im
impressed
enough
to
hope
a
few
more
come
my
way
not
quite
cantillon
but
a
good
start
pretty
drinkable
considering
its
tartness
time
will
tell
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
750ml
bottle
on
my
own
d
this
one
is
almost
on
par
with
uplands
raspberry
lambic
which
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
not
really
a
tradition
lambic
but
more
of
an
awa
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
simple
overall
but
very
enjoyable
worth
seeking
out
mediocre
drinkability
too
much
lightly
sulfuric
and
phenolic
character
but
the
finish
leaves
me
wanting
more
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
edit
a
friend
said
that
i
was
a
bit
harsh
that
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
hope
i
did
if
i
ever
have
this
again
and
its
not
as
bad
i
will
edit
my
review
not
that
high
here
this
is
definitely
not
worth
the
20
dollars
spent
on
this
bottle
relatively
hard
to
get
plus
the
fact
its
my
least
favorite
of
the
others
i
can
still
easily
polish
off
a
bottle
by
myself
but
will
definitely
seek
out
the
other
flavors
overall
not
sure
what
to
think
about
this
on
one
hand
i
enjoy
the
sour
nature
of
it
but
theres
something
that
just
doesnt
mesh
in
the
aftertaste
the
strawberry
flavor
tastes
almost
overripe
and
artificial
its
not
bad
but
maybe
needs
more
time
in
the
cellar
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
mild
with
some
fruity
funk
sourness
is
at
a
pretty
low
level
and
the
difference
between
this
and
the
peach
was
quite
striking
mouthfeel
was
light
with
might
hints
of
wild
character
nothing
too
exciting
out
of
all
of
them
i
think
this
is
the
one
id
most
prefer
to
age
as
its
not
drinking
all
that
great
right
now
and
could
really
use
some
time
for
the
wild
character
to
develop
this
beer
gushed
popped
like
champagne
the
strangest
thing
was
that
all
of
the
sediment
poured
out
onto
the
counter
instead
of
staying
with
the
beer
at
the
bottom
it
did
unfortunately
get
all
over
my
pants
i
made
sure
to
cover
the
bottle
until
it
settled
itself
just
like
the
09
juliet
it
eventually
poured
a
murky
dark
orange
in
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
laced
the
glass
it
smells
of
both
sweet
and
tart
strawberries
i
like
it
and
im
almost
impressed
that
it
doesnt
drink
like
ive
heard
it
to
perhaps
like
the
peach
that
i
know
was
different
from
bottle
to
bottle
that
this
drinks
like
a
solid
independent
sour
its
actually
pretty
good
it
has
alot
of
barnyard
funk
and
a
good
amount
of
both
sweet
and
sour
strawberry
im
surprised
i
like
it
so
much
so
did
the
puppy
who
licked
it
off
the
floor
this
drinks
rather
dry
and
tart
appealingly
so
it
is
rather
acidic
but
its
good
in
the
manner
it
presents
itself
good
beer
if
only
there
were
more
than
450
bottles
of
it
it
is
overly
carbonated
but
upland
did
email
us
about
this
i
like
it
it
doesnt
deserve
the
negative
rep
that
ive
heard
so
far
save
it
and
try
it
if
you
can
d
taste
is
way
better
than
the
aroma
too
much
funk
never
thought
id
be
able
to
say
that
i
could
easily
have
more
of
this
too
bad
the
bottle
was
such
a
gusher
a
little
disappointing
d
this
beer
was
good
but
like
the
peach
lambic
was
just
a
vinegar
bomb
i
didnt
mind
it
but
it
started
to
take
its
toll
on
my
palate
mid
beer
upland
i
think
messed
up
the
newest
release
of
this
beer
and
i
kind
of
feel
ripped
off
for
the
20
plus
tax
that
this
beer
cost
me
to
drink
drank
from
the
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
light
brown
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
distincly
strawberry
sweet
but
not
generic
a
little
yeast
and
oak
the
taste
is
mostly
oaked
strawberries
its
still
pretty
sweet
making
it
drinkable
not
the
best
of
the
lambics
ive
had
to
date
but
decent
enough
to
give
a
shot
this
beer
appears
a
hazy
shade
of
yellow
with
a
little
head
that
fades
after
a
few
moments
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
just
awesome
delicious
strawberry
scents
amid
a
great
funky
straw
wild
yeast
smell
the
taste
follows
suit
this
is
another
wellcrafted
piquant
offering
from
upland
the
carbonation
level
is
well
done
and
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
is
really
nice
the
finish
is
pleasant
with
a
lingering
tart
strawberry
aftertaste
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
beer
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
lovers
of
true
fruit
lambics
an
impressive
effort
by
upland
better
then
i
expected
i
really
came
to
appreciate
it
as
i
enjoyed
my
way
through
the
bottle
a
shame
this
is
not
more
widely
available
at
least
here
drinkability
highly
drinkable
incredibly
refreshing
and
could
imagine
drinking
this
one
in
the
sun
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
strawberry
doesnt
seem
like
its
the
best
beer
to
infuse
a
lambic
with
its
almost
neutrally
fruity
when
youre
using
the
actual
fruit
and
i
imagine
you
have
to
use
a
lot
of
strawberries
to
actually
get
an
effective
strawberryesque
note
out
of
the
fruit
and
that
being
said
a
lot
of
these
notes
werent
strawberryesque
the
yeast
in
conjunction
with
generic
fructose
i
imagine
contributes
lots
of
other
stone
fruits
but
it
was
drinkable
low
in
abv
and
fairly
bright
and
refreshing
even
though
thats
partially
the
result
of
a
neutral
profile
worth
trying
though
not

bubbly
mouthfeel
good
d
an
interesting
take
on
a
lambic
the
fruit
seems
to
have
provided
some
residual
sweetness
that
i
really
was
not
expecting
drinks
very
well
here
wish
i
knew
the
abv
md
mouthfeel
has
a
slight
bite
to
it
but
the
fruit
makes
it
really
work
out
this
is
something
im
glad
i
am
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
my
first
american
made
strawberry
lambic
the
colour
was
a
hazy
straw
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
aromas
was
really
more
like
cherries
than
strawberries
on
the
palate
did
upland
make
a
label
booboo
i
swear
this
is
cherry
and
not
strawberry
nice
stuff
but
hardly
strawberrylike
d
a
good
beer
very
interesting
but
a
bit
tangy
perhaps
its
a
little
too
bretty
its
clean
yet
murky
at
the
same
time
hard
to
get
a
grip
on
ok
this
is
better
than
the
raspberry
the
clearly
identifiable
strawberry
notes
help
too
very
nice
beer
nothing
overpowering
about
it
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
thanks
to
sprinkle
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
bottle
opens
and
apple
cider
tan
foam
starts
to
slowly
crawl
out
of
the
top
of
the
bottle
pours
into
the
glass
with
a
two
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
skim
with
some
yeasty
chunks
body
is
very
murky
orange
and
once
again
resembles
fresh
apple
cider
nose
has
a
nice
bit
of
sweet
tartness
green
apple
and
pixy
sticks
with
first
sip
i
realize
quickly
that
this
beer
was
better
fresher
the
sour
feel
is
a
bit
muted
and
the
yeast
is
big
and
thick
and
carries
with
it
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
feel
there
may
be
some
oxidization
going
on
here
definitely
a
musty
mouthfeel
drinkability
on
this
one
is
relatively
poor
this
bottle
is
not
the
norm
d
very
easy
drinker
light
strawberry
flavor
which
makes
this
a
lot
easier
to
drink
d
this
is
a
great
lambic
and
i
would
have
no
problem
polishing
off
a
bottle
to
the
head
not
the
most
complex
but
good
enough
for
an
american
version
not
very
funky
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
i
can
see
this
going
great
with
many
food
additions
plus
being
a
hit
with
the
ladies
appealing
cherry
color
properly
carbonated
forms
a
small
head
mimicking
the
beers
color
like
the
peach
lambic
does
this
really
tastesmell
like
strawberries
hard
to
say
for
sure
its
fruity
theres
brett
maybe
they
shouldve
added
more
fruit
low
level
of
sourness
more
sweet
but
drinkable
interesting
to
try
but
i
was
expecting
better
for
a
lambic
made
with
one
of
my
favorite
fruits
d
great
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
find
it
more
really
impressive
taste
ill
be
searchin
it
out
again
another
nice
lambic
style
by
upland
strange
review
for
me
as
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
much
more
than
the
elements
of
my
review
would
indicate
perhaps
i
am
not
extremely
familiar
with
the
style
and
need
to
have
more
of
a
benchmark
however
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
sour
but
not
overly
so
not
overly
complex
but
supremely
enjoyable
very
much
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
foggy
gold
almost
no
head
nose
is
lactic
and
funky
one
sided
and
not
very
complex
but
hey
it
smells
like
a
lambic
flavor
is
lactic
little
bit
of
wood
there
citrus
acidity
is
there
but
the
acid
is
not
too
high
touch
of
vanilla
not
overly
complex
imo
fairly
biting
carbonation
typical
liquid
tone
okay
its
a
lambic
dont
really
get
the
strawberry
on
this
but
its
funky
like
a
lambic
bottle
courtesy
of
radiomg
poured
a
cloudy
dirty
beige
color
beer
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
almost
no
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
light
strawberries
with
some
oak
and
some
funky
barnyard
notes
this
is
quite
close
to
the
real
thing
taste
is
also
a
quite
complex
mix
between
some
tart
notes
with
oak
and
some
sour
strawberries
with
some
funky
barnyard
notes
with
a
lactic
acid
finish
full
body
with
very
limited
filtration
and
minimal
carbonation
a
bit
acidic
for
my
taste
but
very
well
done
nonetheless
overall
a
very
nice
sour
beer
though
i
would
have
liked
to
try
the
flavor
a
little
fresher
this
was
still
a
more
then
capable
beer
that
i
would
never
turn
down
i
think
this
one
was
much
better
back
in
nov
it
wasnt
as
sour
or
dry
as
it
is
now
but
the
fruit
was
more
potent
and
the
beer
less
acetic
d
i
enjoyed
the
level
of
sourtart
in
this
beer
but
the
fruit
taste
is
nearly
abscent
i
would
have
liked
a
nice
blast
of
strawberry
guess
i
will
move
on
to
the
others
and
see
if
i
can
find
any
more
fruit
flavor
in
them
its
drinkable
but
not
the
most
tasty
drinkability
pretty
damned
good
the
fruitiness
is
apparent
and
full
of
delicious
berry
goodness
these
upland
lambics
may
not
be
100
true
to
form
but
they
are
very
approachable
and
really
very
tasty
really
nice
stuff
thanks
again
matt
d
im
enjoying
this
thanks
chris
taste
mouthfeel
more
strawberrylike
than
the
nose
suggests
pleasant
berry
flavors
meet
a
pretty
strong
undercurrent
of
acetic
acid
the
light
body
strong
carbonation
and
dryness
make
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
all
the
same
the
finish
presents
some
oaky
tannins
though
theyre
on
the
mild
side
and
the
slightest
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
pretty
decent
stuff
it
seemed
like
a
good
time
to
crack
this
nice
orange
color
with
a
good
and
healthy
funk
of
a
smell
barnyard
and
urine
easy
flavor
with
a
sugary
strawberry
finish
but
not
what
i
would
call
sweet
funky
and
tart
but
not
sour
i
would
love
to
try
a
bottle
of
the
base
lambic
used
for
these
beers
or
maybe
one
day
an
upland
gueuze
the
carbonation
is
a
little
low
but
still
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
my
second
pour
had
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
mixed
in
by
the
carbonation
as
it
sat
in
the
bottle
this
adds
a
touch
of
a
yeasty
bite
to
the
flavor
and
a
raw
yeasted
dough
not
to
the
aroma
both
of
which
are
not
a
major
player
but
contribute
to
the
overall
effect
of
both
the
nose
and
flavor
the
funkiness
of
the
aroma
is
much
reduced
in
the
flavor
the
tartness
is
much
more
noticeable
in
the
flavor
but
there
are
some
light
notes
of
phenolics
some
cotton
mouthed
mustiness
and
just
a
hint
of
musk
the
strawberry
character
is
much
more
enjoyable
than
i
expected
it
to
be
i
am
not
a
big
strawberry
person
but
it
definitely
adds
a
nice
touch
here
especially
since
it
has
a
fairly
soft
influence
overall
not
bad
i
guess
however
at
16
a
bottle
there
are
much
better
examples
of
lambics
with
or
without
strawberries
based
on
reviews
this
one
let
me
down
pretty
hard

poured
from
a
corked
750ml
bottle
and
served
in
a
tumbler
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
bright
orange
with
some
gold
highlights
and
a
bubbly
head
of
foam
that
quickly
faded
into
a
ring
the
aroma
included
strong
oak
and
tart
strawberries
the
flavor
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
it
was
made
up
of
macerated
strawberries
oak
and
some
mild
funky
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
and
refreshing
lightly
carbonated
i
would
have
prefered
a
little
more
funky
sourness
but
this
was
still
pretty
nice
poured
a
very
fizzy
pale
yellow
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and

near

good
scent
hints
of
strawberry
with
a
nice
sour
aroma
good
taste
nice
and
sour
not
overly
malty
or
hoppy
good
traces
of
strawberry
i
just
wish
there
was
more
fruit
in
both
the
taste
and
the
aroma
goes
down
fine
if
a
little
rough
from
the
carbonation
very
good
beer
huber
orchard
produces
some
good
strawberries
by
the
looks
of
this
brew
upland
was
lucky
enough
to
use
some
of
their
fruit
in
this
lambic
nice
tart
lambic
that
will
probably
improve
even
more
on
that
end
because
of
bottle
conditioning
would
like
to
drink
again
once
it
gets
some
age
under
its
belt
recommended

thanks
for

john
my
first
from
this

thanks
jon
for
bringing
it
was
a
great
changeup
in
a
series
of
barleywines

quite
drinkable
notes

this
is
another
great
lambic
from
upland
the
strawberry
taste
comes
in
along
with
the
oak
and
lays
on
you
tongue
nicely
as
it
goes
down
these
lambics
almost
leave
you
wanting
more
and
more
after
you
drink
it
im
not
sure
if
its
the
sour
tartness
or
the
funk
from
it
great
none
the
less
its
a
shame
the
total
run
is
only
50
cases
a
year
of
each
flavor
if
youre
luck
enough
to
get
some
the
peach
is
less
its
only
25
cases
but
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
and
a
treat
for
sure
i
had
this
fresh
at
the
release
review
is
taken
from
fresh

mouthfeel
is
medium

and

dry
finish
drinkability
another
delightful
lambic
from
the
folks
at
upland
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorfully
brew
the
cost
is
a
little
much
which
will
probably
make
it
hard
for
me
to
pick
up
another

this
one
was
shared
during
the
big
upland
sour
tasting
amongst
a
large
group
of
bas
served
from
bottle
into
a
boulevard
tulip
poured
a
purplish
red
with
a
half
finger
pink
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
blueberries
funk
and
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
blueberries
funk
tart
and
sour
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
was
my
second
favorite
from
this
tasting
which
included
all
of
the
upland
fruit
lambics
and
sour
reserve
batch
1
which
took
1
we
figured
no
one
had
brought
blåbær
so
this
would
make
a
decent
substitute
we
were
right
on
that
aspect
while
not
as
funky
like
most
cantillons
this
one
definitely
carried
a
similar
flavor
profile
with
this
one
being
much
easier
to
obtain
i
would
not
think
twice
about
pick
as
many
of
these
up
as
possible
based
on
my
two
experiences
with
this
brew
a
definite
must
try
for
anyone
who
calls
themselves
a
sour
fan
if
you
havent
tried
it
before
you
need
to
do
so
overall
a
great
sour
i
just
wish
the
blueberry
had
been
a
little
more
prominate
overall
this
is
upland
sour
is
in
the
middle
of
the
road
blackberry
and
kiwi
are
still
my
favorite
upland
sours
this
beer
pours
a
dark
blue
color
with
very
little
light
getting
through
the
smell
is
tart
and
funky
with
a
nice
blurbery
aroma
the
flavor
is
tart
not
sour
and
the
blueberry
flavor
is
very
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fuller
than
expected
but
good
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
if
somehow
upland
could
figure
out
how
to
get
the
nose
into
the
mouth
theyd
have
something
really
special
on
their
hands
d
i
remember
liking
this
more
when
it
was
fresh
i
wouldnt
age
this
batch
further
to
be
honest
its
lacking
complexity
with
lactic
acidity
dominating
the
other
flavor
elements
still
an
improvement
from
the
flat
early
batches
it
was
really
easy
to
put
down
a
bottle
even
with
minimal
help
the
beer
pours
a
purple
hue
with
a
fizzy
purple
head
the
head
is
very
thick
at
the
start
but
fades
quickly
into
nothing
no
head
is
left
and
no
trace
of
lacing
left
beer
looks
flat
smell
is
of
fresh
blueberries
and
a
earthy
funk
you
can
smell
a
good
mixture
of
tartness
from
the
blueberries
taste
is
semi
fresh
blueberries
with
a
decent
tartness
a
small
hint
of
funk
is
present
but
this
isnt
as
sour
as
i
would
like
for
a
lambic
carbonation
is
very
low
and
this
beer
is
almost
flat
overall
a
disappointing
lambic
offering
i
have
heard
this
is
one
of
the
weaker
lambic
offerings
from
upland
and
without
having
the
rest
i
hope
the
consensus
is
right
because
i
have
5
other
of
the
varieties
to
drink
at
some
point
like
i
said
my
least
favorite
of
the
uplands
ive
had
no
real
sourness
weird
funk
and
weak
fruit
cant
win
them
all
might
be
better
fresh
o
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
seemingly
more
than
most
who
have
reviewed
it
here
another
solid
offering
from
upland
okay
beer
rather
overhyped
wanted
more
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
with
slight
acidity
that
lingers
into
a
vinegary
acetic
finish
lots
of
vinous
dark
fruit
especially
blueberry
ref
grape
and
dark
cherry
theres
a
subtle
oak
presence
which
contributes
to
the
earthy
character
but
the
slick
flatnesslack
of
carbonation
hurt
this
beer
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
clear
bluepurple
tinged
copper
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
nice
aroma
with
notes
of
tart
blueberry
fruit
and
slight
acetone
light
mouthfeel
the
blueberry
isnt
as
good
as
what
i
wanted
not
overly
sour
not
too
carbonated
and
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
some
apple
fruit
notes
as
well
its
not
all
that
carbonated
but
that
doesnt
negatively
affect
anything
in
this
case
just
super
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
recommended
mild
carbonation
on
the
palate
finishes
decent
enough
dries
out
on
the
finish
puckeringly
tart
blueberries
in
the
flavor
sour
lemonlike
citrus
yeast
lacticacid
wrinkling
the
palate
a
bit
more
funky
flavors
this
definitely
is
tart
i
was
surprised
my
wife
took
to
it
so
well
but
she
downed
it
quickly
and
happily
i
savored
mine
a
bit
more
but
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
a
nice
tart
beer
with
just
hints
of
fruity
sweetness
to
keep
me
sipping
overall
an
easy
drinking
sour
nothing
special
but
still
very
enjoyable
i
have
liked
the
others
a
bit
better
but
i
do
like
this
one
o
it
was
a
bit
pricy
around
18
00
im
sure
i
have
had
better
for
less
but
i
would
still
recommend
this
beer
to
any
lover
of
blueberries
and
sours
give
it
some
age
and
it
could
blow
you
away
im
going
to
hold
on
to
one
for
a
year
and
see
what
i
think
this
time
next
year
3
5
d
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
easily
the
worst
out
of
the
four
offered
for
this
release
big
hit
of
blueberry
but
not
much
else
the
beer
was
a
little
undercarbonated
for
my
tastes
as
i
find
the
bubbles
help
carry
the
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
while
adding
acidity
co2
also
makes
the
beer
seem
brighter
and
more
lively
overall
this
was
a
delicious
beer
but
i
think
more
lambic
aroma
and
taste
would
really
take
this
over
the
top
perhaps
what
this
beer
is
more
time
in
barrels
to
give
the
critters
a
chance
to
break
down
even
more
of
the
sugars
as
i
tasted
a
tiny
bit
of
residual
sweetness
i
think
that
more
time
before
fruit
addition
would
help
get
more
wildness
and
sourness
in
the
beer
i
think
more
carbonation
may
have
made
this
a
little
better
for
me
d
a
nice
lambic
i
look
forward
to
see
what
time
will
do
but
this
is
quite
nice
coming
from
the
states
update
i
shared
a
second
bottle
of
this
last
night
with
my
girlfriend
this
bottle
actually
did
give
off
slight
and
subtle
blueberry
aromas
they
were
still
disappointing
but
at
least
they
were
present
the
flavor
too
only
gave
slight
blueberry
leaving
me
wanting
more
prominent
blueberry
andrewinski1
was
generous
enough
to
share
this
one
with
me
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
slightly
hazy
shade
of
violet
with
about
a
finger
of
lighter
colored
head
kind
of
a
sweet
batter
aroma
to
this
andy
said
it
kind
of
reminds
him
of
blueberry
pancake
batter
and
i
think
that
is
spot
on
its
slightly
tart
in
the
aroma
with
a
decent
balance
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
subtle
side
barely
tart
and
barely
sweet
its
kind
of
the
switzerland
of
beers
i
really
like
the
nice
light
body
but
i
think
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
overall
i
dig
this
it
kind
of
underwhelms
but
ill
still
stand
by
it
as
a
sound
effort
i
like
the
lively
mouthfeel
the
sharpness
of
the
bubbles
works
well
with
wild
ales
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
noticeably
falls
short
of
other
similar
versions
my
8
ounce
share
is
enough
for
me
and
ill
enjoy
it
my
first
offering
from
upland
and
it
is
a
good
one
these
seem
to
be
fairly
well
sought
after
but
the
reviews
can
go
either
way
i
can
say
that
the
10
version
of
blueberry
is
legit
the
best
american
fruit
beers
are
still
made
by
new
glarus
but
upland
may
be
on
to
something
low
bottle
counts
make
it
difficult
but
try
this
if
you
can
without
giving
up
the
farm
drinkability
nice
to
try
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
i
like
the
ideas
they
are
trying
but
they
need
to
work
on
the
execution
up
the
berry
content
and
remove
the
wet
bookcardboard
aromas
and
tastes
the
beer
didnt
really
look
all
that
great
a
nice
red
color
to
it
the
smell
was
definitely
fruity
and
sour
and
i
was
excited
to
try
it
got
a
nice
hit
of
blueberry
flavor
just
like
youd
expect
and
then
it
quickly
dissipated
and
i
was
left
with
just
the
sour
aftertaste
of
the
lambic
overall
it
had
a
really
good
flavor
but
i
just
wish
it
would
have
lasted
a
little
longer
pretty
smooth
to
put
down
i
just
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
blueberries
all
day
figured
i
would
pop
open
one
of
my
two
bottles
of
this
after
a
hefty
battle
with
the
cork
pours
a
very
nice
reddishpurple
looks
pretty
cool
smell
is
full
of
blueberries
with
a
slight
lactic
sourness
as
other
reviews
state
it
does
remind
me
of
blueberry
cobbler
taste
is
actually
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
more
sour
but
the
taste
of
tart
blueberries
is
excellent
this
is
definitely
not
in
the
same
league
as
most
belgian
lambics
but
if
you
take
it
for
what
it
is
its
damn
tasty
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
pretty
thin
drinkability
is
high
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
whole
750
myself
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
not
sure
how
long
ill
hold
onto
my
other
bottle
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
d
overall
i
think
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
uplands
we
tried
that
night
we
tried
blueberry
strawberry
peach
and
dantalion
would
love
to
have
again
the
lactic
is
underplayed
because
the
beer
itself
is
not
very
sour
unfortunately
im
really
rooting
for
uplands
but
so
far
their
lambics
have
been
mediocre
beer
is
thin
with
only
a
hint
of
tartness
at
the
corners
and
back
with
nothing
really
to
prop
up
the
rest
of
the
beer
it
is
nearly
a
flavorless
lambic
d
i
was
honestly
a
bit
disappointed
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
possibility
of
another
great
blueberry
lambic
but
this
one
did
not
deliver
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
i
would
be
willing
to
try
it
again
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
d
nice
a
nice
blueberry
lambic
the
first
i
have
had
next
for
blauw
to
compare
head
to
head
with
leblue
possibly
uplands
blueberry
lambic
10
release
was
our
second
tasting
in
the
home
collection
series
this
was
brought
in
by
my
buddy
lil
bear
who
was
given
this
beer
by
my
brother
myself
as
a
thank
you
for
driving
down
to
bloomington
with
us
to
pick
up
our
reserved
lambics
last
december
we
all
agreed
it
was
a
little
premature
to
open
this
bottle
so
early
in
the
aging
process
but
it
was
a
grand
symbolic
gesture
we
all
enjoyed
poured
a
fizzy
pinkpurple
there
was
a
very
surface
souring
that
just
kinda
teased
my
taste
buds
like
i
mentioned
this
may
have
been
too
fresh
but
that
worked
well
with
the
fresh
michigan
blueberries
used
in
making
this
drink
my
overall
impression
was
of
greek
yogurt
with
unripened
blueberries
on
top
i
cant
wait
to
open
my
second
bottle
of
this
in
a
few
more
years
overall
i
was
a
little
bit
let
down
with
the
strawberry
lambic
last
night
but
the
blueberry
got
me
back
on
track
the
fresh
blueberry
flavor
plays
well
with
the
lactic
backbone
yet
i
can
see
this
aging
well
as
it
gains
more
sourness
recommended
and
i
may
be
trying
to
obtain
more
bottles
d
this
one
is
honestly
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
not
much
of
a
lambic
in
any
sense
no
tartness
not
really
dry
and
bal
effect
is
almost
completely
missing
a
great
fruit
beer
if
it
were
described
as
such
but
in
the
category
that
it
is
average
to
below
average
overall
very
drinkable
with
the
light
fruit
and
moderate
sweetness
make
this
a
very
drinkable
lambic
pours
a
really
magnificent
blueberry
color
with
a
nice
pink
head
really
attractive
coloring
while
this
was
quite
nice
i
was
immediately
distractive
by
the
overpoweringlyassertive
nature
of
the
blueberries
in
the
nose
it
was
a
symphony
of
blueberry
breakfast
items
with
loads
of
blueberry
syrup
and
pancakes
plus
a
slight
amount
of
tartness
really
well
done
the
taste
nails
the
fresh
blueberry
as
well
and
adds
in
a
touch
of
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
tart
and
a
bit
sweet
drinks
incredibly
well
i
think
the
blueberries
are
the
highlight
of
this
one
and
i
wont
be
waiting
long
to
drink
my
other
bottle
i
think
the
fruit
character
that
really
makes
this
beer
will
be
gone
well
before
this
really
sours
up
if
that
happens
d
this
beer
was
the
only
upland
lambic
that
night
that
held
any
sort
of
light
in
the
lambic
world
its
flavors
could
have
been
a
little
brighter
and
more
full
but
i
think
the
fullness
would
come
out
more
in
a
aged
bottle
see
upland
if
you
get
your
shit
together
you
can
make
a
decent
lambic
light
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
i
liked
it
a
lot
persimmon
was
better
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
no
slouch
the
best
upland
lambic
so
far
this
is
really
good
stuff
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
was
disappointed
by
it
at
the
same
time
the
carbonation
issues
are
no
fun
and
they
ruin
what
could
probably
be
a
decent
brew
this
is
a
light
bodied
offering
with
a
lower
than
expected
carbonation
level
it
is
easy
drinking
and
is
approachable
without
too
much
puckering
quality
i
think
the
general
consensus
about
this
brew
is
that
if
you
took
away
the
blueberry
stained
appearance
of
this
brew
you
would
probably
not
be
able
to
figure
out
the
fruit
addition
based
on
flavor
and
aroma
d
consumed
in
a
tasting
with
several
blueberry
lambics
and
thisthough
a
decent
enjoyable
brew
overallwas
the
at
the
bottom
great
opportunity
to
try
this
rare
brewbut
there
are
many
others
out
there
much
better
dnot
bad
drinkin
after
blabaer
so
pales
in
comparison
quite
sweet
and
lacking
the
tartness
i
was
hoping
for
little
complexity
as
well
not
bad
but
falls
well
short
of
the
previous
beer
another
interesting
lambic
from
upland
but
nothing
really
spectacular
would
be
great
to
get
a
little
more
of
the
blueberry
character
perhaps
these
flavors
diminished
over
the
past
year
if
only
i
could
get
a
blabaer
to
compare
d
a
pretty
decent
lambicamerican
wild
with
a
nice
sourness
and
balance
not
the
best
but
certainly
good
d
this
was
an
easy
drinker
but
compared
to
the
few
other
examples
out
there
it
just
does
not
stack
up
i
did
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
though
i
just
wish
more
blueberry
came
through
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
to
almost
no
carbonation
this
is
virtually
flat
this
has
some
great
traditional
lambic
character
vs
american
wild
but
i
think
the
flatness
takes
away
but
this
is
still
good
stuff

the
color

of

pink
with
no

aroma
is
reminiscent
of
blueberry
maple
syrup
but
with
more
sharpness
to
it
tastes
like
overripe
blueberries
the
kind
that
if
you
eat
theyre
a

soft

mushy

big
thanks
to
bobby91w
bobby
is
a
great
trader
md
well
this
one
is
flat
as
can
be
nothing
lively
under
the
tounge
which
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
it
has
a
nice
taste
but
the
lack
of
any
ummphh
keeps
me
from
wanting
more
dwhile
this
brew
has
its
short
coming
overall
it
is
a
pleasant
tasting
and
nicely
done
brew
i
certainly
enjoyed
my
pour
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
it
again
with
some
tweaking
and
proper
carbonation
this
could
becomes
a
truly
stellar
beer
i
think
this
brew
has
a
lot
of
potential
and
will
rereview
if
i
get
to
try
another
batch
md
rather
fizzy
in
the
mouth
and
the
beer
leaves
the
mouht
very
dry
maybe
blueberry
just
isnt
my
flavor
of
choice
but
this
one
just
did
notquite
do
it
for
me
certainly
not
bad
just
not
great
in
my
book
much
better
than
the
peach
beautiful
blue
color
with
a
periwinkle
frothy
head
wow
it
actually
has
some
carbonation
we
all
noted
that
this
had
more
of
an
authentic
blueberry
flavor
rather
than
what
some
of
us
found
to
be
artificial
fruit
flavors
in
some
of
the
other
lambics
we
tried
relatively
low
acidity
especially
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
other
beers
we
sampled
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
although
from
what
i
hear
the
subsequent
batches
werent
as
good
this
is
a
very
stange
beer
unique
somewhere
between
a
wild
ale
and
wine
but
still
disappoints
given
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
subdued
funkiness
the
lack
of
carbonation
plays
better
here
than
in
other
upland
lambics
but
i
would
still
love
to
see
it
carbonated
slightly
puckering
feel
but
overall
comes
off
a
bit
light
all
around
which
does
make
it
really
drinkable

beer
pours
purple
with
pretty
much
no
head
at
all
it
smells
tart
like
oak
blueberries
and
some
funk
and
vinegar
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
i
can
taste
vinegar
blueberries
oak
and
some
vanilla
however
the
taste
is
subtle
and
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
kick
to
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
seems
a
bit
watery
to
me
not
much
carbonation
either
however
there
is
some
slickness
which
is
nice
drinkability
is
decent
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
think
its
an
ok
enough
beer
but
theres
definitely
some
room
for
improvement
with
this
ill
have
to
try
another
batch
in
the
future
and
see
how
it
is
overall
i
am
getting
underwhelmed
by
this
series
in
general
i
have
a
couple
others
to
try
hopefully
they
will
redeem
themselves
a
bit
but
i
would
pass
on
this
one
for
sure
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
lambic
but
its
just
decent
rather
than
transcendent
pours
a
beautiful
purple
but
with
no
head
stemmy
blueberries
on
the
nose
with
quite
an
impact
the
aroma
fades
on
the
finish
not
quite
as
lush
as
id
like
a
little
thin
and
sour
to
start
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
but
the
blueberries
make
an
appearance
toward
the
finish
as
nice
clean
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
sour
a
little
perfumy
overall
and
a
bit
stemmy
could
be
lush
or
could
be
bracingly
sour
but
it
straddles
those
lines
without
really
deciding
which
direction
it
would
like
to
go
and
without
making
a
statement
somewhat
pleasant
but
could
be
so
much
more
750
ml
bottle
acquired
in
a
trade
a
few
months
back
opened
last
night
with
my
girlfriend
poured
into
my
belle
vue
flute
glass
pretty
much
flat
with
a
miniscule
head
that
disappers
immediately
no
lacing
or
anything
just
a
still
body
that
looks
like
the
cranberry
juice
i
had
with
breakfast
would
have
thought
it
would
have
been
darker
with
it
being
a
blueberry
lambic
smell
consists
of
mild
tartiness
soft
berries
vanilla
light
oak
and
funk
taste
is
quite
weak
and
i
kept
thinking
over
and
over
to
myself
where
is
the
fruit
very
light
tart
at
the
beginning
then
it
turned
into
pretty
much
juice
without
a
sweet
or
sour
fruit
flavor
just
bland
and
starightforward
did
not
change
once
it
warmed
too
mild
for
a
lambic
just
dry
in
the
finish
with
no
taste
to
go
along
with
it
it
is
like
barely
flavored
juice
with
a
tonic
water
finish
not
much
of
a
mouthfeel
dry
and
once
in
a
while
mildy
tarty
low
level
of
carbonation
was
one
of
its
main
problems
for
something
that
was
both
corked
and
capped
you
would
expect
the
contrary
taste
did
not
linger
at
all
taste
more
like
it
was
aged
in
a
ziploc
bag
than
a
wooden
barrel
could
drink
more
of
this
stuff
because
of
how
light
it
is
but
would
not
want
to
no
complexity
and
is
not
anything
close
to
other
interpretations
of
this
style
this
was
the
worst
of
the
upland
lambics
i
have
had
so
far
almost
half
the
bottle
ended
up
being
poured
down
the
drain
very
limited
fruit
flavor
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
pretty
much
ruined
it
would
not
drink
again
this
was
the
second
time
i
had
it
and
it
was
the
same
each
time
so
can
eliminate
the
idea
of
it
being
a
bad
bottle
certainly
not
worth
what
i
traded
for
it
not
recommended
drinkability
really
tasty
brew
but
damnit
they
need
to
get
the
carbonation
in
check
a
15
beer
needs
to
be
carbonated
regardless
gripes
aside
i
liked
this
one
more
than
all
except
for
the
peach
which
also
wasnt
carbonated
the
fruit
and
wood
are
fantastic
accompaniment
to
the
light
sour
of
the
brew
thanks
matt
easy
to
drink
since
it
tastes
like
old
blueberry
juice
750ml
bottle
thanks
to
tjthresh
interesting
purplepink
color
and
a
smell
nothing
close
to
blueberries
it
is
close
to
funky
fruit
lambic
though
and
the
aroma
is
one
of
the
qualities
most
of
these
uplands
get
right
flat
mouthfeel
fruit
juice
flavors
too
juicy
not
enough
sour
or
blue
berry
or
funky
enough
but
the
aroma
is
cool
and
misleading
dthe
potential
is
here
but
there
are
some
definite
faults
not
sure
where
they
went
wrong
but
it
needs
the
flavour
component
amped
up
a
notch
i
preferred
the
blackberry
to
this
one
i
have
to
say
this
lambic
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
flavor
is
there
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
knocks
this
one
back
on
most
categories
a
few
more
bubbles
and
this
would
have
been
a
really
good
beer
because
its
less
funky
than
many
lambics
its
also
very
drinkable
and
finishing
off
the
bottle
was
no
problem
at
all
which
i
cant
honestly
say
about
some
lambics
a
decent
effort
but
would
benefit
from
more
carbonation
andor
funk
pours
a
nice
blueish
color
some
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
not
much
sticky
lacing
either
the
nose
is
malty
with
scents
of
raspberrycherry
not
much
blueberry
at
all
the
taste
is
malty
soury
with
some
raspberrycheery
again
not
much
of
a
blueberry
taste
medium
body
drinkable
dissappointed
with
this
brew
if
this
were
carbonated
and
had
more
of
the
traditional
lambic
notes
acidity
and
funkiness
then
it
would
be
absolutely
outstandingly
awesome
runaway
best
from
this
years
upland
lambic
release
in
all
likelihood
the
fruit
adds
such
an
interesting
character
to
this
brew
but
without
the
co2
and
other
traditional
lambic
notes
this
is
merely
interestingly
good
i
am
really
digging
the
similarities
to
a
fruity
red
wine
definitely
an
experience
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
polish
of
the
bottle
of
this
poured
from
a
corked
750ml
bottle
and
served
in
a
tulip
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
dark
red
with
a
thin
head
of
pinkishtan
foam
that
quickly
faded
into
a
thin
film
a
small
amount
of
slippery
lacing
was
left
behind
the
aroma
consisted
of
oak
sugary
blueberries
and
a
hint
of
funkiness
the
flavor
was
made
up
of
muted
blueberry
notes
wet
wood
and
a
very
light
brettiness
finished
mostly
dry
but
was
not
very
acidic
or
puckering
the
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
and
minimally
carbonated
almost
still
goes
down
like
uncarbonated
fruit
juice
after
trying
their
strawberry
lambic
this
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
not
much
blueberry
in
the
flavor
either
the
blackberry
definitely
had
a
much
stronger
berry
component
mostly
acidic
vinegar
that
was
a
bit
thin
some
citrus
zest
and
the
faintest
hint
of
blueberry
not
sure
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
the
mouthfeel
was
unacceptably
flat
poured
a
hazy
reddish
golden
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
left
light
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
brett
light
berries
leather
funk
and
hay
taste
of
dry
berry
skins
some
sweetness
tart
funk
and
a
lengthly
sour
finish
good
but
just
short
of
cantillons
notes
from
and
tasted
on
121607
i
am
betting
this
would
be
better
if
there
was
more
carbonation
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
might
go
up
a
half
point
just
based
on
that
if
you
have
a
bottle
of
this
i
would
suggest
sitting
on
it
and
keeping
it
in
the
70s
to
encourage
a
bit
more
carbonation
dark
magenta
color
with
no
head
terrific
aroma
displays
the
purity
and
glory
of
freshly
picked
and
crushed
blueberry
along
with
a
light
hint
of
oak
and
funk
flavor
is
initially
dominated
by
the
essence
of
real
blueberry
followed
by
a
light
hint
of
pie
and
then
some
nice
tartness
on
the
finish
while
not
blabeur
this
is
a
very
nice
blueberry
sour
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
here
goes
down
easy
with
a
subtle
puckering
sourness
i
have
to
fault
this
particular
bottle
as
it
almost
had
no
carbonation
whatsoever
im
really
hoping
my
other
blueberry
bottle
doesnt
have
this
problem
as
it
does
take
away
from
the
overall
brew
cheers
to
upland
for
creating
all
these
lambics
thanks
bob
the
oak
really
jumps
out
both
in
the
nose
and
flavor
the
blueberry
flavor
is
there
but
more
present
after
you
swallow
on
the
tongue
it
lingers
then
you
say
ooohh
yea
nice
thanks
again
mike
you
are
thee
man
overall
its
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
and
tart
taste
its
a
little
pricey
at
15
bucks
a
750ml
but
its
still
fun
never
the
less
overall
this
was
a
great
lambic
suprisingly
good
coming
from
the
midwest
and
not
overseas
one
for
warm
weather
or
if
youre
craving
something
sour
maybe
not
as
approachable
to
lambic
novices
but
great
for
those
with
a
taste
for
the
sour
side
so
very
sour
light
raspberry
flavor
with
a
lot
of
acidity
very
sour
lactic
acidic
light
raspberry
oak
lemon
super
juicy
but
really
acidic
raspberry
sour
warhead
poured
out
light
purple
pinkish
wispy
white
head
that
faded
fast
smelled
of
lacto
berries
and
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohol
pretty
classic
upland
i
found
this
to
be
maybe
slightly
less
than
full
throttle
on
the
upland
sour
spectrum
very
enjoyable
batch
7109
bottled
31712
beautiful
looking
beer
clear
tartness
became
bracing
a
little
too
quickly
for
my
liking
otherwise
a
fantastic
beer
a
4
75
beer
as
a
first
impression
note
revised
to
reduce
score
because
the
sourness
produced
a
stomach
ache
later
that
night
still
a
good
beer
but
i
feel
the
powerful
sour
may
be
a
bit
over
the
top
based
on
my
later
experience
overall
did
i
say
this
one
was
sour
it
may
easily
be
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
tried
and
still
pretty
delicious
at
that
o
a
treat
and
enjoyed
and
would
have
again
and
again
its
expressive
carbonation
prickles
at
the
tongue
and
enlivens
the
sour
taste
of
the
beer
though
the
ale
may
be
slightly
fuller
than
the
driest
lambics
on
the
market
its
carbonation
and
acidity
counters
nicely
en
route
to
a
dryish
and
tangy
fruitforward
finish
gorgeous
raspberry
color
with
an
immensely
fizzy
head
sour
tart
nose
with
a
natural
earthy
raspberry
and
a
mineral
aspect
the
flavor
is
a
pucker
factor
times
ten
with
strong
tart
and
sour
raspberry
the
raspberry
is
a
very
natural
freshly
picked
flavor
with
some
earth
tones
and
maybe
a
bit
of
mineral
the
puckering
flavor
obviously
translates
to
feel
but
its
without
the
vinegar
feel
this
is
a
straightforward
unabashed
raspberry
sour
pours
a
fairly
clear
light
red
until
the
sediment
is
reached
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
then
its
murky
the
aroma
is
very
acetic
with
citric
acid
notes
and
raspberry
sweetness
there
is
a
subtle
touch
of
yeasty
funk
flavor
is
one
of
the
most
sour
things
ive
ever
tasted
notes
of
oak
and
raspberry
weave
a
tapestry
along
with
the
acetic
citric
and
lactic
acid
creating
a
really
rewarding
experience
its
impressive
that
despite
the
incredibly
sour
taste
theres
enough
berry
and
wood
character
to
shine
and
really
make
this
beer
a
standout
definitely
couldnt
drink
a
full
bottle
in
one
sitting
though
o
this
is
my
first
sour
from
upland
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
i
wonder
if
the
flavors
would
mellow
with
a
year
or
if
they
would
just
get
more
intense
this
one
is
right
on
the
edge
of
being
too
sour
still
the
rasberry
fruit
flavor
is
there
and
the
beer
is
filled
of
flavor
i
find
that
most
will
have
a
hard
time
with
this
one
unless
they
truly
enjoy
extreme
tartness
it
was
ok
i
would
have
liked
more
sweetness
to
cut
the
acidity
but
otherwise
a
decent
raspberry
lambic
overall
extremely
sour
as
i
imagined
it
would
be
due
to
what
ive
heard
but
tons
of
raspberry
and
oak
very
nice
birthday
treat
o
tasty
beer
like
the
other
upland
sours
its
good
but
simple
probably
the
best
one
in
the
series
so
far
thanks
fredmugs
for
the
opportunity
cost
25
for
a
750
ml
bottle
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
upland
sours
that
ive
had
as
it
is
tart
and
packs
a
lot
of
the
fruit
flavor
it
is
definitely
a
tart
lambic
as
it
has
minimal
funky
characteristics
to
it
overall
better
than
i
expected
but
reappy
goddamn
sour
o
not
as
great
as
the
traditional
belgian
framboise
but
definitely
a
crazy
acidic
sour
raspberry
beer
oi
love
raspberries
but
this
was
too
sweet
and
didnt
have
enough
funksourtart
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
o
definitely
one
of
the
most
sour
lambic
style
beers
ive
hever
had
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
however
as
im
a
fan
of
raspberries
and
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
jammylike
qualities
to
this
one
as
well
poured
into
the
sampler
glass
from
the
bottle
the
beer
was
a
reddish
hue
like
cherry
7up
with
a
nice
tinted
white
head
the
aroma
smelled
of
sour
fruits
with
a
variety
of
berry
notes
observable
in
the
initial
taste
one
can
immediately
tell
this
is
a
raspberry
lambic
the
acidity
seemed
to
mellow
toward
the
aftertaste
as
the
beer
became
sweeter
one
also
could
detect
vanilla
with
the
modest
sour
notes
the
aftertaste
further
displays
quite
a
bit
of
natural
seedy
raspberry
flavor
it
is
easy
to
tell
his
is
made
with
real
berries
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
must
confess
i
was
hoping
for
more
lambic
qualities
but
instead
i
got
something
very
very
similar
to
raspberry
tart
medium
light
bodied
and
a
bit
more
aggressively
carbonated
than
expected
but
the
feel
works
and
helps
to
make
this
almost
refreshing
overall
this
will
be
an
eye
opener
for
fans
of
lindemans
or
raspberry
tart
but
should
really
appeal
to
sour
and
funk
fanatics
heavily
carbonated
but
while
this
is
usually
a
turnoff
for
me
it
works
in
this
context
upland
nails
it
once
again
pours
a
hazed
reddish
pink
color
with
a
tall
light
pink
head
intense
raspberry
aroma
lightly
acetic
with
a
very
intense
lactic
acidity
lemon
juice
lemon
zest
and
plenty
of
fruit
mild
oak
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
bit
of
a
funky
blue
cheese
thing
to
it
too
the
flavor
is
really
very
sour
heavy
on
the
lactic
acidity
and
quite
a
bit
of
raspberry
flavor
the
blue
cheese
funk
is
there
too
which
i
like
quite
a
bit
a
touch
of
oak
and
maybe
a
bit
of
must
pours
a
murky
dark
red
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
lots
of
raspberry
and
raspberry
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
quality
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
super
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
very
nice
framboise
so
cool
that
it
was
brewwed
in
indiana

overall
a
very
good
lambic
but
by
no
means
the
best
from
upland
or
anywhere
close
to
the
best
raspberry
fruited
one
upland
seems
to
do
a
much
better
job
with
their
lighter
fruited
lambics
than
the
darker
berried
ones
from
my
experience
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
im
beginning
to
like
these
upland
lambics
more
and
more
d
this
was
one
of
the
best
framboise
ive
had
it
was
perfectly
balanced
between
sweet
and
tart
with
delicious
natural
raspberry
character
the
body
was
just
right
for
the
style
and
the
finish
was
nice
too
so
it
was
great
to
sip
fresh
this
beer
might
be
too
fruity
but
it
was
wonderful
after
a
year
and
could
surely
keep
aging
forever
definitely
recommended
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
very
high
carbonation
nice
feel
overall
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
pretty
good
effort
at
brewing
a
lambic
by
upland
i
would
definitely
have
again
in
the
future
o
if
you
want
a
very
puckering
and
tart
not
overly
sweet
lambic
that
is
undeniably
raspberry
in
origin
then
this
is
for
you
overall
another
wonderful
upland
fruit
lambic
delicious
raspberry
sour
though
not
as
complex
as
the
cherry
variation
or
simply
delicious
as
the
persimmon
good
light
body
with
nice
carbonation
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
finish
real
enjoyable
so
far
all
of
the
upland
lambocs
i
have
had
have
been
real
enjoyable
this
is
tasty
it
is
a
full
on
raspberry
bomb
o
great
sourfruit
lambic
upland
knows
what
they
are
doing
o
great
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
sours
this
ones
for
you
overall
nothing
phenomenal
little
nuance
or
development
over
time
yet
a
very
satisfying
sour
would
be
happy
to
take
another
crack
at
this
one
in
the
future
d
a
solid
example
though
the
carbonation
level
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
otherwise
a
great
sour
fruit
profile
despite
it
being
very
straightforward
could
maybe
use
more
oak
and
funk
to
balance
the
scales
but
time
could
certainly
help
that
o
this
was
very
good
i
thought
it
would
be
a
bit
more
fruity
but
the
overall
taste
is
well
above
average
easily
enjoyable
very
glad
i
tried
it
4
5
bottle
from
the
most
recent
release
bright
pink
with
a
huge
light
pink
head
sour
power
the
lactic
acid
is
ridiculous
in
the
nose
biting
and
sharp
with
a
underlying
raspberry
the
sourness
in
every
sip
stings
the
tongue
swishing
makes
my
eyes
water
super
carbonated
hate
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
but
upland
has
nailed
it
again
i
will
be
collecting
these
like
a
hoarding
douche
bag
next
time
they
come
out
tastes
a
bit
more
balanced
out
than
the
aroma
had
led
me
to
anticipate
though
still
tastes
more
like
fizzy
raspberry
juice
than
it
does
a
lambic
though
thankfully
fizzy
raspberry
juice
tastes
pretty
nice
the
sourness
was
very
big
but
pleasant
and
a
handful
of
oak
nodes
serve
to
smooth
things
out
o
really
good
beer
ive
had
better
sours
but
this
one
i
wouldnt
pass
up
overall
this
is
an
extremely
tart
sour
beer
the
fruit
addition
is
very
welcome
and
well
done
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
750

served
in
a

the
beer
pours
a
hazy
ruby
red
color
with
a
couple
inch
light
pink
head
that
went
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
the
brew
smells
like
sweet
and
tart
raspberries
vinegar
funk
lemon
peel
and
some
oak
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
the
sour
flavors
are
much
stronger
compared
to
the
sweet
ones
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
coating
and
has
high
carbonation
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
beer
its
pricey
at
19
79
a
bottle
but
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
definitely
worth
trying
overall
very
tasty
the
sourness
and
fruit
flavors
are
in
good
balance
very
drinkable
thanks
for

mario
pours
a
ruby
pink
color
with
a
large
whiteish
pink
head
scent
is
raspberry
bomb
with
slightly
acidic
aromas
lots
of
sweet
raspberry
taste
is
initially
a
little
strange
cant
really
describe
it
but
just
a
little
off
then
each
taste
after
gets
better
and
better
tons
of
delicious
raspberry
flavor
with
nice
sour
pucker
not
extremely
sour
balanced
out
with
sweetness
maybe
a
bit
of
sugar
added
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
tart
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
was
a
good
experience
for
my
first
upland
beer
i
will
be
seeking
out
others
in
the
near
future
o
not
my
favorite
lambic
and
i
would
say
i
was
expecting
more
from
upland
i
also
have
the
kiwi
and
persimmon
so
hopefully
those
are
better
than
this
not
terrible
but
not
really
one
i
would
recommend
either
drink
and
overall
its
drinkable
but
even
splitting
this
bottle
with
emily
my
mouth
began
to
feel
a
big
raw
and
dry
its
a
nice
beer
and
ill
have
it
again
but
its
not
in
the
league
of
the
classic
3f
and
cantillon
lambics
if
you
like
your
sour
beers
fullon
and
unsubtle
i
would
suggest
this
o
everything
was
great
until
i
put
it
in
my
mouth
then
it
was
downhill
after
thoroughly
enjoying
uplands
peach
and
persimmon
i
am
pretty
shocked
at
what
just
happened
here
this
is
a
fail
for
me
possibly
the
worst
framboise
style
beer
ive
had
3
5
d
another
solid
beer
in
the
lambic
lineup
this
has
a
pretty
good
taste
and
is
among
the
more
sour
from
the
series
smell
is
strangely
more
subdued
than
the
taste
suggests
and
the
carbonation
of
this
bottle
is
distractingly
high
o
overall
an
enjoyable
lambic
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
its
somewhat
one
dimensional
but
still
is
tasty
o
overall
smell
is
the
highlight
beer
was
surprizingly
sour
pretty
good
and
definitely
raspberries
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
holy
crap
this
one
was
a
geyser
the
cork
literally
removed
itself
once
the
cage
was
off
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
pinkish
red
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
and
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
sour
and
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
really
hate
that
half
the
bottle
ejected
itself
into
the
sink
as
most
people
really
seemed
to
enjoy
this
one
the
most
of
the
lineup
i
can
see
why
as
the
combination
of
the
raspberries
with
the
sourtart
notes
just
simply
worked
together
while
this
was
not
the
most
complex
beer
of
the
lineup
it
definitely
stoodout
in
enjoyment
for
most
at
the
tasting
out
of
the
other
uplands
o
good
beer
easily
drinkable
not
a
world
beater
and
not
the
best
of
the
ones
that
they
produce
but
this
is
good
stuff
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
beer
is
thin
and
bright
heavily
carbonated
on
the
mouth
you
get
the
fruit
immediately
and
then
you
get
the
sourness
with
a
very
tart
finish
that
hits
you
in
the
corners
of
your
mouth
its
strong
very
strong
almost
overwhelming
but
i
powered
on
it
is
very
sour
very
bitter
and
tart
but
it
is
a
wonderful
collection
of
flavors
i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
an
enjoyable
brew
i
am
very
happy
at
the
opportunity
to
sample
a
new
sour
wild
ale
and
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
dthis
is
extremely
drinkable
and
very
light
in
flavor
the
flavor
is
a
little
light
but
it
makes
for
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
fruits
are
subtle
and
the
most
dominant
flavor
is
the
oak
especially
in
the
nose

pours
a
hazed
crimson
pink
color
with
a
fizzy
thick
bright
pink
head
that
quickly
fades
to
thick
ring
of
bubbles
and
splotchy
film
aroma
is
tart
and
fruity
with
raspberry
and
lemon
zest
there
is
some
mild
barnyard
funk
and
acidity
but
is
mostly
fruit
forward
flavor
has
a
rich
sweet
real
raspberry
fruitiness
hiding
behind
the
strong
carbonation
and
pleasant
sour
acidity
unfortunately
the
fruit
isnt
as
strong
as
the
nose
or
as
imagine
it
was
fresh
body
finishes
dry
and
overall
this
is
very
refreshing
though
mildly
overcarbonated
not
complex
but
not
as
one
dimensional
as
i
expected
from
other
reviews
nice
gusher

small
soapy

light
horsey
brett
flavor
is
fairly
light
a
lot
of

i
really
enjoy
how
simple
and
fruitforward
this
is
as
there
is
little
sourness
and
no
acidity
to
kind
of
skew
things
very
dry
its
refreshing
in
its
simplicity
which
i
respect
in
the
upland
lambics
ive
had
and
made
better
through
the
lack
of
acidity
overall
i
was
a
very
big
fan
of
this
beer
as
i
was
of
the
other
sour
ive
had
from
upland
very
well
balanced
and
not
much
room
for
improvement
worth
a
shot
bottle
2009
vintage
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
amber
color
with
zero
head
the
smell
is
rather
a
sharp
raspberry
tart
nose
with
some
slight
barnyard
types
slightly
sweet
upfront
with
a
nice
tart
raspberry
sourness
some
apple
notes
as
well
slightly
mouth
puckering
ends
rather
cleanly
very
drinkable
id
like
to
see
the
raspberry
flavors
a
little
more
prevalent
served
in
a
mini
snifter
pours
a
light
pink
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
after
a
few
good
swirls
the
nose
pulls
through
some
really
really
excellent
and
fresh
raspberry
notes
along
with
some
good
levels
of
sourness
as
well
as
a
bit
of
oak
the
taste
is
strong
raspberry
with
really
nice
levels
of
acidity
good
oak
component
the
sourness
level
is
really
great
with
the
fruit
flavor
and
this
is
one
delicious
brewby
far
my
favorite
of
their
lambic
series
like
the
effort
from
upland
but
just
hitting
the
execution
yet
d
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
wish
they
made
more
of
this
as
id
purchase
it
regularly
for
parties
and
as
a
light
drinking
alternative
d
really
liked
this
one
not
overly
complex
but
it
really
doesnt
need
to
be
its
asadvertised
sourtart
notes
and
raspberries
upland
keeps
getting
better
and
better
with
every
batch
they
release
recommend
d
decent
actually
fairly
good
it
could
be
much
better
though
the
lack
of
a
body
is
disheartening
its
still
decent
and
the
nice
tart
finish
is
very
good
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
with
a
bright
carbonation
this
one
does
go
down
pretty
easily
and
is
quite
wonderful
probably
the
best
batch
ive
tried
cheers
to
upland
for
taking
the
time
and
effort
to
brew
these
lovely
lambics
well
worth
the
effort
to
seek
out
d
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
sour
of
all
time
not
immensely
complex
tart
or
overwhelming
but
with
great
balance
and
clean
simplicity
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
and
not
get
tired
of
it
decent
offering
from
upland
probably
the
second
best
sour
ive
had
from
them
behind
the
blackberry
the
raspberry
really
isnt
all
that
evident
not
that
thats
necessarily
a
bad
thing
probably
a
better
beer
than
my
rating
may
reflect
but
nobodys
going
to
be
confusing
this
with
something
from
russian
river
or
cantillon
d
i
really
liked
this
lambic
it
was
one
of
the
highlights
at
savor
to
me
loved
the
sour
raspberry
smell
and
taste
and
would
love
to
try
again
overall
this
is
a
great
lambic
it
is
so
sour
for
being
so
fresh
very
drinkable
all
around
a
good
beer
this
is
what
i
was
hoping
for
from
this
beer
tart
raspberry
seeds
and
all
very
mild
astringency
with
a
good
amount
of
dry
oak
barrel
flavor
soft
feel
of
mild
carbonation
at
least
there
is
some
very
tasty
and
drinkable
but
it
could
probably
use
some
more
cellar
time
this
is
my
second
experience
with
upland
lambics
first
being
the
last
batch
of
strawberry
which
was
atrocious
compared
to
that
bottle
this
one
blows
it
out
of
the
stratosphere
i
will
be
getting
more
when
the
wider
release
rolls
around
like
all
of
uplands
lambics
very
nice
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
now
and
will
only
get
better
with
age
i
would
hold
onto
this
beer
a
little
longer
if
i
had
more
of
them
but
a
standout
beer
from
upland
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
not
overly
deep
or
complex
but
with
a
great
raspberry
character
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
just
enough
to
keep
it
going
neat
minerally
and
salty
finish
real
nice
lambic

a
capped
750ml
bottle
brought
and
shared
by
me
at
a
recent
tasting
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
snifter
glass
the
lambic
appears
a
clear
brownishred
color
with
about
a
finger
of
off
white
head
the
flavors
and
aromas
consist
of
mild
mild
funk
a
touch
of
berry
some
vinegary
acidity
fruity
somewhat
sour
a
notch
or
three
below
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
kind
of
fell
a
bit
flat
on
the
palate
i
hope
the
other
flavors
have
fared
better
for
me
this
was
best
of
show
for
the
meeting
never
thought
id
get
to
try
one
of
the
upland
lambics
that
ive
heard
about
didnt
think
theyd
be
as
good
as
ive
heard
guess
i
was
wrong
me
of
rosso
smells
of
sour
fruits
especially
raspberry
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
sour
raspberry
so
smooth
and
sour
i
love
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
glad
i
got
fo
have
this
one
its
so
sour
and
delicious
uplands
best
so
far
the
strawberry
was
great
as
well
drinkability
if
youre
a
fan
of
raspberries
like
i
am
than
youll
probably
really
like
this
its
lightly
sour
and
somewhat
tart
and
very
quaffable
maybe
not
the
full
lambic
experience
but
im
not
the
style
police
and
i
enjoyed
this
thanks
much
matt
d
ok
but
nothing
special
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
thanks

better

still
decent
drinker

aggressive

taste
some
raspberry
and
other
berries
there
including
strawberry
d
i
feel
like
i
am
being
overcritical
of
this
beer
i
think
i
had
overly
high
expectations
for
this
one
coming
in
i
find
myself
enjoying
this
beer
despite
the
flaws
and
i
am
having
no
problem
getting
through
the
whole
750ml
on
my
own
alcohol
presence
is
not
detected
at
all
flavors
are
smooth
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
easily
drinkable
may
be
a
good
entry
fruit
lambic
for
those
not
used
to
the
more
sour
flavors
typical
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
lambic
and
probably
the
best
ive
tasted
from
upland
the
funk
is
started
to
show
itself
in
the
taste
and
i
think
this
one
might
actually
get
even
better
with
another
year
on
it
color
wise
this
one
sows
the
fruit
tone
in
the
body
very
well
a
bit
of
an
orange
red
tone
makes
up
the
body
on
this
one
head
is
a
skim
and
even
then
just
barely
but
the
bubbles
do
hang
on
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
sour
raspberry
feel
does
shine
through
on
the
nose
it
includes
a
horse
blanket
funk
that
adds
a
nice
complex
smell
sour
feel
is
quite
soft
as
you
take
first
sip
the
fruit
profile
is
prickly
and
juicy
all
over
the
tongue
with
a
nice
raspberry
feel
there
is
a
powdery
sweet
feel
that
hangs
on
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
mixes
with
the
sour
feel
nicely
considerably
yeasty
throughout
mouthfeel
is
pillow
like
soft
and
very
enjoyable
super
drinkability

the

delicious

with

some
interesting

and
they
did
a
good
job
with
the
most
recent

its
slightly
puckering
theres
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
its
easily
drinkable
this
is
worth
drinking
more
of
in
the
future
the
finish
is
sweet
causing
this
experience
to
be
less
than
euphoric
a
fitting
one
for
the
last
as
i
will
likely
never
feel
her
warmth
again
the
orange
sky
darkens
to
dusk
the
pain
of
the
realization
that
it
must
be
over
now
and
i
will
never
again
see
the
light
of
day
give
up
the
ghost
let
the
salt
water
wash
it
away
the
blood
wash
it
away
ive
waited
wasted
years
somewhat
disappointing
overall
i
feel
a
bit
let
down
by
this
one
gabe
interestingly
noticed
that
the
label
said
aged
in
strawberries
rather
than
raspberries
on
the
front
of
label
it
was
certainly
raspberry
though
and
was
similar
to
the
lindemans
framboise
not
one
of
uplands
better
lambics
would
not
trade
for
again
still
worth
trying
d
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
it
is
very
sour
but
has
good
complexity
the
blend
of
the
fruit
tastes
really
work
well
id
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
while
there
was
little
to
no
head
very
nice
carbonation
level
this
is
a
lambic
id
use
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
750ml
bottle
orangereddish
color
i
expected
it
to
be
pink
no
head
interesting
smell
a
little
sour
and
a
little
funk
flavor
is
perfume
and
fruit
this
is
quite
fruity
but
no
distinct
raspberry
flavor
just
a
general
berry
taste
this
is
better
than
the
blackberry
but
isnt
really
sour
or
tart
kinda
disappointing
if
you
like
sour
raspberries
in
your
beer
this
is
the
brew
for
you
its
exactly
what
the
style
should
taste
like
but
its
some
work
to
drink
it
drinkability
a
very
fine
very
interesting
lambic
good
work
upland
drinkability
is
high
a
very
nice
lambic
tasty
not
too
complex
easy
to
consume
not
overwhelming
on
the
tartness
just
all
around
a
winner
and
enjoyable
to
drink
well
this
being
my
last
one
of
these
from
this
years
release
that
i
will
get
to
try
send
me
a
kiwi
please
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
really
starting
to
miss
the
funkiness
and
biting
acidity
of
a
real
lambic
these
start
to
get
a
bit
bland
after
a
while
though
they
are
certainly
valiant
attempts
in
particular
the
super
aromatic
notes
of
the
raspberry
is
just
to
powerful
for
this
beer
to
remotely
stand
up
to
so
the
nose
is
all
raspberry
my
particular
general
apathy
towards
raspberry
beers
makes
this
one
a
bit
less
enjoyable
than
the
other
upland
lambics
but
it
is
certainly
on
the
same
level
as
the
others
d
a
good
american
lambic
for
sure
and
a
good
beer
but
i
still
prefer
the
oude
belgians
poured
a
murky
pinkish
color
with
a
large
white
head
which
quickly
dissipated
leaving
a
ring
of
pink
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
of
brett
raspberries
leather
wood
and
vanilla
taste
of
sweeter
raspberries
vanilla
some
acidity
wild
yeasts
some
toffee
and
a
sour
finish
thanks
to
clark
for
sharing
this
one
notes
from
and
tasted
on
102508
flavor
is
very
very
complex
and
has
a
really
succulent
and
delicious
raspberry
character
other
notes
of
leather
funk
very
nicely
balanced
beer
mostly
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
fruit
phantom
sweetness
doesnt
interfere
at
all
with
drinkability
resulting
in
a
nicely
balanced
wild
yeast
and
fruit
beer
that
sips
quite
well
my
wife
enjoyed
this
one
which
is
saying
a
lot
i
found
myself
wanting
a
little
more
presence
from
the
flavor
but
its
very
tasty
as
is
drank
this
out
of
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
i
personally
like
these
better
if
you
warm
it
up
to
room
temp
the
taste
seems
to
jump
out
more
so
on
the
raspberry
than
the
other
lambics
and
was
one
of
my
favorites
without
a
doubt
right
on
the
money
with
the
fruit
and
just
the
right
amount
of
lambic
pucker
fruit
is
present
both
from
first
taste
to
after
taste
worth
seeking
out
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
upland
favs
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
pick
up
some
of
the
new
batch
if
you
can
im
not
much
of
a
lambichead
but
i
enjoyed
the
chance
to
try
a
homegrown
small
batch
offering
wow
this
is
by
far
the
most
sour
thing
i
have
ever
drank
before
so
sour
that
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
kiwi
overall
this
sour
is
more
sour
than
average
but
is
very
enjoyable
ojust
too
sour
and
that
is
something
i
never
thought
i
would
say
this
beer
is
harshly
tart
like
most
other
uplands
and
painfully
so
the
kiwi
flavor
peeks
its
way
through
but
in
general
the
tart
quality
is
overwhelming
and
wholly
cringe
and
pain
worthy
over
the
top
acidity
tasted
some
of
the
kiwi
fruit
but
this
is
an
acid
enamel
pealing
bomb
not
sure
why
upland
bottled
and
sold
this
very
sour
kiwi
oak
nice
funk
light
fruity
sweetness
lactic
overall
if
you
like
excessively
sour
beers
youll
like
this
i
get
the
kiwi
up
front
but
then
its
all
sourness
brutally
sour
one
dimensional
much
better
options
out
there
o
one
dimensional
sensationalized
beer
that
is
getting
way
too
much
hype
bottle
poured
a
light
yellow
color
lambic
with
a
nice
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
paint
thinner
is
pretty
intense
with
quite
a
bit
of
acidic
notes
and
sour
notes
also
perceptible
taste
is
also
dominated
by
paint
thinner
notes
with
intense
sour
notes
and
quite
a
bit
of
acidic
notes
kiwi
is
quite
hard
to
distinguish
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
the
paint
thinner
notes
were
a
big
turnoff
for
me
this
was
by
far
the
sourest
upland
ive
had
to
date
not
sure
i
was
getting
much
kiwi
in
the
taste
or
smell
but
it
was
enjoyable
for
someone
that
likes
enamel
stripping
sourness
i
cannot
believe
the
high
marks
this
is
getting
it
starts
out
ok
with
a
nice
hazy
goldtangerine
color
lacto
heavy
citrus
nose
the
first
sip
is
where
everything
goes
wrong
extreme
puckering
and
enamel
erasing
blast
immediately
lacto
overpowered
everything
in
this
couldnt
finish
it
complete
mess
i
love
upland
but
this
falls
flat
on
its
face
overall
another
nice
fruited
lambic
from
upland
not
as
sour
as
some
of
the
others
overall
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
especially
after
seeing
some
of
the
other
reviews
complain
of
rampant
sourness
and
minimal
kiwi
flavor
this
is
less
sour
than
say
la
folie
and
has
a
lot
of
flavors
other
than
sour
going
onit
hits
the
kiwi
perfectly
but
theres
also
some
creamy
sweetness
and
funk
superb
pour
is
hazy
pale
amber
white
a
white
head
nose
is
bright
kiwi
with
faint
brett
notes
fruit
and
tart
taste
has
more
barrel
lots
of
fresh
sawdust
and
kiwi
behind
funk
is
lighter
than
most
uplands
but
barrel
is
very
present
finish
is
extremely
tart
and
has
a
bit
of
acetic
acid
body
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
have
had
this
multiple
times
in
the
past
year
basically
this
is
just
pure
acid
the
liquid
in
the
bottle
has
barely
any
kiwi
flavor
to
it
and
is
so
sour
that
it
feels
like
the
enamel
is
being
stripped
from
my
teeth
and
it
attacks
the
lining
in
my
stomach
its
barely
drinkable
this
was
from
the
first
lottery
batch
i
hope
the
second
round
is
more
palatable
i
enjoy
sours
but
this
one
needs
more
kiwi
flavor
and
less
sour
2010
bottle
sourness
was
over
the
top
kiwi
was
way
in
the
back
but
was
still
slightly
present
very
good
but
i
think
a
bit
past
its
prime
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
good
but
the
carbonation
could
be
a
touch
higher
overall
a
nice
lambic
as
compared
to
the
cherry
lambic
the
extra
hint
of
kiwi
sweetness
adds
an
extra
dimension
overall
this
may
be
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
and
i
think
that
is
the
combo
of
a
sour
fruit
with
the
lambic
base
it
does
display
some
kiwi
flavor
but
no
copious
amounts
this
is
really
a
beer
for
those
that
like
to
pucker
d
finally
i
get
to
try
some
of
the
best
upland
has
to
offer
this
is
worth
the
hassle
and
should
be
opened
very
fresh
its
already
more
bitinglytart
than
if
expected
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
lose
any
more
balance
from
the
kiwi
o
this
is
probably
the
most
sour
of
the
upland
lambics
a
toneddown
acidity
and
more
kiwi
character
would
have
been
nice
cost
25
for
a
750
ml
bottle
overall
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
damn
1010
sour
easily
beatification
and
sour
reserve
3
are
a
lot
more
complex
and
interesting
while
delivering
that
810
sour
quotient
here
its
disappointing
that
im
not
really
getting
any
kiwi
fruit
qualities
this
is
not
necessary
to
age
at
all
i
cant
imagine
how
sour
a
09
kiwi
is
right
now
o
really
tart
lambic
from
upland
that
reminds
me
of
sour
reserve
with
a
hint
of
kiwi
to
it
insanity
sour
level
with
a
super
subtle
but
nice
kiwi
note
flatness
hurts
it
for
me
o
another
great
offering
by
upland
outside
of
their
everyday
beer
this
ranks
just
shy
of
their
malefactor
gilgamesh
in
my
books
its
balanced
very
well
with
a
strong
sour
presence
yet
plenty
of
other
fruity
characters
to
compliment
nicely
o
nice
little
sipper
here
nothing
amazing
just
really
good
the
price
of
admission
is
really
high
though
o
almost
gueuzelike
this
beer
is
just
earthy
and
sour
i
feel
like
kiwi
would
be
a
tough
flavor
to
impart
into
a
beer
but
i
wish
i
could
get
some
fruit
from
it
maybe
it
would
be
fruitier
fresh
delightful
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
lambic
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
fruit
id
definitely
have
more
and
enjoyed
it
a
lot
medium
body
well
carbonated
dry
and
mouthpuckering
on
the
palate
the
kiwi
has
lost
a
step
due
to
age
but
this
is
one
of
those
sours
you
feel
in
the
back
of
your
gums
after
the
first
few
sips
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
next
time
to
see
how
the
fruit
comes
through
but
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
one
overall
this
is
my
second
favorite
of
the
5
or
so
upland
fruited
lambics
i
have
tried
to
date
still
not
as
awesome
as
the
persimmon
but
heads
and
tails
above
the
various
berry
offerings
i
have
sampled
not
sure
how
this
may
have
changed
over
time
in
the
bottle
but
i
hope
i
can
sample
a
fresher
bottle
down
the
road
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
general
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
and
the
kiwi
does
come
out
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
and
has
a
super
acidic
finish
this
beer
has
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
super
crisp
and
acidic
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
taste
that
is
super
drinkable
theres
an
overall
clean
nearly
all
lactic
sourness
that
commands
the
beer
and
shows
restraint
with
the
complexities
of
heavy
must
horse
hair
or
mushroom
earthiness
this
all
allows
the
actual
kiwi
to
shine
through
the
more
aggressive
sour
flavors
though
the
fruit
flavor
seems
melonlike
i
can
also
see
the
influence
of
kiwi
playing
a
pronounced
role
in
the
flavor
spread
well
done
upland
well
done
steer
clear
if
you
dislike
enamelmelting
sourness
otherwise
kiwi
is
the
strongest
offering
from
upland
yet
overall
this
one
is
a
treat
to
drink
great
balance
of
sweet
kiwi
fruit
alongside
the
tartsour
musty
and
barnyard
qualities
expected
from
a
lambic
another
great
job
by
upland
and
i
look
forward
to
cracking
the
remaining
beers
al
has
kindly
sent
me
o
a
really
nice
sour
o
fantastic
fruited
lambic
from
upland
absolutely
seek
this
one
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
not
as
kiwi
forward
as
i
had
imagined
but
the
complexity
and
pucker
factor
make
this
one
a
cantmiss
o
good
surprising
that
its
not
a
belgium
made
lambic
this
one
is
easily
as
good
a
some
of
the
cantillon
ive
had
must
try
for
sour
fans
o
my
first
of
the
upland
lambics
and
this
definitely
has
me
looking
forward
to
the
others
sour
and
funky
but
also
a
nice
fruit
presence
this
is
a
beer
i
can
see
drinking
again
and
again
that
was
my
only
bottle
so
anybody
reading
this
with
a
bottle
id
prolly
trade
you
something
good
for
it

bottle
from
the
most
recent
batch
orange
gold
huge
white
head
great
sweet
and
sour
aroma
lactic
sour
bites
the
nose
but
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
is
just
as
potent
flavors
are
wonderful
the
sour
is
eye
crossing
at
first
but
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
cuts
it
like
a
knife
great
balance
tons
of
carbonation
yet
another
great
lambic
from
upland
d
i
like
this
one
alot
very
heavy
on
the
acidityoakfunk
realm
and
like
on
the
fruit
not
a
ton
of
discernible
kiwi
in
this
but
its
there
definitely
one
of
the
better
uplands
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
very
small
head
surprising
considering
the
reputation
the
upland
lambic
have
for
being
gushers
i
did
chill
it
for
about
20
minutes
in
the
freezer
aromas
are
tart
and
funky
with
lots
of
oak
lemon
juice
and
a
definite
tropical
fruit
aspect
i
dont
think
kiwi
would
be
my
first
guess
but
i
can
see
it
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
tart
and
tropical
with
a
good
amount
of
oak
and
funk
surprisingly
refreshing
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
medium
body
sharp
carbonation
and
dry
puckering
finish
definitely
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
tried
very
wellcrafted
and
delicious
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
one
of
the
better
sour
offerings
from
upland
calebs
got
this
program
dialed
in
mfo
fizzly
carbonation
and
its
dry
flavor
only
intensifies
the
sourness
of
this
beer
its
like
the
end
of
a
box
of
sour
patch
kids
no
kiwi
that
i
could
find
kind
of
disappointing
in
that
way
but
overall
really
good
overall
this
is
in
my
top
2
of
the
upland
lambics
that
i
have
tried
so
far
blackberry
is
the
other
upland
that
i
really
enjoyed

served
in
a
flute
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
carbonated
white
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
no
lacing
either
aroma
is
mostly
tart
fruit
along
with
some
funk
lemon
peel
and
a
bit
of
kiwi
the
taste
is
nice
and
tart
the
brew
tastes
like
lemon
peel
funk
tart
apples
kiwi
and
oak
this
is
definitely
a
tart
and
acidic
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
it
has
high
but
soft
carbonation
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
and
its
my
favorite
of
the
upland
lambics
ive
tried
so
far
19
79
a
bottle
and
worth
every
penny
loved
this
beer
im
partial
to
anything
that
makes
me
pucker
without
leaving
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
zep9865
kyle
this
one
pours
a
dark
and
murky
dirty
gold
in
color
it
smells
both
lactic
and
tart
and
is
on
the
verge
of
gueuze
interestingly
enough
i
even
get
some
california
chardonnay
notes
from
the
oak
unlike
the
persimmon
i
dont
get
fresh
fruit
let
alone
any
kiwi
the
flavor
is
nice
and
tart
almost
a
sweet
and
sour
the
kiwi
fruit
doesnt
really
show
itself
it
eventualy
does
pick
up
some
melon
character
though
its
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
it
is
somehow
fruity
without
showing
the
premiere
fruit
it
finishes
like
it
should
like
a
dry
lambic
with
soft
fruit
character
it
features
really
nice
and
interesting
flavors
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
is
easily
one
of
uplands
best
4
5
d
one
of
my
favorites
i
think
i
would
appreciate
this
just
as
much
if
it
didnt
have
any
kiwi
it
really
doesnt
need
it
tons
of
flavors
with
a
solid
moderate
acidity
make
this
a
great
beer
i
like
this
one
its
super
carbonated
and
super
duper
sour
im
starting
to
like
these
upland
lambics
the
body
is
nice
and
light
with
moderate
carbonation
again
very
clean
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
pretty
impressive
nice
and
sour
with
good
fruit
flavors
best
of
the
uplands
ive
had
so
far
d
i
liked
this
significantly
more
than
batch
1
it
seems
as
if
each
release
of
upland
lambics
is
superior
to
the
last
these
always
seem
to
empty
very
quickly
at
tastings
and
theyre
superb
for
breaking
up
an
onslaught
of
heavier
beers
im
looking
forward
to
cracking
all
the
other
flavors
i
have
cellared
away
big
sour
kiwi
flavor
like
trying
to
eat
an
unripe
hard
kiwi
salty
mineral
flavor
lingers
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
very
sour
but
still
holds
its
drinkability
i
like
the
clean
finish
on
it
o
a
solid
beer
especially
if
i
wasnt
expecting
a
fruit
lambic
theres
some
nice
flavors
from
the
fermentation
and
i
think
the
upland
lambic
program
has
potential
but
this
beer
isnt
quite
world
class
still
tasty
though
o
a
very
interesting
brew
blisteringly
sour
intense
strong
and
complex
although
small
amounts
would
probably
be
best
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
the
very
destinct
lambic
funk
with
some
great
fruityness
coming
in
taste
is
pretty
tart
up
front
with
some
nice
kiwi
fruit
tastes
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
like
nothing
else
i
have
ever
tasted
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
lambic
all
the
way
overall
amazing
beer
o
nice
beer
not
one
of
the
best
but
its
good
and
delivers
on
what
you
think
it
should
be
gets
a
bump
up
in
overall
because
kiwi
itself
is
a
unique
beer
to
make
and
they
did
a
good
job
expecting
even
better
as
they
continue
to
make
these
having
them
side
by
side
this
is
clearly
the
worst
of
the
upland
lambics
the
kiwi
taste
is
not
overly
strong
in
the
first
place
and
placing
it
in
a
beer
doesnt
help
that
flavor
come
through
a
decent
beer
overall
but
nothing
like
advertised
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
a
gusher
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
kiwi
funk
and
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
kiwi
big
funk
and
sour
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
the
sharp
funkiness
of
this
one
really
threw
me
off
a
bit
as
i
was
expecting
the
kiwi
to
dominate
on
this
one
however
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
sure
while
the
funk
was
definitely
the
star
of
the
show
the
kiwi
did
manage
to
add
some
sweetness
to
the
brew
while
the
sour
notes
helped
to
cut
it
a
little
too
this
made
this
brew
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
series
that
ive
had
pours
a
highly
carbonated
hazy
yellow
a
good
amount
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
lightly
fruity
not
so
much
kiwi
but
something
light
and
fruity
a
nice
sour
funk
but
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
tastes
very
unusual
kiwi
i
suppose
but
not
what
i
expected
almost
a
butter
hint
the
funkiness
is
great
and
melds
well
with
the
base
beer
overall
very
tasty
something
im
very
happy
to
have
tried
overall
this
was
about
what
i
expected
beer
is
thin
and
really
bright
on
the
forward
palate
not
as
tart
as
the
others
but
a
nice
acetic
and
succinic
punch
gives
your
taste
buds
a
wake
up
call
pretty
heavily
carbonated
on
the
palate
gives
the
carbonic
boost
to
the
lactic
smoothness
thinning
out
the
sourness
and
carrying
the
beer
to
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
as
good
as
the
persimmon
or
the
raspberry
but
definitely
in
the
top
few
ive
had
overall
a
terrific
fruit
lambic
along
with
persimmon
lambic
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
upland
brewing
company
thus
far
i
really
preferred
the
persimmon
pours
a
semicloudy
orange
like
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
dies
down
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
of
funk
sour
tart
fruit
a
small
amount
of
kiwi
and
more
funk
the
flavor
is
just
brilliant
the
kiwi
is
extremely
well
integrated
without
taking
over
from
the
base
funk
with
this
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
bubbly
carbonation
all
around
the
palate
probably
one
of
my
favorite
upland
lambics
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
them
reviewed

bottle
thanks
to
flssmrbrewalum
this
was
a
delayed
gusher
but
luckily
i
didnt
lose
too
much
pours
a
super
cloudy
dirty
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
that
quickly
subsides
tons
of
yeast
sediment
aroma
of
potent
funk
and
sour
fruit
kiwi
i
guess
flavor
of
sharp
citrus
kiwi
and
sour
funk
in
the
finish
great
palate
for
a
lambic
just
a
touch
of
acidity
but
overall
very
drinkable
this
was
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
lambicssours
i
have
had
in
awhile
reviewed
from
notes
batch
1
a
big
thanks
to
chris
for
sharing
this
poured
into
tulip
color
is
golden
yellow
with
no
head
smell
is
hay
berries
sweet
malts
and
bready
dough
taste
is
very
interesting
coconut
kiwis
cloves
the
kiwi
is
suprisingly
good
not
a
flavor
i
thought
would
come
through
in
a
beer
this
well
a
tiny
hint
of
sourness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
near
still
some
acidity
in
the
finish
a
very
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
exactly
say
it
is
a
lamic
good
drinkability
for
whatever
the
style
actually
is
pours
a
moderate
golden
color
with
a
wee
bit
of
haze
there
is
a
slight
white
head
that
has
some
lasting
power
the
nose
brings
some
tart
light
kiwi
notes
its
not
overpowering
but
it
is
definitely
there
i
really
like
what
it
does
to
the
beer
when
combined
with
a
bit
of
funk
oak
and
sourness
kiwi
is
certainly
a
fruit
that
more
brewers
should
be
using
with
regard
to
lambics
maybe
the
flavor
fades
really
quickly
and
thats
why
either
way
this
beer
combines
the
fruit
with
the
sourness
and
mild
funky
plus
oak
quite
well
nice
feel
and
drinks
incredibly
well
a
good
wild
ale
overall
worth
seeking
out
probably
the
most
lambic
like
of
any
of
the
uplands
i
have
had
my
guess
is
that
the
extra
time
in
the
bottle
has
funkd
this
up
nicely
though
this
is
still
quite
a
long
ways
from
emulating
any
of
the
remotely
traditional
lambic
blenders
brewers
on
the
other
hand
the
kiwi
influence
is
pretty
nonexistent
at
this
point
it
is
interesting
how
fast
this
beer
fades
in
the
palate
after
a
couple
minutes
presence
flavor
and
complexity
of
this
beer
seems
to
drop
out
quite
a
bit
this
is
even
true
after
taking
a
break
from
the
beer
for
about
an
hour
now
if
upland
can
only
figure
out
how
to
carbonate
one
of
these
capture
the
vibrant
fresh
fruit
character
and
have
a
base
beer
that
is
actually
funky
all
at
the
same
time
then
they
will
really
have
something
perhaps
some
of
the
new
batches
have
done
this
hmm
an
easy
to
drink
unique
sour
worth
trying
i
tasted
the
rareness
in
batch
1
but
im
looking
forward
to
tasting
the
improvement
in
batch
2
drinkability
drinks
fairly
easily
i
dont
think
that
i
could
pick
out
any
kiwi
on
a
blind
taste
i
have
been
much
more
impessed
by
their
other
lambics
dr
great
could
have
a
lot
of
these
if
it
was
possible
would
drink
again
given
the
opportunity
but
not
seek
it
out
given
the
rarity
i
would
go
with
a
belgian
anyday
but
great
to
see
an
american
brewery
progressing
so
well
in
this
style
edit
just
had
a
batch
1
and
batch
2
blow
it
out
of
the
water
d
a
very
enjoyable
sour
from
upland
i
think
i
liked
batch
1
better
and
thought
the
smell
of
batch
2
was
a
bit
funkier
would
like
to
try
again
sometime
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
finger
of
head
and
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
and
gave
characteristics
that
it
would
be
nice
and
sour
with
acidic
citrus
notes
popping
out
along
with
slight
brett
oak
and
green
apple
but
really
was
trying
to
find
the
kiwi
within
the
nose
after
every
whiff
the
taste
was
quite
similar
to
the
nose
consisting
of
acidic
citrus
green
apples
and
oaky
bretty
accents
sip
after
sip
and
no
real
big
kiwi
character
on
the
palate
but
it
did
have
faint
pineapple
notes
the
brew
was
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
prickly
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
sour
acidic
and
dry
finish
it
drank
really
good
but
i
wish
it
had
big
kiwi
flavor
alonside
a
sour
punch
oooone
daaaay
d
probably
the
best
of
the
upland
lambics
that
ive
had
with
the
blackberry
being
surpassed
by
this
one
still
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
a
nice
beer
pours
a
hazyyellowish
color
with
a
half
to
full
finger
of
white
head
smell
is
brett
some
more
funk
and
a
very
little
amount
of
kiwi
you
can
smell
some
fruit
and
slight
citrus
but
not
really
kiwi
flavor
is
tart
with
some
citrus
kiwi
is
extremely
hidden
i
wonder
if
the
kiwis
they
used
werent
ripe
enough
that
would
explain
a
lot
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
kiwi
bomb
i
guess
as
i
love
kiwis
but
im
pretty
sure
i
did
see
some
kiwi
seeds
bonus
quite
a
bit
of
carb
on
this
one
felt
really
good
and
it
felt
really
crisp
and
lively
drinkability
is
really
good
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
share
with
friends
but
theres
always
next
release
d
this
beer
is
fantastic
this
years
was
better
than
when
i
have
had
it
before
i
am
glad
i
really
got
to
try
this
one
out
and
wish
i
had
a
bottle
for
the
cellar
do
yourself
a
favor
and
seek
this
one
out
it
just
shows
you
that
even
a
good
lambic
can
be
brewed
in
the
midwest
upland
your
beers
may
be
a
little
balnd
at
times
but
your
lambic
shine
through
and
through
poured
a
recent
ba
tasting
event
courtesy
of
hannot
this
is
the
10
vintage
pours
a
very
unique
cloudy
offyellow
color
with
a
foamy
head
pretty
to
look
at
some
mild
and
earthy
fruit
characteristics
on
the
nose
taste
is
610
on
the
puckermeter
with
fruity
tartness
dominating
and
some
hints
of
kiwi
in
the
aftertaste
best
part
is
the
chunks
of
kiwi
lining
the
glass
and
accumulating
for
a
nice
finish
very
refreshing
and
bright
its
a
refreshing
incarnation
of
lambic
more
of
a
success
than
the
last
batch
and
definitely
something
id
drink
again
recommended
drinkability
really
tasty
brew
that
pretty
much
fits
the
mold
for
the
upland
lambic
family
really
fruity
really
woody
and
ultra
drinkable
the
carbonation
was
much
better
in
this
one
than
the
previous
years
but
it
was
a
bit
much
this
time
around
split
the
difference
and
we
have
a
winner
thank
much
matt
d
of
all
the
varieties
of
fruit
out
there
kiwi
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
though
its
probably
the
texture
more
than
the
flavor
i
dislike
that
said
i
was
happy
with
this
lambic
and
found
the
subtleties
of
the
fruit
usage
pleasing
not
an
amazing
beer
but
a
good
one
and
one
im
glad
to
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
try
i
now
believe
that
a
lot
of
the
hype
on
this
one
was
because
of
how
limited
it
was
continuous
trend
of
this
brewerys
lambics
being
too
sweet
far
from
what
breweries
in
belgium
has
to
offer
might
drink
again
worth
trying
but
wait
until
next
year
when
more
of
it
is
released
and
you
do
not
have
to
trade
too
heavily
for
it
do
not
think
this
one
will
age
and
become
any
better
either
i
actually
think
it
will
do
the
opposite
that
said
pretty
cool
to
try
one
of
only
48
bottles
in
existence
no
carbonation
and
kind
of
watery
in
the
finish
the
lack
of
carbonation
wouldnt
be
too
much
of
a
problem
if
there
beer
had
a
drier
finish
still
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
more
brett
character
to
keep
it
from
tasting
just
like
juice
like
the
blueberry
this
is
a
standout
lambic
wish
more
of
these
could
have
made
it
through
the
barrel
explosion
but
minus
the
2
bottles
i
seen
drank
there
are
still
46
more
bottles
appealing
pink
appearance
with
no
head
less
sour
than
the
other
upland
lambics
ive
had
thinking
the
hype
on
this
one
is
a
pretty
dated
now
us
sours
have
really
come
a
long
way
in
the
last
5
years
both
in
quality
and
selection
this
is
my
first
from
upland
and
i
am
impressed
its
a
beautiful
pour
color
is
hazy
watermelon
pink
the
aroma
tells
you
what
you
are
going
to
get
sour
and
cherry
but
its
all
good
very
clean
and
balanced
looking
forward
to
my
next
bottle
from
upland
palate
was
mostlly
sour
with
minimal
fruit
still
a
nice
lambic
really
sour
like
most
of
uplands
lambics
but
still
detected
the
cherry
very
good
sour
and
not
just
an
acid
bomb
not
as
sour
as
raspberry
flavor
is
good
overall
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
lots
of
sour
cherry
oak
and
a
little
bit
of
funk
as
well
id
still
prefer
a
good
belgian
kriek
over
this
but
its
still
worth
a
try
very
aggressively
sour
like
mostall
upland
lambicstyle
beers
the
color
is
distinctly
cherry
which
is
quite
impressive
looks
like
well
carbed
cherry
juice
the
smell
is
mostly
tart
but
not
overtly
yogurty
or
too
strong
i
do
get
the
cherry
flavor
despite
the
aggressive
tartness
from
this
beer
the
flavor
is
actually
quite
good
for
how
overtly
tart
this
beer
is
unfortunately
2
ounces
was
enough
to
give
me
that
stomach
burn
feeling
i
just
dont
understand
why
these
uplands
have
to
be
so
aggressive
in
the
sourtartness
this
is
the
second
best
ive
had
after
strawberry
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
a
pretty
good
feel
overall
perhaps
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
overall
a
nice
lambic
definitely
a
high
level
of
lacto
sourness
in
this
beer
with
the
age
it
could
be
more
complex
as
for
me
the
cherries
did
not
add
anything
to
the
beer
other
than
more
tartness
and
the
vegetal
notes
did
not
do
it
any
favors
either
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
but
not
complex
with
the
flavors
it
really
pushes
the
boundaries
of
being
too
sour
bottle
poured
into
an
upland
bell
tulip
a
deep
burgundy
color
with
a
full
inch
of
pinkishpurple
head
which
quickly
fizzled
down
settling
at
a
midsized
ringlet
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
and
a
steady
stream
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
heavy
cherry
aroma
acidic
lots
of
lacto
tartness
vinegar
red
wine
there
seem
to
be
mixed
reports
on
this
beer
especially
in
the
sourness
department
but
this
bottle
at
least
was
very
sour
intense
blast
of
tartness
in
the
taste
sour
cherries
acetic
acid
lemon
tannins
notes
of
leather
red
licorice
and
i
even
picked
up
a
subtle
touch
of
cocoa
strange
as
it
seems
tart
up
front
tart
in
the
finish
medium
body
crisp
prickly
mouthfeel
and
if
i
didnt
say
it
before
very
tart
no
problems
with
this
bottle
its
a
very
good
sour
overall
though
im
on
duty
to
conquer
this
whole
bottle
myself
tonight
so
id
better
break
out
the
tums
mouth
is
med
to
lighter
bod
decent
carb
little
acidic
this
is
supposed
to
be
some
pretty
special
stuff
especially
name
dropping
lambic
so
casually
and
i
was
pumped
to
try
it
but
the
experience
was
a
letdown
in
retrospect
its
hazy
cherry
red
like
a
ford
mustang
without
the
shine
sexy
but
soft
pleasant
more
carbonation
than
i
am
accustomed
to
in
a
lambic
which
i
like
the
nose
is
fruity
as
anything
jammy
a
tad
sweet
but
tart
too
intensely
so
in
fact
lactic
and
caustic
almost
definitely
too
much
to
do
a
bottle
alone
i
get
that
from
the
smell
alone
the
taste
is
well
fruited
not
as
authentic
as
some
of
its
peers
but
reasonable
on
the
sugar
and
candy
front
the
sourness
of
this
beer
is
aggressive
almost
unnecessary
its
punishing
and
coats
the
throat
with
a
drying
rough
sensation
like
i
swallowed
one
thousand
sour
patch
kids
at
once
the
fruit
gets
a
little
more
sweet
and
fake
seeming
as
it
warms
but
when
i
focus
i
can
get
fresh
cherries
the
sourness
is
a
distraction
from
everything
else
and
the
wheat
malt
base
is
simply
not
enough
to
convey
the
intended
message
here
carbonation
is
enjoyable
but
the
drying
burning
mouthfeel
is
annoying
to
me
it
serves
no
purpose
a
step
short
of
something
like
motherfunker
but
this
is
not
an
elite
fruited
sour
in
my
eyes
still
keen
to
try
their
kiwi
and
others
but
this
was
in
the
b
range
at
best
oi
was
expecting
a
lot
better
but
this
beer
was
extremely
sweet
while
not
having
much
sourness
to
balance
it
out
o
very
mellow
and
past
its
prime
for
sure
this
flavor
would
have
done
better
with
less
age
did
not
hold
up
against
the
belgian
greats
thanks
again
chad
drink
nice
little
beer
seems
to
be
doing
well
and
not
offensive
as
some
have
said

great
but
what

i
know
jeff
said
and
i

im
just
gonna
drink
sours
from

its
surprising
that
the
upland
lambics
have
been
so
hitormiss
for
me
at
this
point
the
strawberry
and
raspberry
were
amazing
but
the
blueberry
and
now
cherry
have
been
pedestrian
at
best
worth
a
try
because
i
suspect
theres
a
bit
of
bottle
variation
and
you
just
have
to
try
all

drank

only
memorable
for
the
intense

and
lacto
overall
another
solid
lambic
from
upland
the
fruitiness
is
a
little
weaker
on
this
one
than
others
and
that
cause
me
to
like
it
a
little
less
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
vibrant
light
orange
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
and
big
flocks
of
white
sediment
stirring
around
the
bottom
the
nose
is
vaguely
funky
with
light
tart
peach
notes
a
hint
if
puke
and
some
grain
its
a
tart
and
grainy
sour
with
fantastic
peach
flavor
some
lemon
granny
smith
apple
a
great
malt
backbone
and
subtle
fruitiness
that
lingers
in
the
finish
for
an
upland
this
is
a
very
approachable
medium
bodied
reasonably
carbonated
and
drinkable
sour
not
super
acidic
that
amplifies
a
subtle
peach
characteristic
and
maintains
a
great
grain
and
yeast
presence
alongside
id
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
would
rank
it
as
one
of
my
favorite
uplands
overall
so
far
this
might
be
my
favorite
sour
from
upland
oone
of
the
better
upland
lambics
peaches
are
a
great
fruit
and
they
really
come
through
in
this
beer
had
it
again
the
peach
flavor
was
perfect
one
of
the
better
lambics
upland
made
the
extra
3
months
of
age
gave
off
a
perfect
peach
flavor
poured
into
a
wine
glass
very
nice
golden
orange
color
little
head
that
quickly
went
away
not
picking
up
an
peach
in
the
nose
just
the
sour
alcohol
smell
decently
harsh
taste
wow
huge
sour
up
front
hits
you
in
the
corner
of
your
jaw
finished
with
an
amazing
peach
flavor
one
of
the
most
fruit
forward
flavored
lambics
ive
ever
tried
slightly
undercarbed
i
get
what
the
upland
hype
is
all
about
now
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
color
with
no
head
and
some
floaters
nose
has
the
signature
upland
acidic
punch
along
with
fleshy
peach
notes
the
taste
is
very
tart
up
front
with
nice
juicy
peaches
in
the
middle
the
finish
has
some
light
oak
and
nice
fruit
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
another
nice
sour
that
has
a
high
degree
of
tartness
and
plenty
of
fruit
o
peach
is
a
tough
flavor
but
this
beer
was
delicious
not
my
favorite
of
the
lineup
but
great
o
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
as
im
a
fan
of
peach
the
played
off
the
sweetness
of
the
peach
very
well
o
for
its
age
has
held
up
very
nicely
lots
of
peach
still
in
it
though
i
imagine
some
of
it
has
faded
bet
it
is
quite
good
fresh
not
that
it
isnt
now
just
a
different
beast
this
was
brilliant
i
loved
every
sip
another
nice
lambic
from
upland
o
meh
sure
its
a
sour
peach
beer
which
is
always
great
but
there
are
better
ones
by
a
big
margin
b
to
a
range
d
this
was
a
great
lambic
but
the
peach
character
was
quite
subdued
the
scent
and
taste
were
bold
yet
delicate
and
the
body
was
fitting
not
sure
how
this
was
1
5
years
ago
fresh
but
i
wish
there
was
more
peach
at
this
point
otherwise
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
to
sip
and
savor
could
age
a
long
time
as
long
as
you
wont
miss
the
hint
of
peach
recommended
d
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
but
i
could
have
gone
for
more
peach
flavor
really
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
lacking
in
depth
and
complexity

the

a

some

and
about
an

carbonated

that
fizzled

there
isnt

is

it
smells
like

sweet
peaches
lemon
peel
and
musty
earthy
funk
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
sourtart
flavors
are
stronger
than
the
sweet
peach
ones
but
the
tartness
isnt
overpowering
at
all
as
the

warms

really

i
liked

a
bottle
at
liquor
barn
overall
this
was
more
refreshing
than
the
raspberry
not
quite
as
sour
either
really
good
overall
its
a
nice
beer
and
its
enjoyable
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
peaches
but
i
would
drink
it
again
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
has
light
notes
of
a
funky
brett
leather
and
a
touch
of
salt
soft
golden
peach
sits
nicely
behind
the
lambic
notes
the
flavor
is
more
brett
forward
sweetness
is
a
bit
stronger
than
i
anticipated
the
peach
is
clean
and
tasty
with
a
soft
sourness
and
a
nice
acidity
in
the
finish
the
body
is
creamy
light
and
fluffy
with
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
o
great
beer
upland
keeps
getting
better
at
these
things
and
this
is
a
great
sour
for
any
maker
or
country
lovely
lovely
lambic
almost
champagne
like
in
its
carbonationsour
interplay
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
sour
beers
so
far
well
done
peach
sour
not
syrupy
sweet
and
not
too
light
with
the
peaches
solid
o
pretty
frigging
good
easy
to
drink
and
suprisingly
refreshing
good
funk
on
the
nose
with
lemon
rind
and
very
subtle
peach
and
funk
flavor
on
the
tongue
honestly
if
i
didnt
know
this
had
a
peach
addition
i
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
find
the
flavors
in
this
one
worth
a
try
and
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
its
not
peachy
the
beer
could
use
some
drying
out
so
maybe
sit
on
this
for
awhile
if
youre
planning
on
drinking
this
batch
soon
o
overall
not
the
easiest
drinking
beer
this
one
drinks
more
like
a
flavored
soda
than
a
beer
i
think
it
gets
a
little
better
as
it
warms
not
overly
impressed
by
this
one
but
definitely
glad
i
got
to
try
it
totally
different
than
most
offerings
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
uplands
i
have
3
5
overall
a
very
well
done
lambic
that
ill
need
to
acquire
more
of
it
certainly
makes
me
want
to
try
uplands
other
flavors
drink
overall
this
was
good
it
just
didnt
sit
well
in
the
flavor
dept
it
was
lacking
in
pop
over
the
other
beers
in
the
series
the
peach
got
lost
this
was
a
great
drink
i
was
worried
that
there
would
be
too
much
peach
sweetness
but
the
fruit
is
used
perfectly
here
o
not
what
i
expected
good
peach
flavor
could
be
more
prominent
and
whatever
the
opening
alcohol
flavor
was
overwhelmed
my
palette
curious
if
there
was
an
issue
with
my
batch
as
something
here
tasted
off
gracias
to
rempo
for
hooking
me
up
on
the
peach
lambic
very
fun
to
try
i
open
all
of
my
upland
lambics
with
my
wife
and
i
would
definitely
try
again
tons
of
peach
aroma
on
the
front
end
quit
yeast
near
the
end
more
grainy
and
less
aromatic
at
the
finale
initially
poured
very
clear
and
then
clouded
up
on
the
second
pour
mouthfeel
was
average
to
me
i
prefered
the
mouthfeel
on
the
blueberry
a
bit
more
smell
was
the
best
attribute
for
me
on
this
one
and
the
wife
liked
it
more
once
it
warmed

fresh

something

taste
is

lots
of
peaches
on
the
finale
a
bit
of
acidity
but
nothing
like
a
traditional
lambic
palate
is
a
little
sweet
not
quite
dry
enough
count
me
into
the
people
who
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
fruit
sour
but
not
much
of
a
fruit
lambic
well
you
have
the
barnyard
aroma
but
the
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
id
have
it
on
a
regular
basis
though
very
fun
stuff
to
try
this
was
the
nonconsensus
favorite
of
all
the
upland
lambics
i
personally
preferred
the
persimmon
the
fruit
comes
through
beautifully
and
the
clean
tart
and
sweet
flavor
of
the
peach
works
perfectly
to
create
a
subtle
yet
complex
quenching
and
enjoyable
lambic
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
with
myself
and
funkydelic
during
one
of
our
weekly
tastings
bottled
on
101210
batch
4209
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
peaches
and
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
i
found
it
quite
odd
that
there
was
no
sign
of
the
peaches
in
the
aroma
on
this
one
however
the
flavor
made
up
for
this
fact
as
the
peaches
were
quite
prominant
just
something
about
peaches
mixed
with
sourtart
notes
that
make
me
all
fuzzy
inside
no
pun
intended
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
i
suggest
you
do
as
well
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
recommended
o
a
very
good
fruit
lambic
but
really
does
fall
short
compared
to
fou
foune
which
i
understand
is
really
a
upper
echelon
peach
lambic
but
still
solid
and
i
would
love
to
have
another
but
not
sure
this
lived
up
to
the
advance
hype
and
demand
that
this
beer
commanded
around
its
release
definitely
try
it
if
you
have
the
oppportunity
but
dont
go
crazy
trying
to
obtain
it
either
bottle
poured
into
a

abbey
tulip
glass
a

color
with
a

that
collars
around
the
glass
nice
sour
aroma
of
peach
apricot
lemon
zest
and
slight
vinegar
its
not
overly
peachy
in
flavor
slightly
sweet
start
with
hints
of
fruit
lemon
slight
medicinal
and
a
white
wine
flavor
like
chardonnay
the
sourness
level
is
moderate
no
apparent
alcohol
notes
light
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
clean
ending
overall
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
sour
not
overly
peachy
but
enjoyable
id
recommend
this
one
o
i
liked
this
beer
im
rarely
impressed
by
sours
as
my
palate
seems
to
not
be
privy
to
them
at
the
moment
but
this
was
pretty
good
o
maybe
losing
one
third
of
it
to
gushing
soured
this
for
me
no
pun
intended
or
maybe
its
me
comparing
it
to
the
styles
european
brothers
but
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
think
i
traded
a
cantillon
gueuze
for
this
and
although
im
greatfull
for
the
trade
and
chance
to
try
this
i
cant
help
but
feel
i
got
the
short
end
of
the
stick
on
this
trade
my
first
and
possibly
only
try
with
an
upland
lambic
o
this
is
another
very
nice
fruitforward
lambic
from
upland
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
any
of
their
fruit
lambic
if
the
carbonation
issues
were
handled
id
hold
it
in
even
higher
esteem
uplands
peach
lambic
is
quite
good
one
of
the
better
fruited
lambics
that
i
have
tried
im
a
big
fan
this
brew
is
sharp
and
tart
it
has
quite
a
salivation
factor
it
is
easy
drinking
but
the
plastic
and
cardboard
held
me
back
from
fully
enjoying
this
offering
it
is
medium
bodied
and
modestly
to
highly
carbonated
it
is
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
but
if
you
come
across
it
for
a
rediculous
price
of
36
dont
waste
your
time
or
money
there
is
a
lot
of
fruit
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
it
blends
itself
and
balances
out
once
in
a
glass
and
sitting
for
a
few
minutes
big
on
the
one
flavor
and
not
a
real
blended
beer
more
straight
forward
quite
tasty

happily
have
this
again
anytime
definitely
recommended
very
light

relatively
standard

the
complexity
is
just
not
there
when
compared
to
a
classic

or
lambic

is
getting
there
maybe
they
are
intentionally
not
making
it
as
offensive
as
some
lambics
to
appeal
to
more
people
but
i
would
say
this
is
decent

just
not

a

ive

in

years

we
can

batch
properly
carbonated
fruity
with
tangy
peach
moderately
sour
well
done
an
improvement
to
be
sure
d
this
beer
wasnt
as
sour
as
anticipated
but
still
wasnt
a
letdown
good
all
around
and
in
my
opinion
worth
the
price
same
with
the
taste
nicely
sour
with
good
peach
flavors
light
carbonation
still
a
little
buzzy
on
the
tongue
nice
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
than
expected
but
theres
tons
of
carbonation
an
enjoyable
sour
but
the
sweet
peaches
and
the
lambic
never
quite
come
together
to
make
this
beer
great
the
body
feels
more
carbonated
than
it
looks
but
still
feels
a
bit
low
to
me
overall
this
isnt
bad
i
think
i
set
the
bar
a
bit
high
after
drinking
cascade
apricot
this
one
just
doesnt
blow
me
away
i
can
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
wont
be
searching
it
out
d
this
was
really
quite
good
im
really
not
a
fan
of
peach
but
i
liked
this
d
solid
but
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
4
uplands
we
opened
i
thought
all
4
were
solid
but
none
of
them
blew
me
away
d
really
great
damn
what
a
fine
fruit
lambic
overall
not
too
shabby
right
now
id
put
this
well
above
the
strawberry
but
slightly
above
the
blueberry
a
stronger
peach
flavor
profile
would
have
helped
but
in
the
end
this
is
well
made
reminds
me
more
of
a
combo
between
cuvee
renee
and
brute
if
you
want
more
fruit
go
for
the
blueberry
if
tartsour
is
your
game
hit
up
the
peach
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
and
its
sweeter
than
befits
the
style
but
its
nice
tart
and
refreshing
well
done
bloomington
pours
a
hazy
orangepeach
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
into
not
much
other
than
a
thin
collar
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
pretty
impressive
right
off
the
bat
reminding
me
a
lot
of
flaming
fury
theres
a
strong
peach
presence
behind
quite
a
bit
of
a
lactic
character
and
some
mild
funk
the
taste
is
at
the
same
level
not
quite
as
much
of
a
funky
presence
as
i
would
ultimately
like
but
they
held
onto
this
one
for
long
enough
as
the
sourness
and
peach
are
both
at
levels
that
are
highly
complementary
of
each
other
right
now
feel
is
nice
with
a
good
pucker
factor
and
sour
finish
drinks
pretty
easily
i
had
no
problems
at
all
finishing
my
portion
of
the
bottle
at
little
pricey
and
hard
to
come
by
so
it
rates
a
little
low
if
i
were
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
the
upland
lambics
id
grab
a
blueberry
or
datalion
just
based
on
taste
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
however
d
alright
but
the
low
carbonation
and
vinegar
notes
really
ding
this
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
its
just
kind
of
bland
i
know
peaches
are
hard
to
get
a
lot
of
flavor
out
of
so
id
like
to
see
if
the
other
wilds
from
upland
are
any
better
d
this
beer
was
average
for
the
style
upland
really
let
me
down
with
this
beer
and
i
dont
think
ill
ever
buy
this
lambic
from
them
again
bottle
gushed
and
there
were
no
real
lasting
peach
flavor
it
was
good
as
a
flavorless
just
sour
mess
another
stellar
upland
clearly
shows
the
newest
batch
is
on
point
you
gotta
get
you
some
this
bottle
pours
the
muddiest
or
apricot
oranges
with
no
head
at
all
it
began
to
foam
really
quickly
but
i
poured
all
of
it
before
it
could
billow
out
of
the
bottle
it
smells
like
a
very
very
dry
fruit
infused
sour
it
also
has
a
good
amount
of
hay
and
funkiness
it
tastes
of
dried
apricot
and
of
dried
peach
skins
it
reminds
me
of
dried
fruit
through
and
through
the
bitterness
is
both
efficient
and
appealing
the
flavor
is
between
apricot
and
peach
which
is
confusing
i
do
like
it
though
it
drinks
very
crisp
the
carbonation
is
actually
perfect
especially
considering
it
began
to
foam
and
then
that
was
it
this
beer
was
good
but
probably
not
20
a
bottle
good
its
a
good
sour
which
i
had
been
told
but
it
wasnt
spectacular
i
realize
it
was
a
400
or
so
bottle
batch
but
it
couldve
been
better
i
have
another
bottle
so
hopefully
it
gets
better
with
time
good
beer
though
not
great
drinkability
goes
down
oh
so
easy
id
like
it
to
be
more
lambic
with
more
sour
and
funk
and
more
fruit
but
this
is
enjoyable
as
well
upland
uses
a
yeast
strain
that
normally
bothers
me
but
i
dont
pick
it
up
in
this
one
after
trying
it
twice
i
have
had
my
fill
but
the
late
2010
batch
was
definitely
an
improvement
on
the
earlier
batch

a

with
no

at

the
aroma
is
acrid
and
vinegarlike
the
taste
is
much
more
subtly
sour
than
i
expected
the
lambic
is
still
winelike
and
peach
flavored
but
overall
way
better
than
i
expected
im
very
curious
what
hte
abv
is
because
its
no
tposted
but
i
would
get
this
again
if
i
could
ever
find
it
md
mouthfeel
is
very
even
and
smooth
considering
the
extreme
flavors
i
would
call
this
something
im
glad
that
im
splitting
with
people
because
i
wouldnt
want
this
bottle
to
myself
drinks
well
lambic
are
easy
drinkers
but
tough
to
be
impressed
with
a
low
abv
d
just
okay
pretty
much
a
letdown
from
the
getgo
a
flat
pour
followed
by
a
promising
nose
but
fairly
weak
in
the
palate
lacking
the
sourness
and
sharp
acid
base
needed
for
the
style
and
i
was
at
least
expecting
some
tartness
from
the
pits
tasty
enough
but
not
worth
the
expense
of
the
bottle
cheers
nice
peachy
color
flat
no

nice
vibrant
aroma
but
is
it
peaches
its
certainly
fruity
but
not
necessarily
distinctively
peaches
low
level
of
sournessacidity
and
overall
very
underwhelming
in
the
flavor
after
a
fairly
nice
aroma
just
subtle
sweet
fruits
suffers
greatly
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
a
spritzerlike
carbonation
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
i
have
found
this
whole
series
to
be
underwhelming
the
fruit
flavor
was
absent
in
most
all
of
them
blackberry
aside
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
overall
pour
look
could
be
attributed
to
all
but
one
having
a
leaky
cork
not
sure
what
is
going
on
with
these
fully
but
there
are
underwhelming
to
say
the
least
i
would
love
to
see
more
carbonation
and
some
of
that
funk
translate
into
the
flavor
i
like
how
the
peach
is
just
a
note
as
opposed
to
an
overwhelming
flavor
but
this
one
needs
a
little
bit
more
work

it
is
easy
to
drink
and
its
not
that
offensive
but
it
just
isnt
a
great
representation
of
a
lambic
could
definitely
use
some
aging
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
has
the
potential
to
be
a
lot
better
after
the
sweetness
mellows
out
and
the
funk
has
some
time
to
grow
750
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
incredibly
cloudy
peachgrapefruit
color
with
the
consistency
and
look
of
fruit
juice
no
carbonation
is
visible
smells
only
of
brettanomyces
first
sip
is
mostly
brett
but
surprisingly
there
is
plenty
sweetness
left
and
really
not
too
sour
almost
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
in
the
mouthfeel
my
guess
is
a
year
in
the
cellar
and
the
sweetness
will
be
more
eaten
and
well
have
a
funkier
beer
to
enjoy
this
is
certainly
a
drinkable
lambic
mainly
because
there
is
almost
no
funk
in
there
yet
i
have
a
feeling
this
one
will
be
much
more
representative
of
the
style
in
a
year
or
two
when
the
funk
starts
to
come
out
pretty
fruity
in
its
current
state
750ml
bottle
thanks
to
tjthresh
when
i
removed
the
cap
the
cork
was
bubbling
i
wonder
what
it
would
look
like
in
a
couple
years
im
guessing
black
and
moldy
like
a
cantillon
the
first
whiff
i
took
from
the
bottle
got
me
excited
for
the
funk
it
smells
like
a
nice
fruity
lambic
a
little
funk
but
not
distinct
peachiness
the
color
is
hazy
golden
orange
and
it
is
completely
flat
which
is
a
let
down
there
is
hardly
any
sourness
until
the
end
and
the
flavor
is
kind
of
weak
in
my
opinion
resembling
watereddown
juice
sadly
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
upland
lambics
ive
had
good
but
not
the
best
of
7
notes
from
and
tasted
on
102507
definitely
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
this
is
not
bad
though
it
just
could
be
so
much
more
the
lack
of
sourness
much
less
bracing
acidity
one
expects
in
a
lambic
is
a
glaring
hole
and
there
isnt
even
any
barnyard
funkiness
to
up
the
complexity
here
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
a
bit
more
but
would
not
really
have
been
an
issue
if
the
other
lambic
characteristics
had
been
captured
actually
because
of
the
lack
of
sourness
and
funk
the
carbonation
issue
becomes
all
that
much
more
of
a
problem
drinkability
i
really
feel
that
the
fact
that
this
has
almost
no
carbonation
probably
affected
the
flavor
a
bit
which
is
what
keeps
me
from
giving
it
a
5
that
i
know
it
deserves
its
remarkably
delicious
and
the
peach
is
so
perfectly
potent
that
i
almost
cant
believe
it
if
you
have
a
bottle
of
this
you
may
want
to
sit
on
it
for
a
couple
months
just
to
be
sure
its
fully
carbonated
my
score
really
doesnt
reflect
how
good
this
beer
is
because
mouthfeel
and
appearance
have
to
take
hit
huge
thanks
to
matt
for
the
opportunity
lovely
v
i
n
e
g
a
r
this
is
the
3rd
upland
sour
i
have
had
and
while
i
applaud
an
american
brewery
trying
to
make
lambics
they
have
missed
the
mark
in
my
opinion
and
the
product
doesnt
warrant
the
hype
despite
the
heavy
tart
quality
the
fruit
character
makes
this
the
best
upland
ive
had
to
date
oeasily
of
of
the
best
fruited
lambics
upland
makes
overall
very
interesting
almost
undrinkable
as
its
so
sour
but
still
delicious
walks
the
fine
like
of
awesomeness
o
overall
this
beer
was
way
more
sour
then
i
thought
it
would
be
aromatic
tasty
very
impressive
that
it
could
be
so
sour
yet
still
drinkable
while
i
though
i
erred
on
the
side
of
enjoying
highly
sour
fruited
beers
this
beer
just
put
that
to
the
test
all
sour
muddled
fruit
no
finesse
a
rough
go
and
a
downer
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
very
good
feel
overall
a
very
unique
kind
of
lambic
i
have
never
personally
tried
a
persimmon
so
i
cant
really
compare
but
in
this
case
they
seemed
to
add
a
lot
to
the
beer
probably
the
class
of
the
three
variants
that
were
opened
definitely
a
recommend
this
was
the
first
time
my
body
has
ingested
any
form
of
persimmon
or
even
persimmon
flavor
and
it
was
quite
delicious
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
ill
be
let
down
once
i
get
my
hands
on
the
actual
fruit
itself
persimmon
lambic
is
so
delightfully
pure
and
raw
by
nature
though
and
sour
fanatics
will
have
no
trouble
enjoying
this
beer
makes
me
want
the
rest
of
the
upland
lambic
series
now
o
one
of
the
best
of
the
seven
and
just
a
uniquely
flavored
beer
allaround
worth
checking
out
overall
not
really
lambicky
but
a
nice
american
sour
much
better
than
the
kiwi
i
had
a
couple
weeks
ago

wish
i
could
remember
who
to
thank
for
this
treat
but
the
trade
took
place
some
time
ago
this
was
decent
personally
i
think
this
is
rated
a
bit
higher
than
it
needs
to
be
an
interesting
fruited
lambic
for
sure
but
nothing
id
need
to
revisit
ive
had
this
beer
a
number
of
times
now
and
i
think
it
was
best
nearly
a
year
ago
drink
up
now
if
you
have
it
its
most
certainly
not
getting
any
better
though
will
probably
always
be
a
very
tasty
flavorful
very
sour
beer
o
solid
but
i
would
like
to
see
the
fruit
character
enhanced
overall
i
have
tried
all
the
upland
fruit
lambics
except
the
strawberry
i
have
enjoy
most
of
them
and
this
one
is
no
exception
another
solid
sour
beer
from
upland
drinkability
interesting
but
needs
a
bit
more
fruit
ive
now
tried
a
few
batches
of
this
one
a
great
american
sour
though
the
last
bottle
of
this
i
had
was
certainly
better
previous
batch
maybe
seek
this
one
out
its
worth
it
bottle
to
oversized
snifter
looks
good
light
and
inviting
smells
nice
this
was
my
first
encounter
with
the
fruit
persimmon
but
it
smells
great
especially
alongside
the
tartness
of
the
lambic
tastes
solid
light
and
tart
with
a
pleasant
fruit
unlike
anything
ive
ever
come
across
mouthfeel
is
good
too
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
that
ill
definitely
seek
out
again
overall
this
was
a
nice
surprise
and
a
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
regularly
the
aromas
were
out
of
this
world
but
taste
and
mouthfeel
left
me
a
tad
disappointed
considering
what
it
costs
to
acquire
a
bottle
of
this
hopefully
if
they
make
this
again
it
the
carbonation
will
be
more
balanced
out
so
i
can
really
enjoy
the
complex
flavors
here
this
beer
really
surprised
me
the
persimmon
is
an
exciting
new
addition
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
the
great
balance
and
overall
character
i
was
a
little
wary
of
the
carbonation
but
was
very
satisfied
with
its
place
fitting
in
nicely
to
the
overall
profile
not
as
funky
as
some
less
emphasis
on
horselblanket
and
more
on
tart
sour
fruit
and
balance
i
suppose
thats
the
only
thing
i
was
left
wanting
more
of
and
yet
whats
in
the
bottle
is
pretty
incredible
glad
i
opened
it
now
would
have
been
great
to
hang
on
to
for
a
year
longer
wish
i
had
another
bottle
overall
this
beer
is
just
awesome
i
dont
know
what
a
persimmon
tastes
like
but
i
enjoyed
this
so
light
and
refreshing
i
would
love
to
get
some
more
d
despite
the
high
carbonation
level
the
fruit
profile
in
this
is
quite
fresh
and
refreshingvibrant
not
a
ton
of
funk
or
oak
characters
but
the
sour
fruit
is
full
force
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
develops
over
time
d
this
was
a
fantastic
lambic
with
a
unique
scent
and
taste
that
were
super
clean
and
delicious
it
was
complex
yet
simplistic
with
a
fitting
body
and
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
amazing
to
sip
and
contemplate
could
probably
age
a
long
time
lovely
beer
and
highly
recommended
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
aasher
for
giving
me
this
one
during
our
massive
inperson
trade
when
he
came
down
to
visit
thanks
al
slight
gusher
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
subtle
funk
passion
fruit
persimmon
and
slight
sour
apple
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
persimmon
tropical
fruit
tart
sour
and
a
very
slight
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
solid
brew
i
really
have
to
say
that
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
i
have
had
a
lot
of
these
in
the
series
and
this
one
is
definitely
up
there
as
far
as
one
of
my
favorites
the
persimmon
is
definitely
the
star
of
the
show
on
this
one
and
keeps
reminding
you
of
this
fact
throughout
every
sip
a
really
well
done
brew
that
should
be
tried
by
anyone
who
likes
the
style
or
persimmon
you
wont
be
disappointed
pours
a
very
light
yellow
hazy
liquid
violent
inside
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
nose
is
sweeter
than
the
peach
with
some
mineral
notes
up
front
lots
of
fruity
aromas
peaches
mango
light
touch
of
sour
in
the
nose
there
is
a
tang
on
the
fruits
which
i
am
told
is
the
persimmon
never
had
one
the
taste
is
balanced
and
subtl
lightly
sweet
hints
of
tang
with
a
faint
mineral
brett
note
there
is
some
spice
in
the
back
and
a
nice
level
of
sourness
not
overpowering
but
adds
depth
and
is
balanced
wel
the
feel
is
creamy
lively
carbonation
rather
dry
light
crispness
in
the
finish
it
doesnt
get
you
all
the
way
in
the
back
like
cantillon
does
but
all
in
all
a
pleasant
beverage
to
share
with
friends
too
much
for
me
and
my
sb
to
finish
in
one
sitting
i
have
to
say
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
here
but
i
am
happy
i
had
the
opportunity
o
best
i
have
had
of
the
variety
but
these
sour
beers
really
arent
my
favorite
this
beer
pours
a
milky
somewhat
opaque
pear
juice
washed
yellow
it
pours
smoothly
and
medium
in
body
the
nose
is
quite
possibly
the
greatest
and
freshest
nose
that
ive
ever
experienced
in
a
beer
the
aromas
are
full
of
freshly
cut
fruit
melons
pears
kiwis
slight
lactic
sourness
and
persimmons
galore
the
freshness
is
absurd
it
is
just
so
luscious
and
fruit
forward
the
flavors
too
of
tart
juicy
melons
persimmons
fresh
peaches
with
slight
funk
it
is
near
perfect
it
drinks
fresh
sharp
and
crisp
and
goes
down
well
its
hard
to
actually
sip
it
because
i
cant
get
my
nose
out
of
the
glass
what
a
masterpiece
phenomenal
phenomenal
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
wild
ale
i
really
like
the
delicate
flavors
and
champagne
like
carbonation
decidedly
subtle
and
refined
really
enjoying
this
offering
and
absolutely
looking
forward
to
the
strawberry
and
kiwi
that
arrived
in
the
same
box
lovely
persimmon
fruit
counterbalanced
with
the
intense
sourness
and
a
lot
of
funk
very
drinkable
would
definitely
enjoy
another
bottle
or
two
were
it
not
so
limited
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
almost
colourless
a
bit
of
white
head
doesnt
really
look
that
great
smells
sweet
and
fruity
the
persimmon
aroma
is
great
incredible
fruit
aroma
tastes
very
tart
the
fruit
is
simple
and
enjoyable
a
bit
more
sour
than
i
would
like
but
well
carbonated
and
overall
pretty
darn
enjoyable
o
a
strong
tasting
beer
lots
of
tart
its
pretty
dang
good
o
i
absolutely
loved
this
i
dont
drink
this
style
often
but
this
one
may
have
opened
my
eyes
quite
a
bit
grab
or
trade
for
this
if
you
are
a
fan
or
sours
o
the
persimmon
fruit
was
very
delicious
and
seemed
to
take
on
qualities
of
many
differnt
fruits
not
overly
sweet
and
was
very
drinkable
4
5
d
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
this
is
easily
my
favorite
upland
brew
it
captures
the
essence
of
the
persimmon
perfectly
and
presents
it
with
force
there
arent
too
many
brews
out
there
that
are
unique
but
as
of
now
this
one
is
rating
95
out
of
100
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
as
i
had
a
friend
who
made
persimmon
wine
back
home
good
flavor
and
nothing
is
terribly
overpowering
very
good
job
by
my
local
brewer
thanks
again
to
patch
and
strick
for
lending
a
helping
hand
opens
with
a
burnt
yellow
and
huge
head
tremendous
hard
fizzy
head
and
it
keeps
coming
nose
is
of
sourness
and
hay
oaky
presence
from
the
barrel
age
process
as
well
taste
is
first
of
wood
bitterness
and
a
sour
fruit
the
fruit
blends
right
in
with
the
wood
and
i
wish
the
two
flavors
were
segregated
more
i
cant
seem
to
appreciate
the
woody
flavor
here
in
this
lambic
the
persimmon
is
a
nice
sour
fruit
flavor
wish
it
was
more
dominant
mouthfeel
is
crisp
a
rush
of
fizz
hits
the
lips
so
hard
you
can
feel
a
slight
burn
from
the
bubbles
popping
it
is
a
pleasant
sensation
overall
nice
sourness
to
it
very
drinkable
due
to
the
heavy
carb
though
i
feel
to
much
of
this
would
both
upset
my
stomach
and
overpower
my
senses
too
much
oakiness
for
me
o
i
was
very
dissapointed
by
the
nonexistent
carbonation
other
than
that
the
flavors
of
this
really
redeemed
it
its
very
complex
and
refreshing
a
very
good
lambic
i
think
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
overall
very
very
nice
i
would
love
to
sip
this
beer
again
the
aroma
was
beautiful
rich
sour
funkiness
with
huge
touches
of
tropical
fruits
and
notes
of
light
hops
mixed
in
light
peppery
and
spice
notes
come
through
as
it
warms
but
the
sour
funk
was
so
hardcore
the
flavor
was
puckeringly
good
rich
fruits
and
herbal
hoppy
and
lightly
spiced
hallmarks
of
a
great
beer
are
all
over
this
one
as
it
warms
barrel
notes
lots
of
spice
and
a
long
drawn
out
and
very
dry
finish
o
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
disappointing
it
was
a
bit
fruitier
than
some
of
the
other
upland
lambics
and
not
as
funky
as
the
others
i
had
heard
some
people
say
this
was
their
favoritethe
best
one
but
it
definitely
isnt
mine
worth
trying
but
i
like
the
funkier
ones
better
drink
a
very
good
lambic
i
have
enjoyed
all
the
variations
that
upland
is
doing
this
was
dry
fruity
sweet
and
bubbly
edit
i
think
i
had
this
way
to
quickly
after
it
came
out
since
had
it
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
ever
had
smell
adjusted
up
this
is
my
favorite
offering
of
the
upland
fruit
lambics
the
persimmon
doesnt
come
on
strong
but
something
about
it
makes
this
beer
very
subtle
easy
to
drink
and
infinitely
quenching
i
could
have
this
one
over
and
over
again
a
nice
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
one
fresh
in
a
few
months
to
really
experience
the
persimmon
but
this
has
a
nice
bretty
depth
and
the
persimmon
is
a
fantastic
conduit
for
the
wild
parts
of
this
beer
providing
soft
sweetness
tanginess
and
spiciness
id
love
to
see
this
with
a
more
refined
wild
base
and
anticipate
the
second
batch
being
even
better

bottle
thanks
to
flssmrbrewalum
pours
a
cloudy
light
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
of
light
funk
and
a
sweet
smelling
fruit
which
im
guessing
is
the
persimmon
im
not
familiar
with
the
fruit
flavor
is
very
bready
and
malty
with
less
funk
and
fruitiness
coming
out
enjoyable
and
palatable
but
i
wish
that
more
of
the
persimmon
came
out
in
the
flavor
d
super
chugable
very
easy
to
drink
and
my
pour
vanished
quickly
not
an
outstanding
lambic
by
any
means
just
good
and
easy
to
drink
upland
keeps
getting
better
and
better
every
batch
they
make
unique
and
worth
trying
but
id
recommend
familiarizing
yourself
with
persimmons
before
you
do
so
light
bodied
spritzy
maybe
a
little
low
in
carbonation
versus
my
expectation
from
the
gushing
nice
mouthfeel
though
recommended
d
super
easy
to
drink
with
friends
or
by
yourself
good
beer
bottle
from
2008
pours
a
fairly
hazy
peach
with
a
large
loud
head
that
recedes
to
nothing
much
like
a
berliner
weiss
very
weird
nose
is
soft
light
fruits
a
bit
of
barnyard
brett
and
light
sea
salt
kind
of
a
soft
orangelemon
in
the
mouth
dry
oak
lightly
tart
fizzy
kind
of
a
melonlike
sweetness
i
actually
eat
persimmons
fairly
often
and
cook
with
them
and
i
can
in
fact
pick
them
out
here
this
is
more
like
a
soft
spritzy
berlinner
weiss
than
a
lambic
kind
of
in
the
vein
of
festina
peche
but
more
refined
and
interesting
little
sourness
to
speak
of
i
really
enjoy
this
its
quite
an
interesting
take
and
very
well
done
the
oddity
in
flavor
dings
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
some
but
im
sure
i
could
still
enjoy
a
healthy
portion
of
it
d
good
drinkability
it
would
be
best
shared
with
a
few
people
but
its
a
nice
beer
regardless
the
flavor
is
butter
oak
and
slightly
spicy
with
a
lactic
persimmon
character
and
a
light
moderate
sourness
the
finish
is
dry
and
fruity
with
lingering
tannins
and
oak
a
very
drinkable
and
surprisingly
enjoyable
sour
beer
tart
and
fruity
on
the
tongue
persimmon
shines
through
nicely
its
highly
carbonated
excessively
so
which
thins
the
body
a
bit
and
blurs
the
flavors
slightly
i
get
an
herbal
almost
medicinal
or
aspirinlike
flavor
midpalate
refreshing
stuff
very
quaffable
we
finished
the
bottle
in
about
10
minutes
and
i
could
have
gone
for
another
pour
its
only
mildly
sour
though
quite
dry
especially
in
the
finish
which
does
display
a
bit
of
oak
and
tannin
its
a
nice
thirstquenching
beer
not
particularly
outstanding
in
any
way
but
very
good
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
soour
good
fruit
and
funk
balance
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
happy
with
this
one
pours
a
golden
yellow
a
lot
of
carb
with
a
white
head
a
lot
of
lacing
that
stayed
around
a
while
smelt
a
lot
of
funk
and
citrus
tastes
slight
funk
slight
citrus
and
sour
at
the
front
followed
by
a
sour
and
heavy
citrus
finish
very
clean
finish
as
well
i
can
definitely
taste
the
persimmon
on
this
one
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
there
is
a
lot
of
carb
feels
great
right
where
it
should
be
i
really
wish
i
had
another
of
these
d
this
was
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
as
a
lambic
should
be
i
liked
the
flavors
a
lot
but
you
need
to
let
the
carbonation
die
down
for
quite
some
time
before
you
can
get
the
full
enjoyment
d
extremely
drinkable
and
never
gets
overly
sweet
or
acetic
too
bad
it
was
so
rare
please
make
again
upland
bright
and
fresh
citrus
aroma
uniquely
fruity
which
must
be
the
persimmons
in
there
tastes
almost
mimosalike
citrusy
again
with
a
good
level
of
tartness
that
puckers
somewhat
510
on
the
sour
scale
light
bodied
and
soft
on
the
palate
drying
quickly
leaving
traces
of
oak
and
brett
in
the
aftertaste
spritzy
and
fruit
forward
almost
juicy
very
quenching
and
easy
to
drink
if
it
werent
so
scarce
a
bottle
would
go
down
fast
even
several
at
a
time
d
this
beer
was
very
good
to
say
the
least
i
think
it
will
only
get
better
with
age
the
sourness
isnt
very
in
your
face
yet
but
give
it
some
time
and
it
will
be
i
wish
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
to
keep
onto
persimmon
lambic
appears
a
very
light
straw
yellow
hue
with
a
substantial
head
and
copious
amounts
of
caked
on
lacing
wonderful
aromas
of
sour
funk
tart
fruits
and
lemon
zest
make
this
a
very
inviting
beer
the
taste
is
delicious
and
well
balanced
with
more
tart
citrus
and
lemon
zest
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
funky
but
a
tad
overcarbonated
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
really
enjoyed
and
would
love
to
have
again
this
is
a
great
fruit
lambic
for
sure
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
funk
on
the
back
end
but
overall
it
turned
out
to
be
a
great
beer
i
would
recommend
it
trade
for
it
drink
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
hope
they
make
it
again
d
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
the
tart
rather
than
sour
flavor
does
it
well
i
have
high
hopes
for
my
only
bottle
although
it
is
good
now
i
hope
it
will
get
better
with
a
year
of
age
and
perhaps
the
flavors
will
further
develop
d
highly
drinkable
i
presume
this
is
low
in
alcohol
and
provides
great
taste
characteristics
and
pretty
good
complexity
for
a
beer
of
this
size
nice
interplay
of
flavors
and
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
develops
over
time
poured

a
tulip
glass

a
faintly
red

the

and
delicious
big
ripe

jammy
with

sour
and
acid
comes
through
nicely
with
a
nice
yet
subtle
dose
of
funk

well
as
some

clean
and

in

to
the

theres
also
some
dark

notes
very
juicy
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
nice
lingering
tartness
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
feels
just
slightly
incomplete
for
me
the
raspberry
is
hinted
at
the
sour
starts
to
pucker
but
then
gives
way
to
a
cheese
curd
finish
very
interesting
and
i
would
definitely
have
again
but
it
just
needed
something
more
to
get
to
great
for
me
overall
this
is
tasty
and
well
done
puckering
raspberry

im
told
not
quite

its
pretty

cheers
o
an
impressive

extreme
taste
thats
perhaps
too
much
of
a
mix
of
sweet
sour
and
funky
but
a
good
brew
that
definitely
provides
a
good
fix
for
a
sour
craving
poured
a
light
red
body
with
minimal
pink
head
that
died
quick
with
lace
patches
on
top
of
an
overtly
razzy
aroma
and
little
bits
of
sweetness
as
well
stronger
than
other
lambics
so
its
a
little
boozy
in
the
finish
but
other
than
that
a
pretty
good
beer
and
textbook
lambic
has
a
strong
raspberry
taste
that
is
sourfunky
but
not
too
strong
and
has
a
minor
bit
of
razzy
sweetness
but
not
sugaryover
sweetened
the
tartness
is
just
right
for
me
as
i
can
keep
drinking
this
beer
without
getting
sickened
by
being
over
tartpuckering
or
over
sweetenedcloying
and
a
great
dessert
beer
overall
tart
and
refreshing
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
good
stuff
overall
a
really
nice
fruit
lambic
the
sweet
and
tart
flavors
complement
each
other
and
there
is
plenty
of
funk
a
really
nice
framboise
maybe
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
of
the
bigger
lambic
makers
but
still
a
nice
treat
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
versions
d
this
was
a
very
nice
raspberry
lambic
the
scent
and
taste
had
a
great
balance
of
sweet
fruit
and
sour
funk
the
body
was
appropriate
but
the
finish
was
really
intense
so
it
must
be
sipped
could
age
for
a
long
time
but
pretty
enjoyable
fresh
sold
brew
o
this
beer
has
a
very
bold
amount
of
funk
the
nose
is
akin
to
a
gueuze
i
liked
this
one
because
the
fruit
made
the
taste
a
little
more
palatable
but
wasnt
sweet
o
i
love
how
the
tart
funkiness
in
the
aroma
of
this
beer
continues
to
intensify
as
the
beer
warms
i
really
enjoy
the
fact
that
this
one
is
not
sweet
and
has
no
natural
or
artificial
sweeteners
added
this
one
is
kind
of
intense
similar
to
a
gueze
so
if
you
do
not
like
those
you
might
want
to
avoid
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
look
forward
to
trying
some
of
its
sibling
offerings
o
for
the
price
even
with
it
being
cheaper
than
usual
i
shouldve
just
stuck
with
the
goto
belgians
but
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
had
the

overall
i
was
really
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
like
to
have
seen
a
little
bit
more
of
that
traditional
lambic
funkiness
but
thats
only
a
minor
complaint
this
ranks
in
the
upper
echelon
of
raspberry
lambics
ive
had
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
layer
of
off
white
head
that
fades
away
quickly
the
color
is
quite
nice
the
nose
is
full
of
raspberries
with
some
lambic
funk
and
a
strong
oak
presence
the
flavor
follows
from
the
smell
but
the
raspberry
fades
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
leaving
you
with
oak
and
a
lemony
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
with
lots
of
smooth
carbonation
and
an
extremely
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
lambic
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
fruit
goes

a

to

some

lemon
as
well
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
raspberry
color
well
carbonated
to
maintain
a
thin

that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
presents
a
tart

that
screams

raspberries
it
doesnt
pop
as
much
as
a
raspberry
ananke
but
does
well
to
present
the
fruit
forward
the
taste
is
quite
distinctly
sweet
raspberries
up

followed
by
a
great
mix
of
funk
and
bitterness
in
the
beers
finish
the
mouthfeel
is

lightmedium

well

and
a

overall
this
is
a
bit
overpriced
but
definitely
a
solid
raspberry
sour
o
i
have
had
better
framboise
but
i
have
to
look
a
lot
harder
to
find
them
not
too
shabby
of
a
fruit
lambic
the
pungent
tartness
is
there
no
doubt
but
it
also
has
the
good
grace
to
allow
the
malt
and
other
fruit
characteristics
some
lesser
airtime
a
midlevel
example
of
the
style
when
youre
thinking
of
stepping
up
your
game
beyond
the
introductory
sugarheavy
players
this
was
a
lot
better
than
expected
i
approached
this
beer
with
some
trepidation
but
this
is
a
very
well
done
raspberry
sour
its
fairly
expensive
but
its
a
really
nice
legitimately
lambicish
raspberry
sour
and
that
justifies
the
price
for
me
o
a
tasty
raspberry
lambic
wine
adds
a
nice
twist
to
the
beer
price
tag
was
high
but
i
am
very
happy
that
i
picked
this
up
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
lambics
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
id
certainly
drink
this
anytime
onot
a
bad
effort
the
beer
was
not
as
complex
as
the
best
lambics
out
there
but
the
fruit
flavors
were
genuine
tasting
not
artificial
as
can
sometimes
be
the
case
with
fruit
lambics
imho
if
you
dig
raspberries
here
you
go
wow
the
second
spontan
beer
for
me
and
definitely
my
favorite
this
one
pours
a
really
robust
ruby
red
almost
artificial
looking
like
this
color
is
digitaly
enhanced
or
something
a
nice
white
head
rests
on
top
stained
pink
just
a
bit
the
nose
is
crazy
raspberry
this
feels
more
intesely
raspberry
than
the
kriek
did
cherry
its
fruity
but
not
sweet
with
a
really
funky
tart
yeast
backing
everything
up
the
yeast
and
the
fruit
combine
to
do
wonderful
things
this
isnt
a
sour
in
the
classic
sense
but
it
is
tart
rather
than
sweet
that
funk
on
the
raspberries
is
totally
unique
like
nothing
ive
tasted
before
and
i
really
really
like
it
its
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
but
its
a
nice
one
to
try
its
got
a
medium
body
and
supercharged
carbonation
an
excellent
product
as
all
mikkeller
beers
seem
to
be
high
b
where
i
have
found
mikkeller
beers
to
be
ultra
challenging
and
complex
i
have
also
been
critical
on
the
aspects
of
those
complexities
that
i
have
found
unrefined
or
too
challenging
to
my
palate
i
cannot
say
any
of
that
here
this
is
an
authentic
tasting
sour
beer
that
deserves
the
stage
with
hanssens
and
boon
this
beer
is
a
bit
pricey
at
12
but
if
youre
trying
to
explore
sours
sooner
or
later
you
have
to
plunk
down
more
money
than
youd
like
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
it
was
a
very
educational
pour
i
wouldnt
advise
this
to
someone
new
to
sours
in
fact
i
might
come
back
to
it
someday
after
ive
had
a
few
others
a
good
sour
beer
lack
some
brett
vibes
though
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
oversized
wine
glass
proper
poured
a
deep
dark
ruby
red
with
a
one
finger
light
pink
head
that
remained
throughout
the
glass
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
fruit
raspberry
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
funk
raspberry
fruit
and
very
subtle
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
upon
taking
the
first
smell
on
this
one
i
was
quite
excited
as
it
really
reminded
me
of
rose
de
gambrinus
minus
the
usual
cantillon
funk
it
was
also
quite
a
nice
looking
brew
as
well
the
flavor
however
had
a
earthy
note
to
it
that
cut
into
some
of
the
sweetness
which
definitely
hurt
it
slightly
for
me
i
really
wish
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
as
besides
that
this
was
a
really
good
brew
that
could
have
received
very
high
marks
from
me
havent
had
it
before
what
the
hell
are
you
waiting
for
o
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
spontans
thatbive
gotten
to
try
very
nicley
done
gear
tartness
and
fruit
flavor
the
musky
oak
bitterness
worked
a
bit
better
with
this
one
and
felt
a
little
tones
down
on
this
one
o
for
the
style
it
was
really
good
refreshing
and
sour
with
lots
of
fruit
i
am
kinda
of
hit
or
miss
on
lambics
however
this
one
was
good
agressive
pour
yielded
wonderful
head
that
dissipated
to
some
thin
nice
lacing
nice
cloudy
dark
purple
color
with
a
soft
sour
scent
with
a
hint
of
rich
raspberry
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
nicer
and
better
carbonated
than
the
spontanale
overall
a
wonderful
raspberry
lambic
with
a
nice
sweet
undertone
from
the
fruit
to
offset
the
tartness
o
this
is
a
high
quality
lambic
from
a
brewer
that
never
fails
to
surprise
im
really
digging
this
beer
its
not
often
that
foreign
brewers
do
an
authentic
lambic
well
i
hope
that
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
this
series
live
up
to
this
ales
standard
d
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
its
better
than
the
lowerend
lambics
we
get
in
the
us
van
honsebrouck
oud
beersel
but
doesnt
quite
stack
up
with
stuff
like
hommage
or
veritas
006
still
if
the
price
was
right
id
buy
this
again
hopefully
soon
as
i
hear
these
are
coming
stateside
a
nice
lambic
but
the
overall
flavour
profile
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
best
3f
and
cantillon
beers
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
there
is
seemingly
no
indication
of
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
it
is
drinkable
but
a
bit
of
a
mess
that
never
quite
comes
together
to
be
an
enjoyable
brew
there
are
just
a
bunch
of
things
about
this
experience
that
are
offputting
worth
a
try
absolutely
something
i
would
have
again
probably
not
a
375ml
bottle
split
between
2
people
was
more
than
enough
overall
simple
and
solid
extremely
drinkable
and
unlike
the
spontonkriek
the
higher
abv
is
undetectable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
it
seemed
to
be
inline
with
the
other
lambics
from
lindemans
with
this
one
showcasing
apples
and
i
think
it
does
a
good
job
of
it
and
it
makes
for
a
good
dessert
beer
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
refreshing
clean
a
little
crisp
a
little
sticky
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
half
a
small
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
well
the
apple
was
showcased
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
funky
yeast
didnt
show
up
in
the
taste
like
it
did
in
the
aroma
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
trying
it
especially
if
you
like
apple
beers
and
dessert
beers
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
i
think
the
sweetness
and
lack
of
complexity
held
it
back
a
little
but
in
the
end
i
did
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
its
not
a
favorite
lindemans
beer
and
its
a
little
above
average
for
the
style
nice
job
guys
this
was
a

after

overall
this
is
a
very
good
sweetened
fruit
lambic
style
all
around
good
robustness
and
balance
of
apples
pale
malt
and
fruity
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
this
is
more
pleasantly
flavored
than
the
other
variants
but
still
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
not
something
for
everyday
pretty
interesting
beer
great
with
all
types
of
fruit
desserts
such
as
a
fruit
tart
i
give
it
a
81
this
cost
6
dollars
at
total
wine
not
worth
the
price
for
sure
o
a
pleasant
beer
not
as
sweet
as
most
of
the
beers
in
the
style
which
is
a
good
thing
no
complexity
but
you
dont
really
expect
anything
more
o
one
of
the
more
preferable
flavors
in
my
opinion
still
way
to
sweet
for
me
to
drink
regularly
i
gave
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
to
my
unknowing
wife
who
as
if
on
cue
exclaimed
its
like
a
jolly
rancher
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
decent
head
tons
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
smells
like
apple
and
tastes
like
it
too
nice
clean
and
refreshing
reminds
me
more
of
a
champagne
than
a
beer
sweet
with
no
link
to
a
beer
nonetheless
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
a
summers
day
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
i
really
like
lindemans
framboise
raspberry
juice
great
and
have
been
curious
about
the
apple
for
a
while
so
the
apple
is
good
but
not
amazing
its
like
fizzy
apple
juicewhich
is
what
i
was
hoping
forwith
a
hint
of
beer
taste
which
makes
it
more
interesting
than
apple
juice
it
tastes
light
and
not
too
too
sweet
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
but
i
would
probably
go
to
the
raspberry
first
overall
a
sweeter
and
tasty
apple
lambic
that
is
a
rather
easy
and
pleasant
drinker
loads
of
tart
or
sour
green
apples
in
the
flavor
with
a
smooth
enough
malty
character
hidden
deep
within
it
is
what
it
was
meant
to
be
i
was
not
anticipating
a
good
beer
after
the
aroma
but
this
is
really
quite
good
its
not
as
good
as
their
kriek
or
gueze
but
i
havent
had
any
other
pomme
lambics
to
compare
it
against
im
sure
its
not
the
best
in
the
style
but
its
still
very
tasty
recommended
starts
with
sweet
apple
then
a
blast
of
sour
green
apple
not
as
an
intense
sour
as
compared
to
other
lambics
though
with
a
musty
finish
with
a
touch
of
funk
mouthfeel
is
light
with
above
average
carbonation
a
bit
sticky
from
the
sweetness
pours
a
nice
crystal
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
thing
white
head
some
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
unlike
a
hard
cider
or
a
redds
even
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
apples
and
grain
that
taste
wasnt
as
strong
as
the
aroma
but
was
pretty
good
lots
of
apple
taste
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
too
sweet
as
some
other
hard
cider
type
drinks
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
serving
cheese
fondue
etc
o
this
was
much
more
sour
than
expected
much
more
than
their
framboise
i
dint
know
if
the
two
years
of
age
has
anything
to
do
with
it
or
not
the
sour
notes
were
very
enjoyable
but
the
apple
flavor
itself
seemed
rather
one
dimensional
overall
i
could
see
why
this
was
marked
down
with
a
new
apple
ale
every
five
minutes
this
one
was
pushed
way
in
the
back
still
like
the
sour
cherry
and
framboise
it
taste
more
real
that
that
artificial
stuff
even
for
just
under
6
bucks
its
really
not
worth
a
revisit
overall
its
not
that
cidery
but
its
not
quite
beer
either
its
alright
but
considerably
sweeter
on
the
palate
than
on
the
nose
overall
extremely
sweet
desert
beer
here
it
is
what
it
is
crisp
and
bubbly
mouth
drinks
spritzy
and
refreshing
a
nice
beer
to
toast
with
tart
green
apples
sweet
juicy
flavor
light
tart
finish
not
cloying
and
not
too
funky
a
nice
balance
of
tasty
goodness
here
i
dig
it
and
my
wife
loved
it
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
in
the
warm
months
and
would
make
a
nice
alternative
to
cider
in
the
fall
overall
this
is
a
solid
fruit
lambic
the
fruit
in
this
case
being
apples
is
there
in
abundance
this
is
a
sweet
refreshing
brew
which
will
go
down
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
to
many
of
these
in
a
row
without
something
a
little
bitter
in
between
in
order
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
but
the
sour
helps
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
this
brew
is
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
sour
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
flute
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
frothy
light
bright
white
head
that
forms
a
sparse
surface
coating
as
it
settles
aromas
of
apple
tart
and
sweet
with
some
subtle
grassy
highlights
flavors
are
more
richly
sweet
than
the
nose
leads
you
to
believe
with
a
tart
candylike
apple
sweetness
blended
with
hints
of
a
roasted
apple
sweetness
light
crisp
and
effervescent
in
mouth
the
beer
has
a
tangy
sweet
aftertaste
light
crisp
finish
with
a
subtle
tartness
lingering
behind
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
very
nice
tasting
beer
bit
too
sweet
and
not
sour
enough
for
my
liking
though
could
easily
confuse
it
for
a
cider
o
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
glad
to
have
found
this
one
though
it
was
overpriced
not
one
i
would
particularly
go
out
of
my
way
for
as
a
cider
where
available
would
do
the
trick
if
you
are
going
for
this
sort
of
flavour
i
do
enjoy
it
immensely
and
it
has
more
body
than
most
ciders
would
go
well
with
fatty
meats
overall
well
i
preferred
this
to
the
lindemans
geuze
but
it
is
still
a
little
worrying
that
this
stuff
is
marketed
as
lambic
overall
one
of
the
better
pairings
of
beer
and
apple
the
lambic
retains
enough
presence
that
you
dont
wonder
why
you
didnt
simply
grab
a
cider
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
flute
glass
very
bubbly
appearance
and
a
solid
head
is
retained
towards
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
were
numerous
floating
particles
as
well
the
nose
is
not
surprisingly
apples
with
some
brown
sugar
as
well
the
taste
is
very
sweet
almost
like
hard
cider
with
the
apple
being
the
dominant
flavor
although
this
has
a
onedimensional
approach
at
first
sip
the
beers
complexity
becomes
apparent
at
times
hints
of
sourness
especially
overall
a
good
beer
that
will
definitely
turn
some
off
with
its
pungent
apple
taste
but
once
you
get
past
that
there
is
much
to
enjoy
in
this
case
i
must
say
that
my
enjoying
of
this
beer
definitely
comes
from
bias
on
my
part
to
its
flavors
taking
me
back
to
my
childhood
memories
where
candy
was
quite
predominant
its
still
pretty
mellow
and
exactly
as
i
expect
an
apple
beer
to
be
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
lindemans
soon
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
wet
juiciness
of
the
included
fruit
each
sip
of
this
beer
left
your
mouth
watering
for
more
but
with
just
enough
punch
and
pucker
to
the
tartness
to
make
you
take
your
time
the
nose
is
fresh
and
soured
again
with
all
the
necessary
fruitiness
and
pop
for
a
solid
execution
the
feel
follows
suit
making
the
case
for
this
guy
even
stronger
ive
only
had
the
pleasure
to
try
lindemans
apple
and
raspberry
lambics
and
i
definitely
prefer
the
apple
to
the
raspberry
when
poured
the
head
was
a
beautiful
and
fluffy
white
with
the
color
of
the
beer
being
a
cloudy
amber
similar
to
the
color
or
apple
juice
but
without
the
clarity
it
was
tart
and
crisp
sour
with
the
pleasant
tastes
of
the
wild
yeast
very
much
in
the
background
and
subdued
the
carbonation
was
very
appropriate
not
overly
or
under
medium
thin
mouthfeel
lindemans
pomme
lambic
was
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
its
a
great
celebration
beer
that
can
easily
be
used
in
place
of
a
asti
champagne
final
thoughts
literally
like
drinking
sparkling
apple
juice
would
i
drink
it
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
o
strongly
apple
flavored
beer
suitable
for
nonbeer
lovers
as
an
introduction
to
the
lambic
style
this
stuff
is
tasty
but
im
slightly
biased
towards
green
apple
it
doesnt
have
a
strong
beer
character
and
even
the
lambic
notes
are
secondary
to
the
tart
and
sweet
flavors
and
aromas
of
the
apple
this
stuff
is
certainly
delicious
but
id
have
to
limit
myself
to
one
almost
more
of
a
juice
than
a
beer
o
maybe
a
touch
too
old
but
its
still
a
tasty
fruit
lambic
the
general
hatred
towards
this
brewery
is
understandable
but
fruitless
pun
in
my
opinion
they
dont
produce
uber
limited
stinky
brett
walez
they
make
attainable
and
well
priced
sweetened
fruit
beers
if
you
like
apples
you
wont
hate
this
beer
o
i
like
lindemans
apple
o
overall
another
good
lambic
from
lindemans
though
not
my
favorite
as
i
like
dark
fruits
better
this
one
is
straight
up
sweet
green
apples
i
think
if
you
like
hard
cider
and
apple
juice
you
would
really
like
this
one
pours
slightly
cloudy
reddishgolden
beer
with
decent
offwhite
head
and
specific
sediment
smell
of
cider
and
green
apples
no
more
a
taste
follows
the
smell
sour
apples
good
carbonation
light
body
very
light
and
drinkable

notes
poured

a
light
orange

with
a
small
white
head
pleasant
sour
apple
aroma
carbonated
sweet
and
sour
apple
flavor
finishing
with
sour
apple
and
a
slight
bitterness
pleasant
light
bodied
lambic
much
like
a
sparkling
cider
i
enjoyed
it
overall
this
is
a
nice
tasting
beer
but
its
a
bit
too
sweet
and
not
sour
enough
for
my
taste
when
im
drinking
a
lambic
i
want
to
know
im
drinking
a
sour
beer
this
is
sweet
enough
to
almost
make
one
confuse
it
with
a
cider
tried
a
bottle
of
this
at
gigs
in
london
pours
a
golden
yelloworange
colour
this
instantly
reminded
me
of
a
jolly
rancher
with
the
strong
apple
flavour
and
slight
sour
finish
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
its
crazy
how
much
apple
flavour
they
were
able
to
get
into
it
interesting
beer
o
a
really
delicious
lambic
i
enjoy
it
not
necessarily
more
than
their
other
lambics
but
rather
just
differently
the
fruit
notes
are
more
up
front
and
sour
its
really
delicious
but
one
would
have
to
be
my
limit
on
this
one
delicious
instead
the
sweetness
here
really
kills
it
for
me
but
thankfully
it
isnt
as
bad
as
some
of
their
others
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
gueuze
d
another
fantastic
lindemans
offering
but
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
a
brewery
thats
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
definitely
another
one
to
revisit
this
summer
on
a
nice
hot
day
pleasant
tasty
and
refreshing
but
not
quite
as
complexbalanced
as
their
framboise
overall
anfantastic
beer
for
peoplenwho
are
not
a
fan
of
bitter
hops
in
their
drinks
excellent
postnosh
brew
o
a
great
example
of
this
style
but
not
my
first
choice
of
a
beer
since
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
great
if
you
like
a
fruit
beer
though
o
clearly
not
the
most
authentic
of
lambics
but
it
is
very
refreshing
and
bloody
tasty
give
it
a
shot
this
beer
has
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
bit
of
nice
white
head
with
good
retention
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
outside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
not
as
sweet
or
cloying
as
the
framboise
it
gave
me
hope
that
maybe
this
would
not
be
the
sweet
mess
that
that
beer
was
some
green
apple
and
very
mild
funk
the
flavor
was
like
a
melted
green
jolly
rancher
sweet
sour
apple
not
very
appealing
mouthfeel
was
way
too
heavy
and
carbonation
was
too
low
interesting
beer
but
it
was
really
just
not
at
all
my
preference
way
too
sweet
almost
like
sucking
on
a
hard
candy
overall
this
beer
far
exceeded
my
expectations
i
had
had
many
cider
style
beers
and
wines
before
but
this
one
did
a
great
job
of
actually
keeping
the
apple
flavor
and
really
bringing
it
to
the
front
as
far
as
the
apple
flavor
category
goes
this
went
above
and
beyond
other
offerings
it
put
the
framboise
to
shame
o
i
probably
enjoyed
this
more
than
most
people
do
im
a
fan
of
hard
ciders
and
this
one
tasted
like
a
hard
cider
aged
in
an
oak
barrel
its
complex
refreshing
and
damn
good
i
dont
know
if
lindemans
just
uses
apple
syrup
or
the
real
thing
and
frankly
i
dont
care
because
the
result
is
amazing
o
a
good
example
of
a
apple
lambic
overall
i
enjoyed
it
as
i
enjoy
almost
all
of
lindemans
offerings
poured
from
a
355
ml
bottle
into
a
lindemans
flute
dark
champagne
color
and
very
clear
with
active
carbonation
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smells
really
nice
of
apple
pear
and
some
herbals
very
sweet
smelling
taste
mimics
the
aromas
very
closely
at
first
this
was
terrifically
refreshing
but
as
it
went
down
and
warmed
a
bit
the
sweetness
got
a
big
cloying
for
me
this
tastes
very
similar
to
pear
ciders
that
i
have
had
but
with
more
carbonation
i
would
turn
to
this
for
a
refreshing
summer
beverage
nice
crisp
apple
flavor
with
the
slightest
sourness
on
it
reminds
me
of
again
apple
jolly
ranchers
thin
with
higher
carb
and
a
wet
finish
yummy
beer
poured
into
a
8
oz
flute
glass
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
falls
quickly
very
little
lace
smell
is
very
strong
apples
and
champagne
taste
is
like
hard
cider
and
champagne
were
mixed
70
cider
and
30
champagne
body
is
fairly
thin
i
dont
have
very
much
experience
with
the
style
i
assume
this
is
usual
lots
of
carbonation
and
easy
drinking
if
you
can
handle
some
sour
apple
this
is
so
different
than
a
beer
it
amazes
me
that
it
is
called
beer
not
a
bad
change
of
pace
overall
enjoyable
but
i
think
that
the
black
cherry
flavor
is
more
enjoyable
personally
this
one
resembles
apple
juice
cider
too
much
for
me
to
believe
it
is
beer
incredibly
delicious
and
would
complement
any
apple
pie
as
a
desert
treat
my
first
ever
lambic
such
a
treat
overall
below
average
fruit
beer
seems
more
like
a
cider
o
this
is
a
nice
gateway
lambic
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
one
is
nice
to
share
with
a
newbie
d
4
5
appearance
is
gold
with
a
nice
foam
hay
this
is
a
lambic
so
rate
this
as
if
it
was
not
a
traditional
beer
smell
is
of
green
apples
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
strong
with
bubbles
and
sits
nice
on
the
tongue
lays
there
slightly
the
tastes
is
of
a
good
green
apple
a
good
old
granny
smith
overall
this
is
a
lambic
and
is
nice
may
we
suggest
you
mix
this
half
and
half
with
some
carmamel
porter
ahhhh
and
that
is
from
the
dutchman
hans
enjoy
this
lambic
have
you
ever
had
a
green
apple
blow
pop
if
so
then
you
know
what
this
smells
and
tastes
like
add
in
a
fizzy
translucent
golden
appearance
and
a
spritzy
feel
and
there
you
have
lindemans
pomme
it
is
better
than
say
cider
but
worse
than
the
other
sweet
lindemans
fruit
lambics
o
not
a
big
fan
of
the
apple
finding
i
like
framboise
much
better
if
you
really
like
apple
flavor
this
is
worth
trying
otherwise
id
pass
poured
a
2
white
head
which
dissipated
quickly
clear
apple
juice
gold
color
smells
mildy
of
sour
apple
taste
is
a
fairly
clean
and
tart
green
apple
and
truly
its
like
you
just
bit
into
a
fresh
one
its
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
anticipated
and
for
that
reason
it
stands
completely
opposite
the
last
apple
beer
i
tried
which
was
more
like
apple
pie
the
sour
of
the
lambic
style
comes
through
nicely
in
the
end
a
classy
and
refreshing
fruit
beer
o
i
wanted
to
hate
this
but
it
wasnt
too
bad
really
obviously
sweet
and
a
far
cry
from
real
lambic
but
pretty
tasty
for
what
it
is
pours
a
mostly
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
lots
of
effervescent
bubbles
stream
non
stop
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
a
champagne
type
of
look
smell
is
mostly
of
granny
smith
apples
not
much
else
feel
is
light
high
carbonation
a
little
tartness
from
the
apples
is
present
the
taste
is
kind
of
what
i
expected
its
got
a
load
of
nice
granny
smith
apple
sourness
which
i
like
followed
by
loads
of
sweetness
this
is
far
closer
to
an
apple
cider
than
a
beer
overall
an
okay
beer
not
something
i
would
normally
get
perhaps
a
good
dessert
beer
none
of
these
fruit
lindemans
are
my
type
of
drink
and
if
i
had
to
choose
one
i
prefer
the
frambrosie
or
the
kriek
over
this
o
this
was
very
enjoyable
i
expected
it
to
be
too
sweet
but
it
wasnt
at
all
outside
of
the
semiartificial
apple
scent
this
met
my
expecations
going
in
o
tastes
great
on
a
hot
day
but
too
sweeet
to
drink
more
than
one
overall
impression
had
very
high
expectations
for
this
beer
because
of
seeing
the
beer
list
33
wine
bar
limited
amounts
of
cantillon
lindemans
3
fonteinen
etc
beer
was
way
too
sweet
for
a
lambic
but
didnt
mind
it
a
very
1
sided
beer
with
no
real
complexity
and
this
concludes
that
this
should
be
a
fruit
beer
and
not
a
lambic
w
added
fruit
im
on
to
the
next
lindemans
now
ooverall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
i
like
to
drink
this
kind
of
beer
specifically
this
brand
every
once
in
a
while
to
spice
things
up
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
good
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
prost
this
beer
was
shared
and
reviewed
with
the
girlfriend
this
beer
pours
a
bright
gold
lightly
hazy
and
moderately
light
in
body
my
girlfriend
says
it
has
a
fingernails
worth
of
head
haha
it
smells
like
a
slightly
sweeter
version
of
the
green
apple
jolly
ranchers
it
tastes
like
overly
sweet
apple
juice
with
a
sour
tinge
its
also
along
the
same
lines
as
the
jolly
ranchers
its
a
little
too
sweet
my
girlfriend
says
its
not
even
close
to
the
peche
it
drinks
light
but
a
little
sticky
from
far
too
much
sugar
the
flavor
doesnt
really
linger
too
long
overall
it
isnt
lindemans
best
effort
but
its
drinkable
its
a
little
sweet
but
its
ok
overall
this
tastes
like
a
green
apple
cider
plus
a
cup
of
sugar
definitely
one
of
the
poorer
offerings
from
lindemans
and
no
where
as
good
as
the
peche
or
framboise
d
id
drink
again
but
not
a
second
glass
or
buy
frequently
at
all
a
dessert
beer
definitely
this
lambic
pours
as
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
looking
white
head
on
it
there
just
a
bit
of
haze
in
there
once
its
all
in
the
glass
the
smell
of
fermented
apples
are
there
along
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
decent
in
my
opinion
i
think
that
its
a
pretty
reasonable
mix
between
sweet
and
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
can
be
drank
pretty
quickly
in
my
opinion
this
beer
doesnt
compete
with
floris
apple
from
belgium
o
very
tasty
although
it
gets
a
little
sickly
3
5
maybe
not
something
to
compete
the
truly
serious
brews
but
certainly
a
great
party
beer
it
seems
like
the
quality
of
a
lindemans
lambic
is
in
how
much
the
real
complexity
and
character
come
out
underneath
the
fruit
and
how
well
its
balanced
this
is
a
good
beer
but
less
than
framboise
with
my
favorite
thus
far
being
peche
the
very
first
one
i
ever
tried
poured
the
color
of
cider
turbid
34
inch
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smells
of
cider
and
candy
apple
flavoring
taste
was
rather
unlike
any
other
beer
the
taste
reminds
me
of
apple
champagne
if
they
made
apple
champagne
from
artificial
apple
flavoring
the
most
notable
aspect
was
the
slightly
sourbitter
taste
that
was
somewhat
tricky
to
detect
i
would
have
almost
missed
it
if
i
hadnt
been
analyzing
the
flavors
the
small
alcohol
presence
came
through
and
tasted
like
an
american
adjuncttype
flavor
the
aftertaste
starts
out
purely
sweet
apple
candy
flavoring
the
finish
is
reminiscent
of
apple
wine
or
champagne
notes
i
like
this
beer
as
a
novelty
beer
it
is
interesting
but
only
in
small
amounts
or
as
a
dessert
beer
if
im
gonna
drink
a
fruity
beer
give
me
a
samuel
smiths
cherry
ale
drinkabilty
very
easy
to
drink
but
all
the
sugar
and
sweetness
would
be
too
much
after
a
bottle
or
so
not
very
much
booze
so
yea
you
can
drink
alot
but
i
wouldnt
do
so
a
nice
change
up
or
to
have
on
hand
for
a
female
that
doesnt
like
beer
pours
like
apple
juice
but
with
a
beer
head
smells
like
apple
juice
more
then
a
cider
though
taste
is
strongly
of
apples
with
a
finish
of
wheats
and
spices
it
is
a
pleasant
taste
though
not
strong
it
is
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
if
the
cost
were
not
so
high
it
would
be
too
easy
to
drink
drinkability
tastes
great
not
a
session
beer
but
makes
a
great
gateway
beer
for
newbies
getting
into
new
styles
on
most
days
i
would
not
give
two
schlitz
for
lindemans
pomme
but
when
im
in
the
mood
yeah
sure
though
this
was
so
incredibly
undrinkable
after
the
first
5
ounces
or
so
it
almost
became
a
chore
to
finish
the
12
oz
bottle
d
designed
to
be
consumed
en
masse
despite
mixed
feelings
about
this
stuff
it
goes
down
easy
this
beer
poured
nicely
and
looked
promising
with
gold
color
and
a
nice
head
it
had
a
strong
green
apple
aroma
but
was
too
candy
sweet
for
my
tastes
it
was
more
like
a
champagne
or
cider
than
beer
im
not
a
huge
lambic
fan
but
i
was
hoping
it
would
pair
well
with
pad
thai
i
couldnt
finish
it
if
your
are
a
lambic
fan
it
might
be
for
you
this
is
a
light
and
fruity
tart
brew
it
has
great
character
and
based
on
the
brewing
method
it
is
an
extremely
intriguing
brew
i
will
have
this
again
had
this
before
but
decided
to
retaste
it
to
see
how
my
opinions
of
it
have
changed
if
at
all
it
pours
a
clear
apple
juice
almost
apropos
right
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
green
apples
and
white
grapes
everythings
very
sweetsmelling
let
me
tell
you
the
taste
continues
this
sweet
tradition
with
a
combination
of
green
apples
and
white
grapepeach
juice
tasty
despite
the
sweetness
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mildly
sticky
finish
overall
a
nice
little
treat
a
bit
sweet
for
a
proper
lambic
but
i
still
generally
enjoyed
it
the
overtly
sweet
tastes
make
this
a
little
less
drinkable
for
me
easy
to
drink
good
enough
beer
delivers
what
youd
expect
d
like
i
am
with
apple
juice
and
cider
this
beer
is
incredibly
quaffable
the
alcohol
is
low
but
its
borderline
too
sweet
from
the
fruit
syrup
otherwise
its
a
pretty
average
lambic
that
drinks
easily
looks
fine
and
tickles
the
tongue
just
enough
i
am
not
sure
how
much
of
this
i
can
stand
but
a
single
glass
goes
down
nice
and
fast
pours
a
clouded
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
greenish
tint
frothy
whitish
head
with
awesome
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
and
tart
green
apples
granny
smithlike
with
only
a
trace
of
the
impending
doom
of
sweetness
that
follows
in
the
flavor
flavor
starts
off
pleasantly
tart
and
sour
like
biting
into
a
crisp
fresh
granny
smith
before
an
unrelenting
syrup
sweet
green
jolly
rancher
flavor
takes
over
and
refuses
to
clear
the
palate
long
into
the
finish
better
than
i
expected
but
still
disappointing
and
missing
the
mark
from
a
true
lambic
was
a
nice
way
to
try
this
in
their
holiday
gift
pack
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
separately
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
consume
not
a
beer
to
have
frequently
but
a
few
times
a
year
is
just
about
right
for
me
probably
not
for
the
hardcore
ba
who
only
wants
the
top
of
the
heap
for
each
style
but
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
lindemans
and
more
importantly
its
one
of
the
few
beers
the
boss
likes
so
i
can
purchase
them
whenever
d
medium
only
thing
working
against
this
is
the
strong
tartness
had
as
pomme
lambic
aroma
is
strong
rich
and
fruity
rather
sweet
more
like
a
cider
than
a
beer
it
pours
a
clear
bubbly
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
flavor
is
quite
lipsmacking
fruity
and
sweet
like
a
cider
but
having
subtle
hints
of
hops
and
malt
sure
could
mistake
this
for
a
cider
though
but
its
still
a
satisfying
beverage
and
thats
what
matters
texture
is
smooth
lively
and
fizzy
leaving
behind
a
nice
sour
apple
finish
drinks
easily
and
is
a
good
fruit
lambic
refreshing
as
well
not
the
best
for
the
style
but
a
decent
choice
very
drinkable
verges
on
cloying
though
a
little
more
complex
and
apparent
funk
notes
that
the
framboise
i
recently
had
o
like
most
lindemans
offerings
it
is
easy
to
go
down
this
one
is
quite
the
thirst
quencher
looks
a
strawyellow
color
smells
like
green
jollyranchers
it
also
tastes
like
green
jolly
ranchers
it
had
an
impressive
head
around
it
with
a
lot
of
lacing
its
taste
is
super
sweet
a
little
sour
real
nice
tastes
like
apple
juice
for
sure
pretty
drinkable
but
very
sweet
definitly
on
the
sweet
end
of
lambics
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
like
drink
a
good
granny
smith
apple
d
an
after
dinner
beer
one
glass
should
suffice
too
candied
and
sweet
nice
apple
touch
but
rather
tart
which
is
good
but
the
sweet
backing
kind
of
kills
it
though
it
is
a
lambic
and
that
is
the
style
drinks
very
well
the
beer
itself
is
drinkable
but
at
6
a
pop
i
dont
think
ill
be
trying
this
again
its
too
sweet
and
predictable
for
my
tastes
its
not
awful
but
theres
so
many
other
sourslambics
that
are
much
more
interesting
apple
character
is
dialed
up
really
high
herenot
bad
at
all
but
this
is
certainly
at
the
far
end
of
the
sweet
lambics
if
you
want
more
of
the
lambic
flavor
to
come
through
let
it
breathe
and
warm
up
a
little
rather
than
drink
it
at
the
cold
temperature
3841
f
that
is
advised
pair
this
with
a
walnutandgrape
chicken
salad
sandwich
good
mouth
feel
and
carbonation
very
refreshing
just
a
bit
one
dimensional
pours
a
apple
juice
colored
yellow
with
a
white
head
and
mountains
of
carbonation
good
lacing
smells
of
apples
and
light
grain
and
malt
tastes
of
granny
smith
apples
with
malt
to
lessen
the
sour
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
drinkability
is
high
db
the
lindemans
fruit
formula
it
is
almost
like
candysodabeer
i
enjoy
the
flavor
but
can
see
where
others
would
not
like
this
highly
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
wifes
favorites
definatly
a
beer
worth
a
try
thats
widely
available
age
has
done
this
beer
justice
mellowed
it
out
some
and
brought
just
a
touch
more
funk
out
but
i
wouldnt
paticularly
go
out
of
my
way
to
age
it
again
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
1
of
these
not
the
best
lambic
ive
had
but
decent
really
a
decent
fruit
lambic
pretty
simple
but
enjoyable
again
this
is
not
something
i
will
get
all
the
time
but
it
is
a
good
refreshing
summer
brunch
or
hot
afternoon
beer
on
an
occasion
d
for
me
id
only
have
one
of
these
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
these
in
any
quantity
unless
for
a
special
occasion
d
a
tasty
brew
that
could
easily
substitute
champagne
for
any
occasion
fruity
for
sure
with
a
tart
crispness
however
it
being
a
fruit
lambic
it
just
tastes
like
an
alcoholic
apple
juice
a
gallon
of
this
would
be
easy
to
consume
though
goes
down
extremely
easy
very
easy
to
drink
flavors
are
not
to
my
preference
but
not
offensive
could
be
enjoyable
under
the
right
circumstances
this
one
is
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
the
375ml
bottle
was
more
than
i
wanted
to
finish
on
my
own
i
wouldnt
pair
this
with
to
much
it
really
is
desert
on
its
own
however
creamy
cheeses
would
work
very
well
with
this
be
sure
to
serve
it
cold
between
two
and
three
degrees
celsius
and
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
is
super
sticky
and
very
bubbly
the
beer
is
a
sipper
unless
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
drank
this
in
a
pint
glass
color
is
rustyhazy
with
sediments
spinning
about
there
is
a
decent
head
that
leaves
a
ring
down
the
glass
not
a
fan
of
the
overpowering
sourness
but
seems
to
be
an
all
around
quality
beer
for
its
style
there
isnt
much
complexity
to
the
pomme
version
but
the
apple
flavor
is
really
superb
a
great
after
dinner
sipper
hell
i
could
drink
this
for
breakfast
overall
a
pretty
one
note
lambic
big
apple
sweetness
but
not
much
else
it
was
enjoyable
but
it
tastes
a
bit
much
like
a
jolly
rancher
for
my
taste
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
at
least
di
like
the
lambic
style
and
this
is
good
wish
it
werent
so
expensive
serving
type
tap
poured
into
the
lindemans
flute
slight
chill
haze
and
pale
golden
in
color
very
minimal

on
the

aroma
is
sour
apples
with
just
a
hint
of
funky

musty

appetizing

at

the
flavor
starts
with
a
dose
of
green

does

gets
complimented
by
some
mild
funkiness
not
as

it
still
has
a
noticeable

that
seems
to
go
well
with
this

refreshing
and

worth
a
try
if
you
like
sour
apple
final
notes
a
musttry
for
green
apple
fans
makes
either
a
great
dessert
beer
or
breakfast
beer
liked
this
one
a
little
better
than
the
framboise
d
very
good
but
very
apple
ciderapple
soda
like
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
d
well
great
if
you
like
apple
juice
its
not
really
my
thing
drinkability
another
exceptional
fruit
lambic
by
lindemans
definitely
worth
a
try
d
im
sure
this
is
as
they
intended
its
just
lacking
in
tartness
and
is
too
sickly
sweet
for
my
taste
big
active
white
head
on
top
of
a
bubbly
hazy
light
gold
brew
fair
ammount
of
lacing
the
scent
is
pretty
sour
apples
and
barnyard
very
sour
taste
makes
ya
pucker
up
apple
juice
is
the
main
course
pretty
sweet
very
active
mouth
pretty
thin
and
wet
me
likey
the
only
difference
between
the
nose
and
the
palate
is
its
a
little
sweeter
on
the
tongue
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
are
great
on
a
very
hot
day
but
having
more
than
one
or
two
and
it
becomes
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
liking
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
apple
with
some
light
tartness
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
apples
both
sweet
and
tart
the
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
apple
cider
medium
high
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
this
has
nothing
in
common
with
other
belgian
lambics
but
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
a
good
one
an
enjoyable
fruitladen
lambic
one
that
relies
on
the
inherent
tartness
of
the
apple
with
little
in
the
way
of
extra
sugar
rendering
a
decent
balance
between
the
tart
and
the
sweet
along
with
the
cassis
and
the
raspberry
versions
there
seems
to
be
a
divide
developing
in
this
line
of
entrylevel
fruit
lambics
i
e
sweet
vs
not
so
sweet
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
lots
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
its
a
good
beer
to
start
out
before
moving
on
to
other
styles
drinkability
its
good
and
ill
drink
it
again
but
i
dont
think
i
can
drink
more
than
one
per
night
the
aroma
from
this
hits
you
immediately
pour
this
into
a
snifter
and
it
just
blasts
your
olfactory
senses
its
not
just
a
sharp
sour
apple
aroma
a
little
alcohol
and
wood
bleed
through
it
has
a
fairly
standard
cider
look
to
it
with
a
bit
of
foam
high
carbonation
gives
this
a
club
soda
feel
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
green
apple
peel
tartness
with
a
little
lemon
and
oak
underlining
it
all
certainly
not
a
preference
of
mine
but
for
a
lambic
it
is
very
pleasant
gezondheid
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
strong
apples
tart
malt
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
lambic
fruit
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
there
is
a
strong
tartness
present
as
well
tastes
of
apple
yeast
tart
malt
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
an
average
lambic
really
great
but
something
this
dry
needs
food
or
a
meal
soon
after
my
first
lambic
very
good
but
not
very
beerlike
at
all
basically
it
looks
like
apple
juice
it
smells
like
sour
apple
you
pretty
much
get
whats
advertised
here
taste
like
apples
of
course
it
is
slightly
sour
but
nothing
unbearable
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
lambics
after
having
this
drinkability
a
very
good
lambic
probably
my
favorite
one
yet
very
fruity
but
thats
expected
d
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
all
of
this
by
myself
the
big
candy
flavor
profile
this
one
brings
off
though
leaves
me
to
only
drink
up
to
12oz
at
a
time
before
moving
onto
something
else
good
beer
for
the
girls
or
people
who
say
they
dont
like
beer
really
enjoyed
this
couldnt
do
anymore
than
1
at
a
time
though
unfortunately
this
beer
was
to
sweet
for
me
and
with
kind
of
aggressive
carboration
very
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
between
two
lagers
but
no
more
d
this
is
one
of
the
few
fruit
lambics
that
i
can
drink
the
whole
pour
of
granted
i
only
get
the
stuff
when
its
on
special
at
the
bar
but
its
worth
a
try
sometime
somehow
i
think
im
being
a
little
too
generous
here
anybody
else
remember
the
horror
that
was
apple
bach
from
cherryland
anyway
poured
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
soon
subsided
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
hazy
amber
aroma
is
solid
tart
apples
flavor
is
solid
sweet
tart
apples
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
is
fizzy
finish
is
like
flavor
doubt
that
ill
ever
have
another
overall
this
isnt
great
the
feel
is
a
bit
powdery
and
crisp
but
the
sweetness
adds
a
very
full
body
this
beer
was
too
sweet
for
me
i
am
the
same
with
sweet
and
dessert
wines
they
are
just
too
much
for
me
still
the
flavor
is
good
and
i
like
the
hints
of
sourness
present
in
it
overall
a
nice
fruit
beer
whose
simple
flavour
and
quenching
body
make
it
an
easy
drinker
id
take
the
framboise
any
day
but
this
is
pleasant
enough
d
highly
drinkable
and
with
nothing
to
convience
you
otherwise
maybe
if
you
dont
like
apples
d
this
makes
a
good
dessert
beer
but
not
much
else
as
its
sweetness
can
get
to
be
cloying
after
a
few
sips
like
i
said
it
has
a
pleasant
taste
but
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
beer
this
came
in
a
gift
pack
with
a
bottle
of
the
framboise
and
a
lindemans
fluted
glass
the
glass
is
very
nice
and
the
lambic
was
above
average
also
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
frothy
layer
on
top
i
love
the
smell
it
is
like
pure
fresh
apple
juice
the
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
it
starts
as
sweet
apple
then
the
sour
lambic
follows
and
the
sweetness
comes
back
at
the
finish
it
feels
dry
but
no
carbonation
this
the
other
lambics
it
seems
to
be
a
great
drink
for
toasting
i
probably
would
not
want
more
than
2
in
a
sitting
d
if
you
like
green
apple
jolly
ranchers
this
is
for
you
if
you
dont
then
you
should
probably
avoid
one
bottle
was
plenty
for
me
overall
a
plesant
drinker
one
glass
is
about
all
i
can
handle
though
great
dessert
beer
ive
had
all
of
the
lindemans
fruit
lambics
thanks
to
my
wife
who
is
obsessed
with
them
as
well
as
their
other
offerings
and
this
is
the
first
one
ive
taken
the
time
to
give
a
grade
im
very
torn
as
to
what
way
to
go
lindemans
obviously
takes
a
different
approach
to
their
lambics
than
other
belgian
brewers
they
are
making
an
approachable
sweet
fruit
beer
than
is
very
nonoffensive
and
gives
any
alcopop
a
run
for
its
money
i
dont
know
whether
to
grade
it
on
what
i
think
a
lambic
should
taste
like
or
what
lindemans
were
trying
to
achieve
with
this
beer
tastewise
it
is
very
similar
to
ng
apple
ale
but
sweeter
im
going
to
grade
this
on
what
i
believe
the
brewery
was
trying
to
achieve
with
this
beer
on
that
note
it
is
a
decent
beer
although
i
have
a
very
had
time
drinking
a
full
glass
of
these
kind
of
beers
cheers
d
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
lindemanns
as
the
flavor
at
least
varies
a
little
here
and
has
a
bit
of
character
with
the
building
sourness
and
trace
of
cloves
and
belgian
yeast
flavor
id
have
this
again
given
the
opportunity
but
wouldnt
be
too
excited
to
seek
it
out
on
the
other
hand
quite
a
sessionable
beer
d
goes
down
very
easy
however
it
is
very
sweet
and
sour
so
that
may
limit
the
amount
of
drinkability
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
this
was
a
nice
little
dessert
number
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
rather
small
pure
white
head
that
settled
into
a
ring
very
nice
granny
smith
apple
aroma
quite
sweet
which
reminds
me
of
the
green
apple
jolly
rancher
the
taste
is
of
sweetened
apple
juice
more
red
delious
than
granny
smith
some
nice
apple
skin
tartness
definitely
very
sweet
not
much
tart
or
sour
very
nice
apple
flavor
a
nice
light
feel
with
tingly
carbonation
again
sweet
on
the
palate
with
a
touch
of
tartness
a
very
sweet
lambic
with
very
little
balance
but
great
apple
flavor
a
very
nice
dessert
beer
but
like
most
lindemans
i
would
really
only
want
one
in
a
sitting
drinkability
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
here
perhaps
it
is
the
tartness
or
just
the
refreshing
nature
of
the
style
but
i
find
this
beer
eminently
drinkable
md
lively
on
the
tongue
with
a
dry
champagne
like
finish
medium
bodied
levels
of
sweet
fruitiness
and
tartness
fom
the
apples
and
yeast
a
nice
lambic
this
is
worth
rebuying
especially
for
nonbeer
drinkers
or
wine
drinkers
good
drinkability
but
it
tastes
a
bit
too
much
like
apple
juice
for
me
cider
would
be
a
cheaper
alternative
body
is
light
but
effervescent
and
pleasant
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
very
good
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
other
varieties
offered
by
this
brewery
overall
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different
or
want
a
mild
sipper
with
a
meal
drinkability
is
decent
for
bas
who
love
sugary
liquids
solace
can
be
found
here
but
the
fruit
and
sweet
notes
seem
to
overpower
any
chance
of
other
notes
to
balance
them
out
beautiful
light
golden
color
slightly
hazy
with
large
rocky
head
with
good
lace
all
the
way
down
nose
is
straightforward
apples
apple
cidery
and
a
sharp
miscellaneous
citrus
zing
in
there
too
palate
offers
a
great
sweet
n
sour
flavor
with
apple
as
the
focus
and
the
yeasty
bready
flavors
are
there
to
complement
nicely
finish
is
long
and
sweet
and
is
very
appetizing
d
the
sweetness
of
this
was
almost
too
much
for
me
tastes
mostly
like
thick
sparkling
apple
juice
with
a
tart
kick
a
little
more
subtlety
would
have
made
me
happier
it
works
for
what
it
is
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
fruit
lambics
but
there
is
no
fault
that
i
can
find
with
it
either
if
you
have
a
hankering
for
apple
then
this
lambic
wont
let
you
down
holy
apples
batman
purchased
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
local
beer
store
probably
my
favorite
lambic
from
lindemanns
its
a
good
drink
yellow
and
cloudy
in
color
carbonation
formed
a
complete
and
tall
head
three
fingers
fell
off
by
head
remained
steady
nice
carbonation
filled
the
area
with
an
huge
smell
of
sour
apple
its
an
apple
beer
and
it
does
not
fail
to
deliver
apples
goes
down
easy
a
very
good
beer
imo
i
need
to
research
lambics
more
to
see
if
its
a
good
example
of
a
lambic
ive
heard
people
complain
that
lindemanns
does
not
make
true
lambics
not
sure
about
this
all
in
all
a
delightful
beer
this
would
go
well
with
a
thanksgiving
dinner
or
chicken
salad
had
this
over
dinner
w
my
nonbeer
drinking
wife
bc
she
tried
the
framboise
earlier
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
likes
lambics
poured
a
clear
gold
almost
yellow
even
body
w
a
wellcarbonated
twofinger
head
that
quickly
died
and
left
little
lacing
a
tart
apple
smell
almost
like
apple
juice
and
little
else
goes
down
watery
and
slick
but
not
in
a
bad
way
a
quite
tasty
and
easy
going
fruit
beer
and
i
enjoyed
the
glass
i
had
taste
is
more
sweet
than
tart
as
i
didnt
find
myself
puckering
at
all
like
some
tart
lambics
ive
had
more
than
a
glass
or
two
of
this
though
and
ill
probably
be
feeling
a
little
ill
poured
into
my
unibroue
tulip
glass
on
easter
sunday
to
enjoy
with
dinner
it
pours
a
very
cloudy
tanyellow
color
with
little
head
there
is
a
huge
smell
of
granny
smith
apples
on
the
nose
very
tart
the
taste
is
good
it
tastes
like
crisp
apples
it
reminded
my
a
lot
of
a
hard
cider
i
probably
couldnt
pick
out
the
difference
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
would
prefer
most
of
the
other
flavors
over
this
especially
framboise
thank
you
to
nick
and
candace
for
the
complete
review
great
for
what
it
is
overall
just
not
my
thing
feel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
heavier
on
the
palate
than
the
floris
it
also
has
a
drier
finish
which
compliments
the
forwardness
of
this
beers
more
forground
lambic
flavor
carbonation
feels
spritzy
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
though
i
think
that
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
ill
srping
for
the
floris
instead
very
drinkable
indeed
good
summmer
and
fall
drink
d
the
brewers
at
lindemans
are
geniuses
when
it
comes
to
lambics
ive
not
had
a
lambic
yet
that
even
comes
close
i
will
always
be
a
fan
of
this
brewery
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
note
abv
is
4
according
to
the
label
d
lindemans
knows
what
they
are
doing
in
the
lambic
category
i
enjoyed
the
very
sweet
and
mature
mix
of
flavors
notes
this
beer
really
delivers
on
what
it
promises
an
apple
based
lambic
and
so
i
will
give
it
a
high
rating
for
accurately
portraying
those
tastes
taste
is
also
good
if
unsurprisng
could
it
be
apples
the
interesting
thing
here
is
that
i
can
taste
a
variety
of
apples
as
the
drink
progresses
across
the
palate
and
it
isnt
as
sugary
as
i
was
expecting
from
lindemans
much
closer
to
the
kriek
than
the
framboise
in
sugar
content
if
both
of
those
sound
crazy
sweet
to
you
stay
away
otherwise
mouthfeel
is
close
to
a
sparkling
wine
and
drinkability
is
mixed
but
good
very
easy
to
drink
but
so
rich
as
that
you
probably
wont
want
another
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
the
sweetness
hinders
the
drinkability
somewhat
but
i
could
still
drink
this
for
a
while
wouldnt
be
bad
with
desert
but
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
3
95
taste
tart
green
apples
not
as
big
of
an
apple
flavor
as
i
expected
m
d
kind
of
syrupy
yet
a
good
sipper
the
sweetness
gets
kind
of
grating
though
very
much
like
some
good
cider
all
and
all
highly
drinkable
and
a
good
thirst
quencher
though
the
artificial
sweetener
leaves
a
quite
unpleasent
dry
feeling
in
your
mouth
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
d
too
strangely
artificially
flavored
for
me
although
i
am
sure
they
use
real
ingredients
they
wind
up
with
green
jolly
ranchers
d
i
could
drink
this
stuff
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
very
good
i
did
a
lot
of
complaining
in
this
review
but
overall
it
is
an
interesting
beer
but
its
just
not
what
i
expected
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
id
try
it
again
ive
found
another
lindemans
offering
id
rather
have
then
the
widely
available
framboise
raspberry
give
this
to
a
nonbeer
drinker
and
see
how
theyll
react
delicious
i
mentioned
in
another
review
that
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
abv
in
the
lindemans
i
have
found
a
nice
trick
to
raise
this
in
the
pomme
get
some
apple
schnopps
thats
about
20
proof
and
poor
a
shot
in
the
glass
then
pour
your
pomme
it
makes
the
beer
a
tad
sweeter
but
doesnt
over
do
it
its
adds
more
alcohol
as
well
as
a
bit
more
taste
d
i
like
it
i
liked
the
cherry
more
as
this
one
seems
to
be
more
imbalanced
but
i
still
wouldnt
mind
having
another
drinkability
bit
too
fruity
for
me
still
good
though
not
your
typical
beer
either
maybe
an
after
dinner
beverage
d
reminds
me
more
of
apple
juicecider
than
beer
no
thanks
for
me
tastes
and
smells
like
sour
green
apple
candy
not
much
more
to
say
about
it
it
is
a
sour
tartyfruity
beer
that
is
good
for
a
change
of
pace
or
to
suggest
to
those
who
do
not
like
your
typical
malty
hoppy
beers
drinkable
in
the
sense
it
is
not
too
strong
but
too
much
of
that
fruity
taste
gets
old
kind
of
fast
d
drinks
good
but
too
much
sugar
to
pound
back
it
smelled
and
tasted
just
like
a
sour
apple
airhead
the
chewy
sugary
candy
wow
this
beer
had
so
much
flavor
it
was
a
mix
between
apple
juice
apple
cider
and
some
sparkling
sweet
flavors
i
couldnt
find
the
beer
in
this
lambic
either
i
could
of
had
a
couple
bottles
the
sweetness
would
have
been
something
to
deal
with
but
it
was
too
good
i
recommend
to
all
but
wheres
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellowish
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
green
apple
and
cinnamon
in
the
taste
again
green
apple
and
cinnamon
a
bitter
sweet
and
sour
apple
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
green
apple
and
spice
aftertaste
taste
almost
like
apple
cider
dryer
than
most
lindemans
and
not
as
sugary
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
actually
one
of
my
favorite
in
the
lindemans
fruit
beer
collection
it
actually
leaves
a
bit
of
the
funk
in
rather
than
drowning
it
in
syrup
this
particular
bottle
must
have
a
bit
of
age
on
it
but
it
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
and
recommend
it
though
the
score
from
this
review
wont
be
the
best
because
of
this
particular
bottle
taste
is
sweet
with
a
distinct
apple
juice
taste
body
is
sweet
and
sticky
this
beer
has
been
sweetened
there
is
absolutely
no
malt
or
hops
to
be
tasted
here
even
the
expected
tartness
is
not
present
i
understand
that
this
is
really
great
for
people
that
dont
like
beer
but
not
for
me
i
will
be
mild
in
my
judgement
a
great
drink
for
an
apple
lover
like
myself
the
bottle
says
serving
temp
between
38
and
41
degrees
and
i
agree
the
colder
temp
brings
out
the
best
in
this
beer
and
as
i
mentioned
before
if
you
love
the
green
jolly
ranchers
you
will
indeed
love
this
beer
d
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
and
not
tart
enough
to
really
be
a
lambic
but
for
what
it
is
pretty
tasty
on
a
hot
day
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
pretty
good
little
too
sweet
for
alot
of
it
great
for
desert
but
lets
not
forget
breakfast
leave
the
mimosa
for
someone
else
this
would
pair
well
with
an
omelet
or
french
toast
have
at
it
very
low
alcohol
makes
this
easy
to
drink
and
it
makes
a
fine
desertstyle
beer
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
a
great
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
tastes
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
it
an
excellent
session
beer
or
a
nice
beer
to
drink
all
night
drinking
this
beer
is
like
eating
green
jolly
ranchers
with
a
kick
drinkability
apple
cider
plus
a
cup
of
sugar
some
would
say
you
have
a
recipe
for
disaster
but
you
really
just
have
a
recipe
for
lindemans
pomme
d
a
little
dryer
than
the
other
lindemans
lambics
pretty
drinkable
though
id
like
to
pour
back
a
few
of
these
every
sunday
morning
solid
beer
very
solid
d
as
stated
above
this
is
definitley
an
aquired
taste
beer
especially
for
those
not
accustomed
to
the
lambic
style
the
sourness
is
such
that
i
cannot
sip
this
one
and
keep
a
straight
face
making
this
a
slow
sipper
by
necessity
despite
the
relatively
tame
abv
not
as
good
as
the
framboise
but
that
is
my
personal
taste
appearance
was
very
light
with
a
light
head
that
stayed
the
entire
time
smell
was
very
upfront
almost
like
apple
pucker
or
a
hard
cider
very
heavy
on
the
sour
apple
it
was
good
but
was
to
sweet
and
to
sour
at
the
same
time
couldnt
even
think
what
to
pair
it
with
good
but
not
good
enough
d
was
not
as
good
due
to
the
taste
and
sweetness
picked
this
bottle
up
in
a
lindemans
gift
set
i
was
a
little
leary
to
try
this
one
as
i
had
hear
it
tasted
like
an
apple
jolly
racher
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
the
beer
had
a
candy
apple
nose
and
a
touch
of
earthiness
to
it
as
well
the
was
actually
like
an
apple
jolly
rancher
very
syrupy
tasting
that
leaves
a
sugary
taste
on
the
tongue
that
is
not
overly
pleasing
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
back
makes
for
a
pretty
good
dessert
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
some
white
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
surprise
surprise
apple
to
me
it
already
reminds
me
of
an
apple
jolly
rancher
i
give
it
a
3
because
it
reminds
me
too
much
of
the
candy
and
lacks
maturity
taste
is
nasty
tastes
like
sour
apple
like
that
candy
was
melted
and
morphed
into
a
drink
it
gets
more
tolerable
as
times
goes
on
as
is
typical
with
lindemans
brew
but
really
eck
you
might
as
well
put
this
in
a
bottle
and
let
your
kid
drink
it
as
apple
juice
if
it
werent
for
the
alcohol
in
it
no
way
am
i
going
to
be
able
to
finish
this
bottle
or
an
inch
more
of
what
is
in
the
glass
horrid
the
only
thing
i
can
think
that
would
save
this
is
a
proper
pairing
with
food
drinkability
good
for
a
few
sips
and
then
just
becomes
too
cloying
this
is
my
third
fav
from
lindemans
almost
tastes
like
a
hard
apple
ale
pours
light
yellow
green
smells
like
apples
that
have
been
like
mustified
or
something
not
tart
but
more
smooth
and
has
a
bit
of
a
creamy
funk
to
it
its
real
good
but
it
has
a
lot
of
pearish
flavor
to
it
as
well
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
not
quite
cider
not
quite
ale
in
reality
not
quite
lambic
this
is
not
sour
at
all
so
those
of
you
looking
for
a
traditional
lambic
stay
away
good
brew
though
imo
like
the
other
lindemans
offerings
this
one
is
plenty
tasty
but
off
the
charts
in
terms
of
its
sweet
cloying
feel
we
had
a
small
bottle
and
i
know
i
couldnt
have
finished
the
sucker
the
flavor
itself
was
nice
a
similar
but
more
sophisticated
flavor
than
a
green
apple
jolly
rancher
very
candylike
not
a
bad
beer
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
like
sour
apple
definitely
worth
trying
cant
wait
to
venture
into
other
lambics
pours
a
dark
amberblonde
color
with
minimal
head
strong
hints
of
apple
in
the
nose
with
some
sourness
detected
as
well
taste
is
tart
and
similar
to
apple
cider
theres
some
sourness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
but
its
more
like
a
mild
pucker
its
damn
irrestible
and
very
easy
to
drink
you
might
not
notice
that
its
a
lambic
at
first
excellent
allaround
dont
drink
and
review
the
beer
from
the
350ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
pours
a
hazy
deep
gold
color
with
a
modest
creamy
white
head
that
fades
away
leaving
the
lace
to
seal
the
glass
with
a
fine
sheet
nose
has
a
terrific
granny
smith
apple
sweet
and
sour
aroma
with
a
wet
gunny
sack
musty
tone
astringent
but
likeable
nonetheless
start
continues
the
sweet
and
sour
astringency
with
the
top
light
in
its
feel
finish
has
a
barbarous
acidity
followed
by
the
green
apple
sweet
and
sourness
facepuckering
dryness
but
it
has
everything
i
look
for
in
a
good
lambic
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
its
very
drinkable
although
you
will
get
a
little
syrupy
after
a
while
this
was
my
first
attempt
at
this
style
as
far
as
evaluating
previous
fruit
flavored
beers
have
left
a
mark
on
me
as
too
sweet
or
tart
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
offering
i
will
have
to
keep
lambics
in
mind
for
the
future
i
would
also
recommend
serving
this
warmer
than
the
38º
to
41º
referenced
on
the
label
unless
you
are
drinking
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
the
taste
tastes
of
fresh
green
apples
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
some
wheat
and
yeasty
flavour
as
well
it
has
a
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
and
tastes
ever
so
good
i
love
green
apples
man
that
fruity
flavour
lingers
on
in
the
aftertaste
and
i
cant
help
taking
another
sip
or
2
to
satisfy
my
taste
buds
good
fruit
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
flavor
but
not
very
beery
im
a
little
disapointed
but
its
quite
drinkable
i
like
this
beerits
my
2nd
offering
from
lindemans
and
my
favorite
so
far
i
will
have
this
again
the
future
good
beer
palate
is
more
sweet
green
apples
a
touch
of
sweet
pale
malt
and
just
a
little
bit
of
lambic
astringency
a
lingering
sugary
sweetness
becomes
kind
of
cloying
on
the
finish
limiting
the
drinkability
overall
though
an
enjoyable
dessert
beer
had
at
bjs
damn
that
waitress
was
cute
yellowgold
cloudy
concoction
with
a
minor
bubbly
head
and
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
sour
crisp
apples
and
some
earthycompostlike
stuff
the
taste
comes
off
as
a
fizzy
tart
apple
and
yeast
blend
like
granny
apple
soda
or
champagne
kind
of
a
refreshing
experience
for
a
few
sips
if
you
think
more
soda
than
beer
and
it
seems
drinkable
enough
like
any
soda
could
be
but
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
more
than
a
taste
of
this
stuff
i
think
i
recommend
you
ask
for
a
sample
size
of
this
before
you
commit
to
a
full
portion
it
was
alright

a
try

taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
apple
notes
probably
apple
concentrate
and
some
light
tart
and
oak
notes
full
body
with
some
average
carbonation
i
would
have
like
more
sourness
and
oak
which
would
have
brought
more
complexity
and
would
have
been
a
perfect
match
for
the
apple
d
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
offering
from
lindemans
but
it
aint
bad
its
much
more
beer
like
than
a
cider
and
the
tart
green
apple
flavors
are
quite
refreshing
decent
drinking
but
can
be
a
bit
cloying
especially
as
it
warms
very
nice
in
the
summer
when
chilled

hazy
gold
topped
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
i
was
half
expecting
this
to
pour
bright
yellowgreen
to
match
the
unnatural
color
of
some
of
their
other
varieties
hold
a
decent
couple
millimeters
of
head
throughout
heavy
syrupy
green
apple
scent
very
much
like
sour
apple
hard
candy
not
entirely
what
i
like
in
a
beer
of
any
variety
the
flavor
is
somewhat
more
beerlike
with
light
wheaty
grain
barely
surfacing
under
the
omnipresent
green
apple
jolly
rancher
syrup
nicely
effervescent
though
with
a
soft
fuller
texture
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
aside
from
the
apple
with
the
malt
it
comes
across
as
one
of
those
1
apple
pies
you
find
in
the
gas
station
the
definition
of
the
word
cloying
some
faint
lambic
sourness
but
not
much
to
make
note
of
really
half
a
bottle
was
more
than
enough
for
me
and
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
through
just
that
more
like
a
sickly
sweet
apple
soda
than
a
beer
the
bottle
was
a
gift
so
i
cant
complain
too
much
pours
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
almost
no
head
smells
of
sour
apples
with
an
astringent
note
to
it
tastes
crisp
sweet
up
front
and
a
sharp
finish
to
it
the
apples
are
dominant
but
not
nearly
so
pronounced
as
in
a
cider
the
trademark
lambic
sourness
is
definitnely
present
adds
a
nice
interest
to
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
very
refreshing
and
an
alcohol
content
that
could
make
this
one
a
session
beer
i
like
all
of
the
lindemans
line
this
one
is
no
exception
yummy
drinkable
if
your
into
sweet
beers
luckily
i
love
apples
and
apple
flavoured
things
but
there
are
better
beers
that
use
apples
that
actually
also
taste
like
beer
special
thanks
to
amanda
at
mr
goodbar
for
the
sample
d
nice
little
drink
but
for
the
price
and
bottle
size
i
could
find
something
else
to
hit
my
lambic
jones
my
first
review
of
this
one
felt
unfaire
and
i
had
to
revisit
this
one
after
consulting
bas
and
shbfs
style
guidelines
good
drinkability
even
though
its
not
as
refreshing
as
a
kriek
it
goes
down
quite
easily
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
like
the
other
lindemans
ive
had
but
good
for
what
it
is
and
great
to
bring
people
into
the
world
of
better
beer
drastically
different
from
any
real
beer
this
a
cloudy
strawcolored
beer
with
little
to
no
head
the
aroma
is
sour
yeasty
and
prettymuch
smells
like
green
apple
jollyranchers
this
is
an
intensely
sweet
beer
with
a
cracker
dry
grain
contribution
that
knocks
out
the
bottom
to
make
it
drinkable
the
luscious
green
apple
flavor
is
tasty
but
obscures
this
beers
complexity
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
feel
like
drinkin
candy
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
nose
except
at
the
finish
some
good
tart
apple
rhine
gives
a
good
semidry
finish
the
last
lingering
quality
felt
like
you
had
a
greenapple
jollyrancher
from
lindeman
so
far
good
stuff
about
what
i
expected
the
taste
is
certainly
not
bad
just
not
very
interesting
and
too
sweet
like
most
of
their
lineup
i
could
see
it
paired
with
a
fresh
fruit
dish
salad
or
a
tart
dessert
lindemans
pomme
threw
me
no
curveballs
after
drinking
cassis
framboise
kriek
and
peche
i
knew
what
to
expect
from
the
apple
version
if
you
like
incredibly
sweet
moderately
complex
fruit
beer
and
dont
mind
laying
out
some
cash
on
occasion
give
this
one
a
whirl
poured
into
my
stange
glass
nice
head
and
great
retention
smells
of
green
sour
apples
tastes
nice
but
artificial
i
would
like
to
re
review
the
previous
lambics
because
i
think
they
might
have
the
same
quality
taste
is
good
i
really
think
i
might
need
to
try
some
other
lambics
to
understand
the
style
i
like
this
beer
but
from
other
peoples
reviews
it
seems
like
i
really
need
to
try
other
beers
from
the
style
to
really
understand
it
mouthfeel
is
good
and
clings
well
the
beer
goes
down
fast
cause
its
liight
and
tastes
like
candy
this
750
ml
bottle
set
me
back
9
45
at
my
local
north
coast
coop
in
eureka
ca
it
poured
a
nice
interesting
peach
color
with
a
large
and
white
foamy
head
lots
of
lacing
made
you
realize
this
was
not
just
apple
cider
nose
is
apple
however
and
not
much
else
very
sweet
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
but
way
overpriced
for
what
you
get
poured
into
a
flute
glass
appears
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
amber
with
under
an
inch
of
white
foam
smells
of
freshly
sliced
tart
apples
tastes
of
crisp
tart
green
apples
pleasantly
sweet
and
sour
flavors
moderate
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
clean
i
tried
half
the
bottle
with
ice
and
the
other
half
without
i
prefer
this
beers
with
a
little
ice
to
cut
down
the
sweetness
a
little
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
with
some
nice
sharp
cheese
drinkability
a
very
tasty
beer
clean
tart
apples
apples
its
difficult
however
for
an
untrained
taster
to
separate
this
style
from
a
sparkling
apple
cider
definitely
a
different
smooth
mouthfeel
but
very
similar
in
flavor
upfront
pours
a
apple
cider
yellowpale
amber
mild
carbonation
and
a
small
fizzy
head
that
quickly
leaves
the
aromas
are
like
the
squelching
juice
from
a
granny
smith
or
a
fuji
apple
dripping
down
your
chin
after
a
juicey
bite
but
no
farmhouse
earthy
aromas
though
the
flavor
really
captures
the
apple
granny
smith
particulary
tart
and
dry
yet
very
juicey
hints
of
teh
belgian
countryside
but
does
lack
a
bit
of
the
lambic
style
tartness
that
i
was
looking
for
just
fruity
and
appley
nice
to
sip
while
sittin
up
in
bed
after
a
draining
evening
before
very
disappointing
perhaps
mildly
better
than
lindemans
peche
but
close
enough
to
be
tied
for
the
worst
beer
of
the
lindemans
lineup
of
beers
yet
i
kind
of
like
it
i
had
the
kriek
just
a
few
weeks
ago
and
either
i
hated
it
because
i
really
dont
like
cherries
as
much
as
i
think
or
because
it
just
wasnt
as
appealing
at
the
time
or
whatever
i
dont
know
what
i
do
know
is
it
was
a
long
day
it
gazed
at
me
from
the
fridge
shelf
and
i
was
intrugued
and
its
turned
out
to
be
quite
refreshing
now
i
doubt
ill
go
for
it
again
any
time
in
the
remote
future
but
hey
what
the
hell
overall
a
decent
lambic
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
its
still
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
before
cheers
overall
it
is
between
cider
and
a
mamosa
substitute
apple
juice
for
orange
juice
personally
my
least
favorite
of
the
four
main
fruit
lambics
of
this
brewery
too
cidery
and
sweet
maybe
cider
drinkers
and
jolly
rancher
enjoyers
would
appreciate
this
more
it
does
pair
well
though
with
salad
with
apple
slices
in
it
cheers
very
drinkable
at

a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
however
my
christmas
eve
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
like
an
apple
cider
with
a
foamy
head
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
one
of
apples
taste
is
quite
tart
a
touch
of
the
sour
lambic
but
for
the
most
part
a
fruity
apple
flavor
sweet
aftertaste
but
not
too
cloying
very
drinkable
not
a
beer
id
drink
every
week
but
pretty
tasty
this
lambic
pours
a
somewhat
translucent
golden
amber
with
a
nice
frothy
head
with
good
retention
and
thins
to
some
lace
the
smell
is
strong
apple
with
a
nice
yeasty
qualities
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
reminds
me
of
a
snakebite
with
overly
sweet
cider
different
and
rather
pleasant
but
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
it
has
low
carbonation
and
is
rather
light
im
not
inclined
to
drink
many
of
these
but
id
easily
have
another
this
brew
pours
a
deep
straw
color
with
a
spongelike
foam
over
the
top
this
beer
is
slightly
hazy
with
moderate
lacing
and
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
the
aroma
is
unmistakably
apple
it
seems
to
leap
from
the
glass
to
your
nose
the
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
beers
from
lindemans
but
it
is
slightly
tart
and
its
faintly
sour
in
the
finish
it
seems
like
a
combination
of
apple
cider
and
jolly
ranchers
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
moderate
carbonation
giving
it
a
champagnelike
zing
overall
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
once
you
have
one
you
will
definitely
be
hooked
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
green
apple
the
taste
was
really
more
of
green
apple
cider
or
cocktail
than
even
gueze
but
it
was
wonderful
stuff
the
feel
was
wonderfully
dry
and
crisp
allowing
you
to
really
see
the
beer
underneath
this
one
i
like
fruit
lambics
but
this
is
the
first
pomme
ive
had
and
i
found
it
to
be
delightful
now
this
is
heavily
influenced
by
my
love
of
green
apples
but
i
have
definately
added
a
favorite
i
will
be
searching
out
and
purchasing
this
beer
if
it
was
up
to
me
id
have
it
for
breakfast
every
day
it
was
just
a
wonderful
beverage
d
much
too
sweet
for
me
other
lambics
ive
had
are
more
sour
less
carbonated
less
sweet
thats
how
ive
come
to
understand
the
style
even
those
arent
super
drinkable
this
is
ok
at
best
would
not
really
recomend
this
one
pours
with
a
frothy
head
and
an
offgold
body
that
seems
to
have
a
tinge
of
green
apple
skin
color
to
it
aromas
are
of
tart
green
apples
you
can
even
smell
a
bit
of
the
peel
it
seems
on
the
tongue
softly
tart
apple
flavors
present
first
before
a
cloying
sweetness
takes
over
the
whole
thing
is
more
juicy
juice
apple
flavor
rather
than
anything
real
quite
acidic
in
mouthfeel
like
a
baby
lambic
with
medium
carbonation
and
body
overall
this
is
only
ok
i
cant
imagine
drinking
this
as
anyting
other
than
a
dessert
accompaniment
and
even
then
there
are
better
choices
out
there
taking
one
for
the
team
after
this
one
is
kicked
at
the
sharp
edge
creekhouse
ename
tripel

imagine
how
lucky
we
are
to
have
a
true
tripel

after

with

not

much

coating

drinkability
well
no
thanks
especially
after
trying
so
many
fine
beers
over
the
years
at
the
creekhouse
sampled
at
from
the
vine
beer
tasting
sep
22nd
2006
the
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
fast
slick
lacing
the
aroma
is
all
granny
smith
apple
with
a
bit
of
yeast
light
and
crisp
body
with
a
tart
apple
character
sour
apple
dominates
the
flavor
with
a
mild
sweetness
showing
up
here
and
there
the
finish
is
mild
and
fruity
with
touches
of
spice
decent
overall
interesting
but
not
good
this
brew
pours
a
very
cloudy
almost
milkywhite
color
topped
with
a
short
and
airy
foam
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
an
intense
green
apple
smell
its
almost
reminiscent
of
homemade
cider
and
apple
skins
theres
just
a
bit
of
grain
notable
as
well
and
a
bit
of
tartness
you
cant
discern
if
the
tartness
is
from
the
beer
or
the
apples
the
flavor
is
bold
and
notably
sweet
theres
a
nice
juxtaposition
between
the
sweetness
and
tartness
that
works
very
well
in
this
brew
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
the
finish
is
lingeringly
sweet
with
a
fleetingly
sharp
twang
all
in
all
this
ones
very
good
i
wished
that
id
had
more
when
it
was
finished
tasty
and
flavorful
lambic
here
sweet
enough
that
your
girlfriend
would
drink
it
but
with
enough
subtle
flavors
to
keep
a
beer
geek
interested
oelergud
this
thing
is
tarty
enough
to
be
refreshing
but
a
bit
too
sweet
very
silky
mouthfeel
im
new
to
the
world
of
lambics
but
this
seems
to
lack
substance
aside
from
the
apple
nonetheless
its
worth
a
try
though
next
time
ill
probably
go
back
to
the
gueuze
or
try
something
new
i
think
this
beer
would
rock
with
creamy
cheeses
like
brie
maybe
some
bleu
cheeses
or
even
some
goat
cheeses
stone
me
im
no
lambic
rookie
i
love
drie
fonteinen
and
cantillon
but
i
can
dig
a
lindemans
because
i
know
what
i
am
getting
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
different
but
i
didnt
mind
it
hell
id
drink
it
again
i
purchased
my
750ml
bottle
in
omaha
ne
try
one
you
never
know
dull
goldamber
colour
pretty
hazy
with
a
short
cap
of
white
foam
off
the
pour
larger
bubbles
settled
into
a
ring
while
fine
bubbles
remained
on
the
surface
some
lacing
the
green
apple
aroma
is
dominant
but
there
are
notes
of
apple
skins
tartness
and
a
peculiar
earthy
sweetness
as
well
theres
a
solid
tartness
present
but
its
overshadowed
somewhat
by
sweetness
apple
flavour
is
present
throughout
and
the
finish
is
of
intense
sweet
apples
mediumlight
body
with
a
bit
of
stickyness
the
carbonation
is
adequate
but
not
as
lively
as
id
hoped
i
liked
this
beer
its
tart
and
palate
cleansing
but
it
didnt
make
a
huge
impression
notes
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
didnt
care
much
for
the
candy
flavor
i
was
hoping
more
for
a
cider
flavor
its
just
too
artificial
my
least
favorite
of
lindemans
offerings
aroma
is
huge
with
tart
green
apple
very
nownlater
apple
smelling
body
is
a

it
tastes
good
to
me
though
and
i
would
definitely
have
one
again
im
a
sucker
for
candy
and
this
is
just
a
candy
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
base
maltiness
to
prevent
it
from
just
being

d
this

that
was

not

and
not

bity
but
just
a
nice
crisp
drink
drinkability

i
had
no
problem
drinking
this
but
its
certainly
not
a
lambic
and
completely
lacks
the
requisite
malt
base
this
was
an
ok
impulse
purchase
seemed
thin
a
little
stringy
if
thats
the
word
tasted
more
like
a
cider
than
a
beer
it
did
have
a
nice
fizzy
mouthfeel
from
the
carbonation
but
again
the
flavor
of
apples
predominated
rather
than
appearing
as
an
additive
overall
nothing
repulsive
absolutely
no
beer
base
and
it
definitely
is
not
a
lambic
it
is
well
erm
nothing
more
than
expensive
apple
juice
a
chick
beer
hands
down
nice
enough
but
i
find
it
hard
to
acknowledge
that
i
am
even
writing
a
beer
review
for
this
alcopop
shockingly
predictable
just
as
i
imagined
as
if
this
beer
isnt
good
enough
from
the
bottle
even
smoother
richer
and
cleaner
from
the
tap
very
ciderlike
with
apples
and
berries
under
a
very
sugar
sweet
maltiness
and
added
apples
very
tart
and
acidic
evident
in
aroma
and
flavor
vigorously
carbonated
for
a
playfull
effect
in
the
mouth
astringent
feeling
but
not
overly
so
finishes
with
a
big
apple
flavor
syrupy
sweetness
and
carbonated
dryness
and
tartness
sweet
almost
to
the
point
where
it
hurts
the
teeth
though
i
love
the
beer
the
sweetness
and
apples
overtake
what
would
be
pronounced
belgian
beer
flavor
this
beer
is
very
onedimentional
but
its
simple
and
righttothepoint
it
could
be
a
huge
hit
for
the
nonbeeries
the
sheer
simplicity
along
with
the
enjoyability
made
it
rank
high
for
me
i
would
much
rather
have
a
complex
traditional
lambic
but
this
one
still
makes
for
a
great
drink
d
this
is
pretty
much
apple
jolly
rancher
juice
you
like
those
candies
youll
probably
like
this
stuff
the
wife
loves
this
stuff
this
lambic
is
just
way
too
drinkable
its
incredibly
refreshing
and
crisp
notes
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
as
i
tend
to
gravitate
towards
more
traditional
lambic
styles
and
other
spontaneous
fermented
products
like
guezes
and
biere
de
garde
but
and
a
big
but
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
and
i
can
appreciate
the
quality
presented
here
oki
love
apple
anything
so
im
gonne
like
this
no
matter
what
this
pours
out
a
nice
sunset
color
looks
welcoming
smells
like
a
big
fat
green
apple
granny
smith
style
taste
oh
man
your
either
gonna
love
it
or
hate
it
i
love
it
its
like
a
liquid
green
apple
jolly
rancher
sour
and
a
bit
puckering
apple
all
over
oh
my
lively
carbonation
its
like
a
candy
for
the
beer
drinker
one
is
easily
enough
and
it
takes
care
of
my
sweet
tooth
perfectly
my
new
favorite
offering
from
lindemans
this
is
absolutely
wonderful
this
may
in
fact
replace
the
framboise
as
my
favourite
offering
from
lindemans
poured
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
thick
soapy
foamy
head
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
both
streaming
upward
and
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
im
typically
not
a
big
fan
of
carbonation
of
this
level
in
my
beer
but
for
this
style
the
more
the
better
i
say
the
smell
is
almost
candy
like
sweet
green
apple
is
about
all
youre
going
to
get
from
this
one
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
tart
green
apple
dominating
nearly
unnoticeable
level
of
malt
at
the
very
end
you
really
have
to
be
searching
for
it
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
with
a
nice
moderate
carbonation
sting
to
it
i
almost
wouldnt
even
consider
this
beer
mildly
alcoholic
apple
soda
is
more
like
it
nevertheless
i
completely
enjoyed
it
and
will
certainly
buy
this
one
again
12
oz
bottle
9
oz
sample
this
brew
pours
a
deep
straw
color
with
a
weblike
foam
over
top
this
one
is
modestly
hazy
with
no
carbonation
apparent
this
one
reminds
me
a
lot
of
apple
juice
in
the
way
it
looks
the
aroma
from
this
one
is
definately
unmistakable
apple
it
is
somewhere
between
a
nice
apple
cider
and
the
apple
jolly
rancher
candies
slightly
real
but
somewhat
artifically
sweet
at
least
you
cant
say
it
lives
up
the
the
promise
of
apple
the
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
as
expected
it
is
definately
focused
on
the
sweetness
of
the
apple
but
as
i
swallow
the
beer
i
get
just
a
hint
of
funkyness
and
sour
more
than
i
have
in
any
other
lindemans
product
aftertaste
is
slightly
wheaty
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
moderate
with
a
very
light
carbonation
just
working
its
way
out
of
sulution
as
it
hits
my
tongue
i
enjoy
the
light
zing
of
sour
and
tartness
if
from
either
the
apple
or
the
beasties
used
for
fermentation
as
it
lends
distant
thoughts
of
other
lambics
that
i
enjoy
more
overall
this
one
is
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
over
done
on
the
sweetness
but
it
also
has
very
faint
wispers
of
what
it
could
be
so
that
makes
me
happy
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
but
it
was
a
let
down
for
me
as
the
apple
flavoring
tastes
more
like
candy
than
a
fruit
with
that
said
there
are
still
so
few
apple
brews
that
i
have
to
recommend
it
id
also
be
lying
if
i
said
i
didnt
enjoy
it
too
pours
a
hazy
apricot
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
attractive
lacing
drapes
the
goblet
in
sheets
aroma
is
greenapple
bubblegum
and
apple
cider
a
hint
of
spices
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
soft
carbonation
taste
is
greenapple
bubblegum
and
apple
cider
a
touch
of
wild
yeast
acidity
slight
mustiness
befitting
a
lambic
a
hint
of
spiciness
that
seems
to
be
cloves
a
decent
fruit
lambic
but
not
my
favorite
even
from
this
brewery
great
for
the
ladies
but
not
for
me
nearly
identical
to
a
demi
pomme
made
with
kronenbourg
and
sour
apple
syrup
pomme
its
a
good
thing
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
aroma
like
the
other
lindemans
offerings
its
like
smelling
a
big
bowl
of
fresh
apples
raspberries
cherries
peaches
the
aroma
makes
my
mouth
water
i
definitely
like
the
green
apple
characteristics
of
this
beer
the
sour
flavor
matches
very
nicely
with
the
sourness
of
the
lambic
base
for
my
money
this
is
the
least
sugary
sweet
of
the
lindemans
fruit
beers
worth
seeking
it
out
i
really
like
this
one
extremly
refreshing
yet
quite
complex
the
only
disappointment
is
the
price
i
paid
almost
7
for
a
12oz
bottle
but
if
money
is
no
object
or
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
the
style
definitely
give
it
a
try
drinkability
because
of
its
sugar
content
and
extreme
sweetness
i
found
this
really
hard
to
finish
12
oz
or
so
there
is
no
way
i
would
have
been
able
to
consume
the
whole
bottle
no
very
highly
drinkable
but
could
work
as
an
afterdinner
drink
to
share
at
a
party
with
a
dessert
or
something
about
6oz
is
enough
for
me
very
one
dimensional
with
the
thick
flavors
of
sour
green
apple
but
you
cant
expect
this
to
be
a
big
complex
lambic
very
sweet
yet
refreshing
the
one
problem
is
a
lack
of
carbonation
and
a
little
light
on
acidity
those
two
components
really
hurt
the
mouthfeel
the
sweetness
makes
this
one
difficult
to
drink
many
but
a
good
refresher
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
im
a
huge
green
apple
fan
and
this
really
hits
the
spot
its
intense
and
refreshing
very
nice
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
nice
green
apple
flavor
that
is
mildly
tart
and
full
of
fruit
flavor
it
goes
down
like
candy
and
really
satisfies
this
is
one
delicious
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
another
great
offering
from
this
brewery
im
not
a
fan
of
the
less
fruit
more
sour
lambics
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
a
real
thirst
quencher
reminiscent
of
a
very
good
hard
cider
d
this
obviously
isnt
an
everyday
beer
or
one
to
drink
in
large
quantities
but
i
find
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
definitely
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
by
those
who
are
uninitiated
to
the
world
of
fine
beer
drinkability
my
first
taste
of
this
new
offering
and
i
am
curious
i
wanna
try
a
bottle
and
see
how
the
delicate
flavors
hold
up
in
a
bottle
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
nice
but
i
cant
drink
too
much
the
cloying
sweetness
overpowers
me
after
a
halfbottle
yellowish
color
a
little
dull
in
luster
thin
flatlying
head
in
a
chalice
laces
are
thin
with
scant
minimal
strings
highly
sweetened
but
distinct
apple
aromas
lives
in
a
candyish
sour
ball
realm
light
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
certainly
puts
some
apple
into
the
pomme
appelation
as
far
as
the
flavor
profile
not
as
earthy
as
it
should
be
but
definitely
more
defined
than
you
find
in
something
like
unibroue
ephemere
nevertheless
it
seems
a
little
bit
plastic
and
on
the
artificial
side
at
the
same
time
that
its
busting
out
all
over
interesting
slide
into
a
chalky
almost
oaky
wrapup
cant
say
that
its
really
a
beer
that
meets
a
lot
of
things
i
look
for
in
the
many
styles
that
are
available
in
the
world
today
worth
a
try
in
the
way
that
it
is
different
from
such
fruitoverpowering
products
like
the
framboise
and
the
peche
but
still
cannot
hold
a
candle
to
the
cuvee
rene
or
even
the
gueuze
5
wasted
and
this
beer
sampled
i
dont
feel
like
a
total
ass
but
my
money
could
have
been
spent
more
wisely
small
bottle
foil
cap
and
a
small
cork
no
freshnessbottling
indication
pours
cloudy
light
tangerinem
with
a
near
white
fine
slight
head
and
leaving
slithery
stringy
lacing
nose
of
sugary
apples
this
a
quite
sweet
sugary
brew
undernotes
of
slight
sourness
dessert
beer
or
perhaps
with
a
salad
sweetness
takes
away
from
complexity
this
is
an
odd
one
it
tastes
and
smells
artificial
like
green
apple
candy
theres
some
lambic
character
beneath
but
the
apple
flavor
dominates
i
cant
imagine
its
real
and
thats
hard
to
say
as
it
comes
from
lindemans
hmmmm
i
guess
id
have
to
say
im
disappointed
its
way
too
sweet
and
artificial
tasting
to
me
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
and
i
dont
think
ill
ever
bother
with
it
again
this
seemed
like
a
good
midday
nice
weather
sipper
so
thats
what
i
did
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
modest
fizzy
head
some
lacing
rings
but
not
too
much
aroma
is
strong
on
the
apples
theres
a
tart
acidic
element
in
there
but
its
more
sweet
and
sugary
than
anything
else
im
getting
a
small
bit
of
brett
or
something
similar
in
the
backdrop
taste
is
dominated
by
apples
a
strong
granny
smith
flavor
ensues
theres
not
really
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
a
definite
sweetness
arises
but
the
tartness
of
the
granny
smith
flavor
with
the
sugar
sweetness
seem
to
work
off
each
other
quite
well
imo
i
like
the
acidity
and
dryness
in
the
finish
this
is
refreshing
very
cidery
but
thats
probably
expected
i
might
not
be
able
to
drink
too
many
of
these
or
really
want
another
for
awhile
but
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
my
second
lambic
pours
out
to
a
mildly
hazed
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
of
white
foam
no
lace
a
medium
high
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
apples
sweet
malt
sour
fruits
and
some
floral
notes
meet
the
nose
well
taste
is
near
exceptional
full
fruit
flavors
of
apples
lots
of
sweet
candied
sugar
yet
the
sourness
factor
arises
and
changes
the
focus
of
the
palate
to
the
more
subtle
notes
of
mild
malt
and
grass
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
zesty
very
refreshing
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
many
fruity
wines
and
has
really
opened
my
mind
to
the
lambic
style
of
beer
recommended
overall
given
that
this
is
a
lindemans
fruit
lambic
i
expected
it
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
but
this
was
too
much
i
definitely
prefer
lindemans
other
fruit
lambics
to
this
its
like
drinking
a
sour
apple
jolly
rancher
last
night
at
the
long
island
beer
festival
i
was
hit
in
the
mouth
with
something
awesome
and
im
not
talking
about
one
of
the
8000
too
many
fat
dudes
with
hair
gel
walking
around
if
there
were
a
best
in
show
award
it
would
surely
belong
to
lindemans
pomme
lambic
pomme
lambic
pours
out
from
its
bottle
like
my
platonic
ideal
of
apple
cider
resting
in
my
small
plastic
cup
with
little
to
no
head
but
a
menacing
applejuice
colored
body
i
asked
the
man
serving
me
this
exceptional
delight
what
the
abv
was
and
he
responded
8
knowing
this
i
smelled
the
lambic
expecting
harsh
alcohol
fumes
but
only
receiving
apple
first
sip
sweet
jesus
i
left
my
frail
mortal
coil
down
somewhere
in
long
island
and
ascended
into
beer
heaven
where
im
never
drunk
and
always
buzzed
and
water
fountains
dispense
guinness
i
am
not
a
lambic
conneisseur
and
so
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
describe
this
in
terms
of
other
lambics
what
i
can
say
is
that
it
has
a
sharp
appley
and
refreshing
edge
with
a
super
smooth
and
full
body
the
slick
liquid
coated
my
tongue
and
as
for
aftertaste
there
was
none
to
speak
of
just
apples
overall
imagine
every
crappy
malt
alcohol
beverage
youve
ever
had
take
that
pretend
it
tasted
delicious
and
combine
it
with
your
favorite
hard
cider
if
you
find
this
lambic
on
sale
buy
it
cherish
it
never
leave
marry
it
and
dont
cheat
on
it
you
wont
regret
it
what
to
drink
when
you
really
want
something
that
is
more
like
soda
pop
than
beer
i
guess
it
would
be
lindemans
peche
nose
peach
taste
peach
soda
i
suppose
in
a
blind
taste
test
with
this
and
peach
soda
i
would
notice
some
more
differences
nice
sour
balance
to
the
sweet
but
very
little
in
the
way
of
complexity
tasty
yes
this
is
probably
my
wifes
favorite
beer
it
just
seems
to
be
a
onetrick
sweet
peach
pony
drinkability
lindemans
makes
some
of
my
favorite
lambics
but
i
like
their
other
flavors
better
aroma
on
this
beer
was
fantastic
but
i
didnt
pick
up
the
greatest
taste
the
carbonation
was
off
and
the
bottle
may
have
been
old
almost
champagne
like
quality
great
peach
flavoring
love
it
awesome
dessert
beer
if
my
sweet
tooth
kicks
in
this
is
the

great

a
very
sweet

suited
in
my
opinion
for
dessert
or
after
a
meal
if
you
want
to
get
an
unsuspecting
friend
to
drink
and
actually
enjoy
a
lambic
this
is
one
approach
you
could
take
hopefully
said
friend
likes
peaches
personally
not
a
huge
gratuitous
fruit
beer
drinker
but
this
one
was
pleasing
enough
overall
im
digging
this
beer
its
not
something
i
would
normally
go
for
but
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
it
would
be
perfect
for
a
spring
picnic
with
your
significant
other
great
stuff
such
sweet
goodness
amazing
smell
o
seems
like
a
much
more
restrained
use
of
fruit
sweetness
with
this
beer
than
with
other
fruit
variants
of
lambic
and
tastes
very
natural
this
would
be
an
excellent
dessert
beer
i
am
going
to
try
to
serve
this
at
thanksgiving
dinner
as
an
option
to
winewill
see
what
happens
very
refreshing
peachy
light
sour
grows
on
you
and
gets
better
after
each
taste
only
beer
my
girlfriend
will
drink
naturally
sweet
easily
better
than
the
kriek
or
the
framboise
pours
a
pretty
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
with
some
sediment
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
really
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
of
peaches
with
some
yeast
the
taste
has
much
more
flavor
than
the
aroma
and
besides
the
peach
there
is
a
hint
or
tangerine
and
orange
in
there
as
well
very
smooth
and
quite
tasty
actually
good
drink
and
goes
down
so
easy
wow
i
really
dont
like
this
beer
it
smells
like
peach
squash
peach
concentrated
juice
synthetically
fruity
and
artificially
sweet
tastes
the
same
way
sickly
and
way
too
much
it
tastes
like
the
fruit
juice
concentrate
you
buy
and
then
dilute
with
water
except
here
whoevers
mixing
the
drinks
got
the
ratio
all
wrong
and
didnt
put
in
enough
water
id
strongly
recommend
avoiding
this
o
overall
a
very
pleasant
drinking
beer
but
perhaps
more
akin
in
taste
to
a
sweet
cider
recommended
if
you
like
sweet
fruity
beers
overall
solid
dessert
beer
if
you
like
peach
cobbler
this
is
basically
peach
cobbler
and
a
peach
soda
plus
some
unnoticeable
alcohol
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
its
sweetness
it
reminded
me
of
summer
and
i
thought
that
it
would
pair
well
with
a
lot
of
different
foods
this
fruit
based
beer
is
pleasantly
good
has
great
small
no
edge
and
no
after
taste
it
pours
golden
with
a
sparkling
haze
one
finger
sized
head
and
medium
amount
of
carbonation
it
goes
down
light
not
filling
and
doesnt
leave
the
mouth
dry
it
has
a
sugary
and
peach
taste
with
little
to
no
hopsmalt
taste
very
little
alcohol
good
for
starting
the
night
out
o
i
am
drinking
this
on
a
stinking
hot
night
and
it
is
good
because
it
is
refreshing
but
bad
because
it
is
a
ten
dollar
plus
beer
of
2
5
which
goes
down
like
essentially
soft
drink
it
is
not
a
sour
lambic
to
me
whilst
there
is
a
moderate
crisp
note
to
the
taste
it
is
essentially
a
sweet
beer
not
to
be
repeated
o
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
it
is
a
perfect
drink
for
that
hot
summer
afternoon
id
like
it
a
bit
colder
than
it
was
during
my
tasting
overall
while
veryvery
sweet
the
peach
flavor
is
quite
authentic
and
really
is
not
all
the
cloying
with
the
tart
and
light
grass
flavors
as
well
as
the
fantastic
mouthfeel
the
flavors
end
up
making
for
a
rather
refreshing
peach
flavored
sweet
lambic
overall
great
lambic
very
refreshing
and
surprising
that
your
are
drinking
and
alcoholic
beverage
until
it
hits
you
my
favorite
lambic
these
goes
down
quick
and
smooth
typically
lambic
a
little
hazy
effervescent
and
bubbly
aroma
is
peachy
and
has
that
usual
lambic
musty
note
flavor
is
quite
tasty
peach
comes
through
well
as
does
typical
lambic
malt
flavors
and
that
kinda
old
musty
classic
lambic
flavor
ive
enjoyed
each
of
this
brewerys
lambics
that
ive
tried
so
far
and
this
one
is
no
exception
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
flute
the
beer
is
a
bright
orangegold
coloring
with
steady
carbonation
and
a
frothy
bubbly
bright
white
head
aromas
of
rich
hearty
peach
with
an
effervescent
tartness
that
borders
on
sour
the
nose
is
light
enough
that
it
avoids
being
overpowering
like
some
lambics
flavors
of
subtle
roast
with
a
peach
flavor
that
honestly
tastes
like
fresh
pureed
peaches
very
authentic
and
balanced
wow
smooth
bodied
light
and
crisp
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
the
aftertaste
is
subtle
rich
and
sweet
peach
with
a
slight
linger
after
the
clean
smooth
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
o
overall
a
decent
lindemans
basically
like
all
their
other
beers
but
peach
flavored
so
just
depends
which
fruit
you
like
best
i
like
peaches
and
while
i
liked
the
nose
the
taste
was
too
sweet
for
me
to
handle
split
a
375
with
my
girlfriend
as
she
loved
it
and
i
couldnt
handle
the
whole
thing
myself
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
their
other
stuff
but
dont
expect
a
sour
lambic
if
this
thing
tasted
closer
to
how
it
smelled
it
would
have
been
awesome
a
tart
funk
peachfest
but
by
aroma
only
the
taste
lead
on
to
a
much
sweeter
sugary
style
of
peaches
that
still
tasted
fine
but
could
easily
wear
down
a
palate
or
even
a
sweet
tooth
more
funk
more
tart
and
less
sweet
is
the
key
for
some
strange
reason
my
nose
was
pleased
but
my
taste
buds
were
not
o
lindmans
doesnt
fail
this
is
just
as
good
as
the
frambois
could
be
that
peaches
and
raspberries
are
my
favorite
fruits
though
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
there
were
some
nice
peach
flavors
and
aromas
which
saved
it
from
being
a
bomb
but
id
still
stay
away
from
this
one
its
too
sweet
and
lacks
the
sour
tart
and
funky
characteristics
youd
look
for
in
a
belgian
lambic
this
was
more
like
drinking
an
expensive
peach
soda
as
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
and
ciders
this
is
really
enjoyable
to
me
even
if
it
does
border
on
being
too
sweet
once
you
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
for
those
who
arent
a
big
fruit
beer
fan
this
will
probably
be
way
too
sweet
so
you
might
want
to
steer
clear
i
really
enjoy
it
though
its
a
nice
treat
mdo
so
perfectly
drinkable
inoffensive
gregarious
makes
friends
really
easy
situations
where
i
brought
over
a
bottle
of
lindemans
framboise
may
get
replaced
with
this
nectar
this
is
punishingly
sweet
and
there
really
is
nothing
lambicesque
about
it
it
pours
a
flat
looking
bronze
color
with
literally
no
head
the
nose
is
brown
sugar
and
peach
syrup
the
kind
starbucks
uses
to
make
your
latte
special
the
peach
is
artificial
in
taste
too
sort
of
like
dried
apricots
but
more
crystalized
on
the
sugar
front
a
good
beer
for
kids
as
it
satiates
the
candy
urge
and
would
require
a
gallon
or
two
to
catch
a
buzz
not
that
i
advocate
or
condone
youth
and
alcohol
teeth
rottingly
sweet
but
not
boring
it
really
needs
more
bubbles
and
i
think
the
bottle
does
more
justice
to
this
than
the
tap
but
it
comes
across
a
bit
heavy
with
all
the
residual
sugar
and
no
bubbles
to
keep
it
moving
overall
this
is
well
made
i
suppose
but
its
not
beer
as
we
know
and
love
it
its
something
to
keep
the
wife
busy
while
you
guzzle
ipas
and
figure
out
how
much
youve
got
to
pay
the
babysitter
nothing
special
from
my
point
of
view
o
great
lambic
love
this
fn
beer
the
taste
is
loyal
to
the
aroma
but
now
the
sourness
shows
up
i
dont
notice
any
hop
taste
this
mediumbody
beer
has
an
incredible
ability
to
go
through
the
palate
without
any
notice
its
pretty
interesting
also
it
seems
to
be
a
very
good
alternative
for
a
champagne
this
looks
like
a
lightly
colored
fizzy
apple
juice
theres
a
tart
aroma
that
smacks
of
what
i
imagine
peach
blossoms
to
smell
like
veryoverlysweet
with
the
flavor
of
an
almostartificial
ripened
peach
on
the
palate
think
something
along
the
lines
of
a
peach
jam
in
terms
of
sweetness
it
is
crisp
and
an
easy
drinker
but
that
does
not
make
this
one
id
seek
out
again
brouwerij
lindemans
pêche
45
o
light
peach
flavour
people
who
enjoy
lightly
flavoured
fruit
beverages
should
try
lindemans
pêche
o
with
more
carbonation
this
might
be
a
decent
lambic
taste
appreciable
peach
but
also
significant
sugary
content
a
little
bit
of
tartness
develops
on
the
palate
wheat
is
perceptible
peach
is
strong
like
the
pimp
hand
the
downfall
is
just
the
massive
sugar
content
and
it
is
oh
so
prevalent
in
the
mouthfeel
like
youre
drinking
a
peach
lemonade
or
something
but
without
even
the
tartness
of
something
like
lemonade
can
bring
i
like
it
more
than
the
other
sugary
lambics
lindemans
offers
but
i
think
this
would
just
be
so
good
if
they
cut
down
on
the
sugar
and
amped
up
the
tartness
in
these
o
this
is
a
very
sweetsour
beer
and
i
mean
very
sweet
i
can
only
handle
one
bottle
of
this
due
to
that
simple
fact
that
it
is
just
way
to
sweet
for
my
taste
i
still
enjoyed
it
very
much
this
is
not
my
everyday
beer
at
all
but
i
could
possibly
see
myself
trying
more
lambics
in
the
near
future
i
spent
about
6
bucks
for
a
12
oz
bottle
so
if
you
are
experimenting
it
is
a
just
above
fair
price
imo
still
good
in
my
book
though
overall
a
great
showing
i
dare
say
this
one
is
a
little
too
sweet
compared
to
other
lindemans
but
the
balance
is
great
as
always
highly
recommended
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
the
lambic
was
a
golden
color
giving
a
generous
head
the
lambric
has
a
champagnelike
level
of
carbonation
a
bouquet
of
fresh
cut
peaches
erupted
from
the
glass
it
does
not
really
smell
like
beer
but
that
is
how
lambics
are
supposed
to
be
the
initial
taste
is
tart
peaches
with
honey
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
the
peach
hits
the
sour
buds
on
the
tongue
making
them
tingle
with
the
sour
sensation
my
great
disappointment
with
this
beer
is
that
the
flavor
did
not
last
long
as
the
carbonation
brushed
the
peaches
away
quickly
leaving
a
somewhat
watery
aftertaste
the
tart
peach
notes
are
present
but
not
with
the
same
level
of
intensity
tried
this
at
gigs
in
london
poured
a
clear
orangepinkish
colour
just
like
a
peach
this
one
tasted
like
a
jolly
rancher
as
well
with
a
bit
more
apple
coming
through
then
peach
in
the
flavour
its
pretty
crazy
how
much
fruit
flavour
they
got
in
this
though
interesting
beer
highly
recommended
this
sint
a
great
beer
and
not
a
great
lambic
but
it
is
sweet
and
light
and
very
fruit
forward
it
is
a
fun
beer
and
hte
wife
seems
to
like
it
especially
in
summer
so
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
it
ill
never
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
one
of
these
fake
lambics
but
ill
try
anything
once
better
than
i
expected
overall
this
brew
answers
the
call
of
being
a
summer
fruit
lambic
light
and
easy
to
drink
strong
on
the
peach
flavor
and
lambic
tartness
taste
peaches
and
apples
though
this
is
a
peach
lambic
it
comes
across
as
an
apple
cider
o
extremely
drinkable
this
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
biting
into
a
sweet
fresh
peach
this
is
a
great
fruit
lambic
easily
could
be
one
of
my
favorites
great
fruit
flavors
and
sweetness
awesome
doa
o
really
not
that
bad
it
tastes
good
and
in
the
end
that
is
what
matters
most
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
often
d
its
not
balanced
and
its
not
complex
but
its
damn
good
it
also
may
be
worth
mentioning
that
this
has
been
my
introduction
to
brouwerij
lindemans
a
brewery
i
expect
to
drinking
a
lot
of
now
while
it
may
not
satisfy
the
connoisseur
in
search
of
a
intense
sour
this
lambic
has
been
thoroughly
satisfying
for
me
despite
the
overbearing
sweetness
in
the
flavor
profile
it
remains
quite
drinkable
but
then
again
how
could
a
4
0
abv
sunshinefruity
sugar
bomb
not
if
there
has
ever
been
an
ideal
brunch
beer
this
is
it
honestly
i
dont
think
anyone
could
make
a
peach
wine
this
delicious
and
balanced
big
sweetness
and
a
big
tartness
someone
pass
the
french
toast
o
overall
i
rate
this
beer
at
a
4
o
if
the
carbonation
was
a
little
lighter
this
would
easily
get
a
4
5
i
cant
rate
at
a
5
because
even
though
this
is
a
great
beer
its
not
something
that
i
can
drink
everyday
its
a
once
or
twice
a
year
drink
a
sweet
peachy
concoction
but
in
no
way
resembles
a
lambic
overall
its
an
excellent
beer
to
go
with
more
food
selections
than
other
lambics
strongly
recommend
to
those
who
are
not
a
fan
of
young
bitter
hops
in
their
drinks
othis
is
pretty
good
a
bit
to
sugary
drinks
more
like
a
wine
cooler
wouldnt
mind
having
again
though
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
flavors
pours
a
lightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
sugary
tart
peach
skin
in
the
taste
quite
sugary
and
small
tartness
of
peach
skin
a
small
tart
bite
but
mainly
smooth
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
tart
peach
skin
in
the
aftertaste
kind
of
like
a
gummy
peach
ring
and
it
is
line
smell
taste
and
aftertaste
all
the
way
through
o
this
was
an
impressive
lambic
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
with
that
being
said
i
dont
think
i
could
have
had
more
than
one
of
these
medium
body
the
carbonation
balances
the
taste
well
not
bad
overall
not
one
of
lindemans
stronger
offerings
overly
sweet
for
me
although
some
might
prefer
it
kind
of
a
turned
down
fruit
lambic
with
turned
up
sweetness
o
this
is
great
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
i
dont
love
this
but
its
pretty
good
o
the
peach
flavor
is
so
darn
sweet
but
it
is
not
as
syrupy
thanks
to
the
big
fizz
there
isnt
much
depth
in
this
beer
but
it
is
not
really
offensive
to
drink
however
one
is
enough
d
great
lambic
its
well
built
and
balanced
fairly
priced
good
quality
and
widely
available
ill
have
this
again
b
overall
i
like
this
lambic
as
stated
it
is
not
too
juicy
but
not
too
carbonated
it
has
a
strong
sweet
peach
flavor
and
combined
with
the
tarty
finish
makes
it
very
enjoyable
has
well
balanced
flavor
overall
my
second
of
the
lindemans
fruit
lambics
this
one
isnt
as
tasty
as
the
frambois
poured
from
a
330
ml
bottle
into
a
lindemans
fluted
glass
this
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
large
foamy
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
arent
really
of
peach
but
some
earthy
grassy
smells
along
with
a
yeasty
lambic
smell
the
feel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
not
as
sweet
as
the
frambrosie
there
is
a
little
earthy
flavor
along
with
the
peach
good
stuff
overall
meh
too
sweet
and
sugary
like
many
of
the
brewerys
fruit
lambics
and
not
sour
enough
to
cut
through
it
o
this
beer
was
quite
tasty
not
as
tart
but
it
felt
better
balanced
than
the
framboise
carbonation
is
right
on
point
keeps
it
light
and
crisp
but
it
drinks
like
a
sparkling
peach
wine
cooler
decent
peach
flavor
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
impression
the
best
lambic
so
far
from
lindemans
no
wonder
it
has
taken
me
almost
6
months
to
find
this
actually
i
probably
could
have
just
called
around
to
local
liquor
stores
and
eventually
found
it
but
it
was
cooler
to
have
stumbled
upon
it
at
a
beer
bar
with
friends
would
recommend
this
one
for
sure
but
not
the
16
price
i
bet
you
could
buy
this
from
1012
probably
not
something
id
have
more
than
a
glass
or
two
of
in
one
sitting
its
a
pretty
good
find
o
i
know
this
isnt
a
world
class
lambic
but
it
sure
is
delicious
id
like
some
funk
and
more
sour
but
its
still
tasty
its
basically
juice
by
the
by
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
for
me
the
body
is
approaching
full
with
a
syrupy
feel
the
carbonation
is
very
modest
but
adds
the
fuzz
around
the
edges
that
somehow
seems
appropriate
for
a
peach
beer
all
the
while
my
mouth
goes
into
pucker
mode
upon
every
sip
overall
very
pleased
with
it
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
light
orange
color
the
head
fizzles
away
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
sweet
and
slightly
tart
aroma
to
it
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
much
like
wine
to
me
there
is
a
sweet
dessert
like
quality
to
this
brew
also
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
going
overall
i
found
this
brew
to
be
pretty
good
overall
its
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
but
still
not
bad
o
a
very
solid
fruit
lambic
that
lives
up
to
the
lindemans
name
of
making
consistently
good
fruit
beers
notes
pretty
much
like
drinking
peach
sorbetice
cream
or
the
peach
drink
mix
you
add
to
water
sweet
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
actual
peach
but
it
isnt
bad
not
cloyingly
sweet
and
it
isnt
prohibitive
to
drinking
more
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
more
pours
a
hazy
peachorange
color
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
whatsoever
smell
is
obviously
of
peaches
peach
juice
and
some
slight
sourtart
aromas
taste
is
of
fresh
sweet
peaches
peach
juice
and
some
tart
acidic
flavors
a
nice
sour
peach
aftertaste
with
each
sip
very
carbonated
with
a
crisp
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
lambic
and
probably
my
other
favorite
besides
the
framboise
really
nice
peach
aromas
and
flavors
on
this
one
poured
a
2
white
soap
suds
head
clear
golden
yellow
color
body
and
the
first
of
their
fruit
lambics
i
thought
looked
like
an
actual
beer
smells
only
mildly
of
peaches
taste
is
also
fairly
mild
on
the
peach
and
also
has
a
little
malt
theres
a
sour
finish
being
a
lambic
and
it
suits
the
peach
well
this
is
less
of
a
dessert
beer
than
there
other
fruits
respectable
side
point
not
affecting
grading
i
dont
see
how
this
is
a
beer
it
followed
the
guidelines
for
a
lambic
however
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
not
label
this
as
a
beer
please
dont
hate
me
for
this
comment
o
great
beer
gods
overall
a
nice
beer
more
of
a
desert
type
beer
the
sweetness
makes
this
one
a
sipper
and
i
dont
imagine
you
could
drink
more
than
one
maybe
two
glasses
in
a
sitting
o
i
do
like
this
but
its
a
bit
too
sweet
i
really
have
to
be
in
the
perfect
mood
to
drink
this
for
the
style
its
solid
for
my
palate
its
just
too
sweet
theres
an
epic
beer
here
it
just
needs
less
sugar
and
more
refinement
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
it
tastes
more
like
a
wine
cooler
but
id
happily
have
another
one
of
these
this
beer
rocks
and
the
wife
loves
it
o
nice
brew
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
overall
though
easy
drinking
fun
simple
super
easy
light
abv
candy
like
beer
truly
a
peach
in
a
glass
dream
lovers
beer
overall
an
amazing
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
fruit
genre
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
with
a
nice
head
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
peaches
and
yeast
taste
is
first
of
tart
peaches
and
wheatbeer
yeastiness
sourness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
light
fruity
and
bubbly
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
the
tartness
and
yeasty
beeryness
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
i
normally
lament
the
lack
of
more
aggressive
lambic
character
acidity
mustiness
barnyard
in
the
lindemans
beers
i
feel
that
actually
works
here
quite
refreshing
and
highly
enjoyable
its
well
worth
seeking
out
and
should
not
be
passed
over
for
the
kriek
or
framboise
my
girlfriend
says
that
this
one
is
perfect
o
wow
i
love
this
beer
i
can
easily
drink
this
all
day
long
on
a
nice
summer
day
pouring
clear
orange
with
a
thin
wispy
white
head
that
falls
off
to
a
ring
leaving
minimal
lacing
this
looks
pretty
decent
the
nose
is
moderately
sweet
in
a
fruity
way
with
plenty
of
peach
character
present
in
some
ways
this
is
like
peach
juice
with
a
little
bit
of
lemon
and
just
a
wisp
of
barnyard
present
surprisingly
complex
imo
the
palate
though
is
a
lot
sweeter
that
aspartame
sweetness
is
prominent
rather
artificial
and
takes
away
from
the
fruit
character
it
also
hides
any
lambic
character
thats
present
sweet
on
the
finish
this
mediumlight
bodied
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
and
finishes
sweet
decent
this
is
better
as
an
accompaniment
with
a
dessert
where
its
lack
of
complexity
can
be
hidden
overall
i
would
say
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
its
got
a
great
scent
to
it
matching
flavors
and
pretty
low
abv
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
drink
all
day
and
night
i
would
think
it
would
be
especially
refreshing
in
the
summer
months
with
the
sweet
fruit
and
mild
tartness
to
it
o
very
good
in
small
quantities
or
paired
with
something
that
could
really
highlight
sweetness
and
artificial
fruit
i
like
its
aroma
it
stands
out
pour
yields
weak
thin
head
body
is
bright
vibrant
orange
smell
is
tart
citrus
orange
with
a
twist
of
peach
i
am
also
picking
some
clove
and
other
belgian
yeast
qualities
smell
seems
to
mostly
be
in
the
sourness
my
first
so
i
would
say
this
is
good
has
a
super
nice
sourness
with
nice
sugar
sweetness
mixed
in
i
think
i
get
more
sour
apple
than
peach
myself
but
it
does
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
for
a
newbie
i
would
compare
it
sour
patch
kids
or
those
candy
peach
rings
the
flavor
hits
immediately
and
stays
the
same
throughout
it
really
holds
up
for
the
long
run
i
think
i
would
enjoy
it
more
if
the
carbonation
was
amped
up
a
bit
but
still
it
feels
pretty
good
on
the
tongue
my
first
sour
or
at
least
i
think
it
is
actually
delivered
on
what
i
expected
it
really
tasted
exactly
as
i
imagined
it
would
and
that
does
not
happen
often
with
beer
o
certainly
quite
sweet
in
terms
of
the
flavor
but
not
the
worst
of
the
lindemans
products
very
sweet
an
enjoyable
dessert
type
beer
fans
of
cider
would
like
it
a
lot
o
i
like
it
not
enough
that
i
would
go
out
and
buy
some
but
enough
that
i
will
take
a
taste
when
i
get
the
chance
if
this
were
a
little
less
sweet
and
a
little
more
tart
i
would
like
it
a
whole
lot
more
o
if
youre
big
on
peach
pie
check
this
one
out
if
youre
looking
for
a
true
belgian
lambic
avoid
this
one
overly
sweet
and
without
the
tartness
that
one
would
normally
associate
with
a
lambic
o
this
is
a
terrific
lambic
that
is
delicious
and
weak
enough
in
alcohol
to
be
enjoyed
at
any
hour
o
a
refreshing
treat
that
ill
have
to
try
with
peach
cobbler
sometime
drinkability
is
high
this
is
delicious
cloudy
orange
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
lots
of
lace
left
behind
on
the
the
flute
aromas
are
a
tad
skunked
not
prominent
in
any
magnificent
way
theres
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
but
its
almost
stale
and
somewhat
metallic
the
flavors
tell
a
whole
different
story
thankfully
sweet
syruplike
peaches
up
front
and
some
bitterness
at
the
back
high
carbonation
with
a
thick
mouthcoating
consistency
this
brew
is
good
but
its
even
better
when
you
have
someone
to
split
it
with
too
sweet
for
me
to
consider
drinking
an
entire
750
id
go
with
something
like
this
before
or
after
dinner
very
easy
sipper
when
youre
looking
for
something
light
and
tart
not
too
much
sour
not
too
much
sweet
great
overall
drinkablility
is
high
hell
the
bottle
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
and
i
certainly
could
drink
another
all
in
all
for
my
first
experience
with
a
beer
of
this
style
this
one
makes
me
want
to
explore
it
further
poured
a
dark
pale
orange
with
a
small
white
fizzy
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
a
bread
malt
a
doughy
yeast
with
a
strong
peach
presence
it
tasted
sweet
of
peaches
and
malts
at
first
and
finished
sweetlysour
and
quite
peachy
almost
like
a
champagne
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
dry
in
texture
with
a
very
lively
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
lambic
especially
if
you
like
champagne
drinkability
not
a
session
beer
then
again
most
lambics
arent
however
its
a
perfect
dessert
or
brunch
beer
im
a
fan
i
like
the
peach
flavors
and
love
the
balance
drinkability
a
great
drinker
quite
surprising
for
such
a
sweet
lambic
d
very
high
drinkability
with
a
nice
average
4abv
and
great
taste
d
i
think
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
is
a
good
beer
but
the
sweetness
is
getting
to
me
a
little
keep
in
mind
this
is
my
first
lambic
so
im
not
quite
used
to
this
style
of
beer
yet
overall
i
liked
it
i
definitely
think
i
need
to
keep
getting
more
fimiliar
with
this
style
and
understand
it
more
my
girlfriend
loved
this
one
though
i
recommend
trying
it
out
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
lambic
and
an
eyeopening
one
at
that
poured
a
hazy
lazy
pale
gold
with
a
white
head
and
sharp
lacing
smelled
of
fresh
peaches
soaked
in
fresh
peach
juice
tasted
of
a
peach
farm
peach
puree
with
a
simple
syrup
component
to
it
ad
a
clean
brisk
and
refreshing
bite
to
it
with
a
little
tartness
on
the
end
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
clean
and
bubbly
drinkability
maybe
not
for
a
night
out
but
the
right
time
for
this
beer
is
a
summer
weekend
really
good
stuff
this
was
amazing
perhaps
the
best
memory
of
this
christmas
and
a
christmas
miracle
too
i
found
a
beer
my
mom
liked
the
taste
of
this
beer
poured
orange
with
a
whitepeach
colored
head
smell
was
intensely
of
sweet
fruits
complimenting
the
taste
it
was
light
and
bubbly
to
the
tongue
the
alcohol
almost
not
noticeable
it
was
perhaps
that
that
made
it
so
easy
to
drink
d
tasty
especially
if
youre
into
peaches
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
it
done
much
better
than
most
regular
fruit
beers
o
combination
of
sweet
and
sour
is
very
well
balanced
so
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
burn
out
the
palate
low
abv
means
many
can
be
had
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
d
could
probably
drink
this
forever
had
this
ontap
at
fathers
office
in
santa
monica
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
thin
white
head
smells
strongly
of
peach
but
also
candy
sugar
flavour
is
both
sweet
and
tart
quite
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
flavours
very
smooth
carbonation
this
may
be
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
it
is
good
lindemans
pêche
has
a
yellow
colour
and
a
head
that
is
about
one
finger
high
despite
the
fact
that
its
not
especially
carbonated
the
head
lasts
the
smell
is
strong
and
fruity
it
smelled
of
banana
to
me
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
banana
ester
it
tastes
like
a
cider
to
me
or
fruit
juice
the
peach
is
especially
noticeable
in
the
afteretaste
this
beer
is
thin
like
cider
in
your
mouth
like
slightly
carbonated
water
this
beer
was
very
nice
but
the
sweetness
was
slightly
overpowering
after
more
than
one
glass
bottled
pours
a
turbid
deep
copper
orange
with
a
sizable
head
nose
is
some
sour
oak
and
canned
peaches
not
bad
extremely
sweet
flavor
compared
to
every
other
lambic
ive
tried
though
it
tastes
kind
of
good
not
fresh
peaches
but
canned
peaches
and
syrup
ultimately
this
is
candylike
and
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
better
than
the
framboise
and
cassis
overall
basically
to
recap
lindemans
pêche
balances
much
better
than
framboise
tastes
just
as
good
but
the
appearance
feel
and
drinkability
do
not
compare
i
would
suggest
that
everyone
try
it
warm
for
it
is
a
beer
not
lacking
in
character
and
an
amazing
example
of
beer
great
morning
beer
d
great
fruit
flavor
and
very
easy
to
sip
on
this
would
make
a
good
substitution
for
a
mimosa
at
a
brunch
i
found
drinkability
to
be
high
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
as
an
afterdinner
drink
in
lambics
ive
finally
found
a
beer
style
my
wife
likes
poured
a
orange
color
that
was
slightly
hazed
smelled
of
fresh
peaches
sweet
malts
and
some
caramel
taste
of
fresh
peaches
and
sweet
malt
and
some
champagne
flavor
almost
like
a
sparkling
peach
beverage
very
flavorful
mouthfeel
very
light
almost
like
champagne
beer
snobs
may
knock
a
good
lambic
such
as
this
but
they
are
being
too
purest
and
need
to
remember
that
beer
is
open
to
interpretation
very
drinkable
and
a
highly
memorable
beer
drinkability
for
a
peachflavored
libation
id
rather
opt
for
a
bellini
still
its
decent
enough
to
split
with
the
girlfriend
on
a
lazy
sunday
afternoon
d
i
like
the
low
abv
but
this
got
a
bit
cloying
after
a
while
d
i
was
able
to
finish
my
part
of
the
bottle
that
i
had
split
with
my
girl
friend
i
enjoyed
it
but
after
i
wanted
something
more
fimiliar
frothy
white
head
and
clear
aroma
has
hints
of
herbs
and
grass
light
yeast
peach
duh
dry
texture
with
a
very
fizzy
carbonation
heavy
sweet
innitial
flavor
and
finish
peach
is
of
course
the
dominant
flavor
but
its
not
too
overpowering
very
refreshing
d
i
realize
that
many
bash
the
lambics
that
lindemans
puts
out
but
i
rather
have
enjoyed
them
thus
far
fruity
and
lightly
sour
with
good
acidity
what
i
like
about
them
is
that
they
tend
to
be
a
more
fruitdriven
take
on
the
style
rather
than
a
face
melting
sourness
very
food
friendly
and
just
plain
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
flavors
they
offer
overall
another
solid
intro
into
my
delving
into
lambics
i
think
they
are
starting
to
grow
on
me
pours
a
light
hazy
copper
yellowish
color
with
spare
white
fizzy
head
spare
lacing
and
average
carbonation
peach
boozey
smell
and
strong
fizzy
peach
taste
very
sweet
and
tart
and
finishes
the
same
light
bodied
with
a
long
flavor
duration
very
very
sour
amazing
brew
taste
even
better
after
sex
going
to
the
country
going
to
eat
a
lot
of
peaches
or
drink
a
lot
of
peaches
im
not
sure
what
else
to
say
about
this
beer
except
its
a
lambic
and
tastes
and
smells
like
peaches
so
if
youd
had
the
other
flavors
just
substitute
peach
for
whatever
other
fruit
youve
had
this
one
is
tasty
d
really
easy
to
do
for
something
that
is
sweet
its
helped
by
the
tartness
its
pretty
straight
forward
but
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
drinkability
not
so
much
in
my
opinion
very
very
sweet
very
sweet
tastes
of
refined
sugar
orange
lemon
and
lime
peach
flavor
is
clearly
present
but
the
flavor
is
overall
sweet
citrus
there
is
an
abundance
of
carbonation
and
a
terrific
head
and
lacing
in
the
glass
this
is
an
unusual
offering
for
the
beer
drinker
it
may
technically
be
a
beer
but
it
drinks
like
lancers
wine
with
less
alcohol
one
bottle
is
probably
enough
a
second
would
cash
out
your
taste
buds
with
the
overwhelming
sweetness
definitely
worth
a
try
and
if
you
like
sweet
fruit
beers
you
will
love
this
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
peaches
with
some
light
tartness
the
flavor
is
strong
syrupy
peaches
with
a
little
bit
of
tartness
medium
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
this
has
nothing
in
common
with
other
belgian
lambics
but
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
a
good
one
anna
says
pair
it
with
a
nutty
cheese
like
parrano
a
pleasant
fruit
lambic
where
once
again
a
nice
balance
is
struck
between
the
fruit
grain
and
yeasty
funk
something
nice
to
sip
on
after
a
big
meal
and
somewhat
dessertlike
inspiring
thoughts
of
revisiting
the
local
10hour
drive
for
me
orchardstrewn
sunbelt
strip
asap
drinkability
is
very
high
doesnt
have
any
boozy
elements
to
it
its
very
low
in
terms
of
its
abv
and
it
tastes
fruity
not
really
a
beer
id
have
too
often
but
for
its
style
a
very
good
example
id
have
it
again
in
regards
to
which
of
the
lindemans
fruit
lineup
youll
enjoy
the
most
it
really
just
comes
down
to
what
fruit
flavor
you
prefer
or
as
is
the
case
with
me
what
mood
youre
in
i
thought
i
was
in
a
peach
mood
but
now
im
not
sure
i
actually
was
no
matter
with
summer
fast
approaching
im
sure
a
peachy
mood
will
soon
strike
me
d
perfect
with
homemade
coconut
cake
ill
get
this
one
again
easily
ive
pretty
much
enjoyed
every
lambic
ive
had
and
this
was
no
exception
the
peche
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
it
smells
very
sweet
and
you
can
definitely
detect
the
peach
flavor
the
taste
is
similar
very
sweet
peach
flavor
with
just
a
bit
of
a
sour
finish
i
highly
recommend
this
lambic
its
very
tart
so
id
recommend
pairing
it
with
some
sunday
brunch
fair
altogether
a
fantastic
brew
that
is
sure
to
surprise
people
unfamiliar
with
lambics
the
peach
tastes
fresh
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
in
by
brews
but
this
is
a
refreshing
drink
ill
probably
split
this
bottle
and
be
content
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
perfect
to
pair
with
dessert
md
not
as
great
as
the
other
fruit
flavored
lindemans
lambics
still
a
refreshing
treat
of
a
beer
d
the
peach
flavors
are
quite
strong
the
sweetness
can
become
a
little
cloying
near
the
end
which
limits
me
to
just
this
one
bottle
drinkability
i
really
like
the
sour
and
fruit
mix
it
is
reasonably
complex
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
that
i
could
have
several
of
good
times
had
by
all
d
a
good
beer
anyone
who
likes
peaches
will
like
this
not
overtly
fruity
and
sugary
as
the
framboise
golden
orange
with
a
decent
head
and
good
lacing
smells
like
fuzzy
peaches
but
subtle
and
slightly
dusty
not
bad
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
syrup
and
sugar
with
a
bit
of
peach
like
the
stuff
canned
peaches
sit
in
this
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
like
peaches
so
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
fair
shot
lindemans
needs
to
add
some
peaches
to
cuvee
rene
that
would
be
awesome
a
big
fluffy
head
and
great
lacing
on
a
very
cloudy
orangish
gold
brew
a
strong
and
sweet
peach
aroma
with
a
bit
of
wild
sourness
and
horse
blanket
taste
is
sweet
and
full
of
peaches
a
nice
tartness
balances
it
with
a
touch
of
soap
and
funk
still
a
bit
sweet
overall
a
good
dry
finish
brings
grains
and
a
clean
juiciness
crisp
feel
with
a
light
medium
weight
a
dry
quenching
sensation
as
i
drink
even
though
the
abv
is
low
you
really
need
a
food
to
enjoy
going
through
a
bottle
of
this
as
the
taste
makes
this
on
a
sipper
more
that
a
quaffer
my
wifes
a
big
fan
of
this
so
i
snagged
a
small
glass
out
of
her
750
for
a
review
the
pour
is
golden
orange
with
a
bit
of
haze
bright
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
sweet
peach
in
the
aroma
this
is
also
echoed
in
the
taste
theres
a
hint
of
sourness
but
it
is
pretty
tame
ive
had
this
before
and
of
the
lindemans
ive
always
preferred
the
apple
this
lacks
that
punch
of
sourness
that
i
enjoy
ill
stick
to
merely
bummin
a
sip
of
this
every
now
and
then
pours
a
translucent
golden
orange
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fell
quickly
leaving
some
sparse
lacing
in
the
tulip
nice
funk
in
the
nose
much
more
so
than
their
kriek
or
framboise
with
a
light
peachy
fruitiness
not
bad
in
the
aroma
department
wow
i
cant
believe
how
much
peach
flavor
this
has
based
on
what
was
coming
from
the
nose
sweet
orchard
fruit
sugar
syrup
light
tartness
and
acidity
something
that
would
have
really
made
this
beer
sing
if
there
had
been
a
little
more
not
bad
at
all
but
maybe
just
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
tingle
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
im
pretty
much
done
after
one
and
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
drinkability
this
is
one
tasty
beer
but
it
is
among
my
least
favorite
of
the
lindemans
lambic
flavors
id
definitely
drink
it
again
but
not
everyday
overall
this
is
a
very
good
lambic
just
because
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
nice
i
would
love
this
beer
if
both
aroma
and
taste
were
a
little
stronger
and
pronounced
and
there
was
a
tiny
bit
more
complexity
overall
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavors
here
that
make
one
think
of
beer
but
it
is
fairly
tasty
sweetness
is
waaay
too
much
and
the
mouth
puckering
sourness
that
i
enjoy
so
much
in
lambics
is
toned
down
quite
a
bit
carbonation
is
very
high
almost
to
the
point
of
champagne
the
peach
flavors
are
very
prevalent
and
i
am
guessing
have
some
artificial
boosting
additive
it
tastes
pretty
decent
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
tad
too
expensive
for
me
to
want
to
buy
again
pours
a
clear
and
clean
golden
yellow
with
hints
of
orange
pure
white
head
that
bubbles
up
and
away
quickly
scent
of
fresh
peaches
with
hints
of
hay
and
must
taste
is
slightly
tart
peach
which
the
nose
did
not
hint
at
faint
hints
of
hay
and
must
minor
candied
sugar
background
to
offset
tartness
thin
body
crisp
carbonated
slightly
less
than
champagne
somewhat
dry
and
little
tart
aftertaste
pretty
drinkable
wish
i
had
a
dogfish
head
festina
peche
for
comparison
purposes
but
alas
it
is
out
of
season
two
fingers
of
super
frothy
head
almost
whipped
up
bone
white
slow
to
wind
down
moderate
cling
in
the
lacing
light
orange
to
yellow
in
color
very
clear
but
not
close
to
watery
transparent
though
close
to
hard
cider
in
appearance
the
nose
very
clearly
expresses
peach
fruit
boisterously
fresh
touch
of
lemon
and
orange
citrus
golden
honey
glaze
lifts
and
spreads
widely
not
sure
its
supposed
to
do
more
than
this
fullbodied
downy
soft
carbonation
relieves
heaviness
yet
sinks
in
all
the
way
and
requires
effort
to
wash
out
of
the
palate
huge
juicy
peach
with
tang
the
orange
and
lemon
citrus
a
very
able
supplement
contributes
to
an
uptempo
pace
and
general
mouthwatering
quality
theres
nothing
here
that
isnt
obvious
from
the
start
however
no
less
impressive
for
it
drinkability
is
high
imo
its
just
a
very
refreshing
beverage
drinkability
this
is
extraordinarily
drinkable
like
i
said
above
barely
even
tastes
like
beer
really
good
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
ever
had
almost
like
drinking
a
sparkling
fruit
juice
that
has
a
few
beer
notes
added
on
very
different
from
the
norm
d
certainly
different
from
my
usual
tastings
but
not
a
bad
brew
overall
as
i
said
little
earlier
this
has
a
good
bit
of
a
sparkling
wine
quality
to
it
so
its
probably
good
brew
for
folks
who
enjoy
that
style
like
my
wife
when
shes
not
pregnant
ha
not
a
must
try
by
any
means
but
a
good
brew
none
the
less
pours
a
partially
cloudy
orange
color
that
forcefully
produces
little
to
no
head
really
only
a
penline
of
white
lace
is
visible
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
reminiscent
of
a
head
lots
of
carbination
in
this
beer
with
a
light
mouthfeel
sourness
dominates
the
taste
both
upfront
and
in
the
finish
but
also
has
quite
a
bit
of
peach
sweetness
as
well
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
both
sour
from
the
yeast
and
sweet
from
the
peaches
d
highly
drinkable
able
to
be
guzzled
wonderful
summerpicnic
selection
obviously
a
sweeter
lambic
and
while
i
prefer
the
more
traditional
take
on
the
style
i
also
find
these
sweet
fruity
versions
to
be
quite
refreshing
if
done
right
dont
go
into
this
one
expecting
a
huge
lambic
character
approach
it
more
like
a
good
fruit
beer
pours
a
golden
honey
color
with
a
very
small
pure
white
head
that
settled
into
a
ring
the
aroma
is
of
full
frontal
fruit
a
sweet
candied
peach
aroma
with
hints
of
apple
jolly
rancher
like
characteristics
big
sweet
sugary
flavors
definitely
fruity
the
peach
does
peak
out
after
the
initial
sweet
blast
there
is
also
some
white
grape
and
apple
skin
flavor
to
add
a
slight
tartness
again
does
remind
me
of
a
jolly
rancher
moderate
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
it
has
a
touch
of
a
champagne
quality
but
it
quickly
gets
lost
in
the
sweetness
deliously
sweet
and
fruity
with
about
12ozs
worth
before
it
would
get
cloying
very
nice
dessert
brew
drinkability
is
decent
as
far
as
beer
goes
there
is
not
really
any
maly
or
hop
qualities
and
no
distinct
yeast
notes
either
for
what
it
is
it
is
well
put
together
but
it
ends
up
tasting
like
fruit
juice
with
a
light
carbonation

very
peachy
and
not
overly
complex
but
refreshing
and
enjoyable
thanks
for
the
bottle
milos
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
and
i
will
buy
it
again
and
again
very
easy
drinking
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
few
too
sugary
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
upfront
but
a
little
sweet
to
be
having
several
of
alcoholwise
youd
probably
go
into
a
diabetic
coma
before
getting
all
that
drunk
but
tastewise
its
spoton
and
easy
to
go
through
pours
a
golden
orange
clear
color
body
with
an
average
whitish
head
quickly
diminishing
aroma
of
strong
carbonated
peaches
fresh
from
a
canlike
some
effervescence
and
soda
likeness
sweet
syrupy
taste
peaches
and
sugar
carbonation
refreshing
doesnt
pair
necessarily
well
with
spicy
pizza
very
surprised
by
this
beer
but
it
has
opened
my
eyes
to
the
lambic
style
and
i
know
that
is
somewhere
i
would
like
to
venture
to
this
would
also
be
a
great
way
to
get
someone
into
another
style
of
beer
d
one
could
sit
down
and
put
back
a
bunch
of
these
but
there
is
no
need
to
hammer
down
what
is
more
or
less
an
aperitif
drinkability
very
good
i
love
it
its
like
alcoholic
peach
juice
poured
from
bottle
at
ebs
nice
crisp
clear
straw
color
with
good
carbonation
aromas
of
peach
to
be
sure
and
sweet
at
that
this
is
like
candy
water
peach
flavored
at
that
you
could
easily
polish
off
5
or
6
bottles
and
not
realize
it
until
you
couldnt
walk
straight
karen
loves
this
style
overall
this
was
my
first
lambic
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
25
4
oz
bottle
went
down
easy
i
will
be
trying
the
other
ones
i
could
see
these
being
enjoyed
any
time
of
the
year
as
well
the
only
thing
that
caught
me
off
guard
was
the
fact
that
this
has
a
cork
that
requires
a
cork
screw
this
might
show
my
limits
but
this
is
a
first
im
use
to
a
cork
that
has
a
cage
i
had
to
hunt
down
a
cork
screw
regardless
very
nice
750ml
green
bottle
corked
and
capped
obtained
at
hannafords
supermarket
derry
nh
golden
in
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
half
inch
off
white
head
that
shortly
lasted
fruity
smell
with
a
nice
peach
scent
with
a
slight
vinegar
scent
but
not
overly
pronounced
peachy
but
not
syrupy
with
a
sour
finish
reminds
me
of
biting
into
a
nice
ripe
sweet
peach
in
the
middle
of
summer
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
summerearly
fall
ive
never
had
anything
that
so
well
appealed
to
people
who
dont
drink
beer
and
yet
could
so
well
appeal
to
those
that
do
so
i
know
im
not
very
fond
of
peaches
but
ill
try
not
to
let
that
interfere
too
much
pours
a
clear
golden
jello
with
a
nice
head
smells
like
peach
cobbler
and
nothing
more
taste
follows
very
thick
syrupy
sweet
peaches
like
those
canned
peaches
youre
saving
for
the
next
big
earthquake
nice
enough
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
12
ounce
pour
is
all
one
needs
for
night
d
extremely
sippable
gorgeously
fruity
brew
this
is
one
ill
be
recommending
to
all
my
friends
even
the
nonbeer
drinkers
overall
a
solid
lambic
with
peaches
added
not
my
favorite
from
lindemans
but
still
very
tasty
pours
a
hazy
bubbly
honeyamber
with
a
decent
white
head
rather
strong
aroma
is
sweet
and
mainly
of
peach
flavor
is
peachy
and
quite
sweet
more
like
nectar
or
schnapps
than
beer
with
an
undertone
of
malt
texture
is
very
smooth
and
rather
fizzy
a
good
dessert
beer
notes
i
recommend
that
any
beer
enthusiast
try
a
lambic
at
least
once
and
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
i
havent
had
many
lambics
but
this
was
nice
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
it
all
day
again
it
seems
way
too
sweet
at
first
but
its
not
as
thick
as
the
flavour
leads
it
to
be
very
light
but
very
flavourable
i
would
drink
more
if
i
had
more
poured
into
a
champagne
flute
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
burnt
orange
tint
yeast
and
peaches
in
the
nose
smells
enticing
taste
is
very
refreshing
carbonation
is
ample
and
lends
itself
well
a
nice
sweetness
to
the
beer
and
peaches
are
definitely
there
but
are
remarkably
well
balanced
with
the
malts
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
in
large
quantities
but
this
beer
would
serve
itself
well
as
an
aperitif
or
champagne
substitute
not
a
bad
drop
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
thin
head
smells
like
fuzzy
peaches
with
some
other
fruity
aromas
and
there
is
a
little
cork
scent
also
very
sweet
peachy
flavor
at
first
that
also
mixes
with
maybe
a
little
plum
flavor
that
quickly
dries
out
in
a
crisp
finish
this
is
like
candy
beer
d
this
is
a
specialty
beer
to
me
i
could
drink
this
all
day
but
would
expect
a
sour
stomach
after
a
few
bottles
this
would
be
great
to
serve
to
a
group
or
someone
who
doesnt
like
a
typical
beer
ive
heard
a
lot
of
things
about
lindemans
lambics
and
this
is
my
first
go
with
peche
i
was
pretty
apprehensive
about
it
to
be
honest
despite
the
fact
that
its
merely
above
average
beer
it
is
better
than
i
expected
based
on
what
id
heard
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
resemble
beer
much
at
all
i
am
surprised
in
that
respect
frankly
its
too
sweet
and
just
not
my
thing
that
being
said
its
alright
and
worth
checking
out
i
split
a
bottle
of
this
corked
capped
and
foiled
with
my
better
half
the
beer
is
hazy
gold
color
with
a
wet
foam
that
coats
the
glass
while
fading
on
the
liquid
the
aromas
are
fruity
and
yeasty
it
smells
a
little
like
koningshoeven
tripel
but
with
some
peach
the
taste
is
just
a
little
sour
a
trace
of
bite
with
the
first
sip
but
theres
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
balance
the
tart
the
taste
becomes
a
little
addictive
this
is
really
a
better
beer
than
i
expected
the
body
is
full
with
good
carbonation
ive
passed
on
this
beer
for
years
periodically
getting
the
kriek
or
framboise
but
really
the
peche
is
the
best
of
them
so
far
for
me
drinkability
is
very
low
for
me
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
liking
but
also
a
very
good
change
of
pace
for
once
for
as
fruity
as
this
beer
is
it
surprised
me
how
refreshing
it
was
the
peach
flavor
is
syrupy
but
not
annoyingly
so
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
like
previously
stated
im
not
big
on
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
one
of
these
if
it
were
offered
drinkability
is
high
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
good
and
fizzy
drinkability
is
not
that
great
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
cloying
and
unlike
lindemans
pomme
or
framboise
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
bottle
still
a
good
beer
but
probably
my
least
favorite
lindemans
so
far
all
in
all
a
personal
favorite
of
the
lindemans
lambics
normally
the
framboise
is
the
lambic
that
gets
all
the
accolades
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
i
enjoy
this
combination
lots
of
peach
not
as
sour
as
some
lambics
very
sweet
full
body
along
with
a
high
level
of
co2
i
think
peche
is
my
favorite
lambic
style
this
may
be
my
favorite
peche
very
fruity
flavorful
beverage
has
enough
of
a
beer
taste
though
to
make
it
reasonable
theres
really
not
much
else
to
say
if
youre
looking
for
a
lambic
or
any
fruity
beer
for
that
matter
the
buck
stops
here
obviously
this
is
not
something
youre
going
to
want
to
drink
alot
of
but
this
is
a
great
quaff
d
not
my
favorite
lambic
but
still
good

other
than
being
sweeter
than
i
would
have
liked
this
is
a
fine
beverage
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
but
would
like
to
notes
it
could
have
been
really
bad
peach
and
beer
but
it
is
very
pleasant
it
should
be
popular
with
those
enjoying
fruit
beers
very
drinkable
think
a
session
champagne
minus
the
dryness
and
bubbles
drinkability
its
exceptional
you
can
drink
this
all
day
and
especially
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
thin
white
head
aroma
is
very
sour
dominated
by
peach
of
course
and
alcohol
very
nice
balance
of
tart
sourness
and
sweet
pech
flavor
better
than
i
expected
based
on
its
appearance
and
aroma
bottle
bought
a
few
months
ago
at
the
state
liquor
store
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
to
enjoy
this
and
it
was
pretty
nice
pours
out
a
initially
quite
large
white
head
that
goes
down
to
almost
nothing
a
beautiful
clear
copper
body
the
aroma
is
well
what
do
you
expect
peaches
both
sweet
canned
kinds
and
a
more
natural
tart
kind
the
taste
was
similar
it
leaned
towards
a
sugary
sweet
peach
flavor
but
some
balance
is
achieved
by
a
more
tart
flavor
fizzy
and
highly
carbonated
not
bad
at
all
i
would
drink
this
stuff
again
its
good
and
refreshing
more
of
a
summer
thing
i
guess
d
overall
a
very
good
beer
very
easy
drinking
but
a
little
slightly
sweet
poured
from
a
cool
355ml
bottle
that
is
both
capped
and
corked
beer
has
the
color
of
apple
juice
and
has
a
sparkling
white
head
the
smell
is
definitely
peaches
it
reminds
me
of
a
peach
jam
my
mom
used
to
make
sweet
but
not
overly
so
the
taste
is
also
peachy
but
there
is
a
maltgrain
background
that
reminds
you
that
you
arent
drinking
a
wine
cooler
not
too
sweet
the
wild
yeast
has
created
a
slight
sourtart
note
that
complements
the
mix
quite
nicely
the
carbonation
has
a
silky
creamy
feel
to
it
while
the
lambic
itself
has
a
slight
acidic
tart
mouthdrying
effect
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lambic
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
d
this
is
an
awesome
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
dessert
and
i
always
am
decent
look
and
smell
with
a
great
taste
very
drinkable
in
my
book
could
easily
have
23
before
it
gets
old
it
was
a
fleshy
yellow
with
next
to
no
head
bold
blunt
unashamedly
candid
peach
flavor
with
subtleties
of
malt
and
grains
it
turned
out
to
be
a
perfect
way
to
end
the
night
but
there
are
other
beers
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
lot
more
for
way
less
money
at
nearly
five
bucks
a
bottle
youd
have
to
be
a
serious
fan
of
the
style
overall
i
like
this
one
best
of
the
lindeman
lambics
but
if
they
could
just
tone
down
the
sweetness
a
bit
id
like
it
a
bit
more
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
but
will
probably
not
buy
it
again
due
to
the
price
and
the
fact
that
it
does
not
really
taste
like
a
beer
but
hey
i
guess
thats
not
really
what
a
fruit
beer
is
supposed
to
be
like
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
lindemans
this
would
be
a
good
starter
beer
for
people
who
have
not
had
beer
before
its
also
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
hanging
out
with
some
friends
d
not
very
high
this
is
one
to
sip
and
savor
simple
but
good
is
the
way
i
see
this
one
its
really
quite
gorgeous
tastes
of
peach
juice
a
bit
of
tartness
faint
pale
malts
and
sweetness
very
enjoyable
fruit
beerlambic
thought
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
nice
cloudy
orange
with
a
lacy
beige
head
the
nose
has
tart
peaches
and
musky
oak
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
faint
fruit
sour
a
crisp
light
body
is
quite
refreshing
a
little
too
sweet
but
still
a
fine
beverage
d
not
my
favorite
of
the
lindemans
offerings
but
not
bad
at
all
i
think
this
one
goes
a
little
too
sweet
without
throwing
you
the
sourness
to
dry
out
the
finish
making
the
drinkability
a
little
lower
than
the
others
great
sour
taste
throughout
balanced
with
a
very
nice
sweetness
light
carbonation
low
alcohol
and
great
taste
made
this
a
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
drink
d
very
drinkable
in
an
endless
way
too
sweet
and
soda
like
i
couldnt
have
too
much
of
this
one
tasted
like
juice
i
couldnt
find
the
beer
in
it
smelled
amazing
tasted
just
as
it
smelled
lots
of
fruit
juices
i
couldnt
specifically
pick
out
the
peach
but
it
was
definitely
in
there
somewhere
this
was
very
comparable
to
the
leinenkugels
berry
weis
for
me
only
the
lambic
was
smoother
easier
to
drink
and
tasted
less
sprakling
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
all
i
wish
it
had
a
higher
abv
though
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
fruit
lambic
i
prefer
peach
flavored
beers
to
most
others
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
and
received
a
ciderlike
body
with
a
mountainous
head
that
died
quickly
but
left
lace
patches
thanks
to
an
immense
carbonation
a
hoppy
smell
with
sour
peach
notes
and
a
light
sweet
malt
smell
reminded
me
of
a
white
wine
or
a
heavy
apple
juice
smell
very
smooth
almost
slick
and
buttery
this
lighttomedium
bodied
beer
maintains
a
distinct
peach
taste
and
is
also
sweet
finished
with
a
drying
backbite
from
a
hopkick
that
put
up
minor
citric
notes
maybe
a
tad
too
sour
and
fruity
for
a
sessioning
but
i
gladly
look
forward
to
having
this
again
d
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
down
in
my
drinking
pedigree
a
good
mix
of
flavors
and
enjoyable
through
and
through
great
for
porch
drinking
on
a
hot
summers
evening
very
satisfying
i
was
scared
of
this
one
i
have
avoided
this
one
for
ten
years
but
i
had
tryed
all
the
outhers
so
i
figured
why
not
try
this
one
i
found
that
i
have
been
mising
out
this
one
is
like
peach
pie
in
a
glass
the
lambic
is
nice
and
the
peach
starts
nice
and
tart
and
fades
into
pure
sweetness
i
will
get
this
one
agan
and
agan
for
sure
drinkability
very
nice
lambic
even
if
it
is
technically
fake
decent
but
only
just
to
mix
things
up
d
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
not
quite
as
strong
and
sour
as
the
framboise
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
all
the
time
but
i
would
definitely
have
it
every
now
and
again
i
must
try
this
on
my
wife
nice
and
crisp
tingly
good
carbonation
it
was
hard
to
tell
where
the
peach
stopped
and
the
beer
began
great
work
one
of
my
favorite
aspects
of
drinking
lambics
is
simply
being
confused
and
thrown
around
in
an
ocean
of
creativity
this
lambic
has
a
orangyyellow
appearance
and
i
poured
a
one
finger
whiteorange
head
it
has
an
obvious
peach
smell
but
there
are
also
traces
of
vinegar
and
oak
it
has
a
very
nice
taste
at
first
it
is
sour
with
a
definite
peach
flavor
the
longer
it
sits
the
sweeter
it
becomes
it
has
a
very
sugary
peach
flavor
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
very
acidic
carbonated
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
has
an
everchanging
flavor
thoughout
the
drink
the
high
acidity
does
have
the
potential
to
give
you
heartburn
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
dexcellent
and
a
good
blend
of
light
flavors
and
sweet
aroma
with
wellbalanced
body
and
carbonation
pours
a
clear
bubbly
orange
to
gold
with
a
bright
white
head
slight
funkiness
in
the
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
vinegar
and
a
lot
of
juicy
peach
aroma
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
peach
with
just
a
hint
of
funky
yeast
and
even
less
of
a
beer
like
malt
backdrop
tartness
helps
balance
it
to
keep
it
short
of
cloying
but
it
could
still
be
a
bit
less
sweet
overall
comes
off
much
like
a
peach
spritzer
with
a
nice
bubbly
body
that
is
easy
to
drink
d
this
would
be
one
for
desert
or
just
to
drink
beer
but
not
with
a
meal
it
is
very
tasty
and
i
would
defiantly
go
for
it
again
it
is
very
sweet
and
i
probable
would
not
be
able
to
drink
a
number
of
them
because
of
the
sweetness
this
beer
is
the
first
that
i
have
ever
gotten
to
share
a
substantial
amount
of
with
my
wife
after
many
many
unsuccessful
attempts
therefore
it
is
a
huge
winner
in
my
book
thanks
lindemans
easy
to
drink
but
restrained
by
the
deep
sweetness
lindemans
peche
is
delicious
light
and
refreshing
a
great
way
to
cap
off
the
night
dessert
beer
and
definitely
recommended
light
peach
color
with
an
ample
white
head
cloudy
and
very
effervescent
aromas
of
canned
peaches
no
sign
of
wildness
in
this
beer
taste
is
pretty
much
carbonated
peach
juice
with
a
smidgeon
of
tartness
tastes
somewhat
artificial
very
bubbly
and
drinkable
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
d
delicious
lambic
if
they
werent
so
expensive
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
lindemans
has
mastered
this
beer
it
gets
no
better
poured
from
the
big
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
soapy
white
head
nose
is
yeasty
sour
peach
and
green
apple
taste
is
tangy
peach
sweet
and
sugary
not
very
beery
but
good
anyways
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
great
exceptionally
drinkable
especially
at
4
d
drinks
like
peach
flavored
juice
with
almost
no
alcohol
detection
at
all
drank
exceptionally
smooth
and
clean
a
tad
sugary
sweet
which
may
limit
multiples
d
an
extremely
good
dessert
drink
12
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
clear
gold
with
a
ton
of
sedement
with
a
white
colored
head
nose
of
peaches
some
sourness
and
candied
sweetness

taste
of
sweet
and
sour
peaches
nice
and
tart
and
robust
body
is
full
smooth
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
dried
apricot
sweet
and
tart
this
was
a
tasty
desert
beer
im
not
an
expert
on
lambics
so
it
was
hard
to
detect
any
flavors
from
the
yeasts
used
i
found
that
many
nonbeer
drinkers
enjoyed
this
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
as
well
as
pricey
in
a
lot
of
areas
well
brewed
nonetheless
give
it
a
try
a
good
offering
but
lindemans
has
done
much
better
once
again
this
is
not
a
traditional
sour
lambic
pours
yellow
pink
and
cloudy
smells
like
musty
peach
no
head
taste
is
peachy
but
more
like
peach
flavored
yogurt
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
a
great
gift
for
that
special
lady
would
include
the
lindemans
cassis
framboise
pomme
and
peche
they
are
tasty
in
a
desert
kind
of
way
almost
like
juices
i
like
em
but
they
are
by
no
means
traditional
lambic
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
despite
being
brewed
in
belgium
but
dont
get
me
wrong
as
far
as
taste
i
like
these
better
than
sour
lambics
i
know
that
is
wierd
but
i
just
cant
do
sour
in
my
beer
i
could
drink
these
every
day
but
i
dont
this
is
a
great
beer
at
night
after
a
nice
meal
id
love
to
have
a
piece
of
pound
cake
with
it
poured
into
a
stange
the
color
is
a
faded
orange
topped
by
a
fuzzy
white
head
the
flavor
in
this
one
is
pretty
straightforward
some
peaches
balanced
by
some
sourness
with
a
trace
of
malts
did
i
mention
its
delicious
who
needs
orange
juice
for
the
morning
when
you
can
serve
yourself
a
peach
lambic
ill
definately
have
this
another
time
but
its
a
little
pricey
to
have
everyday
maybe
i
gush
too
much
over
beers
like
this
however
its
not
often
that
you
find
a
fermented
fruit
beverage
that
beats
the
pants
off
of
hard
cider
lambics
are
almost
not
like
beers
to
me
definitely
drinkable
though
drinkability
excellent
however
it
is
a
fruit
beer
so
its
best
for
special
occasions
and
meals
so
as
not
to
wear
out
its
charm
drinkability
not
too
shabby
for
my
first
peach
beer
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
session
beer
for
me
but
worth
trying
fine
as
an
aperitif
sweet
enough
but
not
full
bodied
or
strong
enough
to
be
a
digestif
i
suppose
this
is
a
fine
introduction
into
the
world
of
lambics
but
its
so
almost
entirely
a
different
character
that
it
really
does
nothing
except
introduce
the
idea
that
some
beers
have
sweetness
and
sourness
to
them
nothing
to
dislike
here
ill
have
it
again
im
sure
but
its
nothing
i
get
cravings
for
d
a
tasty
change
of
pace
in
the
beer
world
and
a
bit
less
shocking
that
some
other
lambics
ive
tasted
worth
trying
out
and
perhaps
cooking
with
i
have
little
experience
with
lambics
and
the
style
guidelines
that
said
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
lambic
poured
like
a
champegne
with
a
wonderful
peach
colored
cloudy
appearance
good
aroma
of
peaches
with
slight
sour
smell
tasted
wonderful
nice
peach
flavor
but
not
overpowering
maybe
too
sweet
for
some
tastes
but
i
thought
the
sweetness
was
nicely
balanced
with
the
sourness
which
makes
this
style
unique
very
drinkable
could
have
easily
went
through
more
bottles
a
bit
pricey
but
thats
to
be
expected
with
this
unique
style
i
guess
wonderful
beer
for
special
occasions
another
great
offering
from
this
great
brewery
this
is
a
great
lambic
there
is
no
mistaking
it
is
a
peach
lambic
the
peach
is
moderate
to
strong
in
flavor
somewhat
sweet
a
bit
tart
but
it
balances
well
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
happens
to
have
a
sweet
taste
and
is
a
fruit
based
beer
again
not
all
fruit
beers
are
bad
were
not
talking
about
smirnoff
or
bacardi
crap
here
this
isnt
something
sweet
just
to
chug
and
get
wasted
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
fo
rthe
enjoyment
of
drinking
it
not
just
the
buzz
bottom
line
i
really
enjoy
the
fruit
lambics
from
lindemans
i
recommend
them
d
remarkably
drinkable
for
a
lambic
best
ive
had
in
the
lindemans
line
and
probably
my
favorite
lambic
to
this
point
outside
of
liefmans
ridiculously
smooth
that
matches
the
low
abv
pleasure
to
drink
overall
this
was
very
good
and
she
enjoyed
it
alot
which
was
even
more
important
i
now
have
a
jumping
off
point
for
her
to
get
her
into
some
of
the
bigger
beers
this
was
a
damn
fine
lambic
and
i
will
keep
a
few
around
in
case
she
wants
some
more
overall
this
one
is
a
perfect
dessert
beer
or
one
for
those
special
occasions
it
would
be
nice
to
buy
several
750
ml
bottles
and
pop
them
on
a
special
occasion
or
when
guests
are
over
its
a
nice
single
glass
beer
perfect
sweetie
tartness
i
would
buy
it
again
d
i
could
have
one
of
these
25ozers
on
a
good
night
thats
it
though
too
sweet
for
anymore
great
lambic
though
d
this
is
more
drinkable
than
lindemans
other
offerings
and
it
is
more
beerlike
than
the
kriek
pomme
or
framboise
an
extremely
refreshing
but
cloyingly
sweet
brew
i
like
lambics
for
their
tartness
and
complexity
and
this
lacks
both
of
those
important
compnents
easy
for
somebody
who
doesnt
like
beer
to
try
but
not
necessarily
representative
of
the
style
there
is
too
much
sweetness
and
not
enough
tartness
or
even
maltiness
here
for
a
lambic
ive
heard
they
add
peach
syrup
instead
of
actual
peaches
which
might
explain
this
nonetheless
pleasant
enough
to
drink
while
i
may
not
be
the
biggest
fan
of
peaches
this
is
one
of
the
few
types
of
lambics
i
have
not
tried
so
i
decided
ide
try
a
bottle
poured
a
bright
golden
color
nothing
that
stuck
out
for
me
too
much
to
be
honest
smell
was
pleasent
with
soft
peach
flavor
juicy
nectar
and
sweet
sugar
taste
was
incredibly
similar
to
apple
juice
not
too
sweet
not
too
sour
starts
off
very
juicy
then
ends
off
on
a
dry
note
i
would
say
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
that
it
was
sort
of
syrupy
not
bad
on
the
drinkability
scale
but
one
bottle
of
this
was
enough
for
me
i
think
next
time
i
will
stick
with
the
kriek
or
the
framboise
but
still
very
interesting
cheers
was
expecting
a
higher
abv
brew
out
of
lambics
but
i
guess
i
had
the
wrong
interpretation
of
the
style
poured
a
hazy
hefe
looking
color
with
all
cream
head
and
laced
the
sniffer
very
nicely
but
for
me
it
all
went
downhill
after
that
the
smell
was
very
nice
and
peach
but
the
taste
was
tart
and
hard
to
drink
i
got
a
sick
quesy
feeling
after
finishing
off
a
bomber
not
a
good
feeling
either
my
stomach
was
churning
like
hell
as
was
my
gag
reflex
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
heavy
however
im
assuming
because
of
the
fruit
additives
but
because
of
its
tartness
and
wear
on
my
stomach
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisting
the
fruit
lambics
for
awhile
i
considered
this
more
peach
champange
than
beer
and
i
didnt
even
feel
a
buzz
for
what
its
worth
the
mouth
seems
about
right
for
this
type
of
beer
its
a
bit
soft
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
a
tough
call
i
would
revisit
this
again
but
not
on
a
regular
basis
d
this
lambic
goes
down
very
easily
like
drinking
juice
this
is
my
first
lambic
and
i
found
it
quite
interesting
its
not
something
ill
have
all
the
time
but
it
definitely
has
its
time
and
place
for
the
appropriate
use
plus
my
wife
liked
it
and
shes
not
the
biggest
beer
fan
in
the
world
quite
a
nice
and
different
beer
im
sure
this
would
appeal
to
those
who
dont
really
like
beer
but
i
also
find
it
appealing
from
a
beerenjoyers
perspective
theres
much
more
than
just
the
peach
flavor
could
work
well
with
a
light
meal
or
just
on
its
own
on
a
warm
evening
drinkability
is
high
for
the
style
but
i
still
would
not
want
more
than
one
of
these
the
sweetness
can
become
somewhat
overwhelming
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
it
though
this
is
a
nice
choice
the
aroma
is
intensely
yeasty
and
has
a
light
peach
in
the
background
sweetness
is
still
very
upfront
in
this
beer
but
scaled
back
by
that
crazy
yeastiness
kind
of
reminds
me
of
mead
things
finally
balance
out
in
the
finish
and
this
is
where
peach
flavor
finally
emerges
mouthfeel
is
light
with
little
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
the
best
of
the
lindemanns
flavored
lambics
good
if
you
like
peach
my
wife
really
enjoyed
it
not
really
my
type
of
beer
more
like
a
peach
soda
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
lovely
peach
color
big
surprise
with
good
head
but
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
lovely
fruity
bowl
of
yumminess
the
taste
is
peach
in
all
its
glory
sweet
and
tart
i
have
a
need
for
some
kind
of
fruit
beer
every
so
often
and
this
one
fills
that
gap
greatly
another
yummy
beer
from
those
crazy
belgians
most
definitely
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
and
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
period
that
ive
ever
drank
i
highly
recommend
this
as
a
truly
spectular
special
occasion
beer
it
felt
lovely
on
the
palate
smooth
and
drinkable
very
nice
to
find
it
on
tap
cost
at
my
local
north
coast
coop
here
in
eureka
ca
was
9
45
poured
a
hazy
gold
and
left
a
small
head
that
was
gone
in
a
jiffy
big
nose
of
peaches
and
some
spices
i
cannot
identify
smooth
palate
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overpowering
very
unique
and
nice
to
drink
amazing
how
many
good
fruit
lambics
lindemans
can
produce
this
brew
has
a
bery
golden
and
champagne
like
body
which
is
slightly
hazy
it
is
heavily
carbinated
and
creates
a
sticky
white
head
that
hugs
the
rim
all
the
way
to
the
end
it
does
have
a
very
peachy
aroma
but
i
can
detect
doughy
hints
of
malt
with
this
it
reminds
me
of
peach
cobbler
this
is
a
light
yelloworange
cloudy
beer
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
initially
the
carbonation
goes
away
fairly
quickly
it
smells
of
apple
and
peach
initially
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
even
compared
to
the
other
lindemans
beers
it
has
strong
peach
flavors
but
just
as
many
apple
flavors
as
well
it
is
a
very
carbonated
beer
and
very
tingley
on
my
tongue
im
not
crazy
about
peaches
in
general
but
the
drinkability
is
still
fairly
low
i
would
rather
drink
the
framboise
or
cassis
instead
have
to
try
all
of
the
lindemans
beers
that
are
availablet
to
me
the
color
is
a
clear
yet
light
and
pale
orange
very
light
bubbling
and
no
head
left
after
a
minute
or
two
the
aroma
is
very
butterscotchy
with
a
very
faint
hint
of
peaches
a
little
off
putting
different
but
not
expected
the
taste
is
definetly
moire
peachy
and
earthy
with
a
very
strong
butterscotch
and
light
cream
backbone
very
odd
taste
for
a
fruit
lambic
in
my
opinion
not
bad
though
light
dry
palate
with
strong
sweetness
nice
to
sip
after
dinner
would
not
have
more
than
one
in
an
evening
but
the
framoise
on
the
other
hand
honestly
i
dont
think
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
because
of
the
sweetness
if
you
really
like
fruit
beers
or
sweet
drinks
in
general
this
may
be
good
for
you
i
think
if
it
wasnt
sweetened
and
the
tartness
was
able
to
shine
through
this
would
be
a
much
better
beverage
the
style
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
im
really
glad
that
i
tried
it
i
will
definitely
be
sampling
the
companies
other
products
hazy
light
caramel
orange
colour
with
a
short
cap
of
white
foam
composed
of
bubbles
of
mixed
sizes
the
head
quickly
fell
to
a
coarse
ring
leaving
a
smattering
of
lace
subsequent
sips
produced
a
lot
more
fine
lace
a
little
funky
barnyard
aroma
with
some
earthiness
ripe
peach
and
very
mild
pie
spice
pretty
nice
very
sweet
and
syrupy
kind
of
cloying
with
lots
of
peach
flavour
and
mild
tartness
that
pretty
much
sums
it
up
medium
carbonation
with
a
heftier
body
than
expected
palate
coating
initially
but
slightly
drier
by
the
finish
fairly
creamy
texture
not
a
bad
entry
in
the
lindemans
line
i
really
enjoyed
the
aroma
but
was
let
down
a
bit
by
the
heavy
sweetness
which
limits
the
drinkability
capped
and
corked
750
ml
bottle
decanted
into
my
chalice
it
pours
clear
orange
peach
in
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
of
peaches
and
little
else
taste
is
of
peaches
as
well
more
sweet
than
tart
as
a
good
peach
should
behave
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
syrupy
with
crisp
carbonation
its
was
a
nice
dessert
beer
to
accent
my
new
years
day
meal
cheers
peachy
through
and
through
from
the
appearance
to
the
nose
to
the
flavor
this
was
the
thickest
and
least
carbonated
of
the
lindemans
beers
ive
had
yet
it
made
the
beer
seem
a
bit
syrupy
so
drink
this
one
very
cold
cold
is
also
useful
to
combat
the
sweetness
which
is
boarderline
too
much
ive
always
liked
the
base
lambic
and
the
peaches
accent
it
very
nicely
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
pairs
good
with
a
wide
variety
of
food
not
one
of
my
favorite
lambics
but
very
good
nonetheless
recommended
lindemans
is
a
great
family
of
beers
to
introduce
to
people
with
a
macroscopic
view
of
the
beer
world
cheers
what
a
surprise
i
loved
it
so
did
my
wife
and
daughter
with
only
4
abv
you
could
drink
this
all
night
long
and
i
just
might
some
time
overall
a
very
good
lambric
and
it
comes
in
an
odd
bottle
cork
and
cap
how
queer
a
must
try
cheers
i
found
this
beer
and
its
champagne
bubbles
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
drinkability
like
drinking
peach
concentrate
so
very
drinkable
just
like
all
the
other
lindemans
lambics
just
a
solid
lambic
from
belgium
overall
a
nice
beer
to
change
things
up
lately
i
havent
wanted
much
carbonation
and
this
did
a
great
job
quenching
my
thirst
not
bad
but
not
much
like
beer
very
sour
but
kinda
tasty
i
was
dissapointed
that
the
concotion
did
not
taste
like
peaches
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
only
mildly
carbonated
taste
is
quite
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
a
bit
fizzy
and
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
i
would
think
tastes
like
peach
soda
if
you
dont
like
peaches
you
may
not
like
this
it
isnt
sour
however
nice
tartness
and
sweetness
altogether
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
like
a
nice
sparkling
wine
but
of
course
much
sweeter
than
what
you
would
get
in
that
area
its
easy
to
go
through
a
750ml
bottle
of
thise
stuff
without
even
realizing
that
youve
started
thankfully
its
alcohol
content
is
not
outrageous
the
only
probem
i
can
see
is
that
the
sweetness
sets
some
people
up
with
the
idea
that
all
lambics
are
sweet
since
the
lindemans
sweetened
lambics
are
far
more
prevalent
than
pretty
much
every
other
style
of
lambic
available
in
the
u
s
this
happens
far
too
often
and
people
dont
want
to
try
a
more
traditional
drysour
styles
the
only
reason
i
would
not
be
able
to
drink
more
of
lindemans
peche
is
because
it
is
a
fruity
style
personally
i
enjoy
one
or
two
fruitish
beers
and
thats
my
fill
the
same
with
this
one
i
did
really
enjoy
the
one
i
had
it
was
very
smooth
and
thicker
than
i
expected
but
most
certainly
not
too
thick
in
a
goblet
this
beer
forms
a
white
surface
lace
the
body
is
a
tawny
transparent
yellow
gold
when
i
try
to
describe
it
my
girlfriend
simply
says
peach
the
nose
is
100
sweet
peach
which
smells
great
the
taste
is
sugary
intense
peach
simple
but
good
the
mouthfeel
is
viscous
with
low
carbonation
could
use
more
this
is
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
although
the
acid
builds
up
if
you
have
too
much
by
yourself
share
a
12
oz
bottle
with
at
least
one
person
its
a
nice
peach
lambic
i
highly
reccommend
it
overall
another
solid
offering
from
lindemans
a
great
afternoon
beer
for
the
spring
or
summer
time
holds
up
well
and
exhibits
nice
refreshing
peach
flavors
without
being
over
the
top
overall
of
the
lindemans
line
up
the
pêche
certainly
is
one
of
the
easier
ones
to
get
along
with
it
could
be
better
but
honestly
i
found
the
sweetness
to
be
the
only
true
distraction
here
nice
to
revisit
this
one
chilled
on
a
hot
day
but
not
one
that
i
would
regularly
pick
up
from
the
shelves
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
like
lindemans
rasberry
alot
better
maybe
the
better
of
the
lindemans
fruit
beers
still
very
sweet
with
a
mild
but
very
sweet
peach
apple
flavor
tart
to
offset
sweetness
certainly
an
afterdinner
drink
sweet
to
an
almost
cloying
sense
lightly
syrupy
and
velvety
texture
with
a
sugarsweet
finish
and
lingering
not
overly
strong
as
with
the
framboise
quite
similar
to
the
pomme
but
with
a
richer
fruit
flavor
and
texture
solidly
ciderey
but
with
a
serious
beer
undertone
enjoyable
but
only
on
occations
no
kegstands
for
me
this
was
one
incredibly
yummy
lambic
and
one
that
you
should
definitely
try
this
lambic
is
just
way
too
drinkable
perfect
any
time
and
any
day
of
the
week
i
might
be
a
tad
subjective
because
i
really
like
peaches
but
this
is
one
great
beverage
plenty
of
head
great
peach
coloured
body
full
of
character
another
lindemans
product
im
tempted
to
mark
as
the
highest
rated
fruit
beer
ive
had
good
aroma
well
present
a
gritty
rippened
fruit
flavour
flavour
well
developed
candy
like
taste
only
authentic
well
suited
for
anyones
taste
in
my
opinion
this
was
my
first
lambic
and
i
dont
think
i
was
prepared
lol
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
although
the
peach
flavor
is
nowhere
as
dominate
as
their
framboise
fairly
tart
and
sweet
yet
crisp
with
hints
of
malt
and
little
hops
noticable
very
drinkable
and
surprisingly
well
balanced
had
as
an
occassional
treat
since
reviewing
and
consistently
good
brew
the
peaches
dont
interfere
with
the
beer
qualities
as
much
as
some
sweeter
lambic
fruits
do
wonderful
light
peach
flavors
not
overly
carbonated
with
the
same
zingy
wheat
flavors
as
in
the
nose
somewhat
of
a
lackluster
finish
and
the
rs
keeps
it
from
being
in
the
high
ranks
of
drinkability
but
a
good
lambic
if
youre
into
the
sweet
style
like
this
beats
the
more
common
framboise
by
a
long
shot
sweetish
but
very
good
on
tap
at
the
old
toad
emma
really
loved
this
one
and
says
she
could
drink
5
right
now
so
i
digress
an
ok
fruit
lambic
but
maybe
not
one
of
the
most
complex
ones
not
an
everyday
beer
but
on
a
special
occassion
id
love
to
pop
a
cork
on
this
for
dessert
yeah
medium
bodied
sticky
and
lip
smacking
good
not
more
than
one
750
per
sitting
but
it
is
very
refreshing
and
quaffable
due
to
the
low
abv
say
what
you
will
about
lindemans
they
are
great
for
what
they
are
served
on
tap
into
a
lindemans
flute
this
is
a
light
copper
color
active
carbonation
evident
a
finger
of
white
head
without
much
retention
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
all
peaches
fairly
strong
not
overly
sweet
very
nice
taste
is
a
nice
smooth
peach
sweet
but
never
cloying
finishing
just
slightly
tart
very
nice
lingering
peach
aftertaste
this
is
a
one
note
beer
as
most
of
these
fruity
lindeman
beers
are
but
it
really
hits
that
note
wonderfully
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
not
as
fizzy
and
bubbly
as
when
served
from
a
bottle
this
makes
it
better
imo
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
lindeman
beers
that
ive
had
very
drinkable
but
maybe
only
one
at
a
time
for
me
more
than
one
beer
this
sweet
in
a
sitting
might
be
a
bit
much
good
and
drinkable
i
only
buy
singles
of
this
one
at
a
time
but
very
drinkable
none
the
less
my
favorite
of
the
lindemans
offerings
looks
like
a
regular
beer
with
its
dull
golden
color
with
medium
fizzy
head
smells
like
peaches
with
some
hay
in
there
and
some
nice
lambic
notes
a
bit
of
a
tartness
as
well
peaches
are
dominant
and
they
control
the
flavors
it
almost
tastes
like
fresh
picked
whole
peaches
in
here
theres
a
tart
granny
smith
quality
underneath
which
cuts
the
sweetness
of
the
peach
then
theres
a
nice
little
acidic
finish
but
the
notes
of
peaches
remains
the
whole
time
body
seems
fuller
than
any
other
lindemans
offerings
and
the
carbonation
is
not
overdone
very
enjoyable
this
lambic
poured
an
orange
gold
color
and
the
white
head
formed
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
my
glass
that
left
little
spots
of
laces
smelled
of
a
wonderful
musky
and
dirty
yeast
with
a
little
cranberry
and
syrupy
peaches
and
a
slight
bit
of
mushroom
tasted
of
huge
buttery
peaches
and
sweet
cream
with
a
slight
sour
snap
to
it
the
wild
yeast
was
present
and
blended
delightfully
into
the
fruit
flavors
livening
up
their
sourness
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
sticky
with
a
light
carbonation
i
could
easily
drink
this
beauty
in
the
spring
and
summer
with
an
assortment
of
light
dishes
it
is
almost
like
a
peach
soda
that
has
a
fine
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
nice
stuff
d
very
very
drinkable
it
is
like
a
peach
soda
without
such
a
cloying
sugar
presence
sugar
is
present
though
definitely
a
dessert
beer
a
light
dessert
of
course
like
fruit
sorbet
not
a
tiramisu
this
is
delicious
if
you
like
peaches
i
recommend
this
if
you
dislike
peaches
then
you
would
be
an
idiot
to
look
for
it
d
a
little
sweet
for
drinking
more
than
a
glass
or
two
of
didnt
finish
the
bottle
but
this
is
really
good
i
like
the
lindemans
framboise
a
little
bit
better
than
this
and
could
probably
drink
more
of
that
than
this
in
a
sitting
good
drinkability
for
such
a
sweet
beer
overall
i
was
very
impressed
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
bit
girly
but
held
my
attention
for
the
whole
bottle
it
is
very
good
and
worth
a
try
d
could
drink
this
like
soda
its
very
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
its
flavor
is
something
you
just
cant
get
enough
of
gives
me
peach
burps
which
are
also
pleasant
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
has
a
12
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
that
clumps
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
tart
apples
and
peaches
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
dry
and
champagnelike
i
couldnt
drink
this
beer
every
day
but
its
nice
to
pull
out
for
special
occasions
this
is
the
most
drinkable
lambic
from
lindemans
by
far
imo
perfect
beer
to
start
a
session
or
for
an
after
dinner
brew
just
to
ease
you
back
into
the
swing
of
things
very
easy
to
drink
keeps
my
interest
throughout
chicks
may
dig
this
brew
as
it
has
some
wine
cooler
qualities
although
much
more
bitter
lindemans
peche
is
pretty
good
beer
if
one
enters
into
the
experience
with
the
right
attitude
i
doubt
that
ill
ever
buy
another
but
this
bottle
has
brought
me
back
a
step
or
two
from
my
peachophobia
an
excelent
peach
lambic
the
beer
poured
a
nice
peachy
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
was
very
friuty
and
sweet
full
of
peaches
and
a
bit
of
an
apricot
scent
when
i
sipped
the
beer
the
flavor
of
peaches
exploded
in
my
mouth
followed
by
a
nice
dry
sourness
that
counteracted
the
sweetness
perfectly
definantly
a
great
desert
beer
and
one
that
may
cross
over
some
non
beer
drinkers
the
flavor
is
very
definitely
peach
it
starts
sweet
but
not
quite
like
peach
soda
more
like
a
peach
cobbler
as
it
is
quickly
followed
by
a
very
pleasant
tartness
and
a
yeastybiscuity
overtone
finishing
slightly
sour
for
a
nice
clean
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
definitely
a
desert
ale
either
stand
alone
or
with
an
appropriate
fruit
dish
poured
from
a
green
bottle
corked
and
capped
pours
a
hazy
gold
colour
with
a
fizzy
white
head
wonderful
peachy
aroma
some
tartness
but
mostly
sweet
syrupy
peaches
body
was
crisp
and
clean
taste
bursting
with
peach
flavours
and
some
apple
very
juicy
and
sweet
could
use
a
tad
bit
more
tartness
to
balance
it
out
overall
a
delicious
beer
however
it
still
takes
a
back
seat
to
their
framboise
i
think
i
will
share
the
rest
of
this
bottle
with
my
wife
who
prefers
wine
i
would
call
this
the
ultimate
cross
over
drink
from
wine
to
beer
very
tasty
and
i
think
i
will
have
to
keep
some
of
this
on
hand
for
those
rare
times
i
dont
feel
like
drinking
a
normal
beer
about
9
or
10
for
a
750ml
bottle
mouthfeeldrinkability
thick
meaty
mouthcoating
consistency
surprised
at
the
viscosity
of
this
beer
considering
the
appearance
finishes
sour
enough
to
suffice
as
a
great
aperitif
and
fruity
enough
to
accompany
dessert
after
a
meal
well
done
my
first
lambic
and
i
must
admit
i
am
impressed
even
my
beerhater
wife
liked
it
poured
out
to
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
head
and
good
lace
around
the
glass
odors
of
sweet
peaches
and
sour
sugar
were
present
as
was
a
slighly
bile
like
odor
that
reminded
me
of
vomit
seriously
alas
this
wasnt
enought
to
deter
me
from
drinking
it
taste
was
very
sweet
but
not
syrupy
or
overly
powering
very
peachy
with
a
sugar
like
after
taste
yet
i
must
say
again
not
overpowering
this
is
not
a
bad
drink
finished
sweet
with
some
malt
like
flavors
this
is
more
like
a
really
kick
ass
wine
than
a
beer
but
still
very
drinkable
recommended
for
people
just
getting
into
lambics
opinion
golly
gee
this
beer
still
tastes
like
koolaid
i
mean
dont
get
me
wrongit
is
a
wonderfully
flavored
beer
the
peach
is
just
such
a
sweet
and
dominant
force
in
the
entire
flavor
profile
that
it
completely
obscures
the
fact
that
you
are
drinking
the
product
of
spontaneous
fermentation
at
all
i
would
prefer
it
retain
some
of
the
wild
characteristics
i
have
one
more
bottle
of
peche
well
see
what
a
couple
more
years
doe
for
it
pours
hazy
gold
dense
head
aroma
peach
is
also
a
strong
flavor
element
that
covers
malthops
although
the
peach
is
very
dominate
it
was
not
objectional
i
like
peaches
medium
body
and
dextrinous
mouthfeel
strong
carbonation
make
this
sweet
and
fruity
lambic
great
with
a
dessert
pours
a
very
livelywell
carbonated
hazy
golden
color
nice
aromasome
peach
in
there
slight
yeast
in
the
backround
mellow
sweetness
throughout
good
full
peach
flavor
somewhat
tart
but
well
balanced
with
a
nice
fruitiness
i
dont
find
this
lambic
screams
fruit
like
the
kriek
did
very
well
rounded
and
the
fruit
has
a
nice
softness
to
it
good
bodylike
the
kriek
its
hard
to
believe
its
so
low
in
abv
a
very
drinkable
beer
indeed
quite
enjoyable
all
around
wow
this
is
a
crushing
taste
of
peach
the
almost
peachy
color
of
this
beer
that
has
almost
no
head
but
plenty
of
carbonation
sets
up
what
the
rest
of
the
beer
will
be
it
has
an
intense
peach
nose
and
the
beer
is
sweet
smelling
too
the
taste
is
tongue
pulverizing
a
sweet
lambic
with
a
touch
of
souring
characteristics
and
nothing
but
peach
for
miles
around
it
has
a
pleasent
aftertaste
that
lingers
of
peach
and
a
resonating
sweetness
as
i
work
my
way
through
this
one
the
taste
deadens
the
senses
and
eventually
it
becomes
more
and
more
palatable
for
sure
this
is
not
a
session
beir
but
it
is
enojyable
as
a
twelve
ounce
desert
1cm
of
fizzy
white
head
is
dirty
around
the
edges
the
clear
gold
beer
has
some
orange
to
it
nose
is
extreme
peach
tart
not
too
sweet
good
the
front
is
full
of
sweet
perfumey
peach
flowers
the
middle
is
a
thick
peach
syrup
the
finish
is
sugary
sweet
theres
a
little
tart
funkiness
but
not
enough
for
me
not
bad
its
still
too
sweet
for
me
but
definitely
better
than
the
framboise
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
super
refreshing
maybe
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
would
make
it
go
over
the
top
a
nice
decent
peach
lambic
felt
like
my
teeth
were
going
to
rot
but
all
i
have
got
to
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
makes
champagne
taste
like
a
cheap
american
macro
mixed
with
taaka
vodka
this
beer
is
the
most
subtle
of
the
lindemans
lambics
with
a
very
sublime
peach
flavor
that
very
thirst
quenching
i
couldnt
stop
sipping
mine
once
i
tried
it
at
first
it
is
like
a
koolaid
for
beer
lovers
a
must
try
brew
wont
drink
this
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
beer
but
would
be
great
with
a
nice
meal
instead
of
wine
very
good
for
drinking
in
mixed
company
that
might
find
most
other
decent
beers
to
be
too
challenging
drinkability
and
overall
good
stuff
for
sure
i
have
loved
each
and
every
lambic
i
had
before
this
and
i
love
this
one
i
guess
if
you
dont
like
the
style
you
wouldnt
like
this
as
it
provides
nothing
unique
its
still
a
great
beer
that
can
and
will
keep
me
sipping
all
night
long
a
very
good
beer
well
worthy
of
a
strong
passing
mark
pours
a
hazy
medium
gold
with
a
high
carbonation
a
2
finger
head
that
had
mediocre
longevity
but
good
lace
smell
of
sweet
peach
sort
of
like
a
wine
cooler
but
with
some
malt
aromas
mixed
in
tart
apples
smells
also
noted
not
much
if
any
hop
aroma
detected
taste
is
not
bad
the
flavor
of
sweet
peach
is
the
first
noticable
flavor
followed
by
a
subdued
wheat
malt
sour
apple
flavors
also
detected
very
spritzy
my
wife
enjoyed
it
and
refered
to
it
as
a
girly
beer
it
is
what
it
is
a
peach
lambic
a
very
nice
and
tasty
lambic
but
not
one
i
could
drink
several
bottles
of
in
one
sitting
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
not
a
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
oelergud
pours
well
the
colour
of
peach
juice
light
orangy
with
a
hint
of
red
no
real
head
to
speak
of
but
it
bubbles
up
like
a
nice
sparkling
wine
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
a
sour
note
taste
is
tart
and
of
sweet
peaches
almost
in
a
canned
peach
sort
of
way
there
is
just
a
note
of
lambic
sourness
that
creeps
in
and
helps
this
from
being
cloying
mouthfeel
is
good
nicely
carbonated
which
helps
it
from
being
too
too
sweet
drinkability
is
a
little
above
average
a
bit
too
sweet
this
would
be
a
one
and
done
apertif
or
dessert
beer
sweeter
and
less
tart
than
the
raspberry
which
lessens
the
drinkability
drinkability
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
go
to
beers
on
special
occasions
i
bit
sweet
to
slam
a
few
bottles
but
its
about
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
everyone
i
know
personally
loves
this
lambic
i
feel
like
i
have
been
putting
a
lot
o
diclaimers
in
front
of
reviews
lately
but
here
it
goes
i
dont
like
peaches
and
this
is
only
my
5th
lambic
so
deal
creamy
baje
beer
with
a
hearty
white
head
looks
lighter
towards
the
bottom
smells
of
grass
and
peaches
from
a
can
my
best
taste
analogy
is
a
peach
creamsaveri
dont
know
if
they
really
have
one
but
work
with
me
with
an
acidic
center
i
dont
know
why
i
bought
a
peach
beer
but
id
already
tryed
the
rasberry
one
and
was
trying
boons
kriek
also
wood
and
grassy
ntoes
in
there
as
well
my
stomach
feels
like
is
is
rotting
from
the
inside
out
so
low
drinkability
mothfeel
if
very
full
and
thick
and
syrupy
it
hink
this
is
part
of
the
reason
it
reminds
me
of
a
creamsaver
smaller
bottle
classy
with
foil
cork
and
a
cap
pours
slightly
hazy
orangy
amber
tiny
bubble
film
remains
after
a
minute
or
two
of
the
pour
long
stringy
relaxed
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
fruity
sweet
and
delicate
lucious
melons
peaches
fruits
of
a
thousand
nations
flow
in
the
glass
not
nearly
as
sour
as
some
other
lambics
ive
tried
this
one
is
sweet
and
tasty
great
with
desert
berries
ice
cream
etc
etc
its
a
light
orange
mustard
color
with
a
little
haze
a
slightly
yellowwhite
head
smells
like
peaches
but
also
smells
a
little
sour
taste
is
sweet
bursting
with
peaches
and
the
tartness
sets
in
about
halfway
though
your
sip
the
tartness
lingers
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
sour
but
this
is
the
first
fruit
lambic
that
i
have
ever
had
i
would
say
its
pretty
good
if
your
looking
for
something
fruity
i
could
see
this
for
dessert
or
drinking
with
dessert
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
varieties
for
too
sweet
a
fruit
beer
for
me
needs
more
underlying
sourness
drinkability
and
overall
my
wife
liked
this
one
so
it
must
not
be
too
close
to
beer
i
enjoyed
the
departure
from
the
ordinary
i
would
probably
save
this
for
special
occasions
and
times
when
i
wouldnt
mind
sharing
with
nonbas
has
a
silghtly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
distinictly
sour
with
a
peach
essence
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
sour
at
first
with
the
peach
sweetness
settling
in
at
the
finish
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
incredible
beer
drinking
experience
it
was
like
drinking
nectar
very
smooth
velvety
beer
tasting
of
sweet
fresh
peaches
i
just
kept
shaking
my
head
at
how
really
good
this
beer
was
perfect
for
a
desert
drink
and
appealing
to
just
about
anyone
shares
more
qualities
with
a
wine
or
mixed
drink
than
a
beer
i
would
imagine
this
would
be
phenominal
in
recipes
lightmedium
in
body
and
high
carbonation
levels
create
a
crisp
mouthfeel
the
fruit
flavors
ride
on
the
tongue
briefly
after
swallowing
nicely
drinkable
but
one
can
not
have
a
few
of
these
without
having
a
fruity
sweetness
overload
rereviewed
on
82904
and
im
delighted
that
i
gave
this
one
another
try
this
time
the
essence
of
tree
ripe
peaches
was
all
over
the
nose
and
palate
each
sip
was
like
munching
into
a
sweet
south
carolina
peach
with
fuzzy
skin
and
all
quite
tasty
overall
a
delicious
lambic
that
id
be
happy
to
pick
up
again
pours
a
hazed
golden
orange
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
peaches
and
sweet
apples
dominate
the
nose
some
gariny
notes
but
nothing
that
sets
of
any
bells
that
this
is
really
a
lambic
extremely
sweet
flavors
of
peach
with
a
slight
bit
of
green
apple
tartness
in
the
finish
too
sweet
for
my
liking
im
sure
sugar
is
added
i
suppose
it
good
if
you
like
peaches
and
have
a
serious
sweettooth
hazy
apricot
coloured
body
wearing
little
to
no
head
terribly
sweet
peach
aroma
with
distinct
sugar
character
restrained
brett
and
mild
barnyard
character
tries
to
come
out
as
it
warms
but
remains
annihilated
by
the
fruit
not
much
acidity
at
all
very
unidimensional
soft
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
very
disappointing
and
expensive
6
99375ml
bottle
poured
an
orange
colored
beer
with
a
nice
huge
head
aroma
is
simply
comprised
of
a
nice
peach
nectar
taste
is
also
mostly
comprised
of
peach
with
a
subtle
tart
finish
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
that
i
had
the
chance
to
taste
sometime
it
seems
more
like
a
coolerjuice
then
a
beer
nothing
is
very
complex
with
this
beer
and
the
alcohol
level
is
quite
low
strongly
acidic
followed
rapidly
by
a
rich
sweetness
that
is
due
to
an
abundandt
peach
quality
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
dried
apricot
flavors
this
wont
be
to
everyones
taste
it
is
after
all
a
fruit
flavored
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
this
is
a
must
drinkability
bring
it
on
because
of
its
low
abv
and
weak
similarity
to
the
beers
i
prefer
i
dont
have
this
often
if
ever
due
to
the
price
but
it
is
super
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
especially
if
youre
in
a
wussy
mood
just
dont
sniff
before
you
sip
dn
i
had
to
actually
ask
the
barkeep
if
this
was
a
beer
or
not
its
quite
different
than
anything
ive
had
so
far
he
assured
me
that
it
was
so
there
you
are
not
something
i
would
have
expected
there
arent
the
classic
beer
things
here
maltiness
hoppiness
this
is
just
plain
different
in
a
completely
wonderful
way
this
is
incredible
the
only
reason
i
withheld
a
perfect
five
was
the
price
ten
bucks
a
bottle
is
quite
steep
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
quite
different
from
in
the
mouth
versus
the
framboise
well
worth
drinking
or
sharing
with
friends
looking
for
something
different
a
dessert
type
drink
poured
an
orange
colour
with
quite
a
bit
of
cloudiness
to
it
no
head
and
almost
no
carbonation
moderate
consistent
lacing
winelike
fruitiness
with
moderate
peachy
smell
the
taste
was
of
course
very
powerful
of
peaches
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
this
quite
easy
to
drink
i
still
like
the
framboise
better
as
of
my
writing
this
it
is
the
only
other
lambic
i
have
tasted
the
peche
is
still
quite
tasty
however
and
i
would
certainly
buy
it
again
poured
out
an
orange
color
with
not
that
much
carbonation
to
it
smell
consisted
of
well
peaches
the
smell
was
somewhat
sharp
taste
was
very
tart
peaches
rule
the
palate
the
entire
way
with
the
tart
mixing
in
every
once
in
a
while
not
bad
some
of
the
other
lambics
from
lindemans
were
better
than
this
one
though
lambics
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
no
exception
this
one
is
a
hazy
gold
with
an
extremely
thin
head
that
actually
keeps
inviting
champagnelike
aroma
with
hints
of
peach
and
yeast
no
traditional
barnyard
lambic
aromas
here
really
flavor
is
better
than
i
expected
its
just
so
damn
crisp
and
tasty
sweet
peach
flavor
is
subtle
it
seems
there
are
other
fruity
flavors
going
on
here
as
well
very
lightly
malty
and
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
simply
delicious
a
very
nice
lambic
nice
to
know
i
can
still
appreciate
the
stuff
though
it
will
remain
a
special
occasion
only
kind
of
selection
notes
awsome
but
only
by
heritage
i
love
the
drink
hate
the
price
drinkability

this
was
very
good
and
i
enjoyed
sipping
it
away
this
beer
pours
a
transparent
with
slight
haze
honey
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
to
large
head
of
moreate
size
bubbles
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
coming
off
the
head
looks
ragged
not
as
pretty
as
some
ive
seen
because
of
it
the
aroma
is
peach
soda
like
with
a
rich
syrupy
smell
including
a
slightly
organic
wet
earth
mossy
aroma
hidden
below
the
surface
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
very
fruity
sodasweet
with
honey
backflavor
i
had
a
peach
cobbler
dessert
the
night
before
and
there
were
a
lot
of
similarities
in
this
beer
its
not
really
very
beerlike
more
ciderfruit
juice
hansens
than
beer
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
have
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
often
note
my
girlfriend
hates
beer
of
all
types
but
she
actually
likes
this
stuff
and
the
framboise
too
beer
is
good
happy
beering
looks
much
more
like
a
regular
beer
than
lindemans
kriek
peachy
orange
color
with
a
cloudy
body
and
a
thin
short
lived
head
a
bit
too
sweet
and
smooth
for
the
style
no
yeasty
flavors
and
only
mild
sourness
a
bit
dumbed
down
for
mass
consumption
in
my
opinion
ng
this
beer
poured
an
apricot
color
that
was
hazy
in
appearance
still
visible
were
the
carbonation
bubbles
not
much
carbonation
but
just
enough
the
head
that
was
produced
was
white
in
color
not
very
dense
i
would
say
that
the
bubbles
were
hollow
in
appearance
the
foam
did
last
for
some
time
before
it
fell
to
almost
nothing
there
was
lace
present
full
in
places
and
spotty
in
others
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
all
faint
not
too
overpowering
peaches
hops
and
a
sprite
soda
kind
of
aroma
tickled
my
nostrils
and
finished
with
a
light
yeast
hint
kind
of
sour
and
kind
of
dry
just
what
i
would
expect
from
lindemans
and
a
lambic
the
flavors
that
i
tasted
were
peaches
up
front
in
the
middle
and
as
the
end
some
sweet
malts
wheat
grains
mixed
in
through
out
hops
a
light
hint
of
alcohol
became
present
as
it
warmed
and
it
finished
with
that
light
yeasty
wheat
flavor
tart
aftertastes
of
peaches
were
present
the
body
was
on
the
lightmedium
side
over
all
this
beer
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
crisp
clean
tart
in
places
and
over
all
nice
and
peachy
this
is
a
fine
dessert
beer
and
will
keep
a
few
on
hand
the
beer
pours
a
pure
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
decent
it
seems
a
bit
dry
but
the
majority
is
of
sour
peaches
the
taste
is
good
it
is
rich
and
very
tart
it
has
an
intense
sour
peach
flavor
that
is
quite
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
drinks
very
well
i
love
lambic
beers
lindemans
has
the
best
that
ive
tried
the
taste
is
light
fruity
with
a
hint
of
peach
kind
of
champagnywiney
almost
like
a
wine
cooler
really
nice
i
shared
this
with
my
wife
on
sunday
night
after
the
new
england
patriots
won
the
superbowl
patriot
blood
its
in
us
no
matter
where
we
are
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
light
amber
color
and
formed
huge
off
white
bubbly
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
peach
yeast
and
other
lambic
elements
i
have
never
been
good
at
placing
a
flavor
of
peach
and
some
slight
bread
elementsyeast
the
finish
is
sweet
and
a
bit
tart
which
is
pretty
much
what
i
expect
from
this
style
while
not
my
favorite
style
of
belgian
i
have
slowly
been
gaining
an
appreciation
for
them
this
one
is
quite
good
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
special
dessert
beer
it
is
to
sweet
to
drink
in
quantity
it
is
very
nicely
carbonated
and
it
is
a
nice
crisp
drinker
all
the
way
down
peach
flavors
are
more
mild
than
those
of
other
fruits
in
lindemans
other
products
it
is
a
nice
one
but
it
does
not
seem
to
have
any
tart
character
to
it
at
all
it
is
a
bit
boring
but
still
enjoyable
i
will
stick
with
the
framboise
from
these
guys
drinkability
was
ok
i
liked
the
flavor
and
even
though
it
was
not
overly
sweet
the
sweetness
might
get
to
you
after
a
few
of
these
and
the
carbonation
definately
detracts
do
they
really
call
these
beers
tastes
like
a
lite
wine
smells
like
a
peach
cobbler
without
the
cinnamon
with
a
spice
and
yeast
nose
hazy
orange
color
a
lacey
head
sugary
sweet
that
tastes
much
like
a
hard
candy
peach
taste
dominates
here
yeast
aftertaste
is
strong
causing
a
dry
chalklike
finish
good
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
but
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
i
had
a
wine
and
beer
party
where
i
offered
tiny
tastes
of
different
wines
and
beers
there
were
a
bunch
of
girls
there
who
just
dont
drink
havent
developed
any
taste
for
tannins
or
hops
just
a
drop
of
this
peach
lambic
and
they
all
loved
it
so
in
summary
nice
sweet
fruity
drink
that
may
be
especially
appreciated
by
the
uninitiated
i
have
no
doubt
that
less
mainstream
lambics
must
have
more
complexity
though
i
have
not
tried
any
this
was
a
really
sweet
beer
not
as
sweet
as
lindemans
framboise
the
color
was
a
hazy
watered
down
orangish
color
the
smell
was
that
of
fresh
peaches
it
was
very
clean
smelling
the
taste
was
also
very
clean
with
a
mild
peach
taste
and
a
slight
sourness
and
acidic
taste
a
most
enjoyable
drink
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sweet
drinks
but
this
one
isnt
too
sweet
and
that
makes
it
an
agreeable
dessert
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
beer
but
does
well
enough
by
itself
a
delicious
fruit
beer
that
brought
back
memories
of
growing
up
on
an
orchard
where
i
could
walk
out
and
smell
the
peaches
when
they
were
in
season
nice
beer
to
find
on
tap
usualy
arund
rochester
its
only
the
kriek
poured
in
a
lindemans
flute
which
is
a
big
plus
for
me
had
a
smell
spritzy
white
head
woth
a
dirty
yellow
body
full
of
carbonation
smell
was
cool
with
lots
of
bubblegum
flavors
and
just
a
lingering
hint
of
the
peach
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
with
more
peach
just
a
little
of
the
musty
funk
of
a
lambic
and
a
ton
of
sparkling
champagne
characteristics
there
was
also
a
good
deal
of
dry
tart
body
that
helped
make
this
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
very
carbonated
and
usually
i
am
not
a
fan
of
overcarbonation
but
with
a
lambic
it
always
seems
to
hit
the
sopt
perfectly
refreshing
and
always
makes
you
question
whether
you
are
actually
drinking
a
beer
tasty
even
on
a
chillier
night
translucent
amberstraw
color
with
virtually
no
head
but
some
active
carbonation
peach
notes
are
light
and
fresh
and
very
appealing
as
with
other
lindemans
offerings
the
fruit
and
grain
smells
complement
each
other
and
meld
nicelya
distinct
difference
from
the
tacky
fruit
beers
on
the
market
taste
is
unexpectedly
sweet
at
the
start
but
the
subtle
tartness
leaves
no
doubt
that
youre
tasting
genuine
peaches
grains
are
muted
until
the
end
and
even
then
the
maltiness
is
quite
subtle
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
despite
the
sweetness
it
is
more
clean
than
syrupy
this
is
another
fine
lindemans
lambic
but
one
is
enough
at
a
sitting
the
white
head
doesnt
develop
much
it
reaches
a
inch
before
quickly
fading
to
a
nice
tight
collar
ruddytawnycoppery
hue
slightly
hazy
it
does
look
mighty
nice
the
nose
is
fresh
peaches
and
equally
fresh
wheat
with
kisses
of
yeast
clean
good
potency
inviting
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
peaches
and
fresh
cut
wheat
nicely
tart
not
very
sweet
rather
juicy
very
little
funkiness
oh
well
complex
enough
it
is
amazingly
appetizing
palate
cleansing
dry
finish
medium
body
light
carbonation
smooth
mouthfeel
very
nice
this
is
damn
good
there
is
always
a
time
and
a
place
to
sip
this
one
the
cost
is
prohibitive
though
try
one
the
color
a
light
orange
peach
if
you
like
beclouded
with
the
head
insignificant
in
size
creamy
in
texture
with
an
off
white
color
as
it
evanesces
a
thin
film
of
lace
remains
to
seal
off
the
glass
the
aroma
of
fresh
peaches
sweet
yet
tart
with
a
hint
of
yeast
oh
so
inviting
this
nose
what
a
hoot
front
is
ambrosial
with
a
tartness
at
the
sides
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
piercing
in
its
acidity
with
the
peach
flavor
present
till
the
very
end
the
aftertaste
desert
dry
and
semisweet
light
orange
color
medium

noticeable
peach

very
fruity
nearly
overwhelming
peach
flavor

yet
there
is
a
vineous

very
beer
like
bit
a
nice
taste
full
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
expansive
finish
is
full
and
round
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
smooth
this
peach
lambic
poured
a
beautiful
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
trails
of
lace
accumulated
on
the
sides
of
the
flute
glass
aroma
was
an
almost
onedimensional
onslaught
of
ripe
peaches
with
some
acidic
qualities
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
first
taste
of
this
revealed
the
most
sour
taste
while
subsequent
sips
provided
a
very
fruity
sweet
peach
quality
almost
too
sweet
for
my
lambic
interests
but
a
crowd
pleaser
nonetheless
mouthfeel
was
prickly
clean
and
inviting
due
to
the
sweetness
its
not
one
that
i
can
drink
time
and
again
but
its
a
decent
fruit
lambic
that
most
folks
seem
to
enjoy
note
this
paired
incredibly
well
with
a
peach
and
blueberry
cobbler
pours
to
an
orangishpink
color
with
a
white
head
it
has
a
fresh
fruity
yeasty
aroma
with
the
peach
aromas
in
the
back
the
flavor
is
very
fruity
sweet
with
peach
being
the
forefront
of
the
flavor
it
also
has
a
fresh
earthy
flowery
flavor
it
finishes
very
sweet
it
is
a
lightbodied
brew
that
would
complement
many
desserts
a
tasty
beer
f
excellent
purchase
albiet
pricey
when
poured
into
my
glass
the
head
was
very
small
with
smallmedium
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
there
was
some
fizzy
carbonation
present
and
no
lacing
the
nose
was
apples
and
peaches
the
body
was
semicloudy
and
it
was
a
hazy
golden
in
hue
the
flavor
was
sour
bitter
tart
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
was
oily
and
buttery
poured
an
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
good
aroma
and
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
the
sweetness
in
this
is
very
dominate
very
mild
to
non
existant
tartness
not
what
i
expected
a
lambic
to
be
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
drink
finished
off
very
clean
and
peachy
this
would
be
another
good
after
dinner
drink
well
reviewing
this
is
more
like
reviewing
wine
than
reviewing
any
beer
the
color
was
golden
and
there
was
no
head
the
smell
was
well
very
peachy
the
taste
was
very
sweet
with
very
little
hint
of
the
lambic
itself
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
smooth
as
would
be
expected
one
or
two
of
these
would
be
drinkable
although
i
think
beyond
that
the
sweetness
would
become
too
cloying
all
in
all
an
excellent
dessert
drink
and
a
drink
i
would
gladly
give
someone
who
normally
doesnt
like
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
slightly
hazy
reddish
golden
with
a
very
small
clingy
white
head
the
mouthfeel
is
rounded
and
almost
syrupy
the
smell
is
perfumey
and
slightly
malty
with
a
smell
that
i
immediatley
recognized
from
my
childhoodcanned
peaches
the
taste
is
perfumey
peaches
and
overwhelmingly
sweet
i
could
possibly
enjoy
this
beer
if
the
sweetness
was
halved
as
it
stands
now
it
seems
more
like
an
overly
sweet
soft
drink
than
a
beer

its
a
big
time
sipper
i
had
a
much
harder
time
enjoying
this
compared
to
the
framboise
but
it
still
makes
for
a
good
little
dessert
or
night
cap
i
didnt
like
this
as
much
as
the
cassis
but
thats
most
likely
a
fruit
choice
pours
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
good
head
tastes
of
peach
a
bit
tart
and
very
fruity
quite
light
on
the
hops
a
nice
brew
very
drinkable
a
good
lambic
my
girlfriend
liked
it
quite
a
bit
if
you
like
peaches
tasted
pretty
aciddic
the
whole
tounge
was
feeling
this
beer
definately
something
i
enjoyed
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
pillowy
soft
white
head
that
leaves
trails
of
sticky
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
recedes
nose
and
taste
are
both
sweet
and
fruity
with
notes
of
fresh
peaches
no
artificial
flavors
here
balanced
by
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
that
leaves
your
mouth
watering
for
another
sip
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
juicy
with
a
refreshing
amount
of
active
carbonation
this
is
a
delicious
brew
that
would
make
for
a
nice
afterdinner
drink
or
as
an
afternoon
cocktail
on
a
warm
summer
day
i
will
surly
have
to
try
some
other
fruit
lambics
to
determine
if
this
is
part
of
the
style
or
just
a
fluke
note
on
looking
at
the
copyright
of
merchant
du
vin
importer
on
the
label
it
said
1992
older
than
the
other
copyright
1999
lindemans
bottles
i
have
at
home
this
may
be
quite
an
old
bottle
though
im
no
expert
on
the
aging
flavor
profiles
for
lambics
after
recently
trying
the
kriek
and
framboise
i
expected
some
seriously
strong
sour
peach
flavor
out
of
this
lambic
surprisingly
nothing
was
overpowering
about
it
served
at
room
temperature
it
pours
out
to
what
looks
like
beer
not
a
wine
like
appearance
that
the
others
have
its
a
fairly
clear
golden
color
and
some
wonderful
lacing
occurs
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
sour
peach
but
its
not
pungent
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
this
beer
is
wonderfully
pleasantly
sweet
sour
and
peachy
it
isnt
puckering
like
other
lindemans
lambics
making
it
more
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
highly
recommend
this
lambic
to
anyone
who
is
just
getting
into
them
interesting
exciting
and
worth
having
again
it
poured
a
hazy
orange
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
amout
of
foam
the
smell
was
of
citrus
fruit
not
a
strong
peach
smell
but
it
reminded
me
of
a
sparkling
cider
tasting
it
was
like
drinking
a
sparkling
cider
but
not
as
sweet
i
could
taste
the
peach
but
not
this
beer
was
not
overpowering
nice
sweettart
flavor
and
finish
in
the
mouth
with
a
pleasant
after
taste
source
abc
atlantic
beach
fl
it
makes
an
excellent
breakfast
brunch
or
dessert
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
with
a
chance
to
get
their
hands
on
it
i
had
this
as
an
appetizer
but
it
would
also
work
as
a
dessert
i
could
also
use
help
with
selecting
the
proper
glass
for
next
time
the
flavor
is
distinctly
of
peaches
but
the
belgian
beer
flavors
are
still
there
the
hops
and
maltiness
are
perfectly
blended
with
a
delicate
balance
that
they
are
more
enhancing
to
the
natural
flavor
of
the
peaches
if
you
havent
tried
or
have
some
bs
reason
to
not
try
lambics
then
give
it
up
for
this
one
if
you
have
tried
the
kriek
cassis
or
framboise
and
didnt
find
these
to
your
liking
dont
make
a
prejudicial
opinion
based
on
those
this
is
a
unique
flavor
and
stands
completely
on
its
own
pours
a
cloudy
brass
tinged
orange
robe
topped
by
a
short
creamy
white
head
the
head
drops
shortly
but
keeps
a
creamy
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
as
well
as
leaving
some
nice
lace
the
aroma
combines
a
very
nice
authentic
fresh
peach
thats
not
overly
sweet
with
minor
flashes
of
lambic
character
light
lactic
sourness
very
mild
mustiness
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
very
fine
and
restrained
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
adds
to
its
smooth
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
again
quite
realistically
peachy
with
a
ripe
juicy
sweet
fruitiness
thats
backed
by
a
tart
edge
some
minimal
lambic
character
becomes
apparent
in
the
long
finish
and
adds
to
its
complexity
of
the
lindemans
fruit
lambic
lineup
this
one
seems
a
bit
more
delicate
and
a
little
less
sweet
and
therefore
has
more
versatility
i
works
equally
well
as
an
appertif
or
dessert
beer
and
would
be
splendid
at
almost
any
time
during
the
summer
think
sunset
on
the
beach
and
although
i
normally
lament
the
lack
of
more
aggressive
lambic
character
acidity
mustiness
barnyard
in
the
lindemans
beers
i
feel
that
actually
works
here
quite
refreshing
and
highly
enjoyable
its
well
worth
seeking
out
and
should
not
be
passed
over
for
the
kriek
or
framboise
is
this
really
a
beer
it
makes
a
great
sparkling
wine
very
fruity
peach
duh
and
sweet
flavor
lively
and
sparkling
i
hate
that
i
liked
this
so
much
because
its
such
a
sissy
drink
but
what
can
you
do
i
typically
do
not
like
fruit
beers
but
this
is
a
great
summer
drink
at
5
a
bottle
i
could
only
afford
to
drink
it
one
season
anyway
pours
a
large
head
that
settles
quickly
to
a
sticky
thin
lace
underneath
a
copper
color
with
a
hint
of
haze
very
tart
aroma
of
fruit
peach
of
course
also
some
naturelike
aromas
specifically
something
youd
find
on
a
farm
ive
heard
this
described
as
horse
blanket
character
thats
exactly
how
id
describe
it
as
well
very
distinct
character
all
around
that
is
best
described
with
the
word
aged
under
all
of
this
hops
and
malt
are
still
detectable
in
a
slight
bitterness
and
an
earthy
grain
character
overall
tartsourness
dominates
probably
the
best
of
the
lindemans
fruit
lambics
but
it
would
be
much
better
if
it
wasnt
sweetened
go
for
a
cuvee
rene
gueuze
instead
nice
tartness
appropriate
to
the
fruit
and
of
course
the
beer
style
peach
flavor
is
nice
and
the
least
artificial
of
the
flavors
i
know
they
probably
use
the
real
deal
but
it
doesnt
always
taste
that
way
the
best
thing
i
can
think
of
to
say
about
the
flavor
and
moutfeel
that
you
wouldnt
otherwise
expect
from
a
fruit
lambic
is
that
its
soft
i
like
it
very
refreshing
a
fantastically
interesting
peach
lambic
nearly
a
peach
champagne
with
slight
maltiness
and
bitterness
dig
this
if
you
can
cheers
thank
jebus
belgian
brew
has
finally
made
it
to
good
ole
new
hampshire
the
color
of
this
brew
matches
with
its
fruit
pillowy
white
head
with
good
retention
somewhat
candyish
peach
nose
with
slight
must
finishes
fruity
with
a
slight
bit
of
sourness
would
go
nicely
with
the
sunset
and
your
significant
other
notes
simply
superb
a
wonderful
beer
to
have
at
a
sunday
brunch
on
tap
at
world
of
beer
syracuse
deep
red
color
intense
raspberry
smell
and
taste
a
really
beautiful
beer
excellent
fruity
beer
excellent
when
added
as
a
base
to
other
beer
types
almost
overly
sweet
with
no
tart
really
not
too
complex
at
all
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
though
not
a
bad
starter
beer
the
best
of
the
lambic
style
hands
down
it
is
like
drinking
a
raspberry
lemonade
without
the
lemon
part
very
low
abv
so
a
good
choice
for
my
designated
driver
i
asked
for
liefmans
fruitesse
and
they
give
me
this
i
still
wonder
how
is
the
fruity
liefmans
one
this
beer
is
awful
it
should
not
even
be
considered
beer
i
suppose
its
the
style
in
general
the
beer
in
general
is
very
sweet
and
syrupy
of
artificial
raspberry
not
even
jam
lacking
in
tart
quality
and
depth
this
is
a
beginner
brew
but
unsatisfying
for
most
dark
pink
with
a
brown
tinge
and
a
pinkish
white
foam
smells
of
sweetness
and
raspberry
purée
yup
tastes
like
raspberry
but
the
taste
finishes
with
a
slight
tartness
vinegar
and
a
oaky
red
wine
but
overall
this
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
finishes
surprisingly
clean
from
the
sweetness
i
feel
like
im
supposed
to
love
this
because
i
love
belgian
beer
but
i
just
dont
however
if
you
mix
framboise
with
hoegaarden
you
get
whats
called
a
dirty
hoe
and
that
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
cocktail
on
tap
at
the
homegrown
brewhouse
in
summerville
sc
for
valentines
day
the
perfect
afterdinner
drink
for
my
wife
and
i
and
an
excellent
companion
to
the
chocolaty
russian
imperial
stout
that
ive
been
sipping
pours
in
to
a
6
oz
snifter
with
an
opaque
beetred
hue
and
2
fingers
of
cranberrycream
foam
quite
a
sexy
looking
drink
the
soapy
lacing
and
foamy
collar
add
to
the
allure
the
intense
fresh
raspberry
aroma
is
sweet
and
tart
a
little
floral
too
with
a
bit
of
sour
citric
character
the
flavor
is
packed
with
a
potent
raspberrycandy
fruit
tartness
the
delicious
raspberry
sugar
sweetness
is
backed
by
a
nice
yeasty
malted
grain
base
reminding
you
that
it
is
indeed
a
beer
suggestions
of
clove
make
a
subtle
appearance
but
ultimately
the
aftertaste
is
reminiscent
of
tart
raspberry
preserves
with
a
medium
body
and
tame
carbonation
its
easy
and
light
but
not
thin
indeed
its
a
great
complimentary
texture
to
the
distinct
flavors
personally
im
not
much
of
a
fruit
beer
guy
but
this
one
has
always
had
a
place
in
my
repertoire
i
enjoy
this
experience
from
time
to
time
and
there
isnt
much
i
would
change
about
lindemans
framboise
excellent
dessert
beer
or
compliment
to
a
host
of
savory
dishes
split
a
bottle
with
your
lady
instead
of
wine
or
champagne
its
delicious
slightly
sweet
along
with
the
sour
definitely
tastes
just
like
a
raspberry
very
good
love
this
one
everytime
just
the
right
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
super
tart
and
hard
to
finish
outstanding
great
taste
when
i
tried
this
thinking
it
would
not
be
good
i
was
shock
to
like
it
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
not
a
huge
lambic
fan
but
im
trying
to
open
up
to
them
in
truth
my
real
goal
is
to
continue
finding
beers
my
fiancee
will
actually
drink
so
shell
be
more
enthused
when
i
drag
her
places
and
what
do
you
know
shell
actually
drink
this
lambic
so
success
for
my
tastes
its
alright
i
imagine
ill
continue
trying
a
variety
of
lambics
the
mother
in
law
loves
this
stuff
so
when
i
bring
over
my
good
beer
i
have
to
bring
over
some
framboise
its
too
fruity
for
me
but
does
go
well
with
dessert
its
crisp
refreshing
and
a
great
flavored
alternative
the
fruity
aromatics
of
this
delicious
framboise
is
soothing
to
the
pallet
and
the
soul
try
this
beer
on
its
own
or
with
a
delicious
slice
of
chocolate
cake
i
really
liked
it
its
fruity
and
tart
sure
but
its
really
good
just
dont
ask
for
one
in
front
of
your
ale
buying
buddies
pours
ruby
red
with
pinkish
foamy
head
smells
like
raspberry
extract
tastes
like
a
sour
raspberry
gummy
very
tart
i
love
sour
candy
and
this
is
very
similar
very
sweet
almost
syrupy
in
taste
straight
up
raspberry
taste
perfect
if
you
enjoy
the
taste
of
fruit
in
beer
i
found
this
one
to
be
crisp
sweet
yet
had
a
degree
of
dryness
at
the
end
that
made
the
beer
very
interesting
smooth

offering
lindemans

are
alway

nice

i
tried
the
raspberry
flavor
great
taste
but
very
sweet
a
pint
is
definitely
shareable
good
choice
for
a
dessert
beverage
alone
or
with
a
semisweet
cake
this
is
an
experience
not
to
be
missed
its
also
an
education
in
a
traditional
lambic
yeast
brew
that
doesnt
involve
the
vinegar
excesses
of
so
many
american
wild
ales
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
servall
liquor
in
san
diego
this
is
the
beer
that
really
turned
me
onto
sours
i
consider
this
one
of
the
best
buys
for
lambics
i
give
this
beer
a
5
but
its
not
really
beer
its
raspberry
malty
champagne
that
is
pure
heaven
extraordinarily
strong
aroma
but
wonderful
overall
a
very
smooth
beer
we
had
it
again
with
spaghetti
and
it
paired
excellent
served
with
thanksgiving
dinner
if
you
have
served
any
sparkling
red
wines
before
give
this
a
try
with
your
holiday
meals
good
but
too
sweet
for
my
tastei
like
sweet
blended
with
a
chocolate
stout
and
made
a
delicious
discovery
that
let
me
drink
the
whole
bottle
light
and
refreshing
great
taste
to
sip
and
enjoy
wonderful
fruity
berry
taste
throughout
but
a
little
hard
to
think
of
as
a
beer
could
easily
substitute
cocktailssoft
drinks
in
the
summer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
raspberry
lambic
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
expect
from
the
style
and
there
were
no
off
flavors
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
a
little
cloying
a
little
sticky
a
little
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
the
sweetness
would
start
to
wear
on
me
after
more
than
one
glass
so
i
think
one
glass
would
be
a
prefect
amount
for
me
and
it
makes
for
a
great
dessert
beer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
it
was
its
just
what
i
expect
from
a
raspberry
lambic
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
i
think
it
could
be
toned
just
a
little
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
makes
a
nice
dessert
beer
and
i
enjoy
drinking
it
so
far
its
my
favorite
raspberry
lamic
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
from
lindemans
i
still
prefer
the
kriek
good
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
beer
keep
up
the
hard
work
earthy
and
yeasty
sweet
to
start
but
not
cloying
tart
like
a
proper
raspberry
should
be
when
a
friend
from
brussels
learned
i
had
it
she
got
verklempt
which
i
think
is
important
great
for
threading
a
stout
i
like
to
mix
an
ounce
or
2
in
with
a
good
stout
or
porter
try
it
with
some
old
rasputin
good
beer
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
tart
flavor
does
balance
it
out
pretty
well
looks
like
a
mini
champagne
bottle
i
dont
normally
enjoy
a
super
sweet
such
as
this
but
the
raspberry
comes
out
in
this
one
so
much
i
love
every
sip
the
use
of
wild
yeast
shows
in
the
somewhat
funky
aroma
not
exactly
my
style
but
it
was
pretty
good
in
a
different
way
overall
glad
i
tried
it
good
not
great
not
quite
sure
what
all
of
the
sour
fuss
is
about
i
guess
ill
have
to
explore
more
better
than
the
kriek
not
as
good
as
pêche
all
of
em
sweet
as
hell
deep
red
colour
one
finger
of
pink
head
no
lace
smell
is
full
of
sweet
fruity
raspberry
lightly
funky
a
bit
of
cheese
rind
as
well
mix
of
sugary
and
tart
berry
juice
is
a
pretty
good
description
of
this
taste
is
of
sweet
berry
up
front
sugar
coated
raspberry
and
raspberry
candy
mid
palate
of
jammy
berry
flavours
with
a
tart
fruity
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
medium
bodied
and
lightly
syrupy
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
perhaps
but
still
quite
good
for
a
sweeter
lambic
something
i
could
drink
again
easily
overall
with
something
as
focused
on
one
thing
as
this
beer
is
raspberries
it
can
be
hard
to
make
a
beer
that
is
balanced
inviting
and
make
you
want
to
go
back
for
more
even
after
the
entire
bottle
is
gone
yet
this
succeeded
while
my
experience
with
lambics
is
rather
limited
this
stands
up
as
the
best
and
most
enjoyable
one
ive
had
something
i
could
go
to
time
and
again
overall
tough
it
is
ridiculously
sweet
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
the
intense
raspberry
flavor
was
delicious
i
do
wish
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
this
was
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
it
would
be
good
to
sip
as
a
dessert
beer
now
and
then
not
something
you
would
drink
often
though
i
would
buy
it
again
i
dont
see
traditional
beer
lovers
going
for
this
one
o
a
pretty
standard
tasting
lambic
for
lindemans
cloyingly
sweet
borderline
synthetic
tasting
overall
nice
once
in
a
while
to
sip
on
but
overall
way
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
poured
into
a
lindemans
glass
color
was
a
purpley
red
burgundy
shade
with
a
light
pink
head
had
started
off
as
3
fingers
quickly
faded
to
just
lacings
with
decent
side
cling
aroma
was
somewhat
one
note
primarily
raspberries
very
sweet
sugary
ripe
ones
very
small
hint
of
malt
hiding
in
the
back
flavor
was
slightly
sour
that
shifted
to
a
very
sweet
ripe
berry
flavor
definitely
beneficial
to
consume
at
the
suggested
temperature
would
be
a
bit
to
sweet
at
warmer
temps
coated
nicely
a
bit
of
carbonation
that
tingled
the
tongue
not
overly
thick
but
boarding
on
being
so
a
nice
change
up
beer
o
i
didnt
think
that
i
would
like
this
i
was
wrong
this
is
the
first
lambic
ive
tried
the
smell
is
intensely
raspberry
the
bubbles
are
tiny
and
the
foam
is
small
and
pink
taste
is
pure
wild
raspberry
tart
slightly
sweet
small
taste
of
yeast
could
be
slightly
crisper
and
it
would
probably
be
perfect
definitely
a
nice
well
made
lambic
if
i
ever
have
a
craft
beer
night
with
my
buds
and
have
people
there
that
arent
really
into
the
craft
beer
world
this
is
what
i
would
have
as
a
backup
in
moderation
this
is
a
deliciously
sweet
desert
ale
i
would
share
with
friends
who
do
not
typically
enjoy
beers
if
you
like
a
sweet
raspberry
beer
this
is
the
one
for
you
smell
is
wonderful
and
fruity
mouth
feel
has
a
bubbly
feel
high
in
carbonation
drink
this
cold
as
it
doesnt
taste
very
good
warm
bit
you
should
have
no
problem
because
taste
is
excellent
and
you
will
want
bottle
after
bottle
low
in
abv
so
will
make
a
good
session
beer
for
your
lady
if
she
is
she
is
not
into
other
beers
overall
this
was
my
very
first
lambic
i
had
no
idea
fruity
beers
existed
now
that
i
do
im
curious
to
try
some
more
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
love
to
pair
it
with
a
thick
piece
of
sweet
dark
chocolate
cake
im
not
beer
expert
so
i
cant
comment
with
the
details
more
experienced
drinkers
can
but
i
can
say
it
was
a
very
tasteful
beer
with
awesome
smell
and
delightful
after
taste
ill
start
now
looking
for
other
lambic
fruits
beers
all
in
all
an
interesting
and
drinkable
beer
not
something
i
want
regularly
but
on
special
occasions
it
is
refreshing
and
even
my
wife
will
drink
it
balanced
and
approachable
beer
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
raspberry
which
isnt
my
favorite
flavor
but
other
than
that
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
the
taste
is
like
drinking
a
raspberry
twister
with
invisible
malts
toast
or
yeast
and
only
the
slightest
tart
bite
at
the
end
which
could
be
attributed
more
closely
to
the
fruit
if
it
was
hot
and
humid
outside
i
might
actually
indulge
in
one
of
these
but
to
me
it
is
more
like
a
fruit
drink
rather
than
a
beer
this
framboise
was
a
dark
red
in
color
with
a
small
lighter
red
head
the
smell
is
of
fruit
all
the
way
and
the
taste
is
of
tart
raspberries
with
just
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
this
was
my
first
fruit
beer
and
i
have
to
say
it
didnt
disappoint
me
at
all
if
you
havent
already
even
if
you
dont
enjoy
fruit
beers
you
really
should
check
this
one
out
taste
starts
with
tart
apple
and
pear
then
moves
on
to
very
ripe
raspberries
and
blueberries
has
a
crisp
tart
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
with
very
high
carbonation
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
this
is
one
to
not
pass
up
if
youre
not
you
should
probably
give
it
a
try
anyway
overall
this
beer
lacks
the
sourness
and
funk
that
you
would
find
in
a
traditional
lambic
so
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
youll
be
disappointed
as
a
raspberry
fruit
beer
though
its
not
bad
at
all
overpriced
for
a
fruit
beer
but
decent
nonetheless
o
its
good
but
hard
to
believe
this
is
considered
a
beer
based
on
the
color
and
the
near
sodalike
sweetness
like
i
said
it
might
technically
be
beer
but
its
heritage
is
a
40
and
capri
sun
still
this
one
is
less
cloying
that
some
other
flavors
pours
out
to
a
raspberry
head
and
murky
reddishpink
color
aroma
is
a
tangy
fruity
raspberry
and
sour
wheat
flavor
is
an
intensely
fruity
sweet
and
sour
with
a
tinge
of
aged
hops
tangy
tart
finish
mouthfeel
is
pickering
and
medium
body
nice
effervescent
effect
a
great
dessert
beer
for
lovers
of
raspberry
youre
welcome
honey
this
is
a
good
beer
to
share
with
someone
who
likes
a
nice
berry
beverage
but
who
doesnt
necessarily
like
beer
such
as
my
girlfriend
its
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
and
a
worthy
addition
to
a
festive
occasion
the
acid
in
this
beer
is
tough
to
get
over
pours
a
deep
garnet
in
color
like
red
wine
that
has
a
small
fizzy
head
actually
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
lots
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottle
of
the
glass
the
aroma
hits
you
right
up
front
as
if
off
fresh
raspberries
wow
very
nice
the
taste
is
even
better
totally
different
with
a
nice
aftertaste
both
sweet
and
tart
but
not
overly
sweet
at
all
perfect
balance
first
one
of
these
i
have
had
and
seen
their
other
flavors
in
the
store
sold
in
the
beer
section
and
not
in
the
wine
section
omy
first
lambic
and
wasnt
expecting
more
than
what
i
got
not
bad
would
pair
well
with
some
sharp
andor
funky
cheeses
a
great
after
dinner
desert
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
like
a
spoonful
of
raspberry
jelly
of
all
the
lindemans
lambics
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
flavor
a
little
pricey
but
when
the
mood
strikes
you
cant
go
wrong
shared
with
the
wife
at
world
of
beer
in
tioga
again
this
brew
is
just
delicious
if
youre
looking
for
a
sweet
changeup
if
you
like
raspberries
you
seriously
cant
not
like
this
yeah
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
and
fruity
sideand
doesnt
have
any
of
that
sour
lambic
funkbut
for
dessert
it
is
just
awesome
would
definitely
drink
again
really
good
sour
this
is
probably
the
framboise
or
fruit
beer
for
that
matter
with
which
all
others
within
the
style
are
compared
it
was
served
on
tap
with
a
giant
head
that
fell
quickly
the
color
is
magnificenta
pinkish
ruby
color
the
smell
is
only
about
the
raspberry
and
is
almost
medicinal
the
taste
has
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
tartness
but
it
has
very
much
of
both
and
has
a
cough
syrup
quality
to
it
the
carbonation
makes
it
similar
to
drinking
champaign
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
the
pounding
sweetness
makes
this
one
a
little
difficult
as
someone
who
loves
raspberries
i
can
say
i
love
drinking
this
beer
but
its
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
and
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
at
all
i
didnt
notice
any
hop
flavors
it
can
work
as
a
dessert
beer
but
is
probably
not
something
to
have
with
a
meal
as
its
going
to
distract
from
the
flavors
of
the
food
theres
a
lot
of
great
brews
withe
raspberries
in
them
but
this
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
the
one
to
beat
overall
4
25
just
an
amazing
representative
of
the
style
of
fruit
lambics
at
every
level
of
sensory
enjoyment
this
beer
is
outstanding
not
perfect
by
any
means
but
nonetheless
fabulous
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
this
style
of
belgian
beers
the
standard
of
fruited
beers
here
really
this
is
the
best
of
fresh
raspberries
belgian
yeast
and
drinkability
it
pours
a
bright
red
almost
medicinal
color
with
a
foamy
pink
head
and
a
lot
of
bubbles
the
nose
is
decidedly
berry
heavy
fresh
and
tart
as
they
are
sweet
belgian
yeast
completes
the
fermentation
of
most
of
the
sugar
here
leaving
a
beer
that
is
brightly
summery
and
plenty
drinkable
without
being
overdosed
on
sugar
all
of
the
lindemans
stuff
is
very
authentic
and
tasty
but
this
might
be
their
most
classic
and
best
put
together
offering
a
great
brew
for
a
celebratory
toast
weddings
for
example
the
champagne
carbonation
makes
it
sing
i
like
this
a
lot
but
the
low
abv
makes
it
hard
to
cop
a
buzz
on
this
alone
its
also
nice
in
a
beer
blend
with
a
nice
belgian
wit
in
just
under
5050
proportions
im
not
always
a
fan
of
lambic
style
brews
but
lindemans
has
a
nice
selection
8
overall
i
believe
the
framboise
has
a
clean
raspberry
flavor
finishes
nicely
rose
appearance
good
mix
of
sparkly
acidic
flavor
i
like
to
enjoy
the
framboise
with
dark
chocolate
and
cheesecake
overall
very
impressive
fruit
lambic
its
no
wonder
this
beer
is
distributed
everywhere
it
would
be
hard
not
to
have
ones
taste
for
the
style
dominate
a
review
and
mine
is
likely
not
excepted
get
around
standard
expectations
for
beer
choose
light
food
pairings
wisely
and
enjoy
or
move
on
o
an
extremely
fruity
champagnelike
drink
not
nearly
complex
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
unleses
you
are
just
looking
for
a
nicer
version
of
arbor
mist
it
would
probably
be
a
very
nice
addition
to
mixed
drinks
though
hazy
reddish
brown
color
foam
almost
entirely
leaves
after
a
few
minutes
in
the
glass
very
tart
smelling
freshly
picked
raspberry
aroma
the
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
high
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
very
intense
raspberry
flavor
pricks
the
taste
buds
dessert
in
a
glass
very
rich
this
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
has
some
prickly
carbonation
and
drinks
almost
more
like
pop
than
beer
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
really
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
your
average
drinking
beer
definitely
not
sessionable
due
to
its
sweetness
this
is
the
beverage
that
inspired
me
to
start
learning
about
and
tasting
other
beer
styles
and
so
far
its
still
my
favorite
overall
this
is
tasty
and
refreshing
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
balls
to
be
a
real
beer
drinkability
berrylicious
very
tart
and
fruity
but
i
like
it
pours
dark
red
with
a
finger
of
pink
foam
that
receded
pretty
quickly
almost
no
transparency
and
pretty
decent
lacing
smells
of
raspberry
wheat
malts
sugar
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
on
the
nose
sweet
raspberry
with
a
subtle
malt
mouth
is
a
nice
tingle
alcohol
well
concealed
overall
this
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
not
the
best
or
worst
i
was
hoping
for
more
sour
though
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
mild
framboise
i
really
only
like
to
mix
it
with
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
it
is
a
fantastic
combination
it
does
taste
pretty
good
by
itself
but
i
prefer
beers
that
tend
to
not
be
as
sweet
i
have
also
heard
of
it
being
mixed
with
different
ciders
and
being
called
a
hummingbird
this
i
have
yet
to
try
for
the
200th
unique
beer
ive
reviewed
i
wanted
to
go
with
something
completely
different
from
what
i
am
used
to
and
this
ubiquitous
fruit
lambic
certainly
met
the
criteria
as
this
is
my
first
go
with
the
style
my
scores
are
somewhat
arbitrary
the
whole
concoction
on
the
surface
really
reminds
me
of
a
flavored
cider
or
sparkling
wine
but
with
much
more
tartness
this
is
nothing
at
all
like
any
other
beer
i
have
tried
and
i
would
have
to
be
in
a
certain
mood
to
go
for
all
these
sweet
and
sour
notes
over
the
bitter
and
roasted
notes
found
in
traditional
beers
all
the
well
as
this
beer
is
ridiculously
expensive
6
for
the
bottle
im
going
to
save
some
for
my
wife
to
see
if
ive
finally
found
a
beer
she
enjoys
o
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
spectacular
the
only
downside
is
the
extreme
astringent
tartness
this
is
one
to
be
shared
as
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
alone
o
not
bad
for
my
first
lambic
experience
it
was
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
and
i
am
hoping
to
dive
a
little
deeper
into
the
lambicsour
genre
lindemans
framboise
45
o
very
easy
to
drink
but
a
touch
sweeter
than
i
prefer
my
fruit
lambic
there
is
definitely
added
sugar
or
sweetener
to
this
beer
the
super
low
abv
and
sweetness
make
this
beer
a
good
candidate
to
pair
with
a
lighter
dessert
like
a
key
lime
pie
really
hit
the
spot
as
i
was
craving
something
sweet
were
i
craving
any
of
the
more
typical
beer
flavors
then
ehhhh
not
so
much
with
that
said
i
do
like
my
fruity
lambics
and
this
is
a
delectable
one
o
i
do
not
like
raspberry
flavoring
one
bit
so
i
was
as
objective
as
possible
i
tried
something
out
of
my
comfort
zone
and
it
went
okay
overall
for
what
it
is
a
sweet
tart
explosion
of
raspberries
its
actually
quite
good
just
dont
go
in
expecting
a
more
traditional
lambic
experience
sweet
juicy
raspberries
tart
strawberry
with
a
touch
of
acetic
tartness
on
the
finish
like
a
jar
of
fresh
jam
this
isnt
a
beer
for
everyone
nor
is
it
an
everyday
beer
but
i
really
liked
it
next
to
ngs
raspberry
tart
this
may
be
my
favorite
raspberryforward
beer
to
date
a
good
one
for
celebrations
and
one
tailormade
for
desserts
a
tasty
novelty
but
i
cant
drink
too
much
of
this
this
beer
tastes
like
a
10
rasberry
wine
cooler
and
got
me
beat
up
but
that
is
what
i
expected
so
omg
so
good
the
appearance
was
like
a
pinkish
red
beer
smelled
like
rasberry
tasted
like
the
aforementioned
wine
cooler
clean
sweet
finish
felt
so
refreshing
in
my
mouthfeel
overall
i
would
give
it
a
10
if
i
could
best
rasberry
flemish
beer
i
have
ever
had
overall
would
drink
again
o
this
beer
has
some
intense
flavor
it
is
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
but
i
dont
think
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
style
that
i
need
a
bigger
sample
size
to
more
accurately
judge
o
this
was
my
birthday
beer
id
had
a
sample
at
a
beer
show
a
while
back
and
fell
in
love
with
the
taste
would
love
to
graduate
up
to
sours
now
a
pretty
solid
way
to
introduce
people
to
lambics
or
even
educate
people
how
diverse
of
a
process
brewing
can
be
around
the
world
i
enjoy
sipping
this
respectfully
especially
as
a
digestif
after
a
meal
as
well
as
seeing
how
this
changes
under
room
temperature
by
far
not
at
all
in
the
same
league
as
say
cantillons
or
drie
fonteinens
lambics
but
still
delightful
and
definitely
more
crowd
pleasing
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
the
fact
that
real
raspberries
were
added
to
the
mix
was
very
apparent
making
for
a
leafy
organic
vibe
and
a
gritty
realness
the
nose
on
the
other
hand
was
very
heavy
with
a
strange
syrupy
sweetness
that
had
real
notes
to
it
but
made
for
a
strange
overall
blend
either
way
this
beer
drinks
nicely
and
tastily
and
is
as
good
as
you
would
expect
from
any
lindemans
product
o
delicious
not
really
a
beer
but
delicious
i
can
never
get
used
to
the
aftertaste
of
this
lambic
i
know
there
are
fans
of
the
way
wild
yeast
tastes
but
i
am
not
one
of
them
musty
and
funky
it
combines
with
the
woody
earthiness
of
the
raspberries
to
create
a
finish
that
i
find
just
weird
weird
isnt
something
i
like
in
beer
that
being
said
its
not
terrible
just
not
something
id
drink
except
on
occasion
mouthfeel
really
dry
and
chewy
very
similar
to
a
sparkling
wine
review
part
2
dont
know
if
anyone
else
has
tried
this
but
pouring
a
pint
glass
half
full
with
this
raspberry
lambic
then
fill
glass
with
23
scoops
of
good
vanilla
ice
cream
wow
the
tartness
of
the
lambic
combined
with
the
vanilla
ice
cream
makes
an
awesome
float
that
even
most
nonbeer
drinkers
enjoy
still
lovable
in
moderation
not
a
prime
lambic
but
quite
flamboyant
and
fruity
a
classic
final
thoughts
i
enjoyed
this
one
its
sweet
and
tart
all
in
the
same
sip
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
just
one
flute
is
good
enough
for
now
though
this
is
the
only
lambic
ive
ever
enjoyed
butand
im
not
quite
sure
it
qualifies
as
a
true
lambic
some
of
the
bad
reviews
on
ba
may
be
due
to
how
it
is
fermented
in
open
casks
naturally
not
in
a
controlled
environment
because
of
this
not
every
batch
will
taste
the
same
but
i
havent
had
a
bad
one
yet
after
enjoying
this
stuff
for
quite
some
time
i
was
surprised
to
learn
of
its
low
alcohol
content
one
glass
has
always
given
me
a
buzz
and
lets
just
say
i
can
drink
a
lot
but
anyway
it
tastes
like
a
thick
tart
raspberry
lemonade
with
no
hints
of
alcohol
or
yeast
very
sweet
but
very
tart
i
love
it
this
has
always
been
a
compromise
for
me
too
when
entertaining
ladies
i
hate
white
wine
and
most
girls
like
this
stuff
just
as
much
if
not
better
thank
god
o
well
its
a
very
simple
and
sweet
lambic
pure
raspberries
with
lots
of
sugar
just
a
tiny
hint
of
tartness
for
a
brief
moment
otherwise
its
just
raspberry
juice
problem
is
i
love
raspberries
and
this
is
oddly
delicious
and
it
gets
you
drunk
well
after
a
long
time
i
guess
at
only
2
5
how
can
you
go
wrong
hated
this
beer
and
im
utterly
confused
about
the
raves
for
it
it
had
exactly
the
appearance
taste
smell
and
mouthfeel
of
cherry
sprite
to
me
and
nearly
the
same
alcohol
content
it
was
overly
carbonated
despite
nearly
no
head
tasted
like
artificial
fruit
flavoring
and
cost
9
for
12oz
tasted
nothing
like
i
was
expecting
from

this

i
have
found
in

its

refreshing
it
can
get
a

overwhelming
towards

basically
the

sweetness
is
the
only
thing
you
get
and
im
not

that
as
a

thing
kind

sucks
when
you
find

this

the
flavors
and
feel

it

for

i
hate
beers
that
are

of

this
is
what
lambic
means
and
was
a

it

grading
inside
the
style
it
tastes
alright
its
probably
easier
for
these
concoctions
to
err
on
the
side
of
overcarbination
or
sweetness
but
this
one
takes
the
high
road
and
goes
for
sour
and
real
raspberries
finishing
smooth
and
sour
leaves
you
looking
for
another
sip
i
could
probably
do
a

of

the

backdrop
fruit
beer
and
very
tart
i
almost
put
the
sweetsour
aspect
of
this
beer
in
the
mouthfeel
section
as
well
as
the
flavor
it
will
pucker
you
up
with
sweetness
and
the
sour
aftertaste
is
nice
i
would
prefer
this
to
be
a
little
less
sweet
stuffing
but
probably
more
of
an
acquired
taste
to
beer
drinkers
than
other
lambics
and
similar
beers
personally
then
becomes
a
bit
overbearing
to
drink
overlordnov
22
but
nevertheless
an
enjoyable
beverage
im
sure
ill
get
it
again
someday
and
enjoy
it
as
a
desert
beverage
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
sparkling
champagnelike
carbonation
this
far
exceeds
my
expectations
its
one
absolutely
delicious
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
night
but
a
couple
bottles
with
some
chocolate
for
dessert
would
be
the
perfect
way
to
end
any
meal
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
very
drinkable
a
thinnish
red
beer
eminates
from
the
bottle
and
looks
like
wine
with
a
light
red
head
not
really
pink
a
tart
almost
sour
berry
aroma
although
theres
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
it
also
weird
nothing
weird
about
the
taste
this
is
thinbodied
and
sharp
but
has
a
great
berry
taste
with
mild
tartness
not
overpowering
i
know
this
is
probably
a
sipper
to
enjoy
it
but
i
just
couldnt
put
it
down
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
not
killign
the
tastebuds
with
any
sour
aftertaste
didnt
really
detect
that
much
of
a
hop
or
malt
presence
not
a
beer
beer
so
to
say
but
i
will
gladly
relax
with
one
of
these

i

i
enjoy
this
one
although
i
wish
the
alcohol
content
was
a
bit
higher
d
no
thanks
for
me
reminds
me
more
of
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
ill
pass
next
time
for
sure
pours
a
raspberry
red
with
a
thick
pink
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
nothing
with
little
lacing
99
raspberry
on
the
nose
with
the
tiniest
hint
of
vinegar
in
the
back
flavor
is
raspberry
soda
with
a
bit
of
tartness
and
thats
it
bubbly
crisp
and
refreshing
for
sure
but
really
onedimentional
might
be
a
decent
introduction
into
the
lambic
world
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
other
fruit
lambics
a
nice
summer
sipper
but
thats
about
it
i
had
this
beer
at
the
meridian
room
in
dallas
and
for
the
longest
time
i
could
only
find
it
at
that
bar
now
im
finding
this
beer
at
almost
all
the
beer
stores
around
east
texas
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
first
time
drinkers
and
for
a
casual
drink
with
friends
on
a
random
afternoon
d
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
enjoyable
if
you
can
sip
one
or
two
dark
red
smells
obviously
of
raspberries
again
tastes
like
some
kind
of
carbonated
raspberry
mixed
drink
but
with
added
tartness
as
opposed
to
the
sugary
nature
of
a
mixed
drink
an
excellent
beer
to
give
to
a
supposed
beer
hater
definitely
not
something
even
close
to
run
of
the
mill
lager
d
great
for
dessert
im
going
to
get
this
again
during
the
holidays
for
the
familys
postdinner
drink
i
couldnt
drink
more
then
one
d
tasty
and
i
usually
dont
care
for
any
beer
with
a
strong
berry
flavor
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
the
type
of
beer
that
i
typically
like
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
ice
cream
aside
i
normally
shy
away
from
fruity
girly
beers
but
this
has
opened
me
up
a
bit
aside
from
being
a
wea
bit
on
the
sweat
side
this
was
a
really
good
brew
a
dessert
beer
d
too
rich
and
sticky
for
something
to
session
i
really
enjoyed
this
lambic
perhaps
because
im
also
a
fan
of
raspberries
but
it
works
for
me
drinkability
too
sweet
for
my
taste
this
one
should
be
paired
up
with
a
dessert
and
drink
it
with
a
partner
because
a
bomber
is
too
sweet
for
one
person
an
enjoyable
experience
to
come
back
to
from
time
to
time
d
this
is
a
a
very
good
sipping
brew
can
i
have
more
then
one
yes
would
i
go
much
beyond
that
second
probably
not
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
with
a
molten
chocolate
cake
i
bet
that
would
work
well
while
i
dont
usually
like
fruity
brews
this
one
was
awesome
the
raspberry
actually
added
to
the
the
candysweetness
of
the
belgian
ale
taste
was
raspberry
and
wheat
and
candy
sugars
smell
was
raspberry
tart
appearance
was
pretty
nice
nice
head
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
mouthfeel
was
pretty
full
drinkablity
is
up
there
but
one
glass
is
enough
for
me
if
i
liked
fruity
beers
this
brew
would
have
a
perfect
score
d
to
be
so
damn
sweet
this
beer
drinks
well
i
really
like
this
one
to
share
a
bottle
with
someone
but
couldnt
drink
it
all
by
myself
a
while
ago
this
beer
was
my
first
framboise
it
still
holds
a
place
in
my
fridge
anytime
enjoy
very
easy
to
drink
this
stuff
down
almost
to
the
point
where
it
is
more
of
a
tart
raspberry
soda
rather
than
a
brew
dsweet
and
fruity
but
quite
heavy
tastes
good
but
1
and
done
a
sipper
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
perfect
for
after
dinner
and
desert
or
just
for
the
hell
of
it
pretty
drinkable
because
it
tastes
a
lot
like
juice
and
isnt
extremely
sour
do
i
relish
drinking
it
not
as
much
as
other
lambics
d
very
easy
to
drink
opened
a
bottle
that
was
cellared
for
three
years
an
even
if
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
drink
old
i
can
tell
you
that
this
one
still
deliver
the
stuff
although
not
quite
as
fresh
as
the
the
tap
one
i
had
in
antwerp
i
was
surprosed
how
this
beer
kept
is
fruit
all
that
time
it
pours
deep
red
slightly
cloudy
and
forms
a
nice
white
head
that
disapeared
afte
one
or
two
minutes
overwelming
rasberry
fruit
smell
and
taste
good
acid
balance
for
that
richeness
of
fruit
if
you
come
aroud
this
beer
worth
a
try
but
definetly
have
to
like
fruity
beer
girls
will
absolutely
love
this
one
the
only
downside
is
that
it
is
a
little
pricey
however
as
a
treat
now
and
then
its
worth
it
overall
a
great
lambic
possibly
my
favorite
i
love
the
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
best
enjoyed
in
small
portions
d
at
4
and
something
that
tastes
this
fruity
and
delicious
is
obviously
very
redrinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
even
though
its
more
like
juice
slightly
low
abv
for
a
lambic
so
deducting
points
for
that
fantastic
brew
if
you
like
this
youll
love
dfhs
fort
drinkability
smooth
and
delicious
more
of
a
dessert
than
a
beer
great
for
commemoration
d
very
it
is
enjoyable
down
to
the
last
drop
makes
a
perfect
dessert
or
after
dinner
treat
i
wasnt
expecting
the
cork
under
the
cap
anyway
it
exited
with
only
a
small
pop
the
foiled
capped
and
corked
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
duvel
snifter
a
dark
purple
sort
of
mauve
color
the
smell
is
raspberry
and
a
little
musk
not
necessarily
bad
though
its
very
inviting
so
i
drink
it
its
tart
on
the
tongue
at
first
which
fades
into
sweet
and
fruity
raspberry
and
then
back
into
some
dry
tartness
at
the
end
quite
delicious
and
i
dream
of
pairing
this
with
a
cheesecake
mouthfeel
is
quite
enjoyable
crisp
and
light
and
refreshingly
tart
delicious
sharp
sweet
tartness
overwhelms
the
mouth
and
is
enhanced
by
the
large
amount
of
carbonation
the
tartness
is
well
balnced
with
the
sweet
raspberry
flavors
slightly
earthy
tasting
very
drinkable
and
delicious
juicy
and
mediumbodied
cut
to
a
nice
consistency
by
the
carbonation
despite
all
the
fruit
the
drink
is
crisp
with
a
surprisingly
clean
finish
could
see
having
one
with
dessert
or
maybe
in
place
of
a
brunch
bloody
mary
this
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
but
no
head
retention
it
has
a
nice
red
color
on
the
nose
all
i
percieved
were
raspberries
and
nothing
else
on
the
palate
all
i
could
taste
was
the
fruit
no
hop
or
malt
character
in
my
opinion
it
has
a
great
tartness
tho
that
i
think
would
go
great
with
desserts
also
it
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
benchmark
for
the
style
imo
d
i
actually
left
an
ounce
or
so
in
my
glass
because
it
was
too
much
raspberry
flavor
the
sweetness
nor
sourness
bothered
me
but
the
continual
bombardment
of
raspberry
was
a
little
boring
id
never
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
d
drinking
more
than
1
would
be
difficult
however
its
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
lindemans
flute
raspberry
raspberry

it

feeling
in

mouth

drink
but
for

moods

some

sweet

flavor
not
cloying

very

excellent

selection
the
only
problem
with
this
beer
other
than
it
being
incredibly
sweet
is
that
you
can
suck
them
down
faster
than
you
can
order
or
afford
them
this
a
good
lambic
but
it
is
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
to
be
a
common
beverage
i
do
highly
recommend
you
try
this
beer
especially
if
you
havent
had
a
lambic
this
is
a
whole
different
world
of
brewing
d
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
like
drinking
the
melted
leftovers
of
raspberry
sorbet
a
decent
lambic
overall
and
definitely
worth
at
least
a
session
drinkablility
is
decent
for
a
lambic
this
is
a
smooth
and
easygoing
brew
with
a
sweet
quality
and
a
mildly
sour
character
solid
example
of
a
lambic
cheers
whenever
someone
tells

i

that
yummyness
of

is
just

tavernjefapr

and
possibly
due
to
the
low
abv
it
would
be
easy
very
bubbly
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
a
deep
bitter
raspberry
aroma
with
loads
of
bubbles
arising
to
tickle
the
nose
taste
is
a
sharp
bitterness
because
the
sweetness
can
be
a
little
much
unless
youre
really
in
the
mood
for
it
i
enjoy
the
kriek
more
than
this

the
head
modest
in

with

clinging
sheets

to
cover

if
you
believe
that
about
me
i
guess
if
you
have
the
money
as
im
on

to
find
some
that
are

perfectly

with
both

elements
it
begins
with
a
burst

that
is

in

a
rich
tartness
effervesces
as
the

a

the

a
slow

its

to

yet
just
the

amount
of

bite
to
it
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with

which
makes
it
have
like

feel

it
like
someone
else
mentioned
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
ecspecially
here
in
maine
overall
it
is
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
had
to
date
very
tart
but
quite
enjoyable
overall
great
on
a
hot
day
overall
pretty
nice
kriek
light
and
enjoyable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
dont
have
much
experience
at
all
with
this
style
but
since
it
doesnt
have
that
cough
syrup
taste
that
the
first
one
had
i
would
consider
this
a
good
one
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
crisp
slightly
mouth
puckering
not
too
acidic
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
for
a
after
dinner
dessert
beer
but
i
think
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
bottle
to
myself
it
just
might
take
me
a
little
bit
to
finish
it
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
pretty
good
and
it
did
a
good
job
of
really
showcasing
the
cherrys
and
making
them
the
star
of
the
show
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
better
if
it
didnt
have
light
cough
syrup
like
aspect
to
it
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
who
love
fruity
and
tart
cherry
beers
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
impressed
with
this
beer
i
went
into
it
thinking
theres
a
good
chance
it
could
be
a
cough
syrup
bomb
and
the
aroma
didnt
fully
disprove
that
but
once
i
got
to
the
taste
i
started
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
this
beer
so
far
this
is
now
my
favorite
kriek
and
my
favorite
beer
from
lindemans
good
job
guys
this
beer
made
for
one
nice
dessert
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
its
true
lindemans
kriek
is
more
fruit
juice
than
lambic
and
more
sugar
than
fruit
juice
the
initial
impression
of
cranberry
cocktail
turns
out
to
actually
be
pretty
spot
on
mostly
candylike
syrupy
sweetness
and
only
a
superficial
token
amount
of
the
fruits
true
tartness
its
still
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
but
make
no
mistake
tis
no
true
lambic
o
this
is
a
very
vibrant
and
refreshing
beer
strong
flavors
and
a
great
feel
carry
this
beer
past
its
mistakes
and
make
it
a
solid
fruit
beer
o
i
like
the
peche
better
but
this
is
decent
krieks
can
be
very
tart
but
im
not
surprised
having
tried
the
peche
that
this
was
only
slightly
tart
that
said
tart
isnt
necessarily
what
i
like
in
these
kinds
of
ales
overall
not
bad
not
maybe
for
me
but
not
bad
overall
a
solid
offering
from
lindemans
though
the
frambroise
remains
my
favorite
so
far
this
would
be
great
as
an
aperitif
served
in
champagne
glasses
with
a
cherry
cheesecake
or
chocolatecherry
tart
an
approachable
lambic
for
all
but
not
something
that
will
blow
you
away

pretty

lots
of
cherry

actually
a
surprising
amount
of
tartness
especially
up

which
i
didnt
expect
knowing
lindemans
m
o

and
not
much
else
to
speak
of
here

and
syrupy

lambic
purists
will
tell
you
that
true
krieks
shouldnt
be
as
sweet
as
this
and
maybe
they
shouldnt
in
that
sense
this
isnt
very
exemplary
of
the
style
and
we
all
know
that
lindemans
flavors
their
beers
instead
of
using
fruit
in
the
brewing
process
but
that
doesnt
mean
this
cant
be
a
good
beer
overall
a
nice
red
fruity
tart
but
moderately
sweet
lambic
rather
tasty
overall
all
while
still
maintaining
a
somewhat
refreshing
demeanor
even
with
the
tarter
and
sour
flavors
of
the
brew
very
nice
offering
and
i
suspect
will
entice
newcomers
to
sour
ales
to
try
it
out
pours
a
murky
burgundy
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
pink
head
that
retains
well
the
smell
is
all
rich
sweet
cherries
all
day
long
with
a
sour
yeast
aroma
in
the
background
it
tastes
like
cherry
grape
juice
up
front
and
quickly
becomes
a
mouthpuckering
sour
bomb
ending
with
more
cherry
flavor
and
some
yeast
funk
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
high
leading
to
a
mouthfeel
that
is
similar
to
champagne
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
lambic
i
found
it
more
balanced
and
approachable
than
an
american
sour
or
wild
ale
maybe
as
i
try
more
i
will
have
a
better
feel
for
how
the
style
is
supposed
to
come
across
but
for
a
first
experience
i
found
this
quite
tasty
o
this
beer
is
a
disappointment
to
me
i
like
krieks
but
i
just
dont
seem
to
like
lindemans
overall
4
25
just
a
fabulous
kriek
lambic
the
flavor
of
the
fruit
is
forward
and
dominates
but
there
is
so
much
more
going
on
here
than
just
cherry
flavored
beer
the
levels
of
taste
and
the
deep
sophisticated
arrangement
of
them
are
executed
almost
flawlessly
this
is
the
kriek
to
try
if
youve
never
had
one
before
and
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
find
recommended
o
for
ladies
beer
as
it
was
called
in
brussels
this
isnt
half
bad
in
fact
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
splurges
and
something
i
like
to
share
a
great
beer
it
may
be
a
sweeter
example
but
its
certainly
a
fun
drinkable
lambic
i
can
definitely
picture
a
group
of
friends
consuming
this
sitting
on
a
balcony
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
flute
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
ruby
red
coloring
that
is
bloodlike
in
its
depths
and
bright
ruby
around
the
edges
tall
frothy
bubbly
pink
colored
head
that
starts
a
tall
couple
of
inches
and
settles
unevenly
into
a
sparse
surface
coating
aromas
of
rich
sugary
sweet
cherry
both
tart
and
darkly
sweet
the
nose
is
similar
to
cherry
cough
drops
flavors
are
sugar
and
syrupy
sweet
cherry
almost
like
a
maraschino
with
a
bitter
tartness
at
the
tail
end
of
the
palate
smooth
thin
body
that
gets
frothy
and
effervescent
at
the
end
richly
sweet
cherry
aftertaste
with
a
solid
linger
following
a
slick
clean
finish
overall
i
really
like
this
a
lot
dont
fully
remember
the
kasteel
rouge
but
i
think
i
like
this
just
as
much
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
this
is
sort
of
like
drinking
a
jolly
rancher
soda
big
burst
of
taste
except
thats
pretty
much
all
there
is
to
this
not
terrible
but
i
wish
it
had
a
lot
less
sweet
and
a
lot
more
sour
this
is
a
beer
i
keep
in
my
fridge
100
of
the
time
i
drink
one
or
two
bottles
a
week
out
of
the
20
or
so
bottles
of
beer
i
drink
in
a
week
drinkability
incredibly
drinkable
far
better
than
most
other
lambics
ive
tried
that
are
too
sour
for
me
i
might
be
biased
because
i
love
cherries
but
this
may
be
the
best
of
the
linemans
lambics
well
the
ones
that
are
readily
available
on
most
stores
shelves
nice
tart
and
sweet
qualities
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
overall
sort
of
a
onetrick
pony
but
its
almost
to
be
expected
here
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
without
getting
to
much
into
the
funk
side
of
things
do
drinkability
is
very
high
due
in
part
to
the
relatively
low
abv
and
the
black
cherry
goodness
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
this
is
a
fine
kriek
lambic
3
5
theres
a
sweetly
cherrylike
aroma
more
candied
maraschino
than
anything
fresh
the
flavor
is
just
to
the
wrong
side
of
cloyingthink
cough
drops
cough
syrup
and
a
smooth
sickly
sweet
artificial
cherry
flavor
its
a
fun
one
to
share
but
not
something
id
seek
out
to
drink
all
for
myself
alone
that
said
id
definitely
mix
ita
plug
of
the
kreik
in
a
pint
of
chocolate
stout
works
wonders
i
really
liked
the
overall
presentation
and
flavors
of
this
beer
it
looked
nice
the
taste
was
somewhat
one
dimensional
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
super
refreshing
and
drinkable
my
rating
may
be
higher
than
i
would
have
rated
it
in
the
future
but
for
now
the
rating
stands
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
this
is
a
tasty
fruit
lambic
i
know
it
doesnt
have
a
terrific
score
here
but
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
maybe
it
doesnt
have
all
the
complexity
that
some
of
the
better
lambics
have
but
i
dont
think
that
warrants
a
sub4
score
maybe
people
are
expecting
something
a
bit
sourer
if
you
like
cherries
and
tartness
you
will
like
this
beer
a
good
starting
point
for
someone
interested
into
lambics
especially
for
someone
who
is
unsure
how
they
might
feel
about
the
funk
typically
associated
with
it
my
wife
enjoys
this
beer
and
it
is
a
good
one
for
an
after
dinner
or
dessert
beer
would
go
great
with
chocolate
cake
especially
a
german
chocolate
cake
pours
dark
red
with
rosy
pink
satin
surface
sheets
smells
like
cherries
darker
ones
with
a
bit
of
wood
and
sugar
taste
is
deeply
cherry
with
plenty
of
sweetness
and
a
hearty
tone
at
the
base
just
simply
carbonated
concentrated
cherry
juice
here
in
my
face
light
syrup
with
low
to
moderate
carb
and
a
wet
finish
very
standard
and
tasty
for
the
lineup
lindemans
seems
to
me
to
be
great
beer
so
long
as
you
know
what
youre
getting
yourself
into
this
was
good
as
a
treat
would
pair
well
with
strong
cheese
plate
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
we
tried
it
with
dessert
sweetness
overload
great
cherry
aroma
and
flavor
nice
sour
hit
on
the
back
end
cold
is
a
must
not
very
pleasant
as
it
warmed
up
very
champagnelike
light
mouthfeel
minimal
aftertaste
maybe
a
tad
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
wasnt
what
i
expected
different
and
interesting
style
for
sure
liked
would
drink
again
but
would
not
use
with
dessert
this
is
exactly
what
a
kriek
should
be
this
is
the
definition
of
the
style
really
pours
cloudy
and
pink
champaigne
looking
carbonation
and
a
fizzing
white
head
about
half
an
inch
tall
the
nose
is
tart
from
the
yeast
and
from
the
cherries
a
little
sweet
but
not
at
all
overdone
flavor
is
really
true
to
black
cherry
fresh
not
dried
sweet
but
made
tart
and
puckery
by
the
yeast
its
still
a
little
sugary
in
terms
of
feel
but
in
a
dessert
setting
i
think
it
is
a
positive
attribute
the
fruit
juice
and
the
yeast
work
together
better
in
this
beer
than
in
almost
any
other
out
there
in
my
experience
super
intense
carbonation
and
an
alredy
light
body
make
this
really
exciting
in
the
mouth
a
great
bottle
to
share
after
a
thanksgiving
feast
or
similar
celebration
not
something
you
would
drink
every
day
i
was
honestly
disappointed
the
appearance
was
fine
smell
strong
cherry
the
taste
was
faintly
like
cherry
cough
syrup
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
overall
anticlimatic
starts
out
decently
but
leaves
the
cheery
cough
syrup
aftertaste
on
the
palette
beer
is
sweet
like
soda
finishes
sweet
it
is
actually
sweeter
than
most
sodas
i
drink
very
cherry
mild
tartness
mild
everything
i
enjoy
it
but
it
is
overpowering
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
around
for
guests
or
parents
when
they
come
and
visit
o
good
kriek
if
you
like
it
on
the
sweet
side
gives
you
a
strong
red
fruit
highly
drinkable
pretty
much
a
dessert
in
a
bottle
this
is
a
fun
dessert
beer
reminiscent
in
flavor
and
spirit
of
fruit
striped
gum
o
is
this
a
beer
ok
i
know
this
is
my
first
lambic
but
im
not
sure
what
else
to
say
other
than
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
others
of
this
style
ill
get
this
again
when
i
have
a
malt
drinker
over
to
my
house
and
they
say
they
want
a
beer
ill
give
them
this
just
so
i
can
see
the
look
on
their
face
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
so
than
the
framboise
i
had
last
week
from
them
neither
are
sour
but
both
are
great
sweet
fruit
beers
with
a
little
bit
of
a
belgian
kick
to
them
i
like
cherry
a
little
better
and
this
reminded
me
of
black
cherry
soda
so
id
choose
this
over
the
other
but
both
are
great
and
worth
trying
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
finally
decided
to
review
it
it
has
the
typical
lindemans
sweetness
and
strong
fruit
flavors
that
im
sure
discourage
hardcore
fans
of
sour
beers
nevertheless
the
beer
is
refreshing
pleasant
to
drink
and
easy
to
find
merci
davoir
faire
cette
bière
lindemans
cest

vive
la
bière
belgique
overall
a
very
nice
beer
certainly
something
different
check
it
out
if
you
get
a
chance
the
beer
is
red
in
color
cant
see
through
it
the
head
is
pink
and
dense
the
beer
looks
like
strawberry
juice
the
aroma
is
sour
like
vinegar
but
i
get
some
cherry
that
complement
the
sourness
regarding
the
taste
it
is
quite
similar
to
the
aroma
however
there
is
a
presence
of
sugar
in
there
too
the
finish
is
very
sour
like
sour
candies
cold
it
is
good
as
it
warms
up
it
doesnt
get
better
and
the
beer
lose
some
punch
maybe
too
sugary
for
me
but
not
bad
overall
i

pours
dark
red
with
a
small
pink

nose
shows
cherry
cough
syrup
faint
funky
notes
and
very
soft
malt
a
mix
of
acidic
and
sweet
flavours
are
present
upon
tasting
with
cherry
throughout
and
some
funky
notes
later
on
the
sour
finish
is
perfectly
refreshing
nice
moderately
high
carbonation
suits
the
beer
well
o
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
where
i
felt
like
i
wasnt
drinking
a
beer
it
reminds
me
of
the
cherry
apple
cider
i
drank
as
a
kid
around
the
holidays
this
doesnt
take
away
for
how
enjoyable
it
was
it
is
very
drinkable
and
is
very
refreshing
too
sweet
for
my
liking
enjoyed
lindemans
framboise
quite
a
bit
more
followed
by
their
pomme
next
up
peche
o
this
tastes
like
a
watermelon
and
cherry
sour
patch
kid
very
sour
great
beer
for
valentines
day
doa
overall
this
is
simply
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
low
abv
excellent
taste
and
smell
a
great
dessert
beer
and
one
of
my
favourite
lindemans
offerings
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
this
beer
is
most
pleasing
to
the
palate
although
it
isnt
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
nor
often
the
carbonation
is
almost
that
of
pop
but
this
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
drink
perhaps
this
is
a
guilty
pleasure
but
i
enjoy
a
beer
like
this
from
lindemans
from
time
to
time
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
while
still
giving
you
traditional
lambic
qualities
with
a
sweetened
edge
to
it
not
something
i
could
drink
in
large
amounts
but
this
always
seems
to
go
over
well
with
everyone
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
red
color
with
a
thin
pink
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
cherry
which
is
a
good
thing
the
smell
has
some
light
wild
yeast
aromas
in
there
too
giving
a
little
bit
of
funk
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
of
sweet
and
sour
cherry
it
seems
to
start
sweet
and
end
with
the
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
a
carbonated
wine
overall
its
not
a
terrible
lambic
in
my
opinion
however
some
think
that
lindemans
is
just
too
sweet
all
around
to
each
their
own
compared
to
the
only
other
kriek
ive
tried
cantillon
lou
pepe
this
example
is
a
bit
plain
complexity
is
not
in
the
same
league
at
all
still
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
could
see
how
this
would
be
very
accessible
to
people
who
think
they
dont
like
beer
sweetness
is
high
but
it
doesnt
come
off
as
cloying
nor
as
a
fruity
cooler
pretending
to
be
a
beer
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
it
due
to
sweetness
but
one
is
great
this
would
definitely
pair
well
with
all
kinds
of
desserts
especially
anything
chocolate
if
theres
any
brett
in
here
id
love
to
try
this
aged
with
more
showing
im
not
picking
up
on
any
and
feel
it
could
really
use
a
little
o
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
ever
had
simple
cherry
flavor
transformed
into
a
complex
beer
the
character
and
complexity
used
with
one
flavor
aspect
is
wonderful
just
a
delicious
experience
something
ill
enjoy
again
good
change
of
pace
and
soothing
overall
this
is
an
incredible
lambic
such
a
good
pick
up
i
am
usually
one
that
hates
fruity
beer
but
this
completely
changes
that
concept
the
black
cherry
sweetness
and
the
sour
finish
is
a
great
combination
thanks
for
the
recommendation
bigplay1824
o
this
is
the
best
lambic
i
have
had
to
date
the
taste
absolutely
blew
me
away
and
the
scent
was
tantilizing
absolutely
incredible
gonna
need
to
grab
some
more
bottles
of
this
to
test
it
out
with
some
aging
loved
it
i
like
this
beer
all
the
beers
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
so
far
ive
liked
nice
pours
a
hazy
dark
red
with
a
3
inch
foamy
redwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
island
of
foam
random
clumps
of
foamy
lace
cling
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
and
sour
cherries
and
some
slight
funk
taste
is
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
with
the
funk
coming
through
a
bit
stronger
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
slightly
acidic
quality
to
this
one
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
a
sticky
residue
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
another
good
lindemans
take
on
the
lambic
even
though
it
may
not
be
the
most
authentic
product
out
there
o
pretty
one
dimensional
but
its
an
enjoyable
sweet
fruit
brew
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
leaves
a
huge
thick
film
on
the
palate
good
carbonation
levels
overall
an
interesting
beer
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
it
is
honestly
a
nice
beer
that
satisfies
any
sweet
tooth
cravings
you
may
be
having
o
is
this
really
considered
a
beer
this
almost
feels
like
a
sparkling
grape
juice
this
is
no
question
that
this
can
be
a
session
beer
but
i
just
cant
think
of
an
occasion
to
drink
this
for
i
thought
a
beer
and
a
salad
was
crazy
but
after
tasting
this
i
could
now
imagine
this
food
pairing
note
weizenbobs
review
a
few
before
this
one
is
spot
on
i
recommend
looking
at
his
for
a
good
feel
of
what
youre
getting
into
overall
ive
still
only
tried
a
handful
of
lambics
but
this
one
was
one
of
the
better
ones
so
far
im
glad
i
only
had
a
small
bottle
of
it
though
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
much
of
it
in
one
night
if
i
could
chance
one
thing
id
bump
up
the
alcohol
level
a
little
bit
tart
and
tangy
cherry
bite
to
it
the
merest
hint
of
acidity
and
pleasing
aftertaste
no
noticible
alchohol
too
it
o
i
dont
drink
many
of
this
style
but
for
me
this
is
a
nice
changeup
easy
drinker
plenty
of
flavor
and
i
can
still
function
afterward
i
give
a
schlitz
for
lindemans
kriek
two
when
im
in
the
mood
overall
a
decent
desert
beer
with
tons
of
cherry
sweetness
not
terribly
complex
or
interesting
but
not
a
bad
beer
compared
to
real
beer
it
deserves
less
but
that
was
not
my
point
of
fixation
the
first
time
i
had
this
a
year
or
two
back
i
thought
it
was
nothing
more
than
fruit
juice
im
glad
i
revisited
this
its
much
more
complex
than
i
remember
the
sourness
is
well
integrated
and
not
in
the
least
prominent
a
good
intro
into
the
style
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
the
regular
bottles
id
rate
more
along
the
lines
of
332
533
this
one
gets
a
little
bit
higher
for
being
better
i
hope
every
bottle
i
buy
for
her
is
like
this
one
i
wont
hold
my
breath
d
as
i
said
its
a
bit
disappointing
for
my
first
kriek
having
come
to
it
through
a
gueuze
i
was
expecting
more
sourness
and
complexity
in
the
flavour
profile
that
said
its
still
delicious
refreshing
and
worth
trying
with
a
chocolate
dessert
or
just
by
itself
before
the
season
turns
the
sweetness
would
be
a
bit
too
much
for
me
if
i
were
planning
on
drinking
a
few
but
the
one
i
had
wasnt
bad
overall
i
like
it
its
much
different
than
anything
else
ive
ever
had
but
its
good
it
is
definitely
a
good
quality
brew
cant
help
but
imagine
this
with
a
slice
of
chocolate
cake
o
only
tried
a
few
lambics
before
and
was
beginning
to
think
they
werent
for
me
this
was
all
sweet
cherry
and
may
have
converted
me
not
artificial
sweet
either
you
can
tell
theres
real
cherry
behind
it
would
be
perfect
with
dark
choclate
mud
cake
overall
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
a
fruit
lambic
and
its
definitely
a
unique
style
a
bit
pricy
but
tasty
still
if
you
want
a
sweet
kriek
that
most
folks
would
enjoy
this
is
the
one
poured
from
a
corked
bottle
nice
touch
that
poured
a
bright
red
with
a
decent
pink
head
that
fizzles
away
quickly
to
leave
some
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
a
little
like
cough
syrup
but
tastes
like
cherry
sours
its
a
candy
that
im
particularly
fond
of
if
you
dont
like
cherries
youre
not
going
to
like
this
beer
however
if
you
like
sweet
and
sour
cherry
flavors
i
would
highly
recommend
this
brew
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
though
i
couldnt
see
having
more
than
one
or
two
at
any
given
time
due
to
the
sweetsour
flavor
i
think
theres
an
audience
for
this
beer
that
will
be
very
pleased
with
it
id
just
rather
drink
beer
that
tastes
like
beer
o
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
might
even
buy
another
it
was
a
very
unique
experience
and
my
first
with
a
lambic
im
intrigued
enough
to
try
out
some
more
simply
because
this
experience
was
so
unique
pours

opaque

has
black

some
sweetness
and
mild

never
really

both

quite
easy

put
back

doesnt
stand
out
in
any
fashion
per
say

sugary

not

overall
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
beer
something
what
i
expect
a
cooler
to
be
like
tastes
alright
nothing
bad
about
it
and
not
something
i
will
find
myself
drinking
often
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
i
think
this
is
a
beautiful
product

in
fact
this
is
gobs

an
instant
classic

only
a

lambics

either
this

you
like

this
one
exceeded
my
expectations
the
tart
cherry
flavours
were
great
but
as
i
continued
to
drink
this
one
the
tartness
and
the
sweetness
each
became
a
a
little
too
much
for
me
otherwise
this
would
be
an
a

the
sweetness

across
as
more
of
a
cherry

with
a

a
kick
but
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
a
nice

couldnt

one

these

the

good

hardly
any

the

great
i
feel

id

the

is
pretty
high
o
very
good
lambic
quite
delicious
summer
brew
with
some
nice

some

really

this
drinks
more
like

than
anything
but
it
is
still
nice
i
do
like
the
cherry
flavour
overall
this
beer
is
not
really
my
style
but
i
can
see
how
it
could
be
loved
by
others
it
really
is
what
it
says
black
cherry
i
bet
there
are
many
that
would
love
it
but
i
am
not
one
of
them
great
intensity
to
its
rosy
pink
colour
the
appearance
is
hazy
and
turbid
the
pour
forms
a
thin
pale
pink
head
that
recedes
quickly
and
leaves
little
spots
of
lace
powerful
black
cherry
aroma
like
black
cherry
soda
but
less
artificial
the
cherry
aroma
here
has
depth
and
comes
across
as
very
natural
big
cherry
flavour
on
the
palate
with
a
fruit
juice
sweetness
and
mild
tartness
on
the
balance
this
fruit
lambic
is
more
sweet
than
sour
my
guess
is
that
the
base
beer
was
blended
with
the
cherry
juice
mentioned
in
the
ingredients
list
and
that
the
sweetness
comes
from
the
cherry
juice
itself
its
lightbodied
with
the
sugars
giving
it
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
on
the
whole
this
is
a
pretty
simple
fruitbomb
but
the
fruit
flavour
is
very
rich
and
natural
definately
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
your
fruit
beers
to
really
taste
like
fruit
and
little
else
ok
overall
the
sweetness
changes
enough
to
tolerate
many
others
out
there
that
are
better
but
this
one
is
the
easiest
to
find
a
starter
for
newcomers
to
the
style
great
with
dark
chocolate
paired
with
strawberry
shortcake
overall
this
was
just
above
average
for
me
certainly
nothing
to
boast
over
o
this
beer
has
a
syrupy
cherry
taste
that
is
not
fresh
fruit
at
all
but
just
all
artificial
i
havent
had
ludens
cough
drops
since
i
was
a
kid
but
one
sip
of
this
beer
and
i
fell
like
i
was
sick
in
bed
i
couldnt
find
any
other
characters
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
dessert
brew
id
have
to
split
a
bottle
with
a
few
people
though
because
of
the
sweetness
truthfully
id
rather
drink
a
cream
stout
for
dessert
hopefully
the
next
cherry
beer
i
find
is
more
tartsour
mediciney
taste
is
not
very
good
would
not
buy
again
might
drink
as
part
of
a
fruit
punch
bowl
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
still
good
though
thats
probably
expensive
for
you
yanks
out
there
but
in
the
great
white
north
thats
well
worth
the
investment
o
its
a
no
for
me
i
like
my
cherrie
beers
sour
i
knew
this
was
more
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
is
really
at
the
end
of
the
spectre
not
my
thing
do
well
easily
drinkable
at
only
4
a
good
example
of
the
fruit
beer
style
which
is
not
surprising
coming
from
lindemans
notes
overall
i
enjoyed
the
sweettart
mix
of
flavor
as
well
as
its
pretty
appearance
o
sort
of
a
guilty
pleasure
but
at
the
same
time
its
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
a
ton
of
o
not
much
sourtart
but
has
a
decent
taste
that
finishes
slightly
sweet
without
any
off
flavors
not
a
complex
beer
but
would
one
that
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day

mouth
feel

and
refreshing
the
sour
cherry
flavor
is
unique
and
why
you
will
either
love
it
or
hate
it
i
suppose
dont
expect
a
lot
of
sweetness

leaves
a
fairly
persistent

and
a

sweet
and
subtly
sour
finish
d
very
easy
to
enjoy
but
very
much
more
like
a
fruit
dessert
beer
than
a
lambic
still
tasty
and
did
not
last
long
in
my
glass
but
when
i
want
a
good
lambic
this
simply
does
not
fit
the
bill
this
was
used
as
a
toast
with
my
wife
for
our
wedding
anniversary
tonight
she
tends
to
like
sweet
wines
so
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
we
can
drink
together
overall
a
very
good
fruit
lambic
d
lambic
traditionalists
may
scoff
but
damn
if
this
isnt
a
great
dessert
beer
haters
to
the
left
poured
a
pale
red
with
an
average
sized
fizzy
pink
head
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
strong
of
black
cherries
with
a
mild
sweet
malt
and
sweet
yeast
scent
it
tasted
robustly
sweet
of
cherries
and
slightly
acidic
at
first
and
finished
mildly
sweet
with
a
nice
black
cherry
flavor
that
stayed
with
you
for
a
nice
duration
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
dry
in
texture
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
lambic
d
this
isnt
one
that
i
can
drink
that
often
not
offensive
but
not
really
for
me
either
i
can
see
the
appeal
of
this
to
non
beer
drinkers
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
blending
of
the
fruit
with
the
malts
the
brew
presents
a
robust
fruitiness
that
is
of
course
entirely
appropriate
for
the
style
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
malty
beerness
of
it
which
can
be
easily
done
considering
the
strength
of
the
desired
flavor
those
flavors
are
allowed
to
poke
through
and
give
us
a
tasty
well
balance
end
product
decent
mediumlight
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
very
drinkable
at
first
but
the
sweetness
wears
you
down
after
a
while
i
guess
a
decent
and
definitely
approachable
lambic
a
good
starter
for
those
getting
into
the
style
d
not
my
favourite
kriek
by
any
means
mouthfeel
was
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
this
is
what
wine
wishes
it
was
guzzle
away
fairly
low
abv
id
close
this
750ml
bottle
down
and
go
for
another
if
i
had
one
d
very
high
this
is
my
gateway
kriek
i
need
more
750
ml
bottle
pours
redsemiclear
with
a
redish
long
lasting
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
and
sour
cherry
with
hints
of
peaches
the
body
is
medium
and
crisp
taste
is
of
sweet
and
sour
cherries
with
some
spices
for
a
balance
a
good
drink
for
a
dessert
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
high
a
new
favorite
for
me
from
the
lindemans
product
offering
i
think
both
ways
of
presenting
a
fruitfermented
beer
are
brilliant
and
i
really
enjoy
this
experience
and
will
look
for
another
to
represent
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
for
next
time
cheers
to
all
and
merry
christmas
d
second
lambic
ive
tried
and
i
dont
get
it
fruit
juice
is
what
i
get
out
of
it
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
i
get
it
drinkability
unbelievable
very
sweet
but
could
drink
45
without
thinking
twice
if
anything
lindemans
made
their
kriek
taste
nothing
like
a
creek
life
is
too
long
not
to
have
a
lindemans
the
kriek
will
bring
me
back
for
a
repurchase
sometime
in
the
future
even
at
5
99
for
a
12
ounce
bottle
very
high
relatively
low
abv
and
can
be
found
pretty
much
anywhere
great
taste
and
very
refreshing
a
great
dessert
beer
or
for
a
special
occasion
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
the
brew
goes
down
way
too
easy
light
body
a
bit
of
a
sticky
mouthfeel
afterwards
drinkability
is
good
only
the
tartness
precludes
along
session
pretty
much
the
same
as
all
lindemans
which
is
a
good
thing
and
this
one
is
probably
my
personal
favorite
cherry
flavoring
is
very
noticeable
but
not
too
sweet
like
those
stupid
marciano
cherries
very
nice
carbonation
that
compliments
the
cherry
flavoring
well
easy
to
drink
with
breakfast
warm
days
parties
or
with
dessert
this
lambic
is
more
complex
than
i
thought
it
would
have
been
while
there
is
a
strong
black
cherry
flavor
and
an
inyourface
sweetness
it
is
also
bitter
with
faint
hints
of
hops
and
other
fruits
this
isnt
traditional
lambic
and
i
dont
care
im
rating
this
as
a
beer
and
as
a
fruit
beer
its
outstanding
i
think
it
stands
toe
to
toe
with
wisconsin
belgian
red
the
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
and
i
still
enjoy
it
even
if
its
name
is
a
bit
misleading
pours
like
liquid
ruby
with
a
whitish
pink
head
it
has
a
tart
cherry
cranberish
taste
to
it
that
is
quite
refreshing
after
a
long
day
of
dealing
with
computer
stress
it
smells
strongly
of
dark
cherry
it
has
a
smooth
creamy
taste
too
this
is
definetly
one
good
lambic
if
you
like
cherry
alot
which
i
do
poured
a
vibrant
raspberry
red
with
a
half
finger
of
pink
head
and
left
lots
of
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
big
on
the
tart
cherries
with
funky
barrel
cork
mustiness
and
acidic
notes
the
taste
was
also
huge
on
the
sour
cherries
but
also
had
the
funky
barrel
notes
cork
like
character
and
slight
acidic
citrus
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
sour
and
dry
finish
it
drank
very
good
and
had
my
novive
beer
buddies
fienning
for
more
overall
im
loving
this
beer
right
now
i
have
never
really
gotten
into
any
lambics
or
sours
at
all
but
this
one
has
me
wanting
to
explore
more
of
this
world
afterall
12oz
corked
bottle
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
a
crisp
dark
purple
with
a
frothy
pinkish
purple
head
aroma
is
loads
of
black
cherries
as
expected
the
is
loads
of
super
tart
cherries
but
still
enjoyable
the
beer
is
light
and
smooth
but
the
tartness
is
a
bit
of
a
chore
i
certainly
dont
drink
lambics
that
often
but
this
is
one
i
do
enjoy
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
much
to
sweet
just
like
à
cherry
candy
bottle
poured
a
deep
reddish
color
beer
with
a
huge
pink
color
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
cherry
is
dominant
with
light
tart
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
cherry
notes
with
light
tart
notes
also
discernable
and
quite
a
lot
of
sugar
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
i
know
syrup
is
used
in
there
and
i
know
this
is
not
brewed
as
per
traditional
ways
but
i
cant
help
but
fall
in
love
with
this
guilty
pleasure
each
time
i
drink
this
drinkability
is
good
as
well
i
wish
i
could
have
snuck
this
into
the
local
boston
market
and
had
it
with
my
chicken
but
then
again
i
could
have
brought
the
food
home
had
i
been
thinking
properly
this
is
a
superb
tasting
beer
mainly
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
for
that
same
reason
it
is
nice
only
on
occasions
plan
it
for
occasions
when
champagne
would
be
appropriate
sure
i
can
drink
it
its
just
that
i
feel
there
are
better
beers
even
within
the
lindemans
line
of
sweetened
lambics
still
overall
decent
for
what
it
is
im
still
not
sold
on
lambics
as
much
more
than
a
gimmick
but
i
may
just
for
shitzengiggle
buy
a
bottle
of
cantillon
from
my
local
total
wine
16
bucks
though
di
like
the
lambic
style
although
this
has
been
my
least
favorite
of
the
lindemans
lambic
ales
this
is
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
fuller
expression
of
the
sweet
cherries
in
the
taste
wish
it
werent
so
expensive
a
lovely
melange
of
sassy
cherry
fruit
and
sweet
grain
and
a
more
or
less
wellbalanced
dessert
in
a
glass
with
not
as
much
overt
sourness
as
many
other
belgian
kriek
offerings
i
can
surely
understand
the
popularity
of
this
particular
line
of
lambics
and
this
its
king
this
is
my
first
real
lambic
i
dont
think
sam
adams
cranberry
counts
does
it
anyway
very
sweet
and
fruity
obviously
a
strong
cherry
taste
and
smell
very
complex
and
easy
to
drink
im
not
sure
i
would
drink
this
often
but
its
good
for
a
change
of
pace
d
drinkability
is
good
but
a
bit
compromised
by
the
sweetness
great
tartness
for
a
dessert
beer
a
great
example
of
an
excellent
lambic
i
generally
cant
stand
major
fruit
or
other
flavor
additives
in
beer
beyond
the
traditional
elements
but
this
is
an
exception
nice
brew
can
be
sipped
on
its
own
or
the
heresy
ive
found
this
can
be
great
when
mixed
with
a
nice
neutral
lager
or
pilsner
in
any
event
this
stuff
makes
most
fruit
beers
that
aspire
to
the
style
seem
like
rubbish
anyway
in
order
to
properly
enjoy
this
you
need
to
acknowledge
it
for
what
it
is
which
is
something
like
a
dessert
beer
drink
this
at
the
proper
time
like
splitting
it
after
a
nice
dinner
and
you
can
appreciate
what
this
is
drinkability
yes
and
no
tastes
great
but
its
too
sweet
a
drink
for
me
personally
to
want
to
have
more
than
a
single
glass
d
this
is
a
beer
that
is
kinda
far
off
from
a
real
lambic
its
everywhere
cheap
and
tasty
for
beginners
i
can
enjoy
it
every
once
in
a
while
the
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
pink
head
the
aroma
is
extremely
sweet
cherry
with
no
real
sour
or
funk
qualities
the
flavor
is
very
heavy
on
the
cherry
tastes
a
lot
like
cherry
syrup
there
is
very
little
tartness
although
a
tad
bit
of
it
is
there
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
has
nothing
in
common
with
other
belgian
lambics
but
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
a
good
one
drinkability
overall
a
great
lambic
not
my
favorite
flavor
but
still
a
solid
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
d
a
very
decent
and
enjoyable
fruit
lambic
but
im
sure
its
considered
a
lightweight
by
big
fans
of
the
style
dreally
easy
drinking
the
tart
and
sour
notes
really
balance
off
the
sweet
cherry
notes
i
really
dont
understand
why
a
lot
of
people
tend
to
hate
on
lindemans
but
love
new
glarus
belgian
red
the
two
are
very
similar
to
my
palate
call
this
dessert
in
a
glass
mediumfull
body
medium
tight
effervescence
slightly
tangy
great
stuff
maynard
unfortunately
the
artificial
cough
syrup
analogy
persists
when
discussing
the
flavor
theres
no
way
around
it
the
flavor
is
severely
unbalanced
that
said
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
also
probably
not
worth
10
i
will
not
be
getting
it
again
simply
because
there
are
so
many
other
superior
options
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
i
would
probably
have
this
again
and
pair
it
with
a
sweet
dessert
lots
and
lots
of
tart
cherries
would
almost
be
too
tart
but
the
sweetness
balances
it
out
well
really
not
much
else
there
but
the
straight
forward
cherry
fruitiness
is
quite
nice
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
norm
notes
fair
lambic
a
bit
too
lost
in
the
fruit
blend
and
surely
not
even
remotely
offering
the
complexity
that
the
brewer
promotes
d
a
good
dessert
beer
would
go
really
well
with
a
slice
of
cherry
cheesecake
its
more
of
a
novelty
and
off
the
norm
but
for
6
dollars
a
12
oz
id
rather
get
something
i
really
liked
and
could
drink
a
few
of
the
sweet
cloying
nature
of
this
one
must
dull
my
palate
not
to
mention
could
probably
cause
some
serious
hangovers
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
pink
head
and
fairly
strong
carbonation
head
retention
is
decent
but
not
much
lacing
smell
is
very
sweet
and
laced
with
the
twinge
of
tart
cherries
they
cherries
and
sweetness
dominate
so
much
that
not
much
else
can
be
picked
up
on
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
sweet
with
plenty
of
tart
cherry
tang
that
really
dominates
the
palate
hardly
any
lactic
sour
or
musty
characteristics
it
is
pretty
much
all
about
sugary
sweetness
contrasting
with
the
sour
cherries
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
necessarily
but
this
is
definitely
not
the
most
complex
lambic
out
there
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
seems
a
little
less
sticky
than
a
lot
of
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
the
sugar
keeps
this
from
being
a
session
beer
but
it
is
drinkable
for
the
style
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
and
i
enjoy
it
more
than
most
of
their
other
fruit
lambic
offerings
drinkability
overall
a
good
lambic
this
is
my
least
favorite
that
ive
had
from
lindemans
but
its
still
worth
a
try
notes
sweet
lambic
similar
to
an
alcoholic
sour
cherry
koolaid
similar
to
other
lindemans
quite
sweet
with
a
bit
of
tartness
d
this
is
a
bit
sweettart
to
the
point
of
being
slightly
overwhelming
but
it
is
exceptionally
decadent
and
quite
delicious
it
is
a
great
beer
for
blending
as
well
and
better
to
be
overwhelmed
than
underwhelmed
this
was
a
very
easy
and
enjoyable
quaff
i
was
expecting
more
sour
and
less
fruitiness
but
i
enjoyed
this
nonetheless
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
this
beer
from
time
to
time
drinkability
not
what
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
it
was
just
too
sweet
of
a
beer
and
i
didnt
really
think
it
was
a
true
lambic
absolutely
no
funk
and
over
the
top
sweet
this
is
candy
not
beer
pours
a
clear
red
the
ver
definition
of
the
word
red
with
a
small
pinkishwhite
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
settles
to
a
thickness
of
a
thirdofafinger
the
smell
is
of
dry
fresh
cherries
with
a
sparkling
background
ive
no
other
way
to
say
that
the
taste
is
mostly
the
same
but
the
cherries
are
now
moist
fuller
more
pronounced
with
a
slight
hint
of
yeasty
earthiness
near
the
base
it
doesnt
sit
very
heavily
on
the
tongue
and
the
carbonation
is
light
and
unintrusive
making
for
a
highly
drinkable
and
highly
tasty
brew
the
appearance
is
bright
reddish
purple
with
a
thin
lighter
colored
head
the
smell
is
off
putting
not
because
of
the
cherry
but
the
quality
its
an
obviously
artificially
contrived
scent
reminiscent
of
ludens
cough
drops
the
taste
follows
sticky
sweet
cherry
soda
mixed
with
aspartame
the
aftertaste
of
this
sweetner
lingers
surprisingly
and
perhaps
disappointingly
there
is
not
much
sourness
here
ill
be
fair
and
keep
appearance
and
drinkability
at
the
average
mark
kool
aid
and
cheap
wine
coolers
are
big
sellers
this
is
easy
to
drink
with
no
big
boozy
taste
i
just
dont
know
why
anyone
would
opt
for
this
to
me
craft
beer
is
all
about
the
best
ingredients
not
artificial
crap
all
things
considered
its
not
a
bad
drop
to
drink
and
i
find
it
quite
a
cleansing
beer
it
comes
across
as
a
well
balanced
lambic
its
very
candylike
and
that
makes
it
really
unique
not
something
id
drink
every
day
but
its
something
id
happily
take
on
occasion
bottle
into
tulip
like
most
of
these
fruit
lambics
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
have
one
and
i
was
ready
pours
a
nice
redruby
color
withe
a
half
finger
pink
head
that
hung
on
longer
that
normal
and
left
strong
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
obviously
strong
with
cherry
but
i
also
detected
another
sweetness
in
there
honey
maybe
as
well
as
some
citrus
the
cherries
actually
reminded
me
a
little
of
the
ludens
cherry
cough
drops
i
had
as
a
kid
which
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
the
taste
was
very
sweet
from
the
cherries
but
they
were
not
overpowerling
a
slight
bite
at
the
finish
reminded
you
you
werent
drinking
juice
another
strong
offering
from
lindemans
pours
a
strong
purplish
red
color
body
with
an
average
sized
dark
pink
head
lasting
strong
sour
aroma
and
sweet
black
cherries
reminds
me
of
cherry
ice
cream
some
mustiness
too
nice
tart
taste
sweet
cherries
not
as
sweet
as
it
is
tart
and
sour
very
tasty
great
after
dinner
drink
especially
when
i
was
craving
something
sweet
strong
fruit
flavor
from
the
whole
fruit
mouth
puckering
not
super
complex
but
good
for
what
it
is
atmosphere
is
nice
really
solid
appearance
and
a
sweet
pleasing
fruity
nose
flavor
is
sour
cherry
and
a
little
grain
very
nice
for
a
special
occasion
but
not
something
youd
want
to
drink
too
much
of
could
be
a
little
cloying
overall
this
is
a
really
good
brew
pours
a
bright
and
glowing
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
and
lacy
red
head
sweet
cherry
aromas
fill
the
nose
and
the
highly
carbonated
brew
bubbles
out
a
seemingly
endless
supply
of
the
smell
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
very
very
cherry
there
is
also
a
tart
bite
within
the
mix
of
sweetness
and
fades
into
an
even
more
tart
flavor
in
the
finish
the
finish
comes
and
goes
quickly
as
the
light
body
and
very
high
carbonation
flow
away
notes
another
nice
fruit
lambic
offering
from
lindemans
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
lindemans
peche
and
not
as
winelike
or
lambiclike
as
their
cassis
its
not
a
lot
like
a
traditional
lambic
and
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
but
its
a
delicious
fruitflavored
beverage
nonetheless
i
will
undoubtedly
drink
this
again
as
a
special
treat
cheers
so
i
like
it
and
recommend
it
as
an
example
of
good

and
tart
light
lambic
sourness
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
a
tart
and
vinous
component
balancing
it
dry
finish
gives
a
very
nice
puckering
to
the
feel
which
is
quite
refreshing
still
there
is
a
light
syrup
texture
though
the
carbonation
does
a
nice
job
breaking
it
up
pretty
easy
drinking
just
a
touch
thick
for
quaffing
would
be
easy
to
have
several
with
a
meal
d
this
is
absolutely
excellent
though
i
didnt
enjoy
kriek
the
first
time
i
had
it
in
belgium
i
think
its
an
acquired
taste
and
gets
better
every
time
overall
im
aware
this
isnt
a
true
lambic
but
i
think
it
works
on
its
own
level
ill
probably
keep
a
bottle
around
for
when
the
mood
strikes
its
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
drinkability
theres
not
a
technical
fault
with
this
beer
but
perhaps
a
philosophical
one
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
is
overwhelming
but
seemingly
quite
intentional
my
preference
is
for
lambics
to
have
at
least
some
hint
of
beer
in
the
background
but
lindemans
approach
does
not
agree
with
mine
its
highly
drinkable
yes
but
is
it
a
good
example
of
a
lambic
im
not
so
sure
ill
split
the
difference
and
give
it

a
deep
cherry

with

smells
very

of

after

as
is
to
be
expected

but
it
is
a
pleasant
effect
the
mouthfeel
isnt
anything
too
special
the
flavors
do
not
linger
very
long
on
the
palate
far
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
and
even
getting
through
one
is
a
bit
difficult
for
me
for
a
kriek
its
not
bad
overall
very
one
dimensional
but
a
nice
desert
beer
d
if
you
like
them
fruity
drink
away
i
am
only
moderately
impressed
with
these
beers
they
are
basically
a
flavored
malt
beverage
they
are
quite
tasty
but
i
have
a
really
hard
time
spending
5
dollars
a
bottle
on
them
low
carbonation
surprisingly
with
a
light
body
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
low
midstrength
alcohol
level
makes
this
a
perfect
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
maybe
over
some
ice
maybe
if
it
was
cheaper
the
most
important
message
with
this
beer
is
to
drink
it
ice
cold
when
it
is
more
sour
more
carbonated
and
less
sweet
were
it
not
for
the
oversweetness
this
would
score
much
higher
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
one
big
flaw
really
lets
it
down
judging
by
some
of
the
old
reviews
i
think
this
one
has
been
dumbed
down
i
e
sweetened
up
for
the
masses
d
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
my
first
lambic
i
think
and
im
eager
to
try
the
other
lindemans
on
a
side
note
we
got
a
little
experimental
and
mixed
it
with
some
old
rasputin
this
was
fantastic
as
the
blend
was
a
chocolateycoffee
cherry
flavor
d
sweet
nice
and
crisp
very
refreshing
opinion
this
is
a
classic
beer
so
how
can
you
do
it
too
bad
this
example
has
a
bit
too
light
of
carbonation
probably
because
of
its
age
i
thought
that
the
age
would
help
mellow
out
the
in
your
face
cherry
that
this
beer
has
but
it
didnt
really
i
guess
this
beer
is
just
better
fresh
and
that
in
your
face
flavor
is
what
it
does
best
love
it
or
leave
it
i
prefer
some
of
the
other
kriek
beers
better
like
cantillon
or
even
liefmans
anyway
this
is
a
staple
beer
and
one
that
should
be
tried
especially
by
the
ladies
d
not
too
bad
the
cherry
can
be
quite
strong
at
first
but
after
a
few
sips
you
get
used
to
it
not
something
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
once
in
a
while
would
be
ok
excellent
dessert
beer
if
youve
been
holding
off
on
this
these
bottles
take
the
plunge
spend
a
couple
extra
bucks
and
taste
the
goodness
this
kriek
stands
on
its
own
because
it
is
unique
in
its
intense
fruitiness
i
happen
to
love
the
cherries
but
there
was
simply
too
much
sugary
sweetness
present
to
make
me
want
to
buy
another
i
have
no
complaints
with
this
kriek
lambic
it
is
what
it
is
and
is
done
well
although
not
outstanding
or
exceptional
great
as
a
dessert
beer
or
a
shared
nightcap
this
one
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
frothy
pink
head
the
smell
is
of
tart
cherries
with
some
sweet
notes
the
taste
is
exactly
the
same
sweet
cherry
yet
not
artificial
the
lambic
is
smooth
cannot
really
tell
that
it
has
any
alcohol
content
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
very
tasty
but
i
doubt
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
due
to
the
sweetness
worth
checking
out
enjoy
deep
red
with
pink
fizzy
head
has
a
cola
look
to
it
smeel
of
cherries
but
not
an
artificial
flavor
slightly
sourtart
upfront
but
smoothes
back
to
a
very
rich
cheery
flavornice
but
it
is
very
sweet
very
straightforward
flavornot
super
complex
this
sweetness
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
after
drinking
a
little
bit
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
poured
into
a
glass
red
color
with
slight
head
smells
like
cherries
tastes
pretty
good
a
bit
expensive
but
an
indulgence
thats
ok
once
in
a
while
the
fruit
flavor
seems
very
natural
i
dont
think
its
a
syrup
smells
like
a
wine
give
it

the
smell
does
need
to
be
overcome
which
causes
it
to
be
marked
down
just
a
little
bit
shared
a
bit
of
this
with
my
girlfriend
last
night
poured
a
nice
dark
red
color
with
huge
lace
and
amazing
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
full
of
cherries
taste
is
much
the
same
sweet
malt
background
and
huge
black
cherry
tartness
up
front
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
however
i
would
probably
only
have
one
of
these
at
a
time
since
its
not
really
my
style
very
good
this
lambic
was
tastier
than
it
smelled
i
did
not
expect
much
but
the
flavor
was
actually
pretty
good
a
lot
more
syrupy
and
sweeter
than
other
krieks
i
have
had
which
were
dominated
by
vinegary
tart
might
drink
again
though
worth
trying
very
tasty
i
must
say
only
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
sweet
d
1
bottle
onlyif
that
its
incredibly
sweet
and
sour
and
something
that
must
be
slowly
enjoyed
d
very
nice
fruit
centered
with
everything
else
playing
supporting
roles
not
overly
complex
but
some
decent
balance
between
the
cherries
and
balancing
earthiness
and
bitterness
the
taste
the
real
strength
is
far
better
the
start
is
mostly
sweet
cherry
but
this
soon
becomes
more
tart
and
dry
developing
into
a
nice
tartsweet
character
with
hints
of
sour
yeastiness
underneath
while
being
tingly
lively
and
light
its
quite
good
but
could
use
more
yeastiness
drinkability
a
very
light
refreshing
drink
that
i
would
suggest
be
complimented
by
a
dessert
certainly
nothing
that
should
stand
alone
however
it
should
be
used
in
supporting
role
with
some
type
of
food
i
will
certainly
try
this
and
other
varites
again
and
try
to
pair
it
with
a
corresponding
menu
item
i
tart
cherry
taste
with
a
sweet
finish
i
would
highly
suggest
warming
this
drink
up
before
serving
not
too
hot
you
dont
want
to
burn
the
alcohol
off
i
warmed
the
bottle
in
the
microwave
for
a
minute
or
2
you
could
also
stick
it
in
a
large
bowl
of
hot
water
to
warm
it
up
but
who
wants
to
wait
for
water
to
heat
up
not
me
try
it
youll
love
it
the
only
problem
with
this
beer
other
than
how
sweet
it
is
seems
to
be
that
you
can
suck
them
down
faster
than
you
can
open
or
afford
more
the
drinkability
is
good
and
the
right
food
pairing
with
this
brew
would
make
it
very
enjoyable
not
avery
sessional
beer
something
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
with
creme
brulee
or
cheese
cake
didnt
care
for
this
very
much
only
made
it
halfway
through
the
bottle
before
i
had
to
give
it
up
drinkability
good
dessert
beer
a
fat
piece
of
chocolate
cake
would
have
completed
it
this
stuff
is
classic
desert
beer
a
tremendous
brew
a
desert
beer
and
not
something
i
would
have
every
day
tasty
of
course
different
definitely
not
what
i
would
think
of
as
a
beer
but
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
d
drink
on
drink
on
but
for
many
these
sweet
lambics
are
a
favorite
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
call
it
beer
candy
it
is
a
fabulous
beer
and
a
terrific
rendition
of
the
lmabic
style
ive
had
the
new
glarus
belgian
red
which
is
also
sickeningly
sweet
but
it
is
also
mouth
puckeringly
sour
so
it
sorta
balances
out
750ml
capped
and
corked
green
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
rubyredburgundy
with
a
good
inch
of
pink
head
that
leaves
fairly
impressive
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
slowly
dissipates
smells
strongly
of
cherries
with
hints
of
a
funkiness
which
is
no
doubt
due
to
the
spontaneous
fermentation
tastes
strongly
of
cherries
too
with
a
sweetandsour
quality
from
the
funky
twang
hints
of
malt
toward
the
finish
slightly
on
the
dry
side
plenty
of
carbonation
helps
make
this
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
despite
its
flavor
complexity
and
fairly
full
mouthfeel
a
solid
beer
for
sure
and
my
favorite
lambic
ive
had
thus
far
really
hitting
the
spot
tonight
this
ones
hard
to
review
because
it
succeeds
in
everything
it
aspires
to
just
doesnt
really
do
it
in
a
complex
beery
sort
of
way
it
pours
a
light
redmaroon
color
with
a
thin
bit
of
head
on
top
looks
solid
nose
is
all
cherries
as
is
the
taste
my
sister
observed
it
basically
tastes
like
cherry
soda
with
a
little
alcohol
feel
is
fairly
thin
but
not
terrible
for
the
style
drinkability
is
based
on
if
you
like
that
cherry
flavor
or
not
personally
im
a
fan
of
fruit
juices
of
all
kinds
so
i
could
drink
a
fair
bit
of
this
i
just
wouldnt
think
of
it
as
beer
it
felt
nice
with
some
smooth
fizzyness
but
i
really
couldnt
drink
much
of
this
cherry
color
with
a
pink
head
good
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
of
ripe
black
cherries
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
get
a
little
more
complex
as
a
hint
of
tartness
rises
through
the
finish
like
other
lindemans
brews
not
super
complex
but
a
good
drinker
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
that
lack
any
acidity
drinkability
id
call
this
lambic
a
purely
dessert
beer
its
very
very
flavorful
and
absolutely
delicious
if
you
like
cherries
if
cherries
arent
your
thing
keep
moving
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
would
pick
up
on
occasion
to
change
things
ups
a
bit
d
very
easy
drinking
i
think
you
could
convince
a
novice
this
was
nonalcoholic
if
anything
limits
drinkability
its
the
sweetness
great
beer
for
people
who
hate
beer
ive
gotten
my
family
into
the
habit
of
drinking
lindemans
at
the
holidays
makes
it
much
more
bearable
this
beer
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
opaque
in
the
glass
it
had
a
light
pinkish
head
there
is
a
strong
cherry
smell
almost
like
a
juice
there
is
a
distinct
sweet
cherry
taste
that
is
pleasing
and
wellbalanced
with
a
sour
tartness
because
of
its
initial
sweetness
this
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
can
go
down
quickly
without
realizing
it
if
you
dont
remember
to
sip
and
enjoy
it
i
really
like
that
this
beer
can
be
enjoyed
any
time
of
the
day
and
makes
a
particularly
nice
breakfast
brew
12
oz

taste

tart

and

body

aftertaste

with

and

flavoring

thick
with

taste
in

end
heavy
carbonation
and
a
bit

i
love
cherries
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
syrupy
feel
to
it
seems
more
like
a
cherry
drink
with
some
beer
in
it
a
different
beer
but
half
a
bottle
is
all
i
can
take
this
one
poured
a
very
clear
deep
ruby
red
with
bright
pink
fine
bubbles
good
head
retention
with
solid
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
quite
strong
of
sweet
cherries
crossing
the
border
into
cough
syrup
territory
same
in
the
flavour
but
a
little
tartness
and
faint
bitterness
helped
cut
this
character
the
texture
was
alright
palate
coating
without
being
cloying
and
the
carbonation
was
quite
mild
a
fair
offering
but
nowhere
near
their
cassis
still
decent
for
the
style
worth
the
price
i
paid
as
well
this
has
also
been
one
of
the
few
beers
that
ive
been
able
to
get
nonbeer
drinkers
to
try
and
like
break
them
in
with
a
lambic
move
onto
some
other
less
sweet
fruit
beers
and
soon
enough
theyll
be
drinking
all
sorts
of
beer
after
i
unwrapped
the
foil
and
pulled
out
the
cork
the
beer
poured
into
my
sniffer
sported
a
clear
ruby
red
color
with
hints
of
purple
the
head
was
light
pink
and
there
was
heavy
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
with
sour
cherry
and
hints
of
wet
grains
and
alcohol
there
was
also
a
small
presence
of
spices
the
flavor
was
heavy
with
sweet
cherry
flavor
and
a
tart
undertone
without
the
subtle
graininess
showing
through
you
would
think
this
was
a
champagne
of
some
type
it
had
good
carbonation
with
a
smooth
barley
finish
there
was
very
minimal
hop
presence
i
paired
this
beer
with
babybel
cheese
and
it
really
accented
the
sourness
of
this
beer
all
together
this
really
was
an
amazing
beer
those
belgains
really
know
what
they
are

sip
d
this
is
a
staple
dessert
beer
at
our
home
with
its
medium
alcohol
content
and
sweet
goodness
goes
well
with
chocolate
okay
i
should
know
better
i
have
had
other
beer
if
you
could
call
it
that
by
lindemans
it
almost
tastes
like
cough
syrup
that
is
chilled
and
carbonated
my
mom
usually
does
not
drink
beer
so
on
the
advice
of
some
friends
i
bought
a
bottle
she
said
it
was
way
too
sweet
and
i
tend
to
agree
with
her
i
some
how
keep
trying
to
get
her
to
drink
beer
when
i
see
her
but
she
never
goes
for
it
and
this
one
did
not
seem
to
help
quite
enjoyable
albeit
certainly
a
luxury
item
out
here
the
medicinal
notes
also
cut
down
the
overall
drinkability
a
bit
uhoh
is
it

yesrobust
almost

but
not

kind
of

so
strange
to
have
such
a
drastic
swing
in
experiences
between
the
framboise
and
the
kriek
perhaps
in
between
both
is
the
better
review
but
this
kriek
seems
to
be
intruding
my
taste
buds
with
a
medicinal
taste
that
doesnt
leave
me
with
a
beer
experience
perhaps
a
future
rereviewer
pours
out
a
great
deep
red
color
with
a
slight
foamy
head
it
has
a
great
cherry
scent
as
well
as
a
great
cherry
flavoring
a
bit
sweet
for
me
as
far
as
beer
goes
but
it
is
an
excellent
desert
drink
or
desert
all
by
itself
goes
down
smoothly
if
a
little
thick
this
is
my
first
lambic
beer
im
surprised
it
is
so
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
it
tastes
nothing
like
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
i
tried
to
judge
it
based
on
the
experience
which
i
really
enjoyed
if
you
are
on
the
fence
about
trying
a
lambic
like
i
was
give
it
a
try
just
be
sure
to
pick
out
a
fruit
type
flavor
you
enjoy
because
it
dominates
the
flavor
d
chuggable
but
too
expensive
its
like
an
alcoholic
cherry
soda
with
the
added
complexity
of
wheat
barley
and
yeast
the
beautiful
thing
is
that
its
not
made
from
all
the
bullshit
cherry
soda
is
its
only
3
or
4
natural
ingredients
water
and
i
think
thats
freakin
sweet
i
never
really
thought
that
id
enjoy
lambics
but
have
come
to
find
that
they
are
indeed
enjoyable
poured
a
nice
pink
red
with
nice
carbonation
and
fizzy
short
lived
head
little
to
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
strongly
of
cherries
and
fruit
tastes
simliar
alcohol
is
hardly
detectable
and
the
fruity
fizzy
bevarge
goes
down
smooth
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
and
crisply
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
i
especially
enjoyed
it
when
i
mixed
it
with
stone
smoked
porter
the
cherries
and
chocolatecoffee
flavors
blended
absolutely
flawlessly
the
taste
is
so
very
black
cherry
though
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
thats
just
fine
by
me
the
finish
does
end
up
slightly
tart
but
that
just
makes
me
want
to
take
another
sip
it
has
a
medium
body
and
the
carbonation
is
light
its
very
drinkable
very
nice
dessert
beer
i
really
enjoy
the
fruit
beers
from
lindemans
this
is
an
exceptional
lambic
of
course
its
a
strong
tart
cherry
taste
but
it
is
fine
this
is
an
example
of
a
good
fruit
beer
fruit
beerbad
isnt
always
true
miller
chill
thats
bad
this
is
not
this
has
a
real
clear
and
present
chery
taste
but
it
isnt
juicy
jucy
juice
or
arbor
mist
overall
a
very
interesting
lambic
but
a
wee
bit
too
fruity
even
for
a
kreik
a
good
introduction
beer
for
this
specific
style
it
would
be
good
with
pie
and
ice
cream
d
very
soothing
on
a
hot
day
similar
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
good
lemonade
but
the
cherry
can
only
be
taken
for
so
long
d
a
very
sweet
lambic
but
good
drinkablility
a
pretty
classic
sweet
style
made
since
1811
i
would
prefer
more
acidity
and
dry
flavor
but
this
still
has
an
overall
good
taste
and
drinkability
makes
a
good
mix
w
troegs
oatmeal
stout
mixed
14
lambic
to
34
stout
i
found
i
would
guess
any
stout
would
do
but
i
like
the
hop
as
a
complement
to
the
lambics
sweetness
i
will
have
to
try
a
mix
w
sierra
nevada
and
the
framboise
taste
is
full
of
obviously
cherries
as
well
as
notes
of
biscuity
malts
sweettart
candies
and
a
bitter
unripened
vine
taste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
viscous
with
a
great
carbonation
level
and
a
superb
unripened
bitter
finish
quite
good
but
not
as
fullbodied
or
complex
as
lindemans
framboise
black
cheery
pie
is
what
this
is
delicious
and
intense
black
cheery
pie
with
out
the
crust
lambic
beer
is
on
the
label
black
cheery
pie
is
what
is
on
the
inside
very
sweet
but
mixes
the
sweet
with
the
traditional
sourness
one
to
have
now
and
again
but
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
a
regular
beer
in
my
fridge
d
i
could
throw
this
stuff
down
constantly
nice
and
easy
to
drink
and
damn
tasty
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
a
standard
lawnmower
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
really
refreshing
i
have
to
admit
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
drinking
this
all
the
time
is
the
price
however
if
i
ever
win
the
lottery
this
becomes
my
chosen
breakfast
drink
pomegranite
color
with
a
low
pink
head
aroma
of
marischino
cherries
and
sweet
tarts
flavor
is
initially
sweet
with
understated
cherry
flavors
its
just
a
tad
sweet
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
not
overdone
not
overpowering
it
loses
some
appeal
as
i
get
deeper
into
the
glass
and
it
starts
to
remind
me
of
cough
drops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
somewhat
tannic
with
a
powdery
feel
overall
a
nice
cherry
soda
but
not
what
i
would
reach
for
when
i
want
a
beer
my
wife
however
has
fallen
in
love
with
the
whole
line
of
lindemans
a
very
nice
lindemans
offering
better
than
its
peach
variation
given
the
higher
tartness
and
acidity
pours
out
a
cloudy
red
kool
aid
color
with
a
thin
pink
head
that
doesnt
hold
up
too
well
no
lacing
smells
like
cherry
pixie
stick
poured
into
a
mix
of
cherry
cough
syrup
and
cherry
freezer
pop
way
too
sweet
and
artificial
smelling
with
no
real
lambic
characteristics
the
cough
medicine
aspect
is
pretty
well
absent
in
the
flavor
thankfully
but
the
pixie
stick
and
flavrice
or
whatever
is
still
there
in
abundance
really
sweet
and
artificial
tasting
but
has
a
bit
of
a
tart
edge
towards
the
middle
that
lasts
to
the
finish
which
then
holds
some
hints
at
lambic
funk
but
it
is
drowned
out
by
the
sugar
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
and
syrupy
and
has
a
spritzy
carbonation
this
is
really
too
sweet
to
enjoy
fully
especially
since
i
know
in
the
back
of
my
head
that
for
the
exact
same
price
one
can
have
a
really
good
traditional
lambic
that
isnt
cut
with
other
stuff
to
make
it
more
accessible
and
boring
overall
this
is
like
someone
mixed
some
raspberry
cordial
in
with
my
beer
not
bad
altogether
but
not
what
i
would
call
a
good
lambic
look
before
i
get
a
backlash
realize
i
dont
consider
this
a
beer
its
a
malt
beverage
unlike
malt
beverages
of
today
this
brew
doesnt
use
high
fructose
corn
syrup
artificial
colors
natural
and
artificial
flavors
or
add
any
extra
carbonation
beer
is
more
on
the
salty
side
of
the
taste
buds
generally
and
my
dad
would
hate
this
stuff
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
i
respect
and
admire
this
brew
and
would
drink
it
everyday
if
i
could
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
a
malt
beverage
and
the
good
ingredients
and
exceptional
brewing
methods
leave
me
with
a
tremendous
respect
for
this
brew
who
could
have
gone
done
the
highfructose
highway
a
long
time
ago
cheers
to
the
employees
and
brew
masters
at
brouwerij
lindemans
d
good
i
will
definitely
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
sessioning
although
the
crisp
tartness
makes
it
very
drinkable
for
the
sugar
level
drinkability
750
ml
is
a
bit
much
but
i
did
enjoy
it
in
its
entirety
if
you
enjoy
the
sweetsour
flavor
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
made
a
raspberry
tart
for
dessert
i
wanted
sour
cherries
but
they
are
not
in
season
unfortunately
i
didnt
have
a
framboise
in
the
fridge
and
this
beer
complemented
the
dessert
very
well
a
great
alternative
to
champagne
as
well
i
have
drank
this
on
new
years
eve
more
than
once
overall
i
thought
this
brew
was
alittle
off
the
strong
vinegar
scent
and
taste
reminded
me
off
drinking
kambuca
a
fermented
tea
drink
drank
in
south
america
and
japan
pours
a
relipstick
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
pink
head
almost
overflowed
from
my
champagne
flute
the
aroma
was
cherry
juice
while
in
the
distant
countryside
could
smell
some
stale
hops
in
this
one
the
taste
was
a
fizzy
cherry
bomb
with
some
slight
herbal
funk
and
a
very
mild
tart
finish
great
sipping
beer
while
watching
a
movie
after
dinner
a
delightful
beverage
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
fruity
and
sweet
feared
drinking
this
sour
beer
and
found
it
not
sour
enough
for
my
taste
from
tullys
store
in
wells
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
that
forms
a
head
with
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
is
hardly
noticeable
a
bit
like
cherries
tastes
definetly
like
black
cherries
can
barely
tell
its
beer
but
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
lighly
carbonated
lightly
coats
the
inside
of
the
mouth
but
is
nice
going
down
overall
a
real
nice
beer
doesnt
seem
like
so
much
a
beer
but
a
carbonated
fruit
drink
but
not
too
sweet
thanks
to
my
wife
jessica
her
first
review
a
750
ml
bottle
costing
9
45
at
the
north
coast
coop
in
eureka
ca
poured
a
beautiful
red
color
with
a
pink
head
that
lasted
a
long
time
and
left
wonderful
lacing
big
nose
of
cherry
and
a
touch
of
yeast
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
with
remarkable
smoothness
flavor
is
of
cherry
of
course
with
a
small
bit
of
tartness
underlying
the
sweetness
that
stays
all
the
way
to
the
finish
an
outstanding
example
of
its
type
i
am
realing
a
lot
of
my
ratings
are
up
in
the
4
range
these
days
but
i
am
running
into
a
lot
of
really
nice
brews
especially
those
from
belgium
kriek
gives
off
aromas
full
of
cherry
fragrances
it
pours
like
a
soda
and
looks
like
one
too
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
creates
a
thin
sticky
looking
head
it
really
looks
like
a
colored
champagne
this
tastes
like
a
soft
drink
as
well
very
full
of
tart
cherry
flavor
and
not
much
else
this
is
refreshing
and
ill
have
to
try
out
some
other
lambics
so
i
can
get
a
basis
for
comparison
d
good
beer
but
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
the
750ml
bottle
was
plenty
at
one
sitting
translucent
ruby
color
got
a
good
head
with
a
hard
pour
that
retained
decently
a
think
layer
of
head
remains
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
a
fruit
juice
cherries
and
strawberries
dominate
faint
yeasty
smell
too
sweet
but
okay
the
taste
is
still
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
as
much
as
the
smell
would
indicate
which
is
a
good
thing
the
sourness
from
the
wild
yeast
dominates
with
the
cherry
flavor
rounding
out
the
taste
heavy
bodied
with
carbonation
that
trickles
all
the
way
down
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
two
but
nice
though
i
prefer
the
framboise
more
gets
much
above
5
this
beer
was
quite
fruity
but
it
reminded
me
too
much
of
halls
cough
drops
for
me
i
liked
the
creamy
texture
of
it
and
the
color
was
rich
and
dark
id
have
to
take
the
raspberry
over
this
one
though
this
beer
is
definitely
not
on
my
favourite
lambic
beer
list
aroma
is
strong
cherry
very
small
head
which
dissapears
rapidly
overall
appearance
is
a
very
dark
red
in
color
somewhat
hazy
flavor
is
a
very
tart
cherry
with
just
a
slight
bite
of
an
aftertaste
moderate
carbonation
and
bubbly
goes
down
somewhat
smooth
this
is
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
this
is
something
my
wife
likes
so
i
would
drink
this
occaisionally
good
beer
to
enjoy
after
dinner
with
a
chocolate
dessert
or
to
convert
the
wife
from
wine
to
beer
the
only
problem
is
that
a
case
of
this
is
109
99
where
i
live
it
is
over
10
00bottle
its
good
but
not
that
good
not
really
that
great
the
kind
of
beer
that
youd
want
to
reccommend
to
that
girlfriend
who
just
has
no
interest
in
learning
anything
about
beer
but
that
would
at
least
allow
you
to
steer
her
away
from
bartles
james
cheers
drinkability
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
again
and
there
are
better
lambics
out
there
if
i
want
overpowering
sweetness
drinkability
overall
good
if
it
were
my
only
option
i
could
see
myself
easily
having
one
or
easily
passing
i
think
im
just
not
a
fan
of
cherry
drinkability
this
is
a
very
sippable
beer
to
enjoy
as
a
substitute
for
a
glass
of
wine
i
would
not
however
be
able
to
drink
bottles
of
this
without
something
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
that
accrued
in
my
mouth
after
a
while
that
said
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
a
fruit
beer
and
far
less
sweet
than
i
expected
and
not
at
all
offensive
i
would
definitely
stock
a
few
bottles
of
this
at
home
and
i
anticipate
that
i
will
want
to
try
it
again
soon
i
dont
see
how
anyone
couldnt
give
this
a
five
in
drinkability
cheers
i
recommend
having
this
one
with
a
loved
one
over
candles
on
a
romantic
evening
in
place
of
wine
or
champagne
d
this
is
just
about
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
unless
you
dont
like
sweet
stuff
its
more
like
having
a
sugary
soda
than
a
beer
taste
was
slightly
sour
with
very
strong
cherries
to
the
fore
and
a
slightly
malty
undertone
definitely
a
lambic
flavor
you
can
tell
it
was
wild
yeast
a
pure
delight
to
be
enjoyed
with
breakfast
a
special
holiday
after
dessert
treat
or
just
because
its
so
enjoyable
pours
a
very
deep
red
color
with
a
pink
head
smell
has
none
of
the
usuall
lambic
funk
that
i
expected
instead
it
smells
sugary
sweet
taste
is
way
too
sweet
with
none
of
the
expected
sourness
at
all
very
strong
cherry
tasting
almost
as
if
a
sugary
cherry
syrup
had
been
used
and
not
real
cherries
mouthfeel
is
lacking
on
carbination
drinkable
but
there
are
better
lambics
out
there
if
i
didnt
adore
the
taste
of
cherry
i
could
have
really
ripped
this
beer
up
for
the
excessive
sweetness
this
is
without
question
a
dessert
beer
i
would
suggest
pouring
this
over
vanilla
ice
cream
as
cherry
syrup
355ml
bottle
dang
and
with
a
cork
had
a
frenzied
search
all
over
the
house
but
found
a
cork
screw
phew
in
appearance
dark
red
almost
purple
lambic
light
pink
head
dense
and
bubbly
very
pleasant
aroma
of
wild
black
cherry
slightly
sherberty
starts
sweet
cherry
creme
then
i
get
the
tartness
ends
very
sour
and
very
nice
lovelly
on
the
palate
very
smooth
and
not
overcarbonated
even
creamy
at
times
very
nice
drink
i
have
not
had
much
lambics
but
this
was
different
and
a
treat
drinkability
easy
to
drink
loved
it
will
have
more
if
i
can
afford
it
poured
into
a
champagne
flute
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
slight
pink
head
forming
the
strong
scent
of
cherries
dominates
the
aroma
but
there
are
hints
of
malt
and
a
grassy
aromas
present
the
taste
almost
makes
you
wonder
if
this
a
beer
the
cherries
sweet
and
tangy
taste
dominates
the
palate
with
hints
of
malt
there
to
remind
you
that
it
is
a
beer
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
is
very
strong
but
a
nice
dry
finish
after
every
swallow
this
a
dessert
beer
particularly
something
chocolate
this
is
a
beer
i
get
mixed
drink
friends
to
try
mostly
women
they
try
and
can
not
beleive
it
is
a
beer
high
ratings
here
represent
having
one
glass
of
this
as
any
more
would
be
entirely
too
much
causing
the
experience
to
diminish
in
all
areas
i
made
the
mistake
of
refilling
my
flute
and
instantly
regretted
it
my
second
glass
was
even
more
tart
than
the
first
in
this
way
it
requires
chocolate
or
something
to
cut
it
and
it
started
leaving
this
odd
film
in
my
mouth
second
glass
was
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
first
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
thin
to
medium
pinkish
head
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
smelled
like
cherries
sweet
and
tart
tasted
like
cherries
sweet
and
tart
actually
almost
had
a
cherry
cokelike
taste
to
it
but
in
a
good
way
very
pleasing
to
the
palate
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
but
could
imagine
drinking
the
stuff
could
get
old
after
a
while
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
dessert
especially
if
it
is
chocolate
enjoy
edit
its
almost
a
different
style
than
boon
or
cantillon
like
a
cross
between
a
fruit
lambic
and
a
faro
i
like
lindemans
lambics
and
always
will
but
they
are
definitely
a
different
animal
an
extremely
nice
beer
probably
my
favorite
of
the
lindemans
lambics
i
see
my
tastes
have
changed
since
2003
from
my
eailier
review
interesting
overall
another
great
tasting
fruit
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
not
an
everyday
beer
but
sometimes
something
like
this
could
really
hit
the
spot
lots
of
lace
and
reddish
colour
with
lace
and
a
good
head
cherry
aroma
though
sugary
sweet
and
that
is
the
taste
its
refreshing
but
oh
way
too
sweet
sourness
midsip
would
would
like
much
more
a
transition
to
this
style
beer
sampled
at
coles
belgian
beer
fest
d
i
like
it
very
tasty
and
a
cool
change
of
pace
this
cherry
lambic
pours
a
nice
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
moderatley
sized
and
short
lasting
head
as
noted
by
other
reveiwers
there
is
definitely
a
medicinal
quality
to
the
smell
reminescent
of
cherry
cough
syrup
or
drops
the
taste
diverges
only
slightly
from
the
smell
in
being
nicely
sweet
and
fruity
but
with
a
medicinal
flavoring
a
rather
nice
mouthfeel
although
there
is
a
minor
medicinal
adherence
to
the
tongue
if
you
can
get
past
the
reminescence
of
cherry
cough
medicine
you
wont
be
let
down
by
this
beverage
paired
well
with
chocolate
d
very
good
dessert
beer
and
a
great
way
to
finish
off
a
long
evening
of
stouts
and
winter
ales
this
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
fresh
and
clean
the
extreme
sweetness
limits
amount
that
can
be
consumed
at
a
time
but
overall
an
enjoyable
dessert
beer
and
worth
drinking
again
d
not
too
drinkable
for
my
taste
but
fans
of
lambics
will
enjoy
it
my
fiancee
who
drinks
lambics
but
no
other
type
of
beer
prefers
lindemans
framboise
to
this
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
sweet
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
would
be
low
for
me
as
the
sweetness
would
get
old
in
a
hurry
a
decent
beer
to
have
one
of
for
dessert
or
to
compliment
something
sweet
bright
red
color
with
a
smallish
fizzy
pink
head
smell
reminds
me
of
new
glarus
belgian
red
which
i
didnt
like
cherry
fruit
gushers
wheres
that
lambic
quality
its
also
missing
in
the
taste
theres
just
a
lot
of
juicy
sweetness
to
it
it
tastes
like
cherry
juice
a
bit
syruppy
finish
is
drier
though
which
makes
it
somewhat
drinkable
i
guess
i
just
dont
care
for
cherry
beers
too
much
but
this
seems
to
have
almost
no
lambic
qualities
drinkability
save
this
one
for
after
dinner
probably
would
really
go
good
with
some
chocolate
covered
cherries
overall
tasty
but
not
a
gussler
wow
a
treat
for
the
senses
aromas
hit
the
nose
hard
with
dark
black
cherry
fruitiness
sweetness
and
tartness
rich
and
complex
even
at
the
first
whiff
looks
thick
rich
and
maroon
with
a
haze
and
good
retention
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
but
suitable
for
the
style
tastes
rich
and
sweet
with
a
probably
good
dose
of
malt
but
hiding
behind
the
cherries
nearly
cloying
tart
and
lightly
sour
across
the
toung
and
in
the
jawsjust
enough
to
savor
every
sip
and
deter
slamming
it
down
thick
smooth
texture
with
a
mild
astingency
in
the
finish
ends
with
a
big
sweetness
and
lingering
tartness
this
beer
poured
a
light
ruby
color
with
very
little
head
it
was
very
carbonated
its
aroma
was
like
cherry
juice
this
was
a
very
sweet
beer
it
tastes
more
like
a
sparkling
wine
than
a
normal
beer
as
well
as
a
cherry
flavor
it
also
had
hints
of
hibiscus
tea
and
a
slightly
tart
finish
overall
it
was
tasty
and
refreshing
and
generaly
enjoyable
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
even
though
its
one
of
my
less
favorite
styles
this
is
a
wonderful
aperitif
that
id
love
to
serve
with
a
vegetabledriven
appetizer
im
not
sure
that
the
flavors
would
allow
much
more
than
a
predinner
cocktail
for
total
quantity
to
be
consumed
but
overall
this
brew
is
exemplary
drinkability
the
only
drawback
is
that
could
get
to
be
too
sweet
otherwise
this
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
lambic
one
end
of
the
extremes
lindemanssweet
liefmanssour
also
of
note
i
reviewed
this
after
reviewing
the
de
ranke
kriek
earlier
the
same
evening
i
went
back
to
the
de
ranke
after
a
glass
of
this
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
beer
so
sweet
rather
than
sour
sourtart
notes
are
there
but
overpowered
by
sweet
fruit
namely
cherries
overall
a
nice
tasting
brew
but
this
could
get
old
fast
as
the
sweetness
lingers
and
is
syrupy
drinkability
awfully
hard
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
sweet
stuff
im
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
but
the
sweetness
of
this
offstyle
lambic
doesnt
do
it
for
me
either
ever
had
a
ludens
cherry
cough
drop
if
you
answered
yes
then
you
know
exactly
what
this
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
none
of
the
tartness
that
i
cherish
in
cherry
beers
is
more
then
faintly
present
here
this
one
is
pure
sweet
cherries
and
syrup
its
very
medicinal
not
quite
to
the
point
where
it
would
resemble
cough
syrup
but
close
i
find
this
to
be
too
sweet
and
artificial
tasting
for
me
i
also
think
that
the
head
could
be
more
impressive
and
the
aromas
bigger
overall
i
think
that
this
might
do
well
as
a
desert
beer
for
women
with
sweet
teeth
but
otherwise
its
pretty
mediocre
this
is
drinkable
but
the
price
will
likely
keep
me
from
trying
lindemans
other
offerings
this
is
my
first
kriek
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
if
you
like
sweet
liquor
type
beers
youll
love
this
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
you
can
definitely
sense
the
craftsmanship
and
quality
involved
worth
a
shot
if
youve
got
the
bucks
pours
red
with
a
hint
of
orange
with
a
slight
haze
the
head
is
a
frosty
white
that
leaves
a
slight
lacing
smells
of
cough
drops
and
cherry
life
savers
with
a
pungent
yeasty
sourness
tastes
like
cherries
and
red
grapes
with
a
sharp
sourness
with
some
musky
yeast
mouth
feel
is
light
but
a
bit
sticky
with
a
slight
small
bubble
carbonation
the
smell
is
the
biggest
turn
off
here
but
its
not
too
bad
over
all
joey
the
taste
has
an
over
the
top
sweetness
to
it
that
really
just
dominates
this
beer
in
both
palate
and
flavor
there
is
a
strong
cherry
note
as
well
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
cherry
skin
complexity
thrown
in
as
well
but
overall
this
does
not
even
have
the
fruit
character
that
the
lindemans
framboise
has
simplistic
and
straight
forward
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
easier
to
drink
than
the
framboise
but
i
do
like
cherries
better
than
raspberries
there
is
also
a
bit
of
tartness
in
the
finish
here
but
this
wisp
of
a
flavor
is
all
that
says
that
this
might
be
something
that
is
lambic
base
this
brew
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
large
pink
head
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
cherry
coke
but
with
more
bit
to
it
the
taste
is
strong
damn
strong
cherries
are
everywhere
drowning
out
any
other
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
brew
bores
me
i
simply
cant
see
myself
drinking
a
beer
with
such
a
simple
flavor
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
love
to
endulge
on
special
ocassions
great
lambic
and
overall
teriffic
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
juicy
with
an
almost
negligible
amount
of
carbonation
taste
kind
of
reminds
me
of
flavored
soda
not
bad
but
considering
the
cost
there
are
plenty
of
other
tastier
brews
i
could
have
bought
dark
redpurple
color
with
a
very
pink
very
large
head
that
fills
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
top
of
a
16
oz
challice
smell
is
sweet
cherry
but
not
candylike
whatsoever
taste
is
also
cherry
tart
and
sweet
but
much
less
than
the
other
lindemans
i
have
tried
lots
of
cherry
and
a
wheaty
flavor
very
clean
and
delicious
good
well
carbonated
body
very
good
notes
my
wife
loves
this
flavor
so
weve
tried
this
several
times
its
fun
but
not
my
type
of
beer
only
had
a
355ml
starter
bottle
was
nervous
about
not
liking
it

but
will
be
getting
a
big
bomber
next
time
as
the
daughter
and
wife
both
enjoyed
their
little
pulls
off
my
glass
smooth
and
satisfactory
this
is
a
nice
introduction
into
the
funky
world
of
lambics
i
enjoy
this
beer
immensely
appearance
is
a
cloudy
burgundy
with
a
huh
pink
head
of
foam
that
descends
into
nice
lacing
aroma
has
sweet
with
sour
cherries
and
sweettarts
body
is
too
light
carbonation
though
is
good
initial
flavor
is
composed
of
sweet
bing
cherries
and
that
settle
into
tart
bitterness
might
go
well
with
cherries
jubilee
the
cherry
sweetness
is
much
enjoyed
at
the
beginning
but
becomes
a
little
intense
towards
the
end
definately
see
this
becoming
a
must
have
on
some
bigger
cities
clubs
menus
i
think
i
will
grab
an
straight
up
lambic
or
guezue
next
time
i
am
at
the
store
not
a
beer
for
anyone
who
doesnt
enjoy
cherries
this
has
cherry

wonderful
paired

this
is
almost
like
a

tastier
even
to
nonbeer
drinkers
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
for
dessert
or
a
special
occasionanyone
who
likes
cherry
will
like
this
beer

to
be

a
killer
beertheres
a
great
balance
between
the

and
beer
itself
not
overly
sweet
this
is
what
a
wine
cooler
should
be
malt
based
beverage
my
ass
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
even
though
this
is
my
first
fruit
lambic
review
this
is
not
the
first
lambic
i
have
had
i
think
that
the
framboise
from
lindemans
is
a
little
bit
better
but
this
is
still
definitely
good
slàinte
i
really
like
this
beer
and
while
it
is
a
little
over
sweet
it
doesnt
kill
the
flavors
of
the
bright
cherries
laced
with
the
yeasty
funkness
of
the
lambic
the
color
is
of
marichino
cherry
juice
and
it
has
a
pink
head
that
settles
to
foam
gobs
on
top
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
of
dark
tart
cherries
a
taste
easily
recognized
it
is
not
medicine
like
at
all
it
is
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
fresh
crisp
and
tart
cherrys
nothing
medicineesque
at
all
in
this
lambic
ive
had
a
few
lambics
from
lesser
breweries
in
the
past
that
have
tasted
very
unnatural
but
this
is
real
fruit
all
the
way
very
refreshing
comments
what
a
change
this
beer
is
from
just
about
any
other
kind
of
beer
really
very
sweet
i
could
like
to
see
a
lambic
with
more
tartness
just
so
i
have
a
better
basis
upon
which
to
judge
this
style
waf
a
big
dense
bubblegumpink
head
deep
deep
clear
red
beer
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
spicy
and
packed
with
cherries
sugarsweet
with
some
lambic
tartness
the
front
is
tart
but
dominated
by
sweet
cherries
the
middle
is
thick
and
syrupy
cinnamon
and
cherries
more
sweet
cherries
in
the
finish
with
some
tartness
and
spice
its
a
nice
enough
beer
too
sweet
for
me
but
not
as
bad
as
the
framboise
quite
spicycinnamony
like
red
hots
but
not
hot
there
are
some
decent
lambic
flavors
its
not
much
like
beer
but
its
a
lot
better
than
cherry
soda
should
be
great
with
desert
or
for
desert
or
to
share
with
a
friend
alcoholic
cranberry
juice
and
i
like
cranberry
juice
pours
red
wierd
to
see
with
a
slight
redtinged
head
the
aroma
is
cranberries
the
taste
is
all
cranberries
and
raspberries
makes
me
pucker
up
like
it
is
a
lime
too
i
can
see
having
a
couple
of
these
in
the
summer
really
quite
good
and
refreshing
the
finish
is
of
slight
carbonation
and
a
bit
sour
like
a
sour
patch
kid
if
you
like
the
lindemans
line
of
lambics
this
is
one
of
the
top
beers
in
that
category
pours
a
brilliant
red
color
with
a
good
head
aroma
is
naturally
of
cherries
tart
dry
straightfromthetree
cherries
flavor
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
framboise
but
still
not
overpowering
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
sour
a
quality
brew
from
lindemans
oelergud
pours
a
ruby

color
with
a
nice
pink
head
and
very
good
lace
smell
of

some

aromas
also
come
through
tatse
is
of
sour
cherry
with
some
yeast
notes
coming
through
dare
i
say
that
it
reminds
me
of
a
gulp
wine
cooler
except
that
it
also
has
a
subtle
yeastiness
to
it
it
is
crisp
dry
and
somewhat
refreshing
give
it
a
try
just
for
something
different
drinkability
and
overall
a
lambic
is
always
a
good
choice
hard
to
find
a
bad
lambic
but
some
of
them
arent
as
good
as
others
and
unfortunately
this
one
isnt
as
phenomenal
as
lambic
could
be
its
still
a
great
offering
and
one
id
love
to
have
again
this
very
different
brew
poured
almost
blood
red
like
fruit
punch
with
a
well
formed
frizzy
pink
head
the
odor
consists
of
a
pure
black
cherry
feel
whew
it
is
certainly
very
tart
on
contact
makes
you
jump
back
a
bit
the
black
cherry
is
potent
and
all
consuming
the
finish
is
sugary
sweet
that
is
complemented
by
a
quick
clean
sour
edge
it
is
quite
a
concept
and
a
lovely
beer
for
sipping
it
is
one
to
relax
and
enjoy
pours
a
murky
red
with
a
bright
pink
head
smells
like
cherries
almost
to
the
point
of
being
like
artificially
flavored
sweet
cough
syrup
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
slight
tartness
i
cant
tell
if
its
from
the
lambic
or
from
sour
cherries
it
does
not
have
a
pronounced
lambic
sour
astringency
its
ok
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
exciting
to
me
its
not
beer
it
may
be
a
good
slightly
alcoholic
cherry
drink
but
its
not
beer
to
me
my
girlfriend
likes
it
so
its
ok
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
slightly
pink
head
cherries
evident
in
the
aroma
but
with
spices
and
wisps
of
hops
very
pleasing
i
was
happy
that
this
was
more
beerlike
than
the
framboise
cherry
sweet
tart
candy
in
the
taste
followed
by
super
pucking
tartness
lingers
forever
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
could
see
serving
this
to
unknowing
guests
after
dinner
and
them
really
enjoying
it
very
accessible
pours
cherry
red
go
figure
deep
pretty
color
not
much
head
at
all
moderately
carbonated
taste
is
well
cherries
lots
and
lots
of
cherries
a
natural
sweetness
with
the
cherry
tart
it
isnt
too
tart
though
a
little
too
sweet
if
you
want
a
real
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
your
option
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
unique
and
with
lots
of
character
go
with
this
my
first
lambic
very
interesting
color
is
cherry
red
with
a
pink
ice
cream
soda
like
head
smell
is
just
a
bit
odd
i
got
the
cherries
but
there
was
a
tad
of
mustiness
present
taste
is
very
nice
initially
sweet
cherry
then
a
pleasant
tartness
on
the
finish
hmm
is
this
a
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
nice
tartness
extremely
easy
to
drink
reminded
me
a
tad
of
the
flavored
malt
beverages
but
witha
distinctly
higher
quality
will
definitely
try
their
other
offerings
reflection
i
usually
dont
like
cherry
flavored
anything
bad
cough
syrup
experience
as
a
kid
but
this
beer
is
one
i
plan
on
having
again
and
again
this
stuff
is
growing
on
me
i
think
my
taste
buds
have
adjusted
and
im
liking
these
style
brews
more
and
more
scarry
stuff
anyway
this
pours
out
of
the
corked
capped
and
foiled
bottle
with
no
freshness
dating
its
a
plummy
shade
of
cherry
nose
is
sweet
and
fruityleaves
some
light
and
well
dispersed
lacing
taste
is
just
about
right
between
tart
and
sweet
fruity
sticky
on
the
lips
light
and
refreshing
went
great
with
a
salad
this
evening
give
these
lambics
a
try
they
are
nicely
crafted
interesting
complex
beverages
poured
a
sweet
looking
dark
red
color
with
a
white
head
that
lasted
until
the
end
and
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
course
of
cherries
the
taste
again
was
of
black
cherries
and
some
sour
ones
too
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
decent
with
a
slight
syrupy
feel
and
decent
carbonatoin
the
slight
tartness
was
nice
overall
i
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
decent
offering
a
great
starting
point
for
exposing
others
to
the
world
of
good
beer
this
is
a
beer
i
like
to
whip
out
on
the
uninitiated
to
expand
their
horizons
of
beer
even
people
that
dont
like
beer
much
appreciate
the
character
and
easiness
of
lkl
except
for
the
slight
sourness
at
the
end
this
lacks
most
of
the
characteristic
flavors
associated
with
lambics
but
its
still
a
very
tasty
beer
far
better
than
most
american
fruit
beers
the
taste
i
was
pleased
by
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
medicine
like
the
smell
at
all
it
was
of
dark
ripe
cherries
with
a
slight
sour
aftertatste
that
left
the
mouth
watering
for
more
i
can
no
longer
convince
my
wife
to
taste
or
even
smell
beer
after
some
unfortunate
though
well
meaning
attempts
on
my
part
to
bring
her
gently
into
the
beer
lovers
fold
she
loves
cherry
flavored
everything
and
has
a
sweet
tooth
so
perhaps
if
i
had
started
with
lindemans
kriek
shed
be
better
able
to
share
my
passion
for
beer
in
others
words
chicksll
dig
this
stuff
the
acid
in
the
beer
makes
my
tongue
a
little
raw
after
a
while
so
it
suffers
on
drinkability
this
is
a
dessert
beer
nothing
else
in
my
opinion
its
tart
cherry
flavour
would
go
very
well
with
chocolate
cake
i
could
see
it
mixed
with
a
stout
or
a
porter
for
something
a
little
more
fun
still
this
is
one
of
the
better
krieks
available
also
very
suitable
as
a
desert
beer
recommended
this
can
in
the
smaller
12oz
bottle
i
believe
that
was
capped
and
corked
deep
cherry
red
body
with
a
good
sized
pinkish
head
of
foam
the
head
dropped
quickly
leaving
scattered
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
was
of
sweet
cherries
with
some
vinous
characteristics
very
similar
to
the
smell
was
the
taste
with
sweet
cherries
over
a
bit
of
tartness
the
sweetness
became
a
little
too
much
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
mouth
was
medium
with
a
bit
of
over
carbonation
fizziness
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
something
i
could
have
too
many
of
enough
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
pink
wispy
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
cherries
and
oakyness
the
taste
is
almost
entirely
of
cherries
with
some
tartness
but
definitely
not
enough
theres
also
iron
oak
and
sacharine
sweetness
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
of
sweetish
cherries
an
ok
lambic
but
not
nearly
sour
or
tart
enough
maybe
i
got
an
old
or
bad
bottle
taste
is
very
sweet
some
tartness
from
the
cherries
but
mostly
its
cherry
sweetness
some
sour
yeastiness
sticky
sweet
mouth
i
prefer
lindemans
framboise
instead
of
this
more
balanced
and
understated
sweetness
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
dessertafterdinner

wife
loves
it
by
the
way
cloudy
pinkish

light
pinkish
white
head
that
turns
into
a

but
remain
satisfying
to
look
at
explosion
of

in
the
nose
extreme
sweetness
that
approaches
vanilla
very
mild
wheat
acidity
but
seriously
too
sweet
to
refresh
cloying
finish
lively
carbonation
medium
soft
body
its
a
little
strange
drinking
a
beer
that
tastes
more
like
fruit
juice
than
beer
but
what
a
nice
strange
it
is
the
great
maroon
color
and
cherry
smell
really
pique
the
curiosity
and
let
you
know
that
youre
in
for
something
different
the
cherry
flavor
is
unlike
your
standard
runofthemill
fruit
beer
and
is
quite
smooth
and
authentic
it
has
a
very
nice
feel
with
very
fine
carbonation
that
cleanse
the
pallate
its
not
something
that
youd
want
to
drink
all
night
simply
because
it
is
sweet
and
meant
as
an
apertif
imo
but
that
that
isnt
meant
to
take
anything
away
this
is
a
superb
lambic
and
makes
for
a
great
dessert
beer
it
should
not
be
consumed
in
quantity
as
it
becomes
rather
sweet
after
a
glass
or
two
however
the
alcohol
is
relatively
low
at
only
4
abv
dn
an
absolutely
perfect
dessert
beer
or
a
beer
for
any
other
time
the
only
reason
this
doesnt
get
a
five
on
this
one
is
the
price
10
a
bottle
is
pretty
steep
but
once
in
a
while
tis
very
worth
it
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
yet
what
are
you
waiting
for
drinkability
its
very
good
and
i
could
sip
quite
a
few
of
these
but
after
awhile
the
sweetness
of
all
the
lindemans
lambics
turn
me
off
imo
the
best
of
their
offerings
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
now
that
ive
had
a
few
of
these
lambics
theyre
growing
on
me
poured
out
a
nice
deep
cherry
red
color
with
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
that
took
a
while
for
it
to
settle
smell
was
all
cherries
even
though
it
was
only
one
element
it
was
very
pleasing
to
the
nose
taste
was
tart
with
lots
of
dark
cherries
wasnt
as
tart
as
the
other

a

in
my

drinkability
is
not

great

of
this
beer
is
enough
for
me
for
one
night
i
just
love
the
cherry
taste
of
this
one
drinkability

this
is
my
favorite
of
the
lindemans
thus
far
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
down
when
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
a
festive
pink
head
danced
up
and
quickly
fell
back
down
the
glass
the
lambic
is
a
deep
redpurple
colour
when
you
put
your
nose
to
it
there
is
mostly
black
cherry
and
alcohol
and
unfortunately
thats
about
all
i
got
from
this
lambic
there
no
subtleties
that
i
could
detect
for
this
tongue
it
was
highly
carbonated
alcholic
black
cherry
soda
it
was
nearly
syrup
i
know
im
not
alone
in
thinking
that
the
colors
of
most
linemans
products
especially
the
framboise
and
now
the
kriek
seem
downright
unnatural
this
stuff
looks
more
like
the
color
of
a
popscicle
than
a
kriek
blazing
cherry
pie
red
with
a
nose
that
can
only
be
jolly
rancher
red
the
beer
enters
the
mouth
and
even
tastes
like
jolly
rancher
redcandied
and
very
sweet
this
is
an
after
dinner
drink
or
a
dessert
beer
in
my
book
the
beer
has
none
of
the
sour
that
i
love
in
the
style
i
guess
this
is
just
the
ticket
for
the
so
called
pepsi
generation
but
ill
throw
my
money
at
the
likes
of
de
ranke
that
offer
a
more
complex
complete
challenging
and
thirst
quenching
kriek
this
is
pure
sugar
and
would
make
a

i

i
really
like
black
currants
i
grew
up
on
them
as
a
kid
and
have
always
enjoyed
their
flavor
so
this
beer
was
indeed
like
drinking
a
carbonated
black
currant
drink
but
with
more
tartness
than
what
you
would
find
if
you
were
to
get
a
carbonated
black
currant
beverage
sparkling
juice
something
of
a
dessert
beer
i
think
to
have
that
fruit
flavor
counter
a
sweet
desert
that
youre
eating
although
it
could
be
an
afterdinner
drink
as
well
so
i
greatly
enjoyed
the

was
fairly
smooth
a
little
cloying
a
little
mouth
puckering
not
too
acidic
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
the
sweetness
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
the
whole
bottle
so
about
half
the
bottle
is
a
perfect
amount
for
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
sourness
it
was
mice
and
sour
i
liked
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
it
was
just
a
little
too
high
for
me
and
i
wish
it
was
toned
down
a
little
i
would
buy
this
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
who
likes
sweet
and
fruity
dessert
beers
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
and
i
think
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
a
little
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
its
not
my
favorite
lindemans
beer
or
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
its
not
bad
by
any
means
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
solid
fruit
lambic
keep
up
the
hard
work
this
is
a
tart
beer
because
of
the
currants
but
it
also
has
a
horsey
funk
to
it
it
pours
a
deep
purple
color
with
a
bright
pink
head
the
head
is
very
large
and
rocky
the
aroma
is
of
currants
with
a
the
same
slight
funk
as
the
flavor
drinks
like
a
red
sweet
tart
with
a
hint
of
beer
in
the
finish
there
should
be
more
low
abv
brews
this
good
good
you
get
all
of
the
flavors
described
for
the
wine
drinkers
this
is
a
nice
way
into
the
beer
game
nice
prickly
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
good
lambic
and
i
have
to
let
everyone
know
this
is
not
your
typical
sour
ale
it
is
very
sweet
and
palatable
by
newcomers
standards
bottle
poured
into
a
lindemans
200th

glass
cloudy
darker
fuschia
color
topped
with
a
full
two
fingers
of

which
receded
mostly
but
never
completely

leaving
random
specks
of

on

berries
and
more

somewhat
vinous
with
a

not

a

of
puckering

up

in
the
taste
giving
way
to
a
wave
of
sweetness
currants
and
grapes
candy
jam
jolly
ranchers
juicy
juice
overload
simply
too
sweet
a
subtle
grassy
finish
lets
just
call
this
a
fruit
beer
not
a
lambic
medium
body
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
with
sweetness
but
still
had
a
tart
twinge
that
kept
the
drinkability
decent
overall
id
say
maybe
its
a
good
dessert
beer
but
not
something
id
purposely
buy
again
i
really
just
wanted
something
from
lindemans
i
hadnt
tried
yet
to
christen
my
glasswale
this
review
is
based
on
comparative
lambic
beers
this
is
a
really
good
cassis
black
currant
beer
it
is
less
tart
than
a
kriek
and
a
little
more
sweet
if
you
enjoy
a
rouge
or
sour
but
one
with
less
bite
then
you
will
enjoy
this
one
i
am
still
comparing
the
lindemanns
and
timmermanns
but
right
now
they
are
comparable
taste
is
upfront
tart
berries
again
with
plenty
of
sourness
really
quite
tasty
and
after
so
many
hoppy
beers
this
rich
complex
and
delicious
beer
proved
a
welcome
change
from
the
norm
id
drink
this
again
easily
a
pours
with
a
deep
purple
color
clear
and
a
wine
head
about
a
finger
or
two
of
it
the
fruity
aroma
immediately
tells
you
theres
some
black
currant
here
plus
theres
also
a
slightly
wine
smell
present
the
taste
is
very
sour
not
acid
like
but
it
really
tastes
like
black
currant
the
finish
is
towards
the
sweet
side
perfectly
completing
this
great
beer
definitely
recommend
it
o
not
had
a
lindemans
in
a
while
and
my
first
was
labelled
intensely
sour
this
is
not
as
i
suspect
my
palate
has
travelled
long
and
whilst
the
acidity
builds
still
very
drinkable
best
cold
tho
overall
between
this
and
the
peche
for
the
fruit
lambics
this
one
is
a
sleeper
for
me
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
persistent
head
and
lacing
fruity
nose
thick
and
syrupy
fruity
flavor
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
poured
into
a
pint
glass
o
a
good
cassis
lambic
with
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
per
usual
with
lindemans
the
only
downfall
is
that
its
a
one
trick
pony
with
no
depth
behind
the
black
currants
and
grape
good
to
try
at
least
once
though
it
would
be
fairly
hardtoadmit
that
this
beer
doesnt
work
because
it
does
its
a
funkytart
fruit
lambic
with
lots
of
black
currant
represented
other
notes
fill
out
a
halfcomplex
flavor
profile
while
there
are
better
options
out
on
the
market
few
more
accessible
than
this
one
you
can
do
a
whole
lot
worse
cassis
is
still
my
favorite
of
the
lindemans
line
i
absolutely
commend
thee
this
beer
makes
me
feel
sick
its
so
sweet
and
sickly
overall
this
beer
is
different
from
anything
else
ive
had
a
bit
too
fruity
sweet
for
my
taste
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
definitely
not
as
sweet
as
say
the
lindemans
peche
variation
with
the
tartness
but
still
a
good
level
of
sweet
fruit
flavors
i
typically
enjoy
the
sweeter
fruit
lambics
so
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
its
a
good
intro
lambic
or
for
those
who
like
them
sweeter
if
you
like
your
lambics
sour
and
funky
though
this
isnt
the
one
youre
looking
for
pours
deep
crimson
purple
with
colored
foam
very
patchy
and
lots
sticky
grape
fruity
notes
the
sweet
kind
short
tart
berry
taste
stays
sour
throughout
smooth
finish
full
chewy
mouthfeel
very
flavorful
quite
good
o
much
like
the
other
lindemans
fruit
lambics
this
is
a
very
sweet
affair
and
seems
quite
nonbeery
that
said
it
is
flavorful
and
interesting
and
seems
wellsuited
as
an
after
dinner
or
dessert
drink
overall
these
types
of
lambics
always
scream
gimmick
but
this
one
was
actually
pretty
decent
it
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
the
flavour
didnt
come
off
as
artificial
as
many
other
more
commercial
and
again
gimmicky
lambics
i
also
liked
how
the
beer
wasnt
just
100
fruit
bombing
me
and
had
some
interesting
nuances
still
having
said
all
that
in
my
opinion
a
lot
more
can
be
done
with
this
style
and
heck
even
with
cassis
lambics
specifically
dense
cloudy
deep
red
body
with
a
full
thick
creamy
pick
head
which
lasts
and
creates
a
full
lacing
strong
tart
fruit
flavor
that
lingers
malt
only
in
the
first
sip
with
a
slight
warm
alcohol
aftertaste
i
keep
smacking
my
lips
after
each
sip
no
artificial
overtones
at
all
a
lovely
drop
drinkability
very
drinkable
far
better
than
most
other
lambics
ive
tried
that
are
too
sour
for
me
one
of
my
first
lambics
i
prefer
this
one
to
lindemans
framboise
just
by
a
hair
both
are
pretty
good
i
need
to
try
a
wider
variety
of
lambics
before
i
make
any
big
judgement
calls
but
the
ones
ive
had
are
definitely
tasty
o
first
lambic
beer
first
experience
with
something
this
tart
and
fruity
interesting
not
all
that
chuggable
but
in
little
sips
its
a
great
and
unique
tasting
experience
overall
lindemans
make
some
of
the
best
lambic
style
beers
ive
ever
had
and
this
one
is
just
as
good
as
the
others
but
a
bit
more
tartness
and
sour
to
the
taste
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
judge
the
taste
because
lambic
fruit
beers
are
low
on
my
list
of
styles
tart
sour
and
fruit
but
there
is
a
notable
character
of
malts
balancing
it
out
at
the
end
low
abv
so
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
couple
of
a
hot
day
i
always
enjoy
a
lindemans
lambic
and
this
one
was
no
exception
i
realize
they
are
sweetened
and
for
many
serious
beer
fans
are
not
truly
representative
of
the
style
still
they
are
refreshing
and
easily
found
o
a
good
lambic
interesting
focus
with
the
black
currants
which
was
definitely
enough
to
intrigue
me
for
the
duration
if
you
want
an
interesting
beer
for
dessert
this
is
for
you
o
easy
drinking
lambic
more
acid
than
the
average
but
still
an
interesting
experience
d
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
offering
from
lindemans
as
usual
not
exactly
a
traditional
lambic
and
not
at
all
a
blowyoursocksoff
sour
but
a
flavorful
and
drinkable
brew
with
an
excellent
fruit
taste
overall
the
beer
is
okay
it
is
certainly
drinkable
it
just
happens
to
taste
like
a
box
of
kids
juice
that
is
carbonated
overall
pretty
interesting
not
terribly
thoughtprovoking
but
still
good
nice
lambic
with
enough
sweetness
and
tartness
to
please
both
camps
the
currant
flavour
is
subtle
but
enjoyable
o
a
delicious
black
currant
lambic
although
super
sweet
its
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
definitive
cassis
flavour
and
smell
although
a
level
of
sweetness
i
find
unpleasant
reminds
me
of
a
wine
cooler
in
the
initial
sweet
flavour
followed
by
the
tartdry
after
taste
id
like
to
try
in
mixed
cocktail
but
wont
be
drinking
it
on
its
own
again
the
black
currants
give
this
lambic
a
rather
unique
aroma
and
unlike
the
pomme
this
one
does
not
have
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
id
rate
this
one
among
the
best
of
the
lambics
overall
another
good
showing
from
lindemans
this
is
certainly
on
par
with
their
other
brews
and
i
would
recommend
it
for
anyone
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
vivo
in
ikebukuro
tokyo
not
the
first
cassis
ive
ever
had
but
the
first
that
ive
openly
known
to
be
a
belgian
beer
promoted
as
a
peach
flavor
which
i
was
able
to
find
traces
of
in
the
flavor
the
appearance
was
an
amazing
purple
with
a
grapehued
head
like
nothing
ive
ever
seen
almost
like
grape
juice
but
a
beer
the
taste
was
a
little
sour
which
i
found
as
distracting
from
what
could
have
otherwise
been
a
great
peach
brew
but
i
imagine
that
is
the
nature
of
cassis
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
great
fruity
drink
i
can
totally
recommend
this
in
place
of
a
red
dessert
wine
i
love
cassis
and
there
is
nothing
i
would
like
better
than
a
traditional
lambic
with
cassis
berries
added
to
the
barrel
unfortunately
this
is
not
such
a
beer
as
it
is
made
with
artificial
aromas
and
sweeteners
acesulfame
k
i
hope
the
rejuvenation
of
lindemans
will
restore
the
credibility
that
it
has
lost
despite
my
fondness
for
cassis
i
am
avoiding
this
beer
until
it
is
made
with
all
natural
ingredients
now
it
is
time
rinse
my
mouth
of
the
saccharine
taste
o
i
havent
had
many
lambics
but
this
seems
to
be
a
great
representation
the
hops
and
malts
are
nonexistent
and
allow
the
sweet
black
currants
to
take
over
nearly
every
aspect
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
or
tart
a
good
balance
between
the
two
characteristics
taste
is
sweet
and
tart
with
berry
flavor
ive
only
had
fresh
cassis
a
couple
times
and
this
is
more
like
a
pungent
bluberry
for
me
i
like
it
i
wish
it
were
a
little
more
tart
but
this
provides
a
sting
behind
the
jaw
as
it
is
thin
syrup
body
with
hi
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
i
like
it
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
purple
color
with
a
light
pink
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
fruity
with
a
wine
like
aroma
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
almost
a
lot
like
a
red
wine
fermented
grapes
and
sugars
with
just
a
touch
of
funk
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
light
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
brew
was
good
but
not
something
that
is
great
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
often
solid
hit
served
at
a
good
temperature
and
with
a
huge
pinkish
foamy
frothy
thick
head
that
settles
to
a
light
cover
and
last
for
a
while
plus
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
pink
dark
amber
aroma
is
currants
yeast
vinegar
flavor
is
foremost
natural
currants
sweet
tart
malt
body
is
spot
on
perfect
all
the
way
around
finish
is
like
flavor
and
doesnt
deviate
of
good
length
with
a
slow
taper
could
cook
like
a
madman
with
this
very
good
beer
12
ounce
capped
and
corked
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
dark
redpurple
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
light
pink
head
the
head
stays
around
a
while
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
black
currants
and
some
other
dark
fruit
its
a
really
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
mostly
like
sweet
black
currants
along
with
some
sweet
dark
fruit
and
some
tart
berries
with
that
being
said
its
much
more
sweet
than
tart
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
and
it
has
moderate
carbonation
with
the
lindemans
lambics
you
know
theyre
going
to
be
sweeter
versions
so
i
wasnt
surprised
with
the
sweetness
in
this
brew
i
liked
it
and
would
buy
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
sweeter
fruity
beer
not
a
traditional
lambic
this
one
is
made
with
a
ton
of
artificial
sugar
added
incredibly
sweet
and
very
very
simple
almost
like
fruit
soda
really
not
my
cup
of
tea
pours
a
dark
red
color
w
a
light
purple
one
inch
head
good
carbonation
and
lacing
on
this
lambic
it
definitely
looks
the
part
of
black
currant
nose
is
yeast
funk
berries
grain
very
sweet
to
the
smell
which
was
expected
wow
taste
is
superb
for
the
style
this
is
probably
my
personal
favorite
of
the
lindeman
lambics
that
ive
had
sweet
but
not
overly
so
tart
as
well
but
it
almost
has
a
smooth
quality
to
it
that
makes
it
workable
mouthfeel
is
tart
medium
and
lightly
carbonated
very
nice
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
as
far
as
lambics
go
this
is
a
winner
recommended
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
cheers
pours
a
cherry
color
nice
soapy
head
and
lace
aroma
is
full
of
sour
berry
in
the
flavor
sweet
berry
flavor
and
a
sour
lambic
funk
flavor
making
for
a
nice
sweetsour
combo
light
bodied
mild
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
solid
lambic
beer
as
is
everything
from
lindemans
the
cassis
is
an
ok
delivery
vehicle
for
black
currant
essence
but
they
could
have
done
so
so
much
more
with
this
slightly
disappointing
but
still
enjoyable
o
one
of
the
better
lindemans
brews
out
there
its
still
a
tad
syrupy
but
this
fruit
profile
lends
itself
to
allowing
more
of
the
funky
yeast
profile
to
shine
through
overall
great
dessert
beer
if
i
could
get
this
locally
i
would
buy
a
fair
amount
poured
a
2
magentalavendar
head
dark
raspberry
burgundy
colored
body
smells
and
tastes
like
ribena
black
currant
syrup
although
it
has
the
sour
element
of
the
lambic
instead
of
just
the
sweet
of
the
syrup
so
hey
as
a
cassis
flavored
drink
this
is
top
rate
but
as
a
beer
there
just
isnt
much
of
a
beer
aspect
to
it
other
than
the
foamy
head
in
this
case
the
beer
is
pretty
much
just
a
fruit
juice
o
well
this
will
tame
my
sour
thirst
in
a
pinch
nothing
world
class
but
the
best
offering
from
the
fruit
line
of
lindemans
great
stuff
my
second
favorite
possibly
tied
with
framboise
to
the
peche
o
i
love
these
lambics
this
one
actually
competes
with
the
raspberry
for
me
o
this
would
have
been
considerably
better
if
it
wasnt
so
overwhelmingly
sweet
overall
good
not
great
wouldnt
get
this
if
the
apple
of
the
peach
is
nearby
guess
this
is
the
red
headed
stepchild
of
the
lambics
ive
had
not
bad
but
not
noteworthy
either
o
not
anything
like
beer
as
drinkable
as
fresh
fruit
juice
but
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
ill
have
my
dessert
in
a
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slightly
dry
you
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
glass
but
a
very
good
product
that
would
make
interesting
food
pairings
overall
drinkability
sparkling
grape
juice
however
its
beer
pours
a
dark
purple
red
color
with
a
thick
light
pink
head
and
a
ton
of
lacing
super
pretty
smell
is
of
currants
and
tartness
tastes
super
tart
with
tons
of
oak
funk
and
currant
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
heavy
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
awesome
brew
from
a
great
belgian
brewer
one
of
the
better
fruited
lambics
from
them
i
like
this
much
better
than
the
frambouis
but
not
as
well
as
the
kriek
this
one
would
be
the
smoothest
transition
from
wine
to
beer
hell
even
kindergartners
would
enjoy
a
glass
of
this
at
snack
time
for
the
price
and
easy
availabilty
this
is
a
great
beer
to
scratch
your
sour
itch
enjoyable
o
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
was
sickly
sweet
without
any
of
the
funkiness
i
was
expecting
from
a
lambic
i
was
blasted
with
fruity
syrup
in
its
place
mouthfeel
drinkablity
drinkable
but
i
didnt
want
juice
i
wanted
beer
this
is
entirely
to
sweet
with
a
sour
berry
pucker
concentrated
and
unbalanced
something
about
it
is
off
i
am
extremely
dissapointed
that
i
spent
so
much
money
on
this
beer
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pilsner
the
bottle
pours
a
syrupy
grapepurple
color
with
a
thin
film
of
pinkish
foamy
film
ring
smells
very
tart
sweet
to
the
point
of
almost
being
sour
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
to
it
giving
the
grape
flavors
a
sharpness
crisp
and
bittertart
sour
in
mouth
the
beer
has
a
supersweet
grape
aftertaste
with
a
mouth
puckering
finish
too
sweet
to
drink
lots
of
but
tasty
in
small
doses
poured
a
dark
red
with
an
average
sized
pink
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
strong
with
black
currants
a
moderate
dark
bread
malt
and
a
light
sweet
yeast
it
tasted
sweet
and
acidic
from
beginning
to
end
with
the
finish
being
strong
with
black
currants
that
lingered
on
the
pallet
for
an
average
amount
of
time
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
dry
in
texture
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
quite
tasty
and
would
be
great
mixed
with
a
nice
chocolate
stout
highly
drinkable
but
again
a
bit
sweet
for
mass
consumption
dark
black
like
a
ravens
wing
with
a
rasberrish
colored
head
smell
is
intensely
fruity
taste
is
really
really
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
it
is
oh
so
thick
like
the
fruit
it
is
insanely
drinkable
and
at
such
a
low
abv
i
can
see
myself
putting
a
few
of
them
under
the
table
d
great
lambic
and
i
love
black
currante
so
that
probably
contributes
to
my
like
of
this
beer
d
it
doesnt
wreck
the
palate
like
some
other
lambics
and
makes
for
a
delicious
dessert
dr
hides
its
abv
well
especially
for
a
fruit
beer
the
price
is
high
but
the
taste
is
better
avoids
the
izze
drink
imitation
taste
of
beers
like
great
divides
raspberry
very
well
done
a
bit
too
wet
though
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
the
oak
doesnt
come
through
in
the
taste
but
this
is
probably
for
the
best
d
much
too
tart
to
drink
all
night
for
my
taste
but
definitely
among
my
top
choices
if
youre
looking
for
a
fruit
beer
i
like
this
one
even
more
than
the
raspberry
this
has
a
little
less
sweetness
to
it
and
tastes
more
like
a
lambic
fruit
beer
should
taste
in
my
opinion
great
bubbly
mouthfeel
no
aftertaste
at
all
the
appearance
again
is
average
but
that
shouldnt
scare
you
off
the
taste
is
so
superb
nothing
can
bring
it
down
the
initial
pour
was
a
crowd
pleaser
the
reviews
came
right
down
the
middle
out
of
6
reviewers
we
had
threenthat
said
amazingly
good
and
three
that
were
dumbfounded
if
you
like
wine
this
is
up
your
alley
if
you
like
dark
heavy
beer
try
another
road
some
of
us
will
have
this
again
some
of
us
will
not
i
love
straight
lambic
and
dont
drink
many
of
the
fruity
variants
this
one
is
flavored
with
black
currants
the
beer
pours
a
lovely
dark
ruby
color
with
goodsized
pink
headplummish
i
would
say
the
aroma
suggests
an
earthy
cellar
with
fruity
overtones
it
is
appetizing
and
suggests
good
things
to
come
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
light
the
sourness
of
the
lambic
melds
nicely
with
the
tartness
of
the
black
currants
a
fruity
sweetness
balances
it
the
sweetness
is
not
overwhelming
and
mixes
in
well
funk
finishes
it
off
an
enjoyable
bottle
not
bad
pretty
sweet
as
it
is
with
the
lindemans
crew
but
with
actually
more
tartness
than
i
was
expecting
still
a
little
of
this
goes
a
long
way
the
one
is
plenty
for
me
until
i
move
onto
something
a
little
less
sugary
the
body
was
full
and
sticky
drinkability
is
good
but
a
little
tough
depending
on
your
sweettooth
at
the
moment
overall
a
good
solid
brew
i
generally
prefer
to
use
the
lindemans
beers
as
a
blend
with
a
bigger
beer
stouts
or
certain
strong
ales
and
lord
knows
the
ladies
loves
these
beers
theyre
all
worth
trying
tastes
like
purple
drink
currants
are
heavy
the
tart
is
nice
and
sharp
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
didnt
realize
id
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
respect
gained
for
the
coloradding
people
of
lindemans
drinkability
another
solid
fruit
lambic
from
lindemans
like
the
rest
of
lindemans
lineup
this
lambic
is
a
nice
treat
and
a
good
change
of
pace
i
could
see
people
who
dont
like
beer
really
liking
this
beer
while
it
may
not
be
my
favorite
from
among
lindemans
options
that
would
be
framboise
it
is
still
very
good
and
very
drinkable
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
contrasting
flavors
of
sweetness
and
sourness
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
in
body
effervescent
but
not
too
fizzy
i
might
drink
this
one
again
on
new
years
eve
the
mouthfeel
is
big
and
bold
the
sticky
sugar
combined
with
lots
of
bubbles
makes
this
beer
feel
bigger
then
it
is
conclusion
i
know
lindemans
stuff
is
a
bit
sweet
for
the
style
but
this
is
a
great
fruit
beer
all
the
same
paired
wonderfully
with
a
homemade
wedding
cakestyle
with
buttercream
frosting
and
blackberry
filling
just
meh
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
mild
tartness
at
the
corners
and
a
lot
of
sweetness
the
more
i
drink
the
more
it
tastes
like
carbonated
welchs
grapejuice
interesting
but
not
a
repeat
unless
of
course
its
free
d
a
solid
fruit
lambic
with
everything
you
would
expect
a
tad
sweeter
and
richer
than
normal
for
the
style
due
to
the
dark
fruits
but
the
sournesstartness
helps
counteract
some
of
that
another
solid
drinkable
lambic
from
lindemans
which
is
what
i
like
best
about
them
a
simpler
yet
easier
on
the
palate
and
stomach
take
on
the
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
great
flavor
aromas
and
appearance
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
but
overall
its
a
very
good
tasting
lambic
d
excellent
lambic
tastes
somewhat
like
ribena
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
good
d
just
too
rich
for
me
and
too
sweet
had
a
little
trouble
drinking
more
than
half
the
bottle
that
i
split
with
my
fiancee
who
insisted
on
trying
all
the
lindemans
beers
she
could
at
one
setting
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
cherryred
tone
and
a
slightly
reddish
tan
head
rather
inviting
aroma
is
rich
and
yeasty
with
a
fruity
overtone
a
mixture
of
cherry
and
blueberry
must
be
currant
lipsmacking
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
pleasantly
sour
mainly
cherry
and
blueberry
currant
with
undertones
of
malt
and
yeast
texture
is
very
smooth
and
leaves
behind
a
light
tingle
d
i
couldnt
drink
it
all
night
thats
for
sure
however
it
is
a
excellent
desert
beer
and
thats
what
im
rating
it
as
the
beer
pours
a
dark
redpurple
color
with
a
pink
head
the
aroma
is
tart
and
has
a
lot
of
red
wine
characteristics
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
red
wine
and
has
some
other
fruit
which
is
guess
is
the
currants
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
tartness
high
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
this
has
nothing
in
common
with
other
belgian
lambics
but
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
a
decent
one
d
very
good
lambic
i
think
its
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
lindemans
i
like
that
the
cassis
adds
sourness
to
the
overall
taste
medium
bodied
with
some
nice
soft
carbonation
up
front
and
a
subtle
dark
fruit
presence
sweet
grape
and
blackberry
flavor
and
maltier
than
expected
only
slight
tartsour
but
not
acidic
at
all
sweeter
than
i
prefer
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
complex
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
light
pink
head
smell
is
sweet
berriescurrants
grapes
and
a
sournessfunk
taste
is
berriescurrants
cranberries
with
a
slight
sourtartness
light
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
thats
pretty
tasty
some
definite
sweet
notes
from
the
black
currants
and
resides
as
the
majority
of
the
flavor
the
tartness
compliments
nicely
with
a
very
faint
and
distant
funk
again
i
must
say
some
age
would
do
this
beer
wonders
mellow
out
the
sweetness
and
hopefully
the
tart
characteristics
would
take
over
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
but
not
overkill
very
tasty
i
was
thinking
of
something
more
along
the
lines
of
say
a
three
philosophers
this
is
like
fruit
juice
meets
champagne
not
my
thing
wife
will
have
to
finish
it
off
while
i
crack
something
else
drinkability
one
of
the
lindemans
fruit
lambics
with
a
little
more
depth
in
flavor
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
black
currants
before
but
i
do
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
a
lot
overall
meh
its
a
lindemans
fruit
beer
one
that
happens
to
be
a
little
bit
more
traditional
but
a
halfhearted
attempt
at
making
an
honest
lambic
doesnt
make
this
a
better
beer
than
their
framboise
which
totally
embraces
its
unlambicness
this
is
tasty
enough
a
good
sweet
selection
great
for
dessert
easy
to
drink
not
hard
to
like
if
youre
into
lambics
notes
like
most
of
lindemans
beers
this
is
on
the
sweet
side
and
isnt
really
beerlike
in
taste
even
compared
to
most
other
sours
this
one
has
a
fair
amount
of
tartsourness
to
offset
that
though
a
bit
juicewine
like
and
would
be
a
nice
dessert
beer
to
pair
with
things
you
would
normally
pair
fruit
with
on
a
side
note
this
does
remind
me
a
bit
of
a
snakebite
lager
cider
and
blackcurrant
cordial
that
was
a
common
and
popular
drink
at
my
university
in
england
the
cassis
is
a
great
lambic
much
like
the
others
ive
had
this
is
probably
the
lambic
that
most
closely
resembles
a
wine
that
ive
had
its
a
very
dark
shad
of
red
almost
purple
smells
of
berry
a
little
winelike
taste
is
fruity
a
little
sweet
and
tart
not
too
sour
though
very
high
drinkability
i
highly
recommend
this
pours
a
hazy
ruby
redpurple
color
with
a
red
stained
head
little
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glassware
nose
is
sweet
smelling
with
a
nice
amout
of
funk
tartness
and
sourness
taste
is
sour
sweet
and
funky
with
a
bit
of
a
dark
fruit
taste
as
well
light
feel
and
high
carbonation
smells
like
a
dark
fruity
gummy
bear
candy
tastes
similar
but
sour
with
a
tartness
that
makes
your
mouth
pucker
and
want
to
drink
more
with
a
drying
finish
some
light
notes
of
vinegar
are
noted
as
well
truly
a
delicious
beer
d
its
like
a
rich
chocolate
good
in
small
doses
but
invigorating
in
moderation
a
good
substitute
for
the
ever
hard
to
find
sweet
red
wines
not
bad
future
outlook
interesting
and
decent
enough
but
probably
not
one
that
i
will
actively
seek
out
again
as
i
say
with
all
oversweet
fruit
lambics
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
very
cold
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
the
sweetness
overwhelms
any
lambic
character
nice
enough
but
not
for
those
who
appreciate
traditional
fruit
lambics
pours
into
a
deep
somewhat
hazy
maroon
crowned
by
a
frothy
head
whose
color
elicits
images
of
red
wine
settling
into
the
stained
khakis
though
this
head
dies
away
at
a
moderately
quick
pace
it
leaves
a
fine
coating
of
lace
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
there
is
a
smell
of
berries
to
be
expected
with
what
i
will
call
a
rooty
background
a
combination
of
woodiness
and
soilines
as
though
the
aromas
were
coming
from
around
a
dewy
berry
bush
the
taste
generally
follows
suit
though
the
rootiness
is
diminished
in
favor
of
a
tart
pomegranatelike
profile
like
pomegrantes
these
berries
have
a
thick
heavy
effect
in
the
mouth
though
this
is
somewhat
balanced
by
the
nice
carbonation
pours
a
dark
and
hazy
red
color
beneath
a
creamy
and
bright
pink
head
the
visibly
high
carbonation
sends
out
a
rich
and
bold
berry
fruit
aroma
the
light
body
is
accented
by
the
carbonation
and
is
very
refreshing
with
tart
cherrycranberry
flavors
the
finish
is
light
and
very
quick
and
ends
with
a
very
sweet
and
tart
kick
very
very
dark
red
almost
purple
with
a
pink
head
that
is
much
like
framboise
but
a
bit
darker
and
richer
with
the
aroma
i
mostly
am
just
getting
sour
funk
unlike
other
fruit
lambics
it
is
really
hard
to
pick
out
the
fruit
notes
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
very
sour
with
lots
of
musty
basement
character
as
well
as
some
red
wine
like
character
most
fruit
is
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
works
well
with
the
sourness
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
full
and
definitely
on
the
sticky
side
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
sit
down
and
drink
for
a
session
but
i
bet
it
would
go
great
with
a
creamy
desert
d
wow
this
is
a
delicious
beer
it
tastes
almost
exactly
like
a
blackcurrant
juice
sparkling
water
concoction
that
i
used
to
make
for
myself
possibly
one
of
the
best
lambics
i
have
tried
and
im
surprised
more
breweries
dont
make
blackcurrant
lambics
d
after
a
large
bottle
of
this
its
about
all
i
can
handle
in
my
stomach
too
much
of
any
sourwildlambicguezeetc
always
makes
me
a
bit
queazy
for
a
while
dont
plan
on
switching
to
a
dark
or
heavy
beer
after
this
one
because
it
wont
end
well
overall
a
nice
complex
refreshing
beer
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
very
light
but
in
the
glass
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
large
pink
head
aroma
heavily
of
berries
almost
like
a
very
sweet
red
wine
on
the
tongue
the
carbonation
reminds
you
this
is
not
wine
and
the
flavors
are
a
little
more
muted
than
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
there
is
an
earthy
component
that
is
very
refreshing
adnd
serves
to
cut
the
sweetness
a
bit
overall
there
is
no
mistaking
the
fruit
but
this
is
far
from
tasting
fully
like
a
juice
which
i
have
found
in
other
lambics
i
sure
like
me
the
dark
fruit
flavoured
adult
beverages
like
chambord
and
this
of
course
for
their
sweet
and
sour
interplay
and
this
beer
has
that
in
spades
big
titular
fruit
aided
by
its
friends
and
nicely
balanced
through
the
natural
complement
between
the
fruit
and
the
yeast
right
up
there
with
the
framboise
for
my
favourite
in
this
line
this
is
an
exquisite
fruit
lambic
crisp
mouth
a
touch
too
sweet
on
the
finish
i
probably
wont
be
grabbing
this
one
again
anytime
too
soon
notes
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
lindemans
fruit
lambics
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
peche
lindemans
not
quite
as
tart
as
the
kriek
the
cassis
somehow
is
the
most
winelike
but
also
the
most
lambic
qualities
of
the
three
lindemans
ive
tried
it
is
the
most
yeasty
of
the
three
and
has
the
best
balance
between
sweetness
tartness
and
mild
funkiness
in
a
word
its
delicious
flavor
is
bristling
with
dark
grapeberry
notes
more
tang
as
expected
enhanced
perhaps
by
the
high
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
though
just
as
easy
to
savor
a
lively
lambic
the
first
ive
had
in
years
taking
a
break
from
hops
everyday
and
really
enjoying
returning
to
what
old
europe
has
to
offer
great
on
its
own
though
2
would
be
plenty
but
i
can
imagine
this
enjoyed
with
cheese
and
the
usual
fair
associated
with
wine
but
a
hearty
sandwich
or
stew
would
pair
with
this
just
fine
i
think
d
fruity
drinkable
too
fruity
for
my
tastes
but
many
will
like
this
even
non
beer
lovers
d
very
drinkable
easy
going
and
flowing
this
bottle
was
poured
into
a
flute
very
royal
purple
with
a
persistent
purplish
head
bouyed
by
moderate
carbonation
strong
furity
berry
aroma
with
a
mown
hay
and
sourness
in
the
nose
that
literally
tingled
the
nose
hairs
flavor
is
berry
sweet
with
a
clean
sourness
and
vanilla
notes
moderate
body
with
a
dry
finish
just
about
excessively
drinkability
though
overall
it
lacks
the
complexity
sourness
funk
etc
of
the
heavy
hitters
in
the
style
drink
is
ehh
a
little
bit
too
much
for
a
session
as
it
is
way
too
sour
with
a
doubt
a
must
try
pours
a
pretty
purple
color
with
a
light
pink
head
that
settles
into
a
light
chunky
ring
looks
a
lot
like
grape
juice
the
aroma
is
very
much
like
a
red
wine
dark
grapes
and
sour
lemon
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
the
currant
followed
by
a
sugary
lemon
tart
twang
has
a
pulpyfresh
fruit
bite
starts
off
with
a
red
wine
flavor
but
quickly
transform
into
a
fresh
fruity
tart
bomb
the
feel
is
moderate
to
full
with
tingly
carbonation
good
swing
between
sweet
sour
and
tart
a
lot
of
fruit
flavors
going
on
very
sweet
very
sour
very
tart
quite
the
palate
ride
flavor
wise
good
but
not
great
but
it
does
have
depth
of
sensation
in
the
feel
it
is
unique
this
beer
comes
in
a
black
cagedcappedcorked
bottle
and
pours
a
deep
purple
colour
with
very
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
pink
two
finger
creamy
head
with
subtle
lacingthe
aromas
are
straight
out
blackcurrants
with
some
hints
of
funky
sour
cherryit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
sweet
blackcurrant
taste
that
only
finishes
moderately
mouthpuckering
sour
with
no
hint
at
all
of
alcohol
and
tastes
alot
like
a
nice
blackcurrant
juice
but
a
perfect
balance
in
my
mind
between
sweet
and
sour
this
is
definately
a
very
easy
drinking
lambic
and
would
recommend
this
one
for
people
just
starting
to
venture
into
lambics
its
very
drinkable
could
crush
this
all
day
long
but
its
only
4
d
the
perfect
after
dinner
beer
i
only
wish
id
had
some
desert
to
go
with
it
an
experience
i
wont
soon
forget
pours
a
clear
dark
red
color
with
lighter
red
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
13
inch
head
of
a
pink
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
currant
sweet
malt
yeast
tart
malt
slight
hops
and
some
acidity
fits
the
style
of
a
lambic
mouth
feel
is
sharp
acidic
and
tangy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
strong
tartness
currant
and
slight
hop
overall
a
new
an
interesting
brew
never
had
a
currant
beer
reminded
me
as
a
winebeer
combo
and
i
rather
enjoyed
it
drinkability
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
would
be
ideal
either
icy
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
lightly
chilled
closer
to
room
temp
in
cooler
weather
drinkability
lambics
simply
do
it
for
me
i
like
it
drinkability
is
good
of
the
lindemans
lambics
with
fruit
this
is
the
most
balanced
and
drinkable
the
sweetness
is
restrained
enough
to
allow
sour
notes
to
mildly
balance
the
brew
giving
way
to
a
tart
aftertaste
that
cuts
through
the
sticky
sweetness
cheers
what
a
surprise
pours
near
black
in
color
with
dark
purple
head
though
the
body
of
the
beer
is
more
of
a
dark
red
when
held
to
a
lightsource
head
is
thick
rich
laces
well
and
is
mystifying
to
look
at
nose
is
intense
with
mixed
dark
berries
that
are
hard
to
pin
down
maybe
some
blackberry
blueberry
and
a
faint
echo
of
grape
soda
from
childhood
this
dessert
beer
is
creamy
on
the
palate
with
an
explosion
of
sweet
tart
dark
fruits
that
come
through
like
the
intensity
of
a
spirit
but
without
the
alcoholic
bite
finish
is
very
very
long
d
for
a
fruit
lambic
its
actually
decently
drinkable
which
means
i
can
get
through
the
12
oz
bottle
without
having
to
share
a
solid
fruit
lambic
for
sure
really
crisp
but
sweet
fun
stuff
to
drink
well
my
first
real
go
at
a
fruit
lambic
was
a
smashing
success
it
is
said
that
first
impressions
are
paramount
and
i
can
tell
that
this
one
may
end
up
being
my
favorite
of
the
lindemans
line
of
lambics
alliteration
as
ive
always
had
a
fondness
for
blackberry
preserves
on
my
toast
and
bagels
there
was
a
point
in
my
life
when
i
would
have
not
touched
a
lambic
with
a
tenfoot
pole
so
if
i
can
do
it
you
should
too
if
you
havent
already
i
dont
even
care
if
this
isnt
traditional
beer
i
dont
even
care
if
some
would
consider
this
a
wimpy
beverage
i
like
it
and
im
going
to
keep
purchasing
it
this
is
definitely
a
celebratory
brew
overall
one
of
the
most
wellmade
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
very
good
and
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
purple
with
twofinger
pink
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
down
the
glass
tart
fruits
and
a
little
oakiness
in
the
smell
with
grapes
and
something
like
blue
berriesblack
cherries
also
a
great
sweet
taste
of
berries
and
black
cherries
in
a
medium
semicreamy
body
with
a
tart
and
crisp
backbite
that
balances
the
beer
a
great
sipper
that
is
more
enjoyable
than
a
bottle
of
red
wine
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
lambic
it
was
very
sweet
and
tasted
quite
good
for
a
lambic
these
guys
never
seem
to
let
me
down
love
their
gueze
and
love
this
one
now
too
355ml
bottle
corked
capped
and
foiled
shared
with
my
wife
the
beer
is
dark
red
with
a
pink
frothy
head
the
smell
is
like
fresh
berries
maybe
black
berries
and
cherries
i
dont
know
that
ive
ever
tried
black
currants
before
so
im
not
sure
what
theyre
like
a
little
bit
of
sour
in
the
aroma
but
the
berries
are
the
main
takeaway
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
berries
and
a
hint
of
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
excellent
like
all
lindemans
fruit
lambics
not
something
for
everyday
but
definitely
good
to
share
with
someone
pours
a
reddish
colored
body
with
a
big
pink
colored
head
that
is
somewhat
lasting
has
a
sweet
dark
fruity
aroma
but
not
much
else
is
present
there
has
a
sour
sweet
and
creamy
taste
fruity
some
sweetness
is
lingering
d
highly
drinkable
excellent
with
dessert
goat
cheese
and
lighter
fare
d
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
however
not
a
beer
i
would
sit
down
and
have
a
session
with
a
little
overly
sweet
to
do
this
overall
this
is
my
frist
true
belgian
lambic
i
wont
talk
about
the
sa
cranberry
lambic
and
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
liked
it
a
lot
i
surprised
by
the
complexity
of
the
fruit
and
winelike
tart
flavors
i
will
be
getting
this
again
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
by
avoiding
being
too
sweet
or
overly
tart
pretty
balanced
and
smooth
this
is
probably
my
favorite
out
of
the
fruitlindemans
beers
ive
tried
d
a
sweet
tart
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
nice
departure
from
all
of
the
heavy
big
beers
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
quality
beer
at
a
low
abv
that
is
done
very
well
it
may
not
kick
your
ass
but
hell
if
it
isnt
good
drinkability
is
much
higher
for
this
one
to
me
because
its
a
bit
drier
i
havent
had
much
luck
finding
any
other
lambics
in
my
area
but
lindemans
has
definitely
piqued
my
interest
in
fruity
beers
they
do
lack
in
nuance
but
theyre
a
great
starting
point
for
me
notes
i
am
trying
to
complete
all
of
the
lambics
from
lindemans
after
being
impressed
with
the
frambiose
it
continues
to
be
interesting
i
am
glad
that
i
found
this
one
at
chucks
d
sweet
drink
cant
have
too
many
because
of
the
sweetness
but
once
in
a
while
it
is
good
d
very
nice
and
refreshing
a
good
night
cap
or
desert
and
easily
shared
with
others
drinkability
grew
tired
of
it
after
half
a
glass
nothing
was
wrong
with
it
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
care
to
have
another
of
bottle
at
chaucers
pub
decants
a
deep
purple
liquid
sporting
a
creamy
billowing
purple
head
lots
of
retention
and
lace
going
on
here
the
nose
was
pretty
straightforward
but
enjoyable
aromas
of
black
currant
concord
grapes
berry
jam
a
smidgen
of
hops
tastes
of
sweet
and
tart
cassis
a
bit
of
yeasty
funk
add
some
hops
also
quite
tart
and
tight
on
the
finish
good
d
pretty
good
found
this
to
be
extremely
drinkable
and
a
great
dessert
accompaniment
to
cheescake
d
drinks
very
well
with
a
complex
balance
of
flavors
that
my
palate
couldnt
describe
open
the
gates
to
another
universe
and
relax
relax
the
leffe
of
belgie
pales
lieds
currant
cassis
is
exotic
enough
not
to
dissapoint
while
available
at
your
local
supermarket
i
have
never
heard
of
a
currants
the
bacteria
is
present
knawing
and
snapping
dry
and
magically
colored
sour
and
tangy
elegant
but
a
tad
too
bar
mitzvah
an
honorable
introduction
to
a
sour
ale
lifestyle
worth
indulging
and
embracing
dark
purple
color
with
purple
cloud
of
a
head
on
top
quite
beautiful
intoxicating
scent
of
currant
blueberries
and
grape
mouth
watering
taste
of
currant
blueberry
and
sour
mixed
fruit
that
engulf
the
tongue
and
take
advantage
of
it
thick
yogurt
feel
of
a
beer
that
seems
like
mixed
fruit
in
a
blender
rather
than
an
alcoholic
drink
a
great
accompaniment
with
dessert
think
pie
or
european
breakfast
enjoy
a
sensuous
indulgence
that
is
to
be
appreciated

aroma
of
roses
and
fresh
summer
berries
sweet
blackcurrant
taste
with
some
funkiness
and
a
woody
finish
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
good
nonetheless
pleasant
carbonation
and
light
body
i
could
drink
this
like
juice
although
i
prefer
my
fruit
beers
to
have
a
stronger
emphasis
on
the
malts
and
hops
than
this
one
demonstrates
medium
bodied
and
just
a
little
sticky
carbonation
is
tingly
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
fruit
lambics
ive
had
i
found
this
to
be
quite
good
and
one
of
lindemans
better
lambics
the
color
is
a
deep
purple
with
a
creamy
ruby
head
silky
lace
the
nose
has
tart
currants
barnyard
funk
and
oak
the
taste
is
similar
great
balance
of
sweet
tart
and
funk
crisp
body
goes
down
very
well
i
coud
drink
this
brew
all
day
long
d
this
is
a
tasty
alternative
for
me
once
in
a
while
but
id
never
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
pours
a
purpleish
red
color
with
a
small
faint
purpleish
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
red
grapes
and
blackberry
in
the
taste
a
small
tartness
grape
and
blackberry
a
tart
bite
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
grape
juice
aftertaste
dryest
of
the
lindemans
very
grape
juice
like
d
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
the
blackberry
currants
may
seem
a
little
harsh
at
first
but
they
smooth
out
and
become
quite
appealing
a
nice
lambic
overall
i
drink
this
every
now
and
then
but
if
i
want
lindemans
i
usually
reach
for
another
flavor
d
a
tasty
beer
indeed
not
something
for
every
day
drinking
but
a
good
desert
beer
either
by
itself
or
perhaps
with
some
chocolate
based
dessert
a
pleasant
dessert
ale
or
something
savoury
to
share
with
someone
special
not
a
regular
on
my
menu
or
palate
but
it
would
serve
a
certain
time
and
place
yummy
stuff
yet
one
small
bottle
is
good
enough
for
a
night
i
wish
i
had
some
chocolate
cake
to
go
along
with
this
beer
good
d
god
its
like
candy
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
but
sweet
enough
to
make
the
idea
of
more
than
one
bottle
seem
like
kind
of
a
bad
call
im
pretty
sure
that
after
this
bottle
ill
have
had
quite
enough
sugar
good
carbonation
feel
and
not
too
puckering
its
slightly
tart
but
not
much
to
it
dark
grape
juice
in
the
taste
along
with
some
sort
of
woodiness
or
whiskey
like
flavors
something
odd
i
couldnt
pin
point
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
savoring
the
taste
for
a
good
15
minutes
before
completing
the
bottle
it
is
certainly
reminiscent
of
the
currant
wine
with
the
addition
of
the
wild
yeast
and
grain
complexities
thumbs
up
the
taste
is
predominantly
blackcurrant
first
mostly
sweet
then
in
the
finish
more
tart
and
light
but
remaining
throughly
cassis
in
flavour
the
lambicyeasty
quality
and
sourness
are
barely
evident
at
all
almost
nonexistent
probably
because
the
cassis
overpowers
it
all
while
this
is
classified
as
a
beer
it
was
more
of
a
lowalcohol
wine
experience
but
a
great
experience
would
be
a
dream
with
fruit
fondue
fruit
tartes
crème
bruleé
and
cheese
cake
purchased
bevmo
tucson
az
d
very
nice
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
the
taste
is
full
of
blackberry
raspberry
and
tons
of
currant
with
a
slight
hint
of
burnt
fruit
and
oak
an
excellent
tarty
bite
on
the
finish
brings
notes
of
sourdough
breaded
malts
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
nicely
carbonated
with
a
pleasing
sweet
sour
aftertaste
like
most
of
lindemans
lambics
this
is
a
musttry
to
me
its
a
notch
above
the
kriek
but
not
quite
as
good
as
their
framboise
slightly
translucent
purplebrown
with
a
thin
purple
head
that
fades
quickly
nose
is
grape
communion
wine
oak
and
sweet
blackberry
taste
is
sweet
black
currants
wild
yeasts
and
a
nice
spicy
oak
finish
with
hints
of
merlot
and
capers
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
a
little
thin
and
sodaesque
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
the
sweetness
can
get
to
you
drinkability
is
medium
to
high
as
the
flavors
are
not
overwhelming
but
it
could
definitely
be
too
sweet
after
a
while
it
is
an
opaque
blood
red
with
no
real
head
or
lacing
it
looks
like
fresh
cherry
juice
the
smell
is
black
currants
no
surprise
there
the
taste
follows
suit
but
also
mixes
in
apples
and
a
slight
peppery
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
syrupy
with
mild
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
much
better
than
i
expected
of
a
lindemans
lambic
which
tend
to
be
too
swet
for
me
it
is
surprisingly
balanced
by
the
crisp
finish
and
i
should
have
opened
the
bottle
much
sooner
simple
yet
fantastically
unique
at
least
for
most
of
us
who
cant
find
another
cassis
while
i
dont
like
many
fruited
beers
including
most
lindemans
this
is
the
exception
in
my
opinion
this
is
slightly
more
enjoyable
than
the
framboise
because
the
black
currant
and
tart
blackberry
cut
into
the
fruity
sweetness
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
with
its
light
and
fizzy
yet
sweet
and
fruity
mouthfeel
highly
enjoyable
if
a
bit
pricey
another
interesting
lambic
from
this
brewery
this
time
the
black
currants
really
mix
well
with
the
beer
style
just
the
right
amount
of
fruit
flavor
balanced
with
the
sour
lambic
base
makes
this
a
great
choice
as
an
appertif
or
dessert
beer
i
was
even
able
to
get
a
friend
who
has
never
had
this
style
to
enjoy
the
lambic
experience
lightmedium
body
the
nice
carbonation
creates
a
spritzy
sensation
on
your
tongue
delicate
but
enticing
and
that
opens
to
a
fruit
explosion
currants
and
berries
sweet
and
tart
sugary
and
sour
quite
well
balanced
for
a
dessert
beer
i
have
to
compare
them
side
by
side
but
it
is
clearly
better
than
the
peche
probably
a
close
second
to
the
kriek
this
beer
had
a
very
clear
ruby
colour
and
poured
with
a
solid
cap
of
pink
foam
the
fine
bubbles
showed
good
head
retention
and
produced
some
chunky
sticky
lace
the
aroma
was
of
tart
berries
and
currants
a
bit
minty
with
some
earthy
blueberry
flesh
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
being
in
the
forest
after
a
rain
storm
it
was
very
sugary
sweet
up
front
with
berries
and
currants
cutting
the
sweetness
at
the
midpoint
leafy
mint
and
moderate
tartness
lingered
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
it
was
a
little
palate
coating
and
had
a
decent
texture
quite
easy
drinking
and
a
good
fruit
beer
the
sweetness
was
a
little
high
for
my
tastes
but
worked
well
with
the
tartness
i
really
liked
the
minty
character
too
pours
deep
purple
once
again
no
pun
intended
bit
of
a
head
lavender
in
color
smells
kind
of
sour
i
dont
know
what
a
current
smells
like
but
there
is
a
fruit
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
downright
refreshing
like
a
bitter
slightly
sour
grape
juice
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
bit
bitey
downs
way
too
easy
this
was
ment
to
my
procrastination
liquid
before
i
left
the
beasts
house
but
my
car
wont
be
warm
by
the
time
im
done
a
good
fruity
brew
i
havent
much
experience
with
lambics
but
this
tastes
damn
good
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
lindemans
either
that
or
a
tie
with
the
framboise
pours
a
deep
purple
smooooke
on
the
wahhhhtaaa
nose
is
of
currant
and
sour
tart
taste
is
very
luxurious
and
not
sour
like
a
true
lambic
i
like
that
as
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
traditional
sour
lambics
black
currant
flavors
abound
this
tastes
like
it
should
have
seeds
in
it
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
serve
this
as
dessert
to
the
women
at
your
xmas
party
then
tell
them
youve
got
a
bottle
on
ice
upstairs
i
may
be
a
newbie
to
lambics
but
i
feel
this
deserves
a
high
rating
because
of
the
effort
put
into
it
and
how
delicious
it
is
overall
this
beer
was
ok
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
on
lindemans
so
i
didnt
expect
much
i
was
not
let
down
my
only
regret
was
not
having
a
corkscrew
i
had
to
use
a
leatherman
and
a
toothbrush
this
not
a
method
i
recomend
a
nice
hybrid
of
beer
and
wine
nice
look
pretty
much
like
a
red
wine
with
a
bit
of
foamy
head
smells
great
a
nice
fruity
scent
it
has
a
great
taste
if
you
dont
like
wine
because
of
its
alkalyde
taste
this
would
be
perfect
for
you
it
goes
down
smoothly
but
is
too
thick
to
have
too
many
at
a
time
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
brew
unique
and
tasty
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
but
nice
to
have
a
glass
or
two
poured
from
355
ml
bottle
should
be
noted
this
is
my
first
lambic
pours
a
deep
eggplant
purple
with
a
champagnelike
purple
head
some
retention
smell
is
tomato
really
smells
like
sour
grapes
and
tomato
definitely
a
first
for
me
in
beer
taste
is
pretty
much
on
par
with
the
smell
a
strong
tartness
to
it
but
again
all
i
can
focus
on
is
the
tomato
high
carbonation
has
a
crisp
chamagneish
mouthfeel
to
it
im
pretty
much
giving
this
3s
across
the
board
because
it
is
my
first
lambic
and
im
not
used
to
this
while
im
sure
its
not
terrble
just
not
my
style
yet
and
i
just
cant
get
over
the
tomato
or
currant
as
people
with
a
more
sophisticated
taste
would
say
finish
is
solid
due
to
the
last
statement
above
full
body
yet
crisp
and
light
of
alcohol
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
a
355
bottle
alone
and
certainly
wouldnt
attack
a
750
with
less
than
what
you
would
call
a
party
but
rich
tasty
and
extremely
unique
dthis
is
by
far
the
best
lindemans
i
have
had
unlike
the
rest
of
the
lineup
i
have
gone
through
this
one
is
pleasantly
sharp
with
the
right
lambic
notes
this
makes
a
delightful
dessert
beer
and
the
pleasing
fruity
sourness
cuts
perfectly
a
rich
dessert
like
ny
cheesecake
i
love
creme
de
cassis
so
this
is
welcome
to
me
tasty
beer
good
after
dinner
sipper
but
not
overly
drinkable
due
to
intense
flavor
and
oversweetness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
heavy
on
the
palate
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
more
like
a
juice
than
a
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
good
thing
for
this
brew
it
really
compliments
the
flavors
in
the
beer
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
at
4
abv
it
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
at
a
time
it
is
a
pretty
sweet
beer
and
it
could
eventually
become
cloying
if
one
were
to
drink
too
much
i
could
see
this
beer
replacing
juice
in
my
refrigerator
750ml
bottle
from
florians
pours
virtually
opaque
dark
redpurple
with
nearly
no
head
leaves
a
little
lacing
as
it
goes
smells
fruity
like
berries
black
currants
im
sure
though
ive
never
had
them
fullflavored
with
berries
at
the
forefront
with
a
good
amount
of
sourness
toward
the
finish
though
on
overpoweringly
so
slightly
woody
in
its
flavor
as
well
wow
this
flavor
is
great
one
of
the
best
tasting
fruit
beers
ive
had
much
less
carbonation
than
i
expected
could
use
a
little
more
in
my
humble
but
true
opinion
otherwise
medium
bodied
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
is
a
bit
more
of
a
sipper
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
finest
fruit
beers
ive
had
better
than
the
raspberry
version
i
like
this
a
lot
but
if
given
this
without
a
description
would
very
likely
not
have
guessed
it
was
beer
this
is
a
dull
plumcolored
beer
with
a
thin
pink
halo
of
bubbles
smells
like
grape
koolaid
with
smuckers
in
it
acidity
comes
through
in
the
nose
i
taste
and
get
light
rosey
florals
upfront
amazing
that
i
can
taste
that
at
all
considering
the
hefty
grapejuice
tasting
base
berry
is
lively
yeasty
lambic
tartness
holds
this
down
and
acidity
thins
it
down
but
the
brew
is
still
cloying
one
of
the
better
lambics
from
lindemans
mouthfeel
is
midwieght
fuzzy
and
acidic
this
particular
flavor
didnt
jive
with
me
very
well
but
it
did
stay
true
to
style
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
syrupy
but
sort
of
light
at
the
same
time
it
finishes
a
little
dry
kind
of
like
champagne
highly
carbonated
as
well
the
only
knock
toward
the
drinkability
for
me
would
be
the
sour
tartness
of
the
fruits
as
refreshing
as
they
are
i
cant
see
myself
having
much
in
a
sitting
but
several
more
in
the
future
an
ideal
afterdinner
beverage
great
desertlike
fruity
purple
color
well
decorated
head
retention
berryfruitiness
light
tartness
and
a
palate
cleansing
carbonation
strong
vineous
lambic
brettnomycces
sourness
tartness
that
offers
a
thinning
vinegar
quality
that
cuts
the
thick
berry
syrupy
sweetness
and
currant
strength
contributing
musky
moldy
oakey
aromas
fade
as
the
flavors
prevail
with
sweet
fruitiness
a
mellow
spiciness
are
astringency
just
adds
to
the
complexity
though
too
flavorful
to
drink
often
it
is
an
ideal
way
to
close
an
evening
maybe
the
best
balanced
and
most
drinkable
of
all
lindemans
blended
lambics
bottle
poured
a
deep
dark
blue
color
lambic
with
a
big
foamy
purple
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
cassis
syrup
is
dominating
and
gets
pretty
close
to
being
gross
but
stays
within
a
reasonable
limit
taste
is
dominated
by
the
cassis
with
some
weak
notes
of
sourness
and
tart
the
taste
is
also
very
sweet
which
i
usually
would
mind
but
i
thought
it
provide
a
refreshing
edge
to
this
beer
overall
without
being
anything
close
to
traditional
lambic
i
thought
this
was
a
refreshing
option
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
aftertaste
is
faintly
of
berries
not
bad
this
beer
pours
dark
purple
with
a
thin
lavender
head
the
aroma
is
pure
currants
i
am
not
surprised
but
slightly
disappointed
by
the
lack
our
sourness
from
this
beer
i
would
like
a
lambic
to
be
a
bit
more
sour
than
this
this
beer
is
very
sweet
with
a
strong
tart
currant
flavor
which
is
pretty
good
though
the
body
is
light
but
there
is
a
bunch
of
carbonation
to
back
it
up
a
750
ml
bottle
costing
9
45
at
the
north
coast
coop
in
eureka
ca
this
was
the
last
of
the
four
lindemans
lambic
and
was
the
most
difficult
to
rate
poured
a
beautiful
almost
purple
color
with
a
head
of
the
same
color
that
lasted
a
long
time
and
left
wonderful
lacing
big
nose
of
cherry
and
a
touch
of
yeast
a
feast
for
the
eyes
thick
and
rich
with
remarkable
smoothness
flavor
is
very
potent
and
i
suppose
is
currents
but
is
a
little
odd
to
me
mouthfeel
rich
like
all
the
lamics
a
ourch
of
tartness
is
there
but
generally
this
is
very
sweet
and
almost
overwhelmlming
in
its
favors
my
least
favorite
of
all
the
lambics
but
still
not
bad
and
very
interesting
to
drink
da
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
at
only
4
abv
this
was
a
nice
change
from
my
hefty
riss
cheers
as
my
first
flavored
lambic
i
was
overall
impressed
it
makes
me
want
to
try
the
rest
of
the
lindemans
brews
pours
a
deeper
maroon
merlot
hue
than
the
framboise
with
a
light
and
seltzery
head
with
no
retention
hard
to
see
anything
in
this
vampireic
beer
but
you
cn
see
a
few
bubbles
near
the
top
on
the
outer
edge
the
aroma
is
lightly
funky
and
horsey
with
medium
currant
and
grape
aromas
with
yeast
the
taste
is
a
lovely
mild
currant
dancing
on
a
light
aire
of
the
spring
countryside
mixing
with
some
floral
accents
a
little
more
subdued
in
flavor
than
the
framboise
but
still
good
easy
to
drink
just
a
light
to
mild
in
tartness
in
my
wussy
lambic
opinion
very
drinkable
will
buy
again
for
fruity
sipping
occasions
drinkability
this
is
the
by
far
best
of
the
fruity
lindemans
lambics
this
might
ruin
the
pêche
and
framboise
for
me
on
the
rare
occasion
that
i
drink
either
of
them
d
very
drinkable
out
of
the
bottle
this
lambic
is
a
dark
purple
with
a
rich
purple
head
the
smell
is
fruity
as
would
be
expected
it
makes
promises
the
taste
cant
keep
kind
of
like
a
sour
jolly
rancher
the
mouthfeel
gets
points
because
its
sour
keeps
it
a
true
lambic
whereas
others
ive
had
are
too
sweet
pours
a
beautiful
clear
deep
reddishpurple
with
a
substantial
frothy
head
that
lingers
nicely
also
displays
nice
lacing
the
aroma
of
currants
is
pervasive
taste
has
initial
slightly
sour
currant
taste
that
leads
to
a
slighty
sweet
finish
very
enjoyable
hard
to
stop
sipping
good
carbonation
just
a
great
way
to
finish
a
meal
skip
the
dessert
and
have
one
of
these
d
approachable
not
too
funky
but
a
little
tart
for
my
liking
drinkability
with
this
level
of
sweetness
it
is
hard
to
drink
too
much
of
this
stuff
its
not
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
had
but
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
if
in
the
mood
for
a
cassisstyle
lambic
can
only
drink
so
much
of
it
though
before
sweet
dryness
becomes
almost
too
much
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
glass
or
two
of
this
at
a
time
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
at
all
to
grab
it
again
although
itd
likely
be
for
certain
occasions
maybe
as
an
after
dinner
dessert
beer
d
definitely
drinkable
refreshing
drinkability
on
a
summer
day
sour
beers
lambics
berliner
weiss
belgian
sours
are
quite
refreshing
and
low
alcohol
makes
this
brew
quite
quaffable
a
splendid
drink
really
fantastic
colour
rare
and
unique
to
cassis
beers
purple
body
and
bubbly
pink
head
tart
and
lively
aroma
more
tartness
than
fruityness
some
lambic
yeast
makes
its
way
through
carbonation
on
the
high
side
but
doesnt
distract
from
anything
tasty
black
currant
flavour
drinks
far
too
easy
its
always
hard
to
find
much
to
say
about
these
fruit
lambics
there
never
is
and
yet
i
enjoy
them
as
im
sure
many
do
as
much
as
any
other
style
excellent
beverage
for
so
many
occations
wish
i
had
more
fine
beverage
simply
overall
thanks
to
dr
jay
for
hauling
this
one
into
the
country
for
me
and
the
special
lady
cheers
d
i
like
big
wild
lambics
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
like
the
sweet
and
tart
flavors
that
contrast
in
this
beer
and
that
is
what
makes
it
perfect
for
desert
the
fresh
distinct
flavors
of
the
currants
are
captured
perfectly
in
this
beer
and
they
are
the
main
player
with
other
supporting
flavors
before
and
after
them
id
pick
up
lindemans
framboise
or
kriek
over
this
any
day
although
interesting
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
little
less
enjoyable
mostly
because
of
the
fruit
choice
itself
personally
while
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
wont
pay
6
dollars
for
another
one
yet
another
lindemans
lambic
that
is
just
way
too
drinkable
that
could
be
enjoyed
at
anytime
or
anyday
d
drinkable
this
is
a
lambic
offering
from
lindemans
would
recommend
at
least
once
in
a
lifetime
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
definitely
goes
good
smooth
and
creamy
and
has
the
carbonation
just
about
right
highly
drinkable
but
probably
not
something
one
would
drink
a
lot
of
d
refreshing
but
not
all
that
interesting
decent
drinkability
drinkability
very
high
drinkability
the
sweetness
and
dryness
are
nice
changes
of
pace
i
have
been
looking
for
one
of
these
for
a
while
now
and
finally
found
one
in
superior
wi
lucky
me
the
best
lambic
i
have
ever
had
is
the
new
glarus
cherry
tart
but
this
cassis
is
a
close
second
for
those
who
like
sweet
sugary
lambics
this
is
not
for
you
lindemans
does
a
great
job
of
capturing
the
nature
of
black
currant
sort
of
watery
in
texture
but
sweet
and
tart
create
a
flavor
burst
that
mellows
with
fruity
dry
flavor
almost
like
a
red
wine
what
i
was
most
impressed
with
was
the
smell
the
first
thing
i
did
when
i
opened
it
was
smell
the
cork
it
was
almost
like
a
musty
but
fruity
cellar
very
refreshing
reminds
me
of
the
northwoods
in
the
spring
or
fall
this
is
not
something
you
would
have
a
session
with
is
any
lambic
i
think
it
would
be
best
with
some
dank
food
or
to
actually
cook
with
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
refreshing
lambic
lacking
in
complexity
but
not
too
heavy
or
sugary
probably
would
go
over
well
at
parties
2nd
following
the
raspberry
the
cassis
is
another
delicious
3
year
masterpiece
from
lindemans
lovely
ruby
pour
with
a
delicate
white
head
of
foam
the
nose
is
worth
a
good
10
minutes
of
savoring
very
sweet
and
rich
flavor
like
pure
juiced
cherries
fills
the
mouth
addictive
and
would
go
great
with
cheesecake
my
first
lambic
lindemans
cassis
is
a
shiny
shade
of
ruby
with
a
fluffy
pink
head
the
aroma
is
rich
and
of
strong
sweet
dark
berries
the
taste
is
simply
amazing
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
best
fruit
beer
that
ive
sampled
flavor
is
of
very
strong
tart
dark
berries
with
a
center
of
sugary
sweetness
my
idea
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
arent
present
however
the
layers
and
complexity
of
the
fruit
flavors
are
amazing
for
fans
of
fresh
fruit
this
is
a
must
sample
beer
highly
recommended
finally
got
me
a
bottle
of
lindemans
big
750
ml
green
bottle
corked
and
capped
and
topped
with
foil
it
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
with
notes
of
purple
and
pink
and
its
topped
with
a
beautiful
strawberry
frosting
color
head
that
rises
to
an
inch
and
a
half
and
sticks
everywhere
and
not
just
on
the
first
glass
damn
thats
a
pretty
beer
it
smells
sweet
with
berries
currant
blackberry
and
a
slight
mustyfarmy
aroma
the
last
pour
with
all
the
dregs
smells
of
currant
preserves
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
good
tartbitter
quality
and
additional
notes
of
dark
cherries
and
oak
delicious
the
body
is
both
medium
and
syrupy
both
smooth
and
dry
the
carbonation
at
the
beginning
is
nice
but
the
beer
is
better
as
it
warms
as
far
as
drinkability
i
was
taking
sips
for
the
whole
2
hours
it
took
to
drink
and
im
surprised
it
even
lasted
that
long
good
thing
i
was
trying
to
savor
it
i
could
have
drunk
two
of
these
in
a
row
easily
especially
because
of
the
low
abv
however
the
high
price
keeps
me
from
that
ah
well
now
to
try
their
other
lambics
drinkability
i
would
say
is
fairly
high
i
could
see
havin
a
few
of
these
and
its
quite
pleasant
to
drink
although
doesnt
seem
like
beer
to
me
this
offering
comes
out
a
deep
burgundy
red
color
with
purple
on
the
sides
a
nice
tall
airy
frothy
pink
head
sits
atop
the
glass
and
maintains
good
retention
aroma
was
sweet
kind
of
berryish
with
some
yeast
notes
evident
taste
had
more
of
a
purple
grape
flavor
than
berries
imo
body
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
not
too
syruppy
at
all
the
sweetness
is
dominant
and
the
yeast
doesnt
really
hold
it
back
the
finish
however
gives
me
some
acidity
and
washes
away
the
sweetness
quite
well
this
was
a
fairly
good
beer
cassis
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
to
add
to
a
lambic
but
it
worked
well
here
taste
very
sweet
and
fruity
to
start
followed
by
a
slightly
puckering
sourness
it
was
a
little
hard
to
pick
out
at
first
because
of
how
sweet
this
beer
is
but
theres
a
bit
of
a
peppery
spiciness
in
the
finish
that
makes
this
slightly
more
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
this
is
so
sweet
that
i
had
a
really
hard
time
finishing
it
oelergud
this
beer
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
and
has
a
thin
fizzy
one
finger
head
with
little
to
no
retention
but
leaves
some
dark
pink
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
bursting
out
with
ripe
berries
yeast
and
pepper
medley
the
taste
reminds
me
of
sweetarts
with
a
sensory
overload
of
fruit
if
youve
never
had
a
lambic
before
the
youre
in
for
a
treat
with
this
one
an
excellent
lambic
with
an
wonderfully
pungent
black
currant
aroma
the
flavor
is
full
of
fresh
crushed
fruit
and
herbal
notes
the
light
wheaty
backbone
of
this
beer
truly
lets
the
fruit
shine
through
the
lambic
yeasts
add
that
distinctive
tang
that
nicely
compliments
the
other
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
appropriate
to
the
style
almost
no
hops
present
the
color
is
a
dark
brownish
purple
reminiscent
of
a
cabernet
grab
a
bottle
if
you
can
find
it
12
oz
bottle
an
excellent
lambic
it
has
a
somewhat
sweet
fruity
aroma
to
it
it
also
has
a
nice
sour
aftertaste
to
compliment
the
slight
sweetness
of
the
beer
the
black
currant
taste
is
very
evident
but
not
overdone
nice
purplish
head
on
top
of
a
beer
that
has
an
almost
grape
juice
color
very
heavy
the
black
currants
are
a
nicer
flavor
than
the
krieks
or
boons
definitely
a
one
at
a
sitting
brew
d
the
one
part
of
this
beer
that
kills
it
is
the
drinkability
i
have
a
hard
time
finishing
the
bottle
when
i
crack
open
a
750ml
so
i
usually
share
with
a
friend
the
sweetnesssugariness
of
this
beer
is
almost
too
much
but
never
the
less
a
quite
enjoyable
change
of
pace
i
respect
the
quality
of
this
effort
im
shocked
at
the
abv
as
i
could
have
sworn
i
felt
some
warming
off
this
bad
boy
it
really
does
warm
my
gullet
even
for
a
short
time
i
would
wait
a
while
to
review
this
style
as
the
first
couple
of
times
ive
tried
it
i
really
couldnt
stand
it
but
now
i
find
that
it
is
a
nice
treat
when
im
in
the
mood
12
oz
capped
and
corked
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
dark
purple
with
two
fingers
of
light
pink
head
good
retention
medium
lacing
smell
is
extremely
fruity
and
extremely
appealing
im
assuiming
the
fruit
is
currant
never
eaten
one
but
it
smells
like
a
cross
between
cherries
cranberries
and
figs
to
me
taste
is
more
fruitiness
this
one
is
much
more
tart
than
the
other
lindemans
ive
had
kriek
and
peche
but
still
has
a
nice
sweetness
on
the
finish
to
make
this
an
extremely
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
medium
carbonationnot
as
fizzy
as
some
other
fruit
lambics
ive
tried
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
in
place
of
soda
i
like
all
lambicstheyre
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
normal
beer
and
usually
have
great
fruit
flavors
and
i
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
one
yet
anyway
i
like
it
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
of
lindemans
lambics
mostly
because
of
its
unique
flavor
and
the
fact
that
its
not
too
sweet
definitely
worth
a
try
for
those
that
arent
afraid
of
mixing
beer
with
fruit
pours
an
odd
purplish
color
very
fizzy
with
a
nice
creamy
pink
foam
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
like
a
comination
of
cranberries
and
grapes
very
candylike
taste
is
also
extremely
sweet
with
tartness
an
afterthought
this
beer
is
very
sugary
i
wouldve
like
to
see
more
tartness
and
body
in
it
still
it
was
good
and
my
first
experience
with
currants
opinion
i
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
but
they
are
so
flavorful
and
awesome
that
i
just
have
to
keep
drinking
them
on
a
regular
basis
the
cassis
in
particular
is
a
superbly
crafted
beer
with
the
tastes
of
the
masses
in
mind
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
and
one
that
you
can
definitely
introduce
the
beerignorant
to
to
show
them
that
there
is
something
other
than
budmilloors
out
there
for
us
diehard
sour
beer
fans
this
one
is
seriously
sweet
beer
is
good
happy
interesting
beering
this
was
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
a
good
base
beer
for
the
sweet
tartness
of
the
black
currants
it
poured
a
lovely
pinkpurple
white
a
pnk
head
that
dies
to
spots
of
carbonation
a
lovely
taste
of
latic
spoiled
beer
and
a
heady
dose
of
currant
flavors
and
sweetness
a
good
beer
to
sip
with
friends
it
was
a
little
syrupy
and
i
would
drink
a
whole
bottle
by
myself
but
enjoyable
and
pleasent
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
three
common
lindemans
beer
deep
purple
in
colour
with
an
odd
pink
head
this
beer
is
really
a
one
note
wonder
loads
of
cassis
aroma
and
flavor
but
not
much
else
going
on
theres
not
much
lactic
sourness
yeast
orwheat
malt
character
at
all
it
starts
out
light
on
the
palate
and
gets
a
little
heavy
and
cloying
as
time
goes
on
all
of
that
being
said
i
like
cassis
flavor
quite
a
bit
so
this
wasnt
all
that
bad
for
me
okay
this
one
disappointed
me
i
ordered
this
as
part
of
a
flight
which
included
the
lindemons
framboise
this
one
just
did
not
compare
to
the
latter
too
bitter
even
for
wild
cherries
do
not
expect
this
to
taste
like
the
fake
sweet
cherries
you
get
in
the
syrup
no
head
lacing
or
carbonation
more
like
cough
medicine
than
a
fruit
lambic
slàinte
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
as
an
occasional
brew
paired
with
a
dessert
but
i
dont
think
i
could
make
it
a
session
brew
after
awhile
the
tartness
numbs
my
taste
buds
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
shared
a
750
with
fellow
ba
mtanji
poured
a
reddishpurple
color
with
head
comparable
to
a
grape
soda
smell
is
of
mint
taste
is
of
a
slightly
tart
wine
cooler
left
a
nice
taste
in
the
mouth
but
nothing
that
resembled
a
malt
beverage
easy
drinking
enjoyed
it
with
shrimp
and
scallop
kabobs
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
probably
will
not
try
it
again
watched
michael
jacksons
burgundies
of
belgium
while
we
drank
it
a
big
thick
raw
hotdarkpink
head
leaves
sticky
rings
of

the

a

blackcurrant
up

the

and

with
a
little
medecine
quite
tart
blackcurrant
in
the
finish
and
a
little
funky
sour
this
isnt
bad
maybe
the
best
least
sweet
of
the
four
for
me
still
needs
more
lambic
less
fruit
juice
ruddy
brownish
red
appearance
essentially
opaque
thin
fizzy
head
of
a
dirty
dark
pink
hue
scant

just
a
few
dots
aroma
is
interesting
currant
fruitiness
but
with
prickly
black
pepper
and
vinegary
sense
like
in
louisiana
hot
sauce
taste
is
essentially
tart
and
as
someone
who
ate
a
ton
of
homemade
currant
jelly
as
a
kid
thats
whats
happening
here
slight
undercutting
yeastiness
not
overly
sweet
but
not
biting
lambic
and
fruit
seeem
to
meld
as
far
as
i
can
tell
aftertaste
sticks
with
you
but
doesnt
last
for
hours
eh
ok
spiciness
and
aroma
are
noteworthy
for
me
a
great
dessert
beer
either
by
itself
or
accompanying
a
tart
fruit
pie
cobbler
or
sorbet
lindemans
cassis
may
not
be
a
classic
or
a
traditional
lambic
to
a
style
purist
but
that
means
nothing
to
me
im
a
purist
when
it
comes
to
some
things
but
im
not
so
rigid
when
it
comes
to
beer
although
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
all
that
often
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
fruit
beer
thats
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
not
a
huge
list
mind
you
ill
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
before
anything
else
drinkability
and
overall
while
this
is
definitly
not
lindemans
best
offering
this
is
stilla
beer
i
could
enjoy
all
night
its
so
authentic
tasting
i
think
a
little
bit
of
age
would
really
give
this
the
kick
it
needs
to
be
phenomenal
the
body
is
very
thick
and
coarse
not
syrupy
but
still
a
kind
of
body
that
leaves
a
film
of
sugar
on
your
tongue
poured
an
opaque
ice
tea
brown
with
shades
of
garnet
and
blue
thin
layer
of
foam
on
the
top
but
no
head
otherwise
pomegranate
peach
and
maybe
strawberry
rhubarb
pie
were
the
aromas
i
detected
the
taste
was
peach
and
pomegranate
again
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
similar
to
champagne
or
carbonated
juice
this
beer
is
good
and
fruity
one
id
drink
occasionally
with
a
pie
probably
overall
impression
dessert
anyone
this
is
a
nice
celebration
beer
a
good
way
to
finish
a
huge
meal
far
too
sweet
for
a
session
but
enjoyable
enough
to
create
a
good
reason
to
pop
a
bottle
seek
brethren
seek
and
know
actually
nicely
drinkable
perfect
for
a
summer
afternoon
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
where
my
experience
began
to
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
it
tasted
like
a
cheap
wine
and
after
a
few
acclimatizing
drinks
it
began
to
taste
like
a
juicy
juice
despite
the
fact
that
it
tasted
like
a
kids
juice
and
has
a
low
abv
the
drinkability
is
very
low
i
dont
think
i
will
experiment
with
any
more
lambics
in
the
future
i
sampled
the
typical
small
bottlefoil
cork
capnice
arty
label
pours
a
great
plummy
color
cloudy
light
purple
head
leaving
oodles
of
classic
lacing
nose
is
fruity
musty
horsey
i
love
wild
yeast
this
is
a
dryer
lambic
then
the
others
ive
had
recently
not
as
sweet
more
sour
and
tart
notes
of
plums
and
sour
berries
quite
dry
in
the
long
lasting
finish
complex
and
intriguing
worth
a
try
to
expand
your
beer
horizons
except
for
their
traditional
gueuze
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
lindemans
line
this
is
fun
for
once
in
a
while
in
fact
i
might
bring
some
of
this
home
for
the
holidays
to
replace
wine
drinkability

this
was
very
entertaining
to
consume
and
clearly
the
liveliest
of
the
lindemans
family
ive
had
to
date
it
is
juicier
than
its
lindy
cousins
and
probably
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
although
i
think
ive
rated
them
all
about
the
same
the
tartness
at
the
end
stands
out
the
most
it
was
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
thought
it
would
be
it
was
sweet
but
just
not
sweet
it
was
a
good
balance
between
the
tartness
and
sweetness
pours
a
reddishpurple
color
well
carbonated
with
a
large
head
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
some
fruit
the
flavor
is
tart
as
expected
with
some
grape
or
dark
berries
very
sweet
and
tart
but
very
enjoyable
as
well
if
it
werent
so
expensive
id
get
this
more
often
it
poured
a
deep
rubypurpleish
color
with
a
bizzare
looking
pinkish
tinged
white
foam
cap
that
quickly
dissolved
now
i
cant
recall
ever
having
black
currants
in
my
life
but
i
assume
this
brew
smells
a
lot
like
them
very
fruity
in
the
nose
with
only
a
slight
hint
damn
of
that
brett
funkiness
that
i
love
so
much
a
tart
fruity
taste
is
the
first
thing
noticable
but
it
quickly
finishes
very
sweet
there
is
a
very
slight
hint
of
some
musty
flavors
in
this
beer
as
well
if
it
was
possible
for
those
musty
notes
to
become
more
predominant
id
love
this
lambic
overall
im
definately
glad
that
i
purchased
this
and
i
will
probably
be
buying
it
more
in
the
future
as
its
availability
cant
be
beat
pours
a
nice
deep
rose
color
the
nose
is
distinctly
sweet
black
currant
as
i
would
have
expected
there
is
a
nice
sourness
and
a
tart
black
currant
fruit
flavor
on
this
there
is
also
a
sweetness
almost
a
bit
too
much
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
nice
dancing
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
i
could
drink
a
whole
small
bottle
in
a
sitting
and
be
content
a
great
beer
that
would
be
a
great
transitional
beer
for
wine
lovers
i
highly
recomend
this
to
anyone
with
good
taste
medium
bodied
i
couldnt
get
through
a
glass
of
this
pours
a
clouded
strawberrypurplish
color
with
a
decent
pink
to
mauve
colored
head
strong
odors
of
currant
and
grapeskins
sourish
yet
sweet
smelling
only
a
faint
whiff
of
something
resembling
a
lambic
tastes
mostly
sweet
and
tart
its
taste
is
reminiscent
of
some
strong
dark
berries
theres
some
viney
acidity
which
is
welcome
my
go
to
in
the
fruited
lindemans
line
of
lambics
which
are
all
overly
sugared
for
their
root
styles
im
not
a
wine
drinker
at
all
sulfites
and
i
dont
agree
however
this
is
always
good
to
pull
out
to
a
wine
drinker
that
doesnt
drink
beer
i
drank
this
beer
with
friends
after
a
trapist
beer
tasting
this
beer
was
preceded
by
a
bottle
of
two
philosiphers
even
though
it
was
a
big
change
in
style
everyone
at
the
table
enjoyed
it
its
a
very
sour
beer
with
strong
fruity
currant
smells
a
great
dessert
beer
drinkability
other
than
the
aftertaste
is
good
easy
to
drink
but
would
only
have
one
and
would
definitely
have
my
next
selection
ordered
before
i
finished
this
one
this
is
the
third
lindemans
lambic
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
i
dont
quite
know
what
to
think
about
this
one
it
has
a
bit
of
a
musty
dank
basement
smell
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
and
a
bit
grape
the
taste
is
remniscent
of
a
damp
musty
basement
aswell
although
there
is
quite
a
bit
more
grape
in
the
taste
than
there
is
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
also
very
dry
like
brut
champagne
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
in
that
the
level
of
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
all
in
all
not
bad
but
the
musty
damp
basement
thing
is
certainly
an
obstacle
to
overcome
which
is
why
it
got
a
3
5
on
drinkability
pours
a
grapepurple
color
with
creamy
pink
head
that
sticks
around
leaving
nice
lacing
sweettart
berry
aroma
with
an
earthy
woody
character
bold
flavor
mostly
berry
black
currant
sweet
sour
tart
and
juicy
some
herbal
and
earthy
notes
are
also
present
good
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
tartness
light
in
body
smooth
and
crisp
highly
drinkable
and
more
complex
then
some
of
lindemans
other
lambics
give
this
a
try
this
brew
is
a
grape
colored
beverage
with
a
with
frosted
head
on
top
the
scent
is
very
tart
as
with
the
other
lindemans
up
to
now
the
only
lambics
ive
gotten
into
the
taste
assaults
your
tounge
and
the
buds
come
alive
berry
flavors
a
unique
sweet
drink
poured
out
a
grape
color
with
a
ton
of
head
on
this
beer
wonderful
smell
of
currents
in
this
beer
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
a
nice
tart
sting
to
it
which
is
nice
a
nice
flow
of
currents
blended
in
with
some
carbonation
a
good
beer
to
have
with
some
dessert
the
flavor
is
a
bright
not
overly
sweet
fruit
of
currents
followed
shortly
by
tartness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
my
best
comparison
is
that
it
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
cranberry
juice
cocktail
mixed
with
champagne
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
negative
sense
i
am
just
having
a
hard
time
finding
better
words
for
it
the
tartness
did
not
have
the
overwhelming
pucker
of
some
ive
had
which
to
me
means
its
a
better
balance
of
sensations
i
enjoyed
it
refreshing
and
nice
tart
good
fruit
but
i
probably
wouldnt
want
a
lot
of
these
let
me
just
say
that
after
comparing
the
lindemans
lineup
to
the
cantillons
ive
tried
im
a
bit
confused
i
think
cantillon
is
the
traditionalist
while
lindemans
has
made
some
mighty
fine
dessert
beers
however
i
saw
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
cantillon
in
the
cassis
offering
leaving
me
more
impressed
than
the
other
fruit
flavored
lambics
ive
tasted
appearance
purple
ruby
tone
with
an
effervescent
pink
head
lacing
even
with
each
sip
very
nice
not
much
retention
though
aroma
tart
winey
tones
with
an
herbal
musty
earthiness
very
solid
by
far
the
most
complex
smelling
lindemans
product
ive
had
taste
tart
grapes
currants
sweet
but
herbal
notes
this
is
an
awesome
tasting
lambic
sourness
is
perfect
not
as
lip
puckering
as
a
cantillon
but
not
as
candy
as
the
kriek
framboise
or
peche
mouthfeel
spritzy
and
light
to
medium
bodied
very
bubbly
solid
drinkability
this
one
contains
the
best
balance
for
me
cantillon
is
great
but
so
sour
and
the
other
fruit
infused
lambics
from
lindemans
are
overly
sweet
this
is
the
overall
ideal
lambic
for
me
id
love
this
if
i
liked
black
currants
even
so
this
is
very
good
and
a
nice
change
from
the
cherry
flavors
im
used
to
its
a
great
aperitif
for
our
chinese
new
year
celebration
this
makes
a
good
dessert
beer
drink
it
alone
or
with
vanilla
ice
cream
i
didnt
know
what
black
currants
tasted
like
but
i
tried
this
one
anyway
because
i
never
had
it
and
wanted
to
try
it
so
it
was
so
pretty
in
the
glass
for
starters
a
deep
purplered
colour
with
a
nice
pink
head
i
actually
wasnt
turned
on
by
the
smell
at
all
i
honestly
thought
it
smelled
musty
like
i
was
inhaling
the
dusty
outside
of
the
bottle
but
then
maybe
that
makes
it
more
like
the
traditional
lambics
than
other
lindemans
lambics
anyway
i
got
over
the
smell
and
finally
took
a
sip
and
after
a
second
i
loved
it
in
the
1st
second
it
was
almost
too
much
tasted
like
berries
you
might
find
in
the
woods
that
youre
not
supposed
to
eat
but
then
i
got
over
that
and
it
was
just
great
it
tasted
very
fresh
like
something
in
the
woods
i
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
it
really
fresh
fruity
tart
berryish
tasty
i
think
i
made
a
sour
face
but
no
worse
than
eating
a
sourpatch
kid
like
it
was
a
sweettart
kind
of
feel
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
not
too
thick
and
not
thin
at
all
drinkability
well
even
though
i
loved
the
taste
it
would
get
to
be
to
much
if
i
drank
it
all
night
splitting
a
bottle
is
enough
for
one
evening
but
id
drink
it
again
any
day
i
willingly
overpaid
for
this
12ounce
bottle
in
omaha
7
00
this
brew
was
a
lovely
dark
purple
colour
with
a
small
head
of
foam
the
aromas
were
of
black
currants
sugar
and
more
the
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
quite
lovely
and
reminscent
of
a
black
currant
cough
drop
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
astringent
but
nice
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
drinkability
a
nice
desert
beer
how
many
ales
or
any
drink
for
that
matter
are
currant
flavored
serve
something
different
to
friends
deep
red
in
color
that
you
can
see
through
with
a
large
pink
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
disipate
very
carbonated
there
is
a
very
fruity
and
aromatic
smell
that
is
a
little
too
strong
for
me
the
taste
starts
sweet
and
ends
tart
not
very
bitter
at
the
end
but
yet
very
sweet
to
start
with
its
a
little
too
fruity
for
me
but
thats
what
i
ecxpected
if
you
want
somethingfruity
this
is
worth
the
price
deep
cranberry
in
color
with
an
attractive
creamy
pink
head
not
nearly
the
super
dark
extracted
color
of
the
framboise
aromas
hint
mildly
of
garden
mint
and
sweet
brambly
cassis
fruit
some
tartness
in
the
mouth
yet
still
aimed
at
the
international
marketthough
not
much
as
the
framboise
however
if
this
steers
a
person
in
the
direction
and
or
perpares
the
palate
for
the
likes
of
cantillon
this
brew
has
carved
its
niche
should
be
widely
appreciated
the
aroma
of
friut
lambics
always
suprises
me
other
fruit
beers
often
seem
artificial
and
overdone
not
a
good
friut
lambic
of
course
i
always
seem
to
think
that
theyre
more
fun
to
smell
than
to
drink
no
difference
here
deep
purple
almost
black
color
with
a
dark
lavender
head
charachteristic
tartness
and
candylike
sweetness
very
fizzy
and
very
thin
this
one
was
an
adventure
to
drink
dark
purple
color
medium
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
berryish
kind
of
sweet
and
grapelike
at
the
start
yields
to
some
tartness
at
the
finish
very
carbonated
if
not
for
the
malts
and
the
tartness
at
the
finish
i
would
think
i
was
drinking
a
soda
pop
probably
the
least
beer
like
of
the
3
fruit
lindemans
lambics
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
tart
and
slightly
sweet
im
not
sure
what
currants
taste
like
but
im
getting
something
that
smells
and
tastes
like
grapefruits
or
an
alcohol
sweet
tart
i
was
a
bit
put
off
at
first
but
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
enjoy
it
where
do
i
start
this
is
my
first
lambic
it
pours
a
deep
purple
and
has
an
enormous
head
that
really
lasts
the
aroma
of
currants
dominates
everything
about
this
it
gives
you
that
pucker
you
expect
without
overdoing
it
and
finishes
nicely
the
more
you
drink
the
more
the
complex
flavors
start
presenting
themselves
this
is
a
great
after
dinner
sunday
afternoon
kick
back
and
relax
drink
looking
forward
to
trying
lindemans
other
lambics
pours
a
grapey
purple
color
with
a
tall
creamy
light
purple
colored
head
that
fades
into
a
creamy
and
sticky
lace
nose
is
medicinal
with
notes
of
mint
and
cough
syrup
moderate
in
body
and
quite
tangy
taste
starts
off
with
a
candylike
sweetness
a
juicy
fruitiness
and
fresh
jam
followed
by
a
strong
tartness
with
notes
of
black
currants
the
sweetness
and
tartness
balance
each
other
very
nicely
if
you
like
sweet
tarts
you
should
enjoy
this
brew
a
fine
beer
for
sunday
brunch
this
beautifully
plum
colored
lambic
has
a
nice
dry
fruity
aroma
with
staying
power
medium
in
body
and
low
in
the
hop
department
reminiscent
of
a
dry
fruity
wine
dry
oak
with
residual
sweetness
and
ripe
berries
up
front
and
a
tart
jam
finish
fairly
complex
despite
the
lack
of
an
alcoholic
presence
behold
the
rose
head
pours
a
deep
purple
with
a
nice
pinkish
head
the
black
currant
flavors
are
ever
forward
and
tasty
slightly
sweet
and
nicely
tart
this
is
a
fine
brew
i
love
black
currant
and
this
brew
just
adds
to
that
love
affair
this
is
my
first
lambic
and
im
stoked
on
it
i
hope
the
other
lambics
im
bound
to
try
will
be
good
too
pours
a
murky
dark
purpleish
color
the
head
in
enormously
pinkish
lighter
pinkish
the
aroma
is
wonderful
its
black
currants
mixed
with
mustiness
the
mustiness
is
kind
of
faint
behind
all
of
the
sweet
n
sour
tug
of
war
going
on
but
its
nice
to
notice
this
tastes
more
like
a
lambic
than
just
fruit
juice
with
carbonation
like
some
of
the
others
are
like
enjoyable
nonetheless
this
one
has
that
certain
musty
character
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
quite
enjoyable
the
highly
sour
super
tart
black
currant
flavor
obviously
is
dominative
a
wonderful
lambic
from
lindemans
i
enjoy
the
kriek
more
still
the
sweet
tooth
in
me
i
guess
the
high
point
of
this
beer
was
when
it
was
still
in
the
bottle
after
pouring
this
ruby
purple
color
beer
with
a
light
purple
head
everything
after
that
was
down
hill
the
smell
was
overpowering
and
i
had
a
feeling
i
was
smelled
eucalyptus
oil
the
taste
was
well
after
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
which
tasted
very
tart
and
had
a
sour
taste
that
puckered
my
tongue
to
my
stomach
this
beer
from
lindemans
is
there
absolute
worst
brew
one
sip
and
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
no
kiding
it
tasted
like
sour
puckering
tart
eucaluptus
leaves
there
might
have
been
berries
but
i
couldnt
find
them
the
cassis
is
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
an
excellent
dessert
beer
nonetheless
i
highly
recommend
every
lambic
in
the
lindemans
line
the
color
is
a
rare
to
me
deep
purple
color
with
the
head
portly
and
the
remaining
lace
nice
clinging
sheets
nose
has
hints
of
yeast
black
currants
and
malt
also
a
light
sweet
and
sour
tone
present
quite
different
front
is
sweet
with
the
grape
taste
quite
evident
and
a
skimpy
top
the
finish
is
highly
acidic
with
little
or
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
a
real
change
of
pace
once
again
a
good
after
dinner
drink
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bottle
conditioned
ruby
body
almost
purple
tinged
with
a
thin
and
creamy
light
pink
head
that
holds
very
well
and
leaves
some
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
quite
bold
with
a
tart
and
sugarysweet
berry
aroma
thats
laced
with
some
earthy
and
musty
lambic
character
this
is
surprising
since
most
of
the
lindemans
products
seem
to
be
almost
completely
devoid
of
lambic
character
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
an
exceptionally
fine
carbonation
the
flavor
is
huge
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
other
than
just
intense
black
currant
its
tart
sour
sweet
ripe
juicy
fruity
the
tartness
predominates
in
the
finish
and
it
dries
out
fairly
quickly
at
first
i
found
this
to
be
my
least
favorite
of
the
lindemans
line
but
ive
come
to
appreciate
it
for
its
uniqueness
it
makes
a
better
apertif
than
afterdinner
drink
although
it
can
be
enjoyed
just
as
any
sweet
wine
might
be
a
little
more
purple
than
the
framboise
it
was
also
more
dry
than
the
other
lindemans
fruit
lambics
a
little
medicinal
in
the
beginning
the
taste
at
the
begining
is
very
tart
compared
to
the
others
but
the
more
you
drink
you
begin
to
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
currants
this
was
a
pinkish
amber
or
it
was
karrant
anyway
this
was
great
the
color
was
good
and
the
head
was
a
pinkish
color
also
that
left
a
little
bit
of
a
lace
behind
the
smell
of
the
fruit
was
very
strong
it
tasted
like
cotton
candy
from
the
fair
the
sourness
make
its
a
little
hard
to
drink
these
badboys
down
for
a
while
and
of
coarse
the
price
did
not
help
either
13
dollars
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
medim
red
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
left
a
little
lace
it
had
a
nice
aroma
of
currents
and
little
bit
of
malt
the
flavor
was
of
currents
and
slightly
of
malt
the
finish
was
tangy
with
current
elements
this
one
tends
to
be
a
touch
sour
as
opposed
to
the
framboise
i
like
currents
and
was
hoping
that
it
would
hold
up
as
well
as
the
framboise
but
the
sour
aspect
hurt
it
some
dark
purple
color
big
black
currant
aroma
alongside
an
oaky
earthy
smells
sweet
tart
fruity
currant
flavor
effervescent
mouthfeel
a
nice
treat
one
is
plenty
though
when
poured
into
a
champagne
flute
and
slowly
sipped
yikes
well
this
stuff
smells
great
like
fruit
punch
the
appearance
is
a
deep
reddish
purple
looks
like
carbonated
wine
the
smell
is
quite
powerful
and
the
beer
has
a
thick
red
head
on
the
top
i
guess
thats
the
proof
that
it
truly
is
beer
the
taste
was
not
too
great
and
was
far
too
sweet
for
me
some
may
enjoy
this
but
as
one
who
rarely
drinks
wines
or
champagnes
i
will
stick
to
beer
that
tastes
like
beer
the
rocky
light
pink
head
tops
an
attractive
slightly
hazy
deep
ruby
hued
brew
belgian
lace
is
left
down
the
glass
sugary
black
currant
aroma
w
a
hint
of
tartness
the
lack
of
complex
wet
horse
brettanomyces
in
atoma
as
typical
for
style
is
lacking
in
this
brew
leaving
the
aroma
akin
to
that
of
a
wine
cooler
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
borderline
overbearing
sugary
one
dimensional
sweetness
while
the
tartness
is
perceptible
in
the
finish
the
black
currant
flavor
is
quite
assertive
and
when
coupled
with
the
sweetness
leaves
me
with
the
impression
that
ive
just
tasted
a
carbonated
wine
cooler
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
lambic
it
lacks
the
tartness
and
complexity
of
a
true
lambic
and
is
cloyingly
sweet
nothing
ventured
nothing
gained
not
recommended
at
all
definatly
something
to
try
youd
be
suprised
how
good
black
currants
can
taste
when
infused
into
an
ale
good
with
indian
food
notes
a
treat
with
complexities
and
very
drinkable
drink
as
you
would
a

champagne
or
a
prize

red

with
a
clingy
foamy
pinkish
sheen
soft
berry
scent
has
a
huge
burst
of
sweettart
frit
flavor
with
a
very
dry
finish
your
tongue
is
left
dry
and
wanting
to
drink
more
of
the
desert
at
once
i
first
tried
this
a
week
ago
at
a
tasting
in
phila
and
had
to
go
out
a
buy
a
bottle
this
week
to
taste
again
it
is
still
great
not
quite
as
sweet
as
their
other
lambics
great
to
finish
off
a
date
if
i
was
allowed
to
date
kind
of
like
drinking
ribena
which
means
its
very
drinkable
but
not
complex
in
any
way
it
was
ok
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruity
beers
but
not
bad
for
a
lambic
started
sour
and
finished
sweet
and
not
too
bubbly
on
the
mouthfeel
a
drinkable
kriek
but
most
likely
a
one
time
deal
delicious
sour
tasting
beer
with
a
red
hue
very
tasty
this
is
for
the
2015
version
while
the
look
was
pleasing
and
different
the
smell
was
nice
the
taste
was
weird
trying
to
have
the
sour
taste
of
la
follie
spelling
might
be
off
it
also
attempted
to
have
the
taste
of
wine
which
kind
of
threw
me
the
feel
was
thin
and
hard
on
the
tongue
overall
i
gave
it
a
3
75
i
would
not
buy
it
again
though
overall
very
nice
though
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
the
tastes
of
both
the
golden
ale
and
the
kriek
are
both
recognizable
a
little
more
tart
would
be
better
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
mediocre
an
uninteresting
one
note
lambic
that
is
not
worth
trying
nice
tart
cherry
aroma
blandish
flavor
dry
with
just
hints
of
cherries
spicy
aftertaste
disappointing
taste
medicinal
and
not
in
that
good
lambic
aged
way
faint
nose
the
finish
is
empty
this
is
a
soulless
encapsulation
of
capitalism
and
other
pretentious
completely
unrelated
beer
things
2015
version
with
oud
beersel
tastes
like
new
belgium
got
all
of
the
leftover
oud
beersel
lambic
barrels
that
were
unblendable
racked
them
onto
some
old
sweaty
gym
socks
for
a
few
months
pasteurized
then
spiked
with
robitussin
cough
syrup
at
bottling
overall
this
brew
isnt
screaming
anything
to
me
its
not
adventurous
not
taking
you
to
a
new
level
of
lambic
goodness
its
like
someone
put
watered
down
sour
cherry
flavored
syrup
into
a
bottle
of
steel
reserve
hey
atleast
steel
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
cheaper
than
this
swill
and
doesnt
proclaim
to
be
craft
beer
mediocre
at
best
i
cannot
recommend
this
brew
tart
cherry
in
aroma
and
flavor
though
the
consensus
is
it
could
be
more
tart
disappointingly
tasteless
slight
cherryish
taste
faint
nose
unsatisifying
ending
overall
pretty
good
kriek
nothing
in
your
face
great
gateway
sour
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
not
love
it
poured
into
a
westy
chalice
a
very
nice
cleanclear
light
ruby
red
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
pretty
nice
white
fizzy
head
leaves
some
nice
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
tart
kinda
yeasty
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
tart
some
cherry
notes
medium
body
at
8
abv
it
is
hidden
very
very
very
well
with
a
slight
dry
finish
overall
a
tasty
brew
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
a
lambickriek
brew
just
might
buy
it
again
even
if
its
for
the
cool
looking
color
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
fruit
in
the
intial
taste
with
semitart
cherry
quality
with
a
light
malt
flavor
which
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
mild
sour
flavor
of
yeast
in
the
finish
which
is
pleasantly
dry
the
cherry
has
a
fresh
flavor
without
any
harsh
acidity
and
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
malt
body
is
mostly
dry
which
balances
the
fruit
with
a
slight
bready
flavor
overall
this
is
a
very
decent
fruit
beer
not
as
intense
as
expected
considering
the
collaborator
yet
it
is
very
drinkable
and
would
definitely
enjoy
this
again
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
drink
its
got
a
lot
to
make
you
ponder
but
its
flavors
dont
quite
do
the
trick

for

it
would

worked
much

in

i
enjoyed

and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
in
the
future
if
i
want
a
similar
drinking
experience
to
this
id
rather
just
drink
straight
boon

overall
enjoyable
good

my

but
lots
of

total
3450
o
nice
attempt
by
an
american
brewery
at
a
belgian
classic
my
first
lambic
from
the
usa
it
feels
midway
between
a
dry
lambic
like
cantillons
and
a
sweetened
version
like
lindemans
got
in
raleigh
wholefoods
drank
in
clyde
nc
this
was
a
pleasure
to
share
with
friends
the
8
abv
was
hidden
as
this
drinks
so
easily
pours
dark
red
with
pink
2
finger
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
sour
cherry
dominates
the
nose
as
expected
sour
notes
are
definitely
there
initial
taste
is
all
over
sweet
cherry
sour
cherry
and
some
earthy
notes
maybe
leather
i
like
mouthfeel
is
full
creamy
even
with
a
pretty
low
carbonation
on
it
overall
its
a
solid
kreik
it
tastes
like
it
should
in
my
opinion
and
is
right
there
with
the
any
straight
belgian
kreik
ive
ever
had
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
lambic
good
fruity
notes
with
a
balanced
tartness
and
sweetness
pours
a
beautiful
translucent
cranberry
red
with
a
luscious
pink
head
the
nose
is
distinctly
cherry
with
floral
notes
the
mouth
feel
is
active
and
rich
due
to
nice
carbonation
there
is
a
nice
cherry
taste
upfront
that
isnt
too
sweet
or
artificial
tasting
the
end
taste
is
moderately
sour
but
not
mouth
puckering
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
brew
and
a
great
way
to
end
a
meal
bottle
share
at
proof
looks
like
carbonated

i
wish
this
had
more
of

something
to
play
with
the

the

pours
a
clear

beeresqe

flavor
is
extremely
dry
extremely
strong
cherry
tone
medicinal
funk
its
bone
dry
though
that
being
the
main
thing
you
notice
here
a
very
good
and
old
world
beer
a
fairly
edgy
tart
and
somewhat
complex
kriek
ale
the
cherry
definitely
in
charge
but
it
seems
to
have
a
multiple
personality
disorder
as
it
wafts
from
fruity
to
woody
to
yeasty
in
its
impression
not
an
overly
bad
thing
but
it
makes
the
blend
appear
to
not
really
be
working
something
interesting
to
sip
on
in
the
nice
front
range
autumn
sunshine
so
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
here
as
the
retail
bottle
price
seems
a
bit
steep
from
what
ive
heard
poured
from
650
ml
bomber
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
52114
bought
locally
in
austin
at
specs
all
the
components
of
a
classic
kriek
are
here
yet
nothing
really
pops
somewhat
mediocre
bottle
from
tipples
pours
bright
ruby
reddish
almost
fuscoa
purple
with
a
pretty
pink
head
that
fizzes
out
after
about
a
minute
aroma
is
dry
wheat
malt
sweet
maraschino
cherries
not
a
lot
more
here
but
pleasant
enough
flavor
has
no
real
sourness
expected
from
the
style
but
not
medicinal
light
tartness
if
i
look
hard
for
it
seems
like
an
amped
up
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
cherry
juice
and
malt
are
dominant
with
almost
a
bit
of
a
lager
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
slightly
slick
with
low
plus
carbonation
not
an
unpleasant
or
offensive
beer
by
any
means
but
its
hard
to
believe
that
the
same
brewery
made
both
this
am
la
folie
o
a
good
looking
brew
but
just
not
100
there
in
the
taste
its
just
missing
that
funk
that
makes
a
good
lambic
great
and
a
kriek
jump
out
and
smack
you
in
the
face
this
is
definitely
fruity
but
has
that
sour
beer
brett
funk
that
could
make
it
a
great
beer
rather
than
a
different
and
unique
brew
which
it
is
just
not
anywhere
near
other
american
wilds
or
belgian
sours
i
enjoyed
this
sour
overall
its
a
great
layer
of
flavors
o
overall
not
bad
but
much
better
beers
out
there
it
kind
of
falls
off
in
the
middle
of
the
drink
and
then
come
back
in
the
finish
o
as
some
other
reviewers
have
asked
i
have
no
idea
where
the
bad
reviews
are
coming
from
the
label
says
kriek
its
a
belgian
sour
beer
is
this
typical
new
belgium
nope
is
it
a
proper
rendering
of
the
belgian
kriek
style
absolutely
so
its
pricey
so
are
most
really
good
belgians
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
well
done
o
no
one
at
the
tasting
was
really
impressed
with
this
mismatched
brew
we
had
the
la
folie
afterwards
and
really
liked
it
but
the
transatlantic
is
a
miss
obase
of
this
beer
just
doesnt
come
through
for
me
the
cherry
flavor
is
actually
decent
but
sweetness
comes
through
and
no
base
makes
this
miss
for
me
pours
out
a
brilliant
clear
red
with
a
light
pink
head
smells
of
fruit
country
wine
cherries
and
grain
malt
body
is
a
bit
grainy
but
the
flavor
of
fermented
cherry
is
great
alcohol
is
extremely
wellhidden
sweet
up
front
but
tart
and
dry
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
body
with
some
prickly
carbonation
im
loving
this
beer
and
im
having
a
hard
time
figuring
out
the
low
ratings
are
people
expecting
sweet
cherry
bullshit
lindemans
ive
never
been
one
for
looks
if
it
tastes
good
this
beer
honestly
poors
like
cranberry
juice
with
a
pink
head
its
unusual
i
had
this
beer
early
on
when
i
was
just
beginning
to
like
beer
and
it
was
offputting
but
i
saw
a
bottle
and
i
hadnt
seen
it
for
a
while
so
i
tried
it
wow
now
that
im
used
to
beers
being
tart
i
am
just
again
pleased
with
new
belgium
its
not
too
tart
but
it
definitely
scratches
the
itch
for
one
the
cherry
flavor
is
a
complement
not
overpowering
extremely
pleased
and
a
little
surprised
o
wishing
for
more
tartness
and
cherry
character
not
one
id
revisit
poured
from
bottle
to
flute
glass
intense
red
in
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
pinkish
foam
pleasent
aroma
of
cherry
gives
way
to
a
light
bodied
tingly
efervecense
and
a
rubbish
dryness
to
wrap
it
all
up
sadly
the
taste
leaves
much
to
desire
since
it
s
almost
nonexistent
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pink
bubbly
foam
head
both
large
bubbles
and
smaller
ones
ruby
red
body
darkish
pink
i
loved
the
smell
tart
cranberries
sour
cherries
a
little
sour
apples
little
balsamic
oakiness
cherry
pie
definitely
fruity
taste
followed
the
noise
though
in
a
subtler
less
sour
manner
than
expected
fruity
for
sure
with
slight
funk
notes
though
maybe
i
was
reaching
quite
sweet
though
i
wouldnt
say
overtly
artificial
like
other
reviews
have
but
really
quite
fruity
not
syruppy
in
either
flavour
or
mouthfeel
which
was
medium
and
smooth
i
think
i
would
have
wanted
the
carbonation
a
little
tighter
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
light
on
the
sour
more
sweet
and
gentle
tart
fruit
notes
but
really
enjoyable

man
i
heard
this
was
not

great
but
this
is
almost
offensive
given
the
price
tag
of
14
as
well
did
they
blend
the
boon
kriek
with
their
fat
tire
amber
ale
by
any
chance
none
of
the
curious
and
rustic
aspects
of
the
lambic
come
through
here
worst
off
it
just
tastes
bizarre
and
reeks
of
offflavors
this
has
to
objectively
be
one
of
the
weirdest
and
simultaneously
mediocre
beers
ive
ever
had
ill
be
extra
careful
about
trying
any
of
the
lips
of
faith
beers
in
the
future
overall
a
fair
attempt
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
its
not
stunningly
sweet
like
many
of
the
fruit
lambics
can
be
so
it
redeems
an
otherwise
lackluster
beer
not
bad
by
any
meansi
didnt
have
any
problem
finishing
the
whole
bottlebut
i
wouldnt
exert
myself
to
have
it
again

the

front
end
but
the
mid
to
late
palate
falls
quite
short
with
a
wet
compost
funk
that
comes
through
slightly
muddy
destroying
the
enjoyable
cherry
notes
not
bad
just
nothing
very
special
especially
based
on
the
price
low
c
d
this
was
a
mild
dessert
beer
but
the
scent
and
taste
and
body
were
all
a
little
disappointing
at
least
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
it
wasnt
much
worth
drinking
not
recommended
i
dont
care
for
the
style
but
i
keep
buying
them
hoping
to
find
one
i
like
im
still
looking
this
doesnt
look
or
smell
like
a
beer
doesnt
take
much
like
one
its
doesnt
go
down
easy
one
of
these
days
im
going
to
stop
buying
these
damned
things
m
medium
viscosity
with
very
small

mediumsized
bubbles
overall
a
little
too
light
in
flavor
for
the
style
if
you
were
just
introducing
someone
to
the
style
this
would
be
okay
but
falls
a
little
flat
compared
to
other
offerings
i
have
many
great
lambics
but
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
i
do
not
feel
the
same
way
about
other
beers
on
the
lips
of
faith
line
but
this
one
was
just
not
for
me
i
actually
did
not
finish
my
beer
which
is
rare
the
only
use
i
could
make
of
it
would
be
to
cook
with
it
overall
meh
very
light
for
a
kriek
very
light
sour
and
little
cherry
some
cough
syrup
flavors
too
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
dark
red
with
a
half
inch
light
pink
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
light
and
subtle
the
brew
smells
like
tart
cherries
breadygrainy
malt
and
a
bit
of
musty
funk
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
red
grapes
and
a
floral
flavor
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
little
watery
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
its
an
ok
beer
overall
but
at
16
49
a
bottle
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
should
have
grabbed
another
la
folie
instead
overall
i
cant
help
comparing
this
with
the
belle
royale
ive
been
drinking
recently
its
like
a
very
watered
down
version
of
that
beer
without
the
barrel
i
guess
thats
the
problem
with
drinking
lots
of
great
beers
the
standards
rise
nothing
bad
tasting
just
not
big
enough
flavours
in
a
beer
that
could
be
great
im
going
to
guess
that
profit
was
a
factor
in
this
one
as
far
as
the
amount
of
ingredients
goes
i
could
be
wrong
but
thats
what
it
tastes
like
to
me
d
just
really
digging
this
like
the
balance
of
ale
and
cherry
and
not
as
overpowering
in
the
abv
either
t
the
carbonation
here
feels
way
light
and
it
weighs
the
flavors
down
a
lot
thick
concord
grape
cherry
juice
and
cherry
skin
flavors
a
bit
of
a
cranberry
flavor
as
well
its
definitely
not
sour
and
barely
tart
theres
some
bitter
cherry
skin
on
the
finish
with
a
wave
of
smooth
grain
its
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
one
of
the
better
krieks
out
there
d
im
really
enjoying
this
more
cherry
flavor
than
acidity
but
again
i
am
enjoying
how
this
brew
came
out
cherry
pie
flavor
to
the
max
if
this
brew
had
a
bit
more
acidic
tart
nature
it
would
be
overthetop
overall
its
an
average
cherry
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
medicinal
flavors
that
some
other
kreiks
have
but
its
not
that
interesting
o
not
horrible
but
for
over
15
i
expected
more
the
beer
is
transparent
and
ruby
hued
with
an
inch
of
pinkish
purple
head
the
aroma
offers
sweet
cherry
juice
fruit
punch
shirley
temple
drinks
very
subtle
funk
the
flavor
brings
cherries
cherry
juice
lack
of
funk
wild
yeast
personality
complexity
etc
essentially
missing
the
characteristics
that
can
make
drinking
kriek
a
heavenly
experience
alcohol
begins
to
emerge
more
as
the
beer
warms
while
there
is
some
cherry
presence
this
beer
is
boring
and
uneventful
new
belgium
should
stop
cutting
corners
mass
producing
a
huge
lineup
and
get
back
to
focusing
on
quality
this
is
the
brewery
that
produced
corked
and
caged
la
folie
what
happened
o
very
drinkable
but
offers
little
in
flavor
with
a
second
opinion
was
described
as
natty
light
with
cherries
dissapointed
in
the
lack
of
aroma
and
flavor
appearance
and
carbonation
were
its
highlights
o
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
it
is
a
beer
that
includes
cherries
and
does
not
taste
like
cough
syrup
i
keep
comparing
it
to
wine
which
is
the
closest
thing
this
would
compare
to
it
is
an
ale
however
it
has
enough
flavor
that
i
get
way
more
fruit
character
than
beer
character
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
those
looking
for
a
nice
mellow
kriek
or
wine
drinkers
who
are
wanting
to
make
the
transition
to
beer
o
disappointed
with
this
beer
particularly
considering
how
good
the
la
folie
was
by
new
belgium
o
i
wish
it
was
had
more
acidity
and
a
concentrated
cherry
flavor
as
it
stands
its
dull
and
uninspiring
the
color
is
the
most
vibrant
thing
about
it
now
that
i
think
about
it
it
does
remind
me
of
a
boon
kriek
which
it
is
mixed
in
with
and
has
the
same
candy
artificiality
honestly
my
homebrew
attempt
at
a
kriek
was
better
o
new
belgiums
transatlantique
kriek
is
an
excellent
entrylevel
kriek
that
completely
abandons
the
sugary
fruit
beer
notion
and
focuses
on
engaging
real
cherry
flavor
and
tartness
with
very
subtle
yeast
funkiness
its
approachable
and
enjoyable
so
when
i
say
entrylevel

the

then
cherries
with

pretty
good
different
than
the
norm
and
not
overly
sweet
i
like
it
overall
i
do
not
like
this
beer
it
is
not
a
kriek
at
all
more
like
a

and
not
a
good
one
served

a

pink
with
a
two
finger
pink
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
a

slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherries
wood
earthy
and
very
subtle
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cherries
tart
wood
and
an
earthy
note
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
wasnt
that
bad
but
it
wasnt
that
great
either
the
flavor
profile
on
this
one
seemed
to
be
really
dilute
which
was
quite
unfortunate
if
i
am
honest
this
one
really
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
reasons
why
i
enjoy
cantillon
so
much
but
it
just
fell
short
worth
trying
to
say
that
you
have
but
i
would
leave
it
at
that
overall
i
like
what
the
lager
did
to
this
beer
it
took
away
some
of
the
sweetness
and
added
a
bit
of
complexity
worth
a
shot
overall
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
really
work
for
me
the
taste
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
the
cherry
notes
really
the
overall
taste
and
the
level
of
sourness
leaves
me
wanting
more
overall
it
was
ok
nothing
special
by
any
means
but
still
worth
trying
not
sure
what
i
expected
here
but
this
wasnt
quite
it
opinion
i
will
have
to
go
back
and
read
the
hype
on
this
beer
i
cant
recall
what
their
angle
is
but
this
beer
is
bordering
on
foofoo
when
you
set
it
up
next
to
le
terroir
or
la
folie
there
is
no
comparison
this
beer
is
mild
enough
to
appeal
to
a
lindemans
drinker
but
isnt
quite
as
sweet
overall
so
it
may
be
more
appealing
to
some
for
me
if
i
am
drinking
a
sour
beer
i
dont
want
there
to
be
any
doubt
i
prefer
to
pucker
up
and
have
the
enamel
cooked
off
my
teeth
this
beer
doesnt
do

i
would
have
guessed
and
fairly
dry
i
felt
like
i
was

a
cherry
soda
rather
than
a
kriek
lambic
this
is
one
beer
i
would
not
be
buying
again
anytime
soon
as
there
are
many
other
krieks
i
have
enjoyed
and
would
rather
have
with
the
exception
of
la
folie
all
of
the
lips
of
faith
beers
i
have
encountered
have
been
too
weak
in
flavor
that
is
not
to
say
that
they
are
watery
but
they
all
have
so
much
potential
transatlantique
kriek
has
the
same
issue
this
would
be
much
better
if
it
were
funkier
and
more
complex
d
l
ended
up
liking
this
more
than
i
was
told
i
would
its
pretty
subtle

to

it

the

against
the

an
okay
beer

if
im
going
with

id
prefer
la

preferably
cc
d
not
bad
for
a
sour
doesnt
taste
very
good
but
you
dont
tire
of
drinking
it
this
is
a
pretty
big
disappointment
the
beer
is
in
a
word
bland
pretty
fun
kriek
a
decently
dry
and
tart
version
of
the
style
somewhat
spicy
and
boozy
setting
it
a
little
apart
from
a
belgian
lemongrass
menthol
diacetyl
and
pale
malt
provide
the
backbone
somewhat
thin
on
the
body
end
but
its
buttressed
by
the
base
ale
this
is
a
good
drinker
with
some
noticeable
flaws
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
very
accurate
for
the
style
this
is
a
comfort
beer
without
being
too
hot
actually
the
heat
is
cloying
there
it
is
and
there
it
went
more
the
flavor
and
olfactory
of
alcohol
without
the
btus
who
knew
the
french
knew
how
to
cross
the
pond
just
wonderin
this
apparent
bit
of
proof
pours
a
slightly
hazy
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
cherry
ruby
red
grapefruit
and
what
seems
like
a
light
cocoa
the
taste
brings
in
more
cherry
along
with
some
oak
cedar
and
a
touch
of
dark
peach
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish

i
enjoyed
this
bit
o
kriek
its
nothing
mindblowing
but
pretty
tasty
nonetheless
d
very
sour
nice
sweet
pie
flavor
not
what
im
used
to
but
for
the
style
its
pretty
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
not
watery
the

tones
are
never
to
the
puckering
level
alcohol
is
nowhere
present
in
the
flavor
if
its
possible
the

mouthfeel
is
bland
the
beer
isnt
a

i
became
quickly
bored
with
it
this

was
a
major
let
down
ried
grapefruit
the
cherry
flavor
lingers
a
bit
after
the
finish

the

a

not
really
an

quality
there
is
no

d
this

once
you

past

this
would
be
a

to
give
to
someone
who
likes
wine
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
use
as
an
example
of
why
i
dont
take
new

seriously
pours
a

mild

some
cherries
not
offensive

medicinal
which
is
really
something
im
finding
after
about
10
krieks
today
its
difficult
to
pull
out
nuances
and
general
descriptors
here
my
notes
say
succeeds
in
being
not
sweet
fails
in
otherwise
succeeding
then
my
notes
just
say
a
bit
metallic
an
and
it
ends
there
another
classic
poured
like
an
opaque
blackcherry
soda
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
atop
a
translucent
dark
ruby
cherries
and
plum
made
up
the
bulk
of
the
aroma
with
little
else
other
than
the
fruity
aromas
nice
tart
notes
stand
out
over
the
cherry
sweetness
and
it
has
a
nice
boozy
warmth
to
it
lighter
body
than
the
abv
would
suggest
and
carbonation
faded
quickly
all
with
a
sour
aftertaste
went
down
a
bit
quickly
but
not
one
i
could
see
myself
drinking
all
the
time
d
pretty
easy
drinker
but
just
not
that
great
of
lambic
ill
try
it
again
if
they
rerelease
it
in
2011
this
is
a
decent
but
not
great
beer
i
enjoyed
it
for
the
most
part
as
far
as
the
flavor
is
concerned
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
of
everything
sourness
funk
cherries
etc
it
would
be
a
nice
introduction
to
sours
for
the
uninitiated
all
in
all
its
not
bad
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
topnotch
sour
look
elsewhere
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
it
goes
down
with
ease
and
is
pretty
silky
hmmm
medium
in
body
really
creamy
in
the
mouth
good
levels
of
carbonation
there
is
just
one
thing
wrong
with
this
beer
it
tastes
terrible
its
straight
lactic
acid
the
cherry
tartness
is
so
late
and
completely
absent
in
the
front
that
it
comes
off
as
medicinal
completely
its
like
cherry
candy
mixed
with
yogurt
not
my
thing
ive
had
a
lot
of
lambics
and
this
misses
the
mark
completely
there
is
no
citric
or
acetic
brightness
there
is
no
forward
cherry
flavor
or
sweetness
at
all
its
a
tart
mess
lactic
bomb
its
not
a
good
stand
alone
flavor
imo
parallel
beers
balance
it
with
fruit
or
make
the
sourness
harsher
with
additional
mixed
acids
this
tastes
like
an
amateurish
attempt
at
a
sour
ale
by
a
homebrewer
that
realized
that
if
he
just
added
1
ounce
of
lactic
acid
per
gallon
you
would
get
a
sour
beer
will
not
repeat
overall
not
drinkable
i
wont
finish
a
lot
of
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
on
there
are
much
better
lambics
out
there
notes
an
interesting
brew
and
unique
but
im
pretty
sure
i
could
tell
you
that
its
got
boon
in
it
dont
really
see
the
new
belgium
influence
on
the
beer
glad
i
bought
it
though
overall
i
am
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
and
i
am
curious
as
to
what
this
would
be
like
soured
blended
and
aged
overall
ok
for
14
most
likely
wont
be
buying
it
again
22oz
bottle
into
a
hopus
glass
pours
a
crisp
dark
ruby
red
with
a
thin
light
purple
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
cherry
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
loads
of
tart
cherry
with
an
interesting
malt
backbone
the
alcohol
in
this
one
is
not
that
noticeable
due
to
the
extreme
tartness
of
the
beer
this
is
an
interesting
lambic
but
it
does
not
begin
to
compare
with
its
true
belgian
counterparts
the
pour
was
a
delightful
carmine
red
with
a
thin
glass
edge
head
smells
of
cherries
with
a
light
malts
and
subtle
brandy
taste
is
fruity
with
a
light
tartness
overpowered
by
ligering
fructose
the
beer
does
have
a
slight
soda
feel
but
is
not
sickeningly
sweet
this
is
not
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
everyday
but
it
is
a
perfect
pairing
to
the
end
of
a
meal
or
as
an
introduction
of
belgium
krieks
for
a
signifcant
other
not
a
very
good
kriek
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
the
beer
is
a
dull
maroon
with
a
small
but
dissipating
white
head
somehow
the
look
fits
the
beer
the
aroma
is
mostly
cherries
but
not
terribly
clean
theres
some
cough
syrup
in
there
the
beer
is
also
a
bit
sweet
and
lacking
in
intensity
of
flavor
its
a
washed
out
kriek
thats
easy
to
drink
but
not
compelling
theres
some
sour
character
and
acidity
its
mildly
tart
on
the
palate
feel
seems
appropriate
good
enough
fruit
beer
d
pretty
good
nice
a
good
sour
hit
but
does
not
have
the
long
lingering
sourness
i
would
expect
the
finish
dry
and
very
clean
o
overall
this
looks
like
a
beer
my
wife
should
be
drinking
but
the
8
abv
makes
it
manly
enough
for
me
to
drink
with
familiar
people
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
home
drinkability
its
a
relatively
high
alcohol
lambic
but
having
one
bomber
of
these
in
an
evening
is
just
enough
this
is
a
really
well
put
together
beer
from
brewerij
boon
and
new
belgium
an
interesting
way
to
brew
a
beer
though
i
cant
imagine
it
being
that
cost
effective
ill
be
adding
this
to
my
crate
again
in
the
future
o
good
introduction
to
what
kriek
should
be
rather
than
the
artificial
candy
sweetness
of
another
more
well
known
brand
still
a
very
bland
offering
that
seems
to
want
to
please
everyone
and
succeeds
in
pleasing
very
few
transatlantic
kriek
was
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
for
me
as
i
said
before
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
there
isnt
anything
that
really
draws
me
to
it
either
when
it
is
priced
in
the
same
area
as
a
lot
of
belgians
that
are
pretty
good
beers
that
is
problem
d
goes
down
very
easy
nice
kick
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
one
that
i
could
sit
with
all
night
very
nice
d
while
this
isnt
the
most
true
to
style
beer
out
there
i
still
liked
it
for
the
most
part
la
folie
is
a
lot
better
but
hey
nb
is
trying
to
do
something
different
d
excellent
very
refreshing
sour
and
fruity
softly
cherrylike
with
some
very
mild
cough
syrup
kind
of
flavor
under
a
nice
sourness
soft
floralperfume
tones
soft
sweetness
finishes
softly
tart
tastes
good
feels
nice
good
drinkability
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
way
it
hides
the
8abv
this
has
the
potential
of
being
a
fantastic
high
rated
brew
from
a
company
that
knows
how
to
make
a
fantastic
sour
ale
d
i
am
not
very
impressed
with
this
kriek
its
rather
boring
i
enjoy
breweries
trying
more
obscure
beer
styles
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
one
particularly
when
the
style
is
referenced
this
doesnt
follow
it
well
for
11
99
a
bottle
i
was
even
more
disappointed
drinkability
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
starts
to
fatigue
as
it
gets
near
the
end
d
interesting
but
not
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
ok
this
should
be
a
good
beer
its
got
a
really
nice
kriek
in
there
somewhere
but
the
mix
isnt
doing
it
any
favors
they
ruined
a
perfectly
good
beer
by
getting
too
creative
disappointing
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
carbonation
is
above
average
but
perhaps
lower
then
it
should
be
for
the
style
drinkability
is
average
for
the
style
it
had
some
nice
cherry
flavors
but
tasted
more
like
a
cherry
juice
then
a
lambic
beer
why
mix
what
seems
to
be
a
perfectly
good
kriek
with
a
regular
ol
lager
totally
dilutes
the
tart
and
sour
aspects
of
a
lambic
you
can
tell
what
was
in
place
before
the
lager
addition
as
some
mild
acidic
and
sour
notes
are
there
that
said
it
is
still
plenty
enjoyable
and
is
by
far
the
most
chuggable
lambic
ever
created
the
cherry
flavors
taste
really
good
and
natural
slight
medicinal
sting
at
the
end
but
does
not
detract
from
the
beer
in
any
way
for
me
grainy
malts
are
expectedly
prevalent
and
lend
some
sweetness
to
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
great
and
glides
down
the
throat
with
ease
and
the
8
abv
is
nowhere
in
sight
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
and
will
not
have
any
problem
finishing
this
whole
bomber
by
myself
but
going
into
this
thinking
authentic
belgian
kriek
one
is
bound
to
be
disappointed
d
hmm
not
really
enjoying
this
beer
very
much
and
i
really
wanted
to
also
shouldve
listened
to
knucks999
warned
me
it
was
a
bit
off
but
i
had
to
try
anyway
just
strange
tastes
more
like
homemade
red
wine
that
was
made
with
a
bad
kit
and
not
totally
fermented
out
before
bottling
im
usually
a
fan
of
the
new
belgium
lips
of
faith
series
beer
but
this
one
totally
misses
the
mark
for
me
drinkable
not
spectacular
pours
a
medium
dark
red
color
with
a
white
head
it
is
very
clear
the
aroma
is
tart
cherries
with
some
light
funk
the
flavor
is
tart
cherries
with
some
vanilla
and
oak
there
is
something
at
the
end
of
the
flavor
that
is
a
little
off
but
it
doesnt
take
away
too
much
this
tastes
a
lot
like
a
dry
red
wine
low
carbonation
and
thinmedium
mouthfeel
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
not
exactly
a
good
example
of
the
style
there
is
still
something
that
tastes
artificial
about
it
to
me
however
it
is
a
stepping
stone
to
other
beers
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
the
750ml
i
have
at
home
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
from
this
especially
since
im
not
in
love
with
their
kriek
either
how
long
can
i
age
something
with
that
much
fruit
in
it
would
that
even
help
my
memory
may
be
a
bit
weak
but
i
think
this
is
actually
weaker
than
the
original
lower
alcohol
release
i
was
at
least
expecting
a
bright
cherry
note
here
but
that
isnt
here
and
neither
is
a
pronounced
funkiness
or
sourness
somehow
this
beer
has
been
a
disappointment
from
what
i
was
even
expecting
it
is
just
too
bland
overall
still
this
is
not
a
horrible
beer
just
not
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
very
sprightly
fizzy
without
much
head
tart
but
not
sour
i
dont
taste
much
malt
or
belgian
oddities
flavor
recedes
as
you
sip
it
has
its
charms
but
i
am
not
so
eager
for
another
bottle
claims
8
abv
but
it
really
does
not
seem
that
strong
to
me
i
always
look
for
new
belgium
offerings
but
i
hope
they
go
back
to
the
more
stronglyflavored
version
of
the
kriek
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
unless
i
get
tired
of
watching
my
friends
wince
at
the
sourness
of
most
of
what
i
serve
i
wont
be
looking
to
pick
it
up
possibly
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
beery
beers
or
sour
sours
though
overall
this
is
my
first
new
belgium
brew
and
consequently
my
first
from
the
lips
of
faith
series
i
feel
like
this
beer
has
potential
but
isnt
one
that
i
would
visit
again
unless
they
revamp
the
recipe
or
lower
the
15
sticker
price
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
d
good
but
slightly
less
bitter
would
be
more
drinkable
d
not
one
of
new
belgiums
winner
i
feel
like
this
beer
has
a
serious
identity
crisis
it
thinks
its
a
lambic
but
everything
screams
fruit
beer
or
cheap
wine
body
is
too
watery
and
it
takes
away
a
lot
from
the
already
light
flavor
a
stunning
beer
to
look
at
though
pours
a
light
ruby
red
color
body
with
a
smallish
pink
foamy
head
diminishing
clear
sour
aroma
strong
some
fruitiness
cherries
but
almost
a
fake
cherry
smell
like
extract
strong
sours
earthy
farmy
reminiscent
of
a
red
wine
mouth
watering
smell
dry
fizzy
taste
somewhat
dry
aftertaste
light
cherries
fruit
almost
nonexistent
nutty
aftertaste
very
good
taste
extremely
drinkable
somewhat
puckering
clean
tasting
almost
like
a
sour
fizzy
candy
less
fizzy
but
still
that
sharpness
and
then
the
taste
the
sour
is
minimal
the
cherries
more
pronounced
the
flavor
flat
2
dimensions
pedestrian
a
dry
lindemans
the
sparks
on
my
tongue
comes
more
from
carbonation
that
sour
its
a
fizzy
soda
with
a
hint
of
disappointment
a
kriek
version
of
fat
tire
the
safe
way
to
brew
pours
a
koolaid
like
cherry
skin
yet
clear
red
woth
some
visible
carbonation
and
a
super
quick
flashinthepan
head
the
aroma
is
candy
cream
cherries
with
maybe
a
touch
of
barnyard
mingling
around
interesting
but
a
little
too
candysweet
for
a
lambic
in
my
view
the
taste
has
a
tart
strawberries
and
cherries
and
crem
taste
right
upfont
the
middle
takes
a
more
general
tart
fruit
flavor
with
some
earthy
lambic
yeasty
goodness
the
finish
is
ripe
fruit
and
must
the
palate
feels
more
carbonated
than
it
looks
fruity
and
tart
but
lacking
complexity
and
sophistiction
not
worth
the
15
a
22oz
bottle
i
spent
this
is
a
really
fun
beer
that
i
can
gladly
recommend
to
anyone
this
ruby
red
lambic
is
a
blend
of
two
the
nose
is
all
cherry
with
a
good
dose
of
the
sourness
being
revealed
cherry
follows
in
to
the
taste
and
dominates
the
palette
it
is
delightfully
sour
with
a
complex
herbal
bitterness
that
helps
round
out
the
beer
although
it
is
8
this
one
is
refreshing
with
a
lasting
slightly
bitter
finish
d
i
think
that
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
style
has
the
tartness
of
a
traditional
kriek
but
it
is
rounded
out
by
some
of
the
sweet
mellowness
of
the
malts
i
would
have
it
again
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
my
girlfriend
liked
it
and
she
rarely
likes
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
with
definite
lambic
real
fruit
character
that
could
serve
as
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
for
a
novice
the
lambic
character
isnt
as
intense
as
a
traditional
kriek
but
the
fruit
is
very
nice
despite
a
minor
note
of
cough
syrup
in
the
middle
i
am
not
sure
why
this
hasnt
been
reviewed
better
than
it
has
been
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
it
was
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
for
a
beer
that
was
only
55
lambic
but
i
picked
it
up
at
a
store
that
marks
its
beer
up
too
much
imo
so
it
may
be
more
reasonable
elsewhere
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
retains
a
lot
of
the
depth
of
its
base
it
is
almost
a
sessionable
lambic
d
probably
the
worst
of
the
lips
of
faith
beers
in
theory
this
should
be
great
but
it
just
comes
out
as
a
sugar
bomb
with
hardly
any
features
of
the
actual
lambic
3

5
overall
its
not
a
beer
that
id
return
to
frequently
its
not
explicitly
a
lambic
and
this
sort
of
inbetween
state
makes
it
unappealing
nevertheless
its
still
an
interesting
beer
thats
fun
for
something
different
while
i
applaud
new
belgiums
experimentation
sometimes
you
just
cant
improve
upon
tradition
avoid
i
really
like
new
belgium
and
a
lot
of
the
lips
of
faith
beers
this
is
just
bad
though
there
is
nothing
lambic
about
this
they
need
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
i
feel
cheated
and
i
need
a
good
beer
now
pretty
good
for
a
fruit
beer
better
than
most
drinkability
overpriced
lacking
flavor
will
not
being
buying
again
d
this
is
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
a
steep
price
tag
but
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
is
good
not
too
sour
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
i
liked
this
very
much
and
all
in
attendance
enjoyed
the
chance
to
savor
this
wish
i
had
brought
a
few
more
back
to
work
on
my
friends
who
are
just
getting
into
sours
overall
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
i
love
boons
brews
particularly
the
oude
kriek
and
i
generally
enjoy
new
belgiums
lineup
but
this
mixture
didnt
showcase
the
strengths
of
either
drinkability
a
sipper
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
this
was
a
good
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
try
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
for
the
style
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavors
but
the
flavors
are
just
slightly
lacking
on
this
one
the
la
folie
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
it
fell
short
of
expectations
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
i
cannot
believe
that
this
is
8
abv
you
dont
get
alcohol
in
the
taste
or
the
aroma
dramatic
beer
poured
with
a
giant
pink
foamy
frothy
textured
head
wth
a
load
a
lace
color
is
clear
slightly
brown
tinged
rose
red
aroma
is
a
mild
cherry
with
a
little
spice
flavor
is
malty
cherry
pie
more
on
the
sour
side
clean
body
is
good
and
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
decent
not
overdone
at
all
easy
and
balanced
tough
to
be
a
session
in
this
style
good
beer
overall
though
the
finish
for
this
is
lingering
cherry
and
a
very
clean
tasting
beer
with
sharp
carbonation
a
highly
drinkable
beer
here
and
just
an
all
around
good
kriek
to
drink
on
pretty
good
drinking
but
not
my
cup
otea
beer
im
not
normally
much
of
a
sour
beer
drinker
but
this
one
is
excellent
edit
i
drainpoured
the
last
6
or
7
ounces
so
drinkability
takes
a
hit
pours
a
clear
deep
red
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
cherry
tart
malt
and
acid
fits
the
style
of
a
lambic
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
sharp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
theres
also
a
noticeable
tartness
associated
with
this
brew
tastes
of
cherry
up
front
tart
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
some
yeast
overall
different
than
the
other
krieks
ive
had
but
still
quite
drinkable
pours
a
luxurious
dark
ruby
red
with
pink
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
rim
lace
nose
isnt
as
assertive
as
other
examples
of
kriek
and
im
able
to
note
a
slightly
herbal
sour
cherry
with
a
hint
of
barnyard
funk
in
the
background
luckily
the
barnyard
isnt
there
on
the
palate
as
the
sour
cherry
with
light
baking
spices
take
over

in
my
opinion

but
i
expected

more
after
having
tried
many

sours
at
various
festivals
more
lambic
is
needed
in
my
opinion
i
dont
think
transatlantic
kriek
is
a
bad
beer
exactly
for
the
ridiculous
price

i
expected
so
much

be

i
dont
know
what
kind
of
problem
most
people
are
having
with
this
beer
but
i
though
it
was
pretty
good
a
sort
of
middle
ground
between
the
sweet
thick
lindemans
kriek
and
the
super
funky
drie

kriek
theres
a
good
portion
of
juicy
cherries
but
theres
also
a
nice
balance
of
mellow
earthy
barnyard
aroma
and
flavor
most
krieks
seem
to
fall
on
one
end
of
the

spectrum

this
is
a
delicious
compromise

would
never

again

by

of

its
lost

the

the

places
even
though
im
not
a
huge
sour
beer
fan
i
can
distinguish
a
wellcrafted
sour
from
one
thats
not
unfortunately
for
new
belgium
this
falls
into
the
latter
category
pass
overall
my
girlfriend
liked
it
and
i
thought
it
was
ok
everyone
else
not
so
much
the
idea
behind
this
beer
clearly
reveals
a
passion
and
international
appreciation
for
the
art
of
brewing
but
the
execution
is
sloppy
and
it
seems
like
a
waste
of
such
noble
intentions
the
lips
of
faith
is
a
premium
series
with
a
premium
price
tag
that
this
beer
just
does
not
live
up
to
considering
new
belgium
has
been
trotting
out
some
exceptional
sours
though
on
an
extremely
limited
basis
this
disappoints
thoroughly
looks
great

great
tastes
thoroughly
mediocre
and
thats
a
bad
miss
split
a
22oz
bomber
with
my
wife
poured
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
bright
raspberry
red
with
a
1
inch
pastel
pink
head
that
recedes
into
just
a
thin
layer
resting
on
the
top
of
the
beer
leaving
just
a
spackle
of
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
bright
cherry
vinegar
with
oak
lemon
zest
diacetyl
and
a
bit
of
belgian
candy
sugar
the
flavor
isnt
nearly
as
dynamic
as
the
nose
is
all
of
the
flavors
are
just
dull
versions
of
the
aroma
tart
cherries
lemon
oak
sacramental
wine
and
sweet
apple
cider
vinegar
also
the
butter
is
a
bit
more
powerful
then
i
would
have
wanted
my
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
finish
on
the
flavor
profile
is
overwhelming
sweet
the
sweetness
on
the
finish
overshadows
much
of
the
crisp
tartness
of
the
boon
kriek
the
mouthfeel
is
cakey
dry
leaving
the
palate
wanting
just
a
little
more
this
is
a
good
beer
i
love
seeing
american
breweries
taking
a
leap
on
new
styles
for
them
drinkability
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
it
isnt
a
thrill
a
sip
for
me
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
and
whoa
the
alcohol
is
starting
to
kick
in
now
nope
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
i
loved
the
previous
edition
just
kind
of
average
for
me
well
balanced
and
drinkable
i
liked
it
upon
first
impression
but
the
more
i
drank
the
less
i
liked
it
d
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
but
wasnt
really
impressed
by
this
one
intriguing
idea

abv
is

at
all
seems
like
this
is
much
better
on
tap
than
in

because
this
stuff
was
pretty
dope
by
no
means
a
terrible
beer
but
within
its
style
there
are
better
options

a
ripoff

not
waste
your
money
this
lambic
tastes
more
bitter
than
anything
but
a
sour
alcohol
you
can
barely
detect
the
cherries
a
very
disappointing
lambic
easy
to
drink
refreshing
not
a
bad
effort
if
a

ill
recommend
it

more

with

dissipated
quickly
massive
diacetyl
aroma
with
a
hint
of
maraschino
cherry
beneath
it
its
like
buttered
cherry
or
cherry
butter
more
accurately
the
taste
is
equally
vile
and
buttery
with
surprisingly
minimal
fruit
flavor
and
no
sourness
to
speak
of
slick
coating
mouthfeel
no
finesse
whatsoever
and
a
horrible
lingering
diacetyl
finish
this
beer
is
a
fucking
trainwreck
avoid
at
all
costs
conceptually
this
should
be
a
homerun
out
of
the
park
but
ultimately
the
blend
isnt
flattering
to
either
producer
boon
oud
kriek
kicks
tks
ass
all
up
and
down
and
conversely
la
folie
gives
boon
a
run
for
its
money
in
the
end
this
is
neither
here
nor
there
but
its
better
than
dark
kriek
just
double
the
price
which
seems
justified
for
importing
boon
lambic
to
co
to
blend
this
brew
but
too
much
for
what
you
end
up
with
update
just
read
this
is
a
blend
of
a
kriek
by
boon
and
a
golden
lager
by
new
belgium
that
makes
a
bit
more
sense
and
while
the
taste
of
the
brew
obviously
remains
the
same
my
expectations
would
have
been
a
whole
lot
different
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
be
a
good
session
though
one
because
of
the
price
and
two
the
effort
made
to
make
this
beer
is
impressive
best
to
cherish
it
an
interesting
beer
and
a
very
cool
collaboration
between
boon
and
new
belgium
i
really
want
to
try
the
original
though
really
easy
drinking
beer
w
a
good
balance
no
real
bold
flavors
although
the
tartness
is
great
and
not
overpowering
22oz
bottle
9
the
first
whiff
from
the
bottle
is
like
red
wine
vinegar
the
beer
is
bright
pink
with
a
decent
head
fro
a
brief
moment
the
secodn
glass
i
poured
the
head
was
super
foamy
and
pink
and
looked
cool
as
shit
the
aroma
is
more
vinegar
cherries
and
dirty
socks
but
in
a
good
way
the
smell
really
grows
on
me
despite
the
fact
there
is
a
buttery
cake
aspect
to
it
the
taste
is
weird
definitely
a
little
bit
of
sour
but
the
syrupy
cherry
flavor
is
the
main
flavor
the
flavor
was
kind
of
a
disappointment
to
be
honest
the
body
is
between
moderate
and
light
but
finishes
very
dry
with
the
lingering
cherry
vanilla
notes
carbonation
is
low
and
considerable
for
style
but
not
offensive
overall
great
to
see
this
one
back
ideally
i
would
have
liked
to
see
it
not
filtered
but
should
age
nicely
raspberry
galore
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
light
tartness
more
viscous
than
the
sours
im
used
to
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
it
isnt
as
good
as
some
but
it
has
plenty
of
fruit
flavors
tartness
and
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
i
think
i
might
pick
up
another
bottle
to
see
how
it
changes
after
a
year
one
things
for
sure
it
sells
its
raspberry
character
well
as
lambics
go
im
not
sure
this
is
my
favorite
not
tart
enough
not
acidic
hardly
at
all
and
lacking
the
wild
fermentation
characteristics
i
usually
look
for
in
the
style
but
as
a
fruited
belgian
ale
i
absolutely
love
it
and
its
head
and
shoulders
better
than
its
immediate
peers
natural
looking
purple
pink
raspberry
color
a
short
lived
stained
pink
head
and
some
chunks
of
yeast
and
maybe
even
a
few
raspberry
seeds
in
there
it
looks
the
part
the
nose
is
great
jammy
but
not
overly
sweet
authentic
fruity
character
and
a
little
belgian
yeast
funk
and
fruit
but
not
the
sourness
true
lambic
usually
possesses
i
love
the
fruit
flavor
not
quite
as
true
as
the
nose
mellowed
by
an
oak
hit
here
but
its
still
the
chief
flavor
agent
and
a
genuine
one
at
that
no
corn
sugar
no
cavities
just
true
raspberry
beer
its
affordable
and
tasty
well
carbonated
and
light
and
overall
extremely
well
made
for
what
it
is
not
really
passable
as
a
sour
but
im
not
sure
its
trying
to
be
one
highly
respectable
brew
here
better
than
some
of
the
other
fruit
editions
i
think
too
really
summery
and
real
fruity
i
almost
feel
guilty
for
liking
this
as
much
as
i
do
this
pours
a
raspberry
red
in
color
straight
up
the
aroma
smacks
of
raspberry
jam
in
its
character
and
intensity
the
flavor
has
a
raspberry
tartness
with
a
sweetish
but
not
cloying
finish
much
preferred
this
to
the
more
common
bar
framboise
quite
the
opposite
from
the
weyerbacher
riserva
i
tried
before
this
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
2
finger
head
and
smells
of
raspberry
candy
full
on
raspberry
candy
taste
is
similar
there
is
nothing
tart
about
this
and
i
feel
as
though
i
am
drinking
a
raspberry
syrup
sweet
and
thick
from
start
to
finish
this
is
more
like
a
raspberry
punch
than
beer
shared
with
wife
at
gainesville
hob
pours
deep
red
with
pink
head
huge
sweet
raspberry
aroma
flavor
is
super
sweet
and
tart
raspberries
and
sugar
something
slightly
weird
on
the
back
end
like
sweetnlow
flavor
not
bad
wife
liked
it
but
i
have
had
better
raspberry
flavors
in
my
beer
slightly
artificial
was
offputting
but
this
smells
great
o
this
is
not
how
i
like
my
lambics
this
is
like
a
beer
with
raspberrylemonade
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pretty
nice
and
refreshing
lambic
here
not
much
sour
happening
rather
lots
of
sweetness
huge
raspberry
flavor
gets
coupled
nicely
with
a
bit
of
cherry
too
pretty
similar
to
lindemans
framboise
though
its
been
quite
a
while
since
ive
had
that
one
so
i
dont
know
if
i
can
say
for
sure
which
one
is
better
very
close
though
and
would
both
go
well
with
this
quesadilla
had
this
on
tap
several
times
but
from
memory
looks
really
inviting
like
i
take
a
36
oz
tankard
of
this
stuff
smells
of
bread
and
ripe
raspberries
and
floralness
id
swim
in
this
stuff
taste
is
fruit
forward
and
lightly
sour
but
not
over
the
top
although
i
love
this
too
and
fresh
raspberries
duh
and
bread
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
carbonation
is
low
and
everything
is
well
balanced
and
considered
id
drink
this
until
the
end
of
time
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
fruit
lambic
that
doesnt
have
artificial
flavors
and
has
much
more
tartness
compared
to
sweetness
it
almost
feels
like
youre
having
a
very
strong
raspberry
sorbet
pour
is
blood
red
with
pink
hues
and
a
dark
pink
head
the
nose
is
overly
sweet
and
singular
loads
of
raspberry
purée
and
raspberry
syrup
taste
is
just
that
with
maybe
a
touch
of
tartness
decent
carbonation
and
syrupy
feel
simple
and
too
sweet
no
lambic
notes
or
depth
reasonably
smooth
somewhat
tart
while
still
being
refreshing
and
sweet
dessert
in
a
glass
the
equal
of
duchess
du
bourgogne
o
a
nice
treat
every
once
in
a
while
d
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
would
have
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
want
to

pretty
good

every
now
and
then
i
really
enjoy
these

and
this
is

one
of
those

well
with

small
streaks
of

form
around
the

on

down
smell
is
of
raspberries

raspberry
juice
but
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
cleaning
product
aroma
as
well
taste
is
of
sweetened
raspberries
and
raspberry
juice
with
some
grainmalt
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
fruit
lambic
but
not
as
good
as
some
similar
ones
i
have
had
in
the
past
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
fake
tasting
the
amount
of
fruit
flavor
was
so
intense
the
beer
tasted
unpleasant
and
overwhelming
lindimans
has
a
better
showing
in
my
opinion
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
lambic
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
one
again
overall
not
bad
a
little
tarter
than
most
frambroise
that
i
have
tried
but
that
is
not
a
totally
bad
thing
i
do
think
the
overpowering
carbonation
does
create
an
issue
with
the

o
of
the
st
louis
beers
this
is
by
far
the
best
one
ive
tried
unlike
many
commercial
framboise
lambics
this
one
is
not
cloying
o
an
enjoyable
fruit
lambic
one
with
over
the
top
fruit
first
time
trying
this
one
surprising
given
how
available
this
one
is
not
the
best
framboise
ive
ever
had
but
solid
quality
enjoyable
reasonably
priced
and
easy
to
get
sounds
like
a
winner
to
me
thinking
ill
be
getting
this
again
in
the
near
future
o
this
beer
was
borderline
cloying
for
me
it
ends
up
being
very
drinkable
though
just
one
at
a
time
o
superbly
drinkable
great
tasting
too
sweet
for
a
session
beer
though
disclaimer
i
rate
backsweetened
lambics
to
the
style
of
sparkling
fruit
juice
not
actual
lambics
picked
it
at
the
gourmet
store
at
siam
discovery
in
bangkok
i
was
preparing
for
a
romantic
evening
with
my
lady
on
the
58th
floor
club
room
of
the
lebua
state
tower
on
the
chao
phraya
riverfront
a
fruit
lambic
always
works
split
the
beer
into
two
small
but
sturdy
pours
into
the
available
wine
glasses
the
liquid
was
a
bursting
rosy
red
crowned
with
a
shouting
pink
head
hardly
any
retention
and
no
lacing
at
all
this
was
a
little
comical
as
i
found
the
appearance
to
be
very
child
friendly
the
nose
was
full
of
raspberry
tartness
this
didnt
smell
like
a
beer
at
all
except
for
the
yeast
aroma
that
was
unmistakably
belgianesque
for
me
thats
when
the
love
affair
and
appreciation
ended
for
the
beer
the
taste
was
too
sweet
for
my
liking
like
a
raspberry
candy
maybe
i
was
not
used
to
lambics
but
this
tasted
artificially
sweet
of
course
it
was
tart
as
hell
thankfully
to
give
some
credibility
to
the
taste
beer
was
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
looking
out
for
this
one
again
though
it
definitely
is
a
lady
pleaser
and
maybe
suitable
for
an
after
dinner
sit
out
o
good
beer
for
the
style
nothing
ill
drink
regularly
but
nice
to
have
something
most
people
will
enjoy
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
ruby
red
with
a
three
finger
pink
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
raspberries
strawberries
and
cream
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
raspberries
strawberries
cherries
and
cream
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
a
nice
palate
cleanser
as
it
was
not
abrasive
to
the
tongue
at
all
and
left
a
rather
pleasant
aftertaste
the
fruit
on
this
one
was
definitely
the
start
of
the
show
as
one
would
expect
from
this
style
this
is
a
definite
must
try
and
could
be
a
good
gateway
brew
for
some
females
who
are
fans
of
fruitier
mixed
drinks
just
a
great
lambic
pours
a
deep
reddish
color
with
a
small
pink
head
decent
retention
aroma
is
full
of
raspberry
and
a
hint
of
sour
in
the
taste
berries
coupled
with
the
apple
cider
like
quality
of
the
st
louis
geueze
base
beer
tart
lightly
sour
and
very
fruity
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
feel
and
a
lingering
tart
raspberry
note
overall
not
bad
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
funk
o
not
a
bad
beer
tastes
fine
nothing
overly
complex
or
amazing
but
i
didnt
hate
it
o
delicious
sour
framboise
4

this
limbic
pours
out
as
a
red
bubbly
liquid
with
a
pink
fizzy
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
full
of
raspberries
the
taste
is
also
very
sweet
and
should
be
drank
like
a
dessert
or
something
lots
of
sugary
raspberries
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
but
still
has
a
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
could
be
switched
with
a
lindamans
and
not
many
people
would
notice
the
difference
aroma
is
sweet
sweet
sweet
raspberries
no
funk
or
sourness
to
be
found
this
was
definitely
backsweetened
same
thing
with
the
flavor
as
a
cloying
sweetness
overshadows
the
fresh
taste
of
the
raspberries
syrupy
and
a
bit
too
thick
on
the
palate
a
rechracterization
of
this
beer
would
do
it
good
if
you
like
sweet
fruit
beers
this
is
one
to
try
if
you
are
expecting
a
funky
or
sour
lambic
stay
away
because
despite
what
others
here
have
said
you
arent
going
to
find
anything
remotely
traditional
here
very
good
compared
to
lindemans
this
is
more
funky
perhaps
a
bit
less
sweet
less
carbonated
and
way
less
aromatic
i
would
try
this
again
overall
drinkability
delicious
lambic
but
maybe
not
enough
complexity
to
achieve
a
high
score
poured
on
tap
at
the
blind
lady
ale
house
in
san
diego
the
beer
was
served
in
a
minisnifter
the
beer
pours
a
syrupy
deep
vibrant
blood
red
color
the
beer
has
a
good
lacing
as
you
drink
and
maintains
a
thin
film
of
head
the
nose
is
syrupysugary
sweet
raspberry
legitimate
raspberry
flavors
with
dark
sweetness
and
decreased
carbonation
when
compared
with
something
like
lindemans
very
smooth
with
a
slight
tartness
on
the
finish
body
is
thicker
and
more
smooth
than
other
fruit
lambics
too
d
the
nice
raspberry
flavor
is
not
overly
sweet
and
does
have
a
nice
fruit
flavor
this
is
definitely
not
a
fruit
lambic
but
it
is
a
nice
fruit
beer
just
a
bit
more
depth
would
be
nice
if
i
were
to
drink
more
than
one
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
lambic
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
served
paired
with
the
notsodirty
cupcake
dark
chocolate
with
a
milk
chocolate
ganache
at
sweet
revenge
in
nyc
most
of
the
5
parings
our
group
ordered
were
great
but
this
one
was
particularly
outstanding
the
raspberrychocolate
combination
is
obviously
but
what
put
this
over
the
top
is
the
way
the
earthyness
of
the
sour
pulled
out
some
absolutely
incredibly
flavors
from
the
chocolate
a
highly
recommended
pairing
overall
i
dont
want
to
but
i
really
like
it
my
wife
called
me
a
girl
if
you
want
a
funky
sour
framboise
this
is
not
it
this
is
a
sweet
one
but
with
enough
real
lambic
character
that
it
doesnt
taste
like
lindemans
d
it
is
not
as
sour
as
i
would
prefer
but
it
is
still
good
and
highly
drinkable
unfortunately
this
lambic
and
every
other
one
costs
about
6
bucks
per
12
oz
so
i
do
not
drink
many
cheers
the
color
is
gorgeous
looks
just
like
raspberry
tart
ruby
with
light
purple
head
and
lacing
aromas
are
balanced
sweettart
tons
of
berries
the
smell
makes
my
mouth
water
immediately
flavors
follow
pure
raspberry
goodness
medium
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
lambics
are
such
a
treat
and
this
one
delivers
exactly
what
im
looking
for
this
is
a
good
framboise
its
only
the
fourth
ive
tried
but
im
curious
to
try
more
of
these
and
other
nonfruitoriented
lambics
notes
not
as
tart
and
defintely
funkier
than
lindemans
seemingly
a
little
more
balanced
and
easier
to
drink
due
the
less
puckering
quality
d
i
like
the
balance
and
the
no
overly
sweetness
of
this
brew
drinkability
im
very
glad
ive
finally
tried
a
lambic
and
will
continue
to
explore
the
style
in
the
future
on
its
own
this
beer
is
doing
little
for
me
but
pairing
it
with
something
a
dessert
most
likely
would
probably
make
it
much
more
drinkable
i
was
kinda
scared
to
try
this
and
have
been
putting
it
off
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
very
pretty
rasberry
red
color
somewhat
cloudy
but
not
too
bad
the
head
was
has
a
kinda
wine
look
and
smell
hello
raspberry
is
what
i
said
when
i
smelled
this
the
taste
is
a
very
sweet
but
accepting
taste
drinks
like
a
koolaid
in
all
honesty
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
with
a
citrus
salad
of
some
sort
this
is
a
wonderfully
carbonated
drink
with
a
great
finish
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
one
wonderful
poured
from
corked
caged
bottle
into
lindemans
flute
another
colorful
red
bubbling
brew
very
similar
in
smell
to
lindemans
with
a
little
more
alcohol
taste
is
similar
to
smell
still
sweet
but
a
touch
less
than
lindemans
must
be
looking
for
a
very
fruity
brew
to
enjoy
at
the
right
time
third
beer
of
the
night
of
christmas
eve
paired
with
a
chocolatealmondraspberry
tart
served
in
a
champagne
glass
the
bottle
says
this
is
a
2006
vintage
opaque
body
with
a
reddish
pink
color
cotton
candy
colored
head
smell
was
very
fruity
and
sugary
flavor
was
all
about
the
raspberries
extremely
tasty
sugary
on
the
palate
but
has
a
decent
drinkability
because
its
not
overly
sweet
definitely
a
dessert
beer
more
of
a
lambic
for
those
who
prefer
sweeter
ones
over
tart
crisp
ones
pink
bright
frothy
head
this
smells
straightly
of
raspberries
what
else
but
the
taste
is
well
balanced
not
stickysweet
not
puckeryourlips
sour
this
is
straight
down
the
middle
its
not
a
sodabeer
its
a
real
fruit
beer
with
style
bubbly
good
mouthfeel
and
ultimately
quite
drinkable
its
one
of
the
few
beers
that
my
wife
a
beer
hater
enjoys
good
color
and
nice
pink
head
that
quickly
dissipates
with
minimal
lacing
smells
of
raspberries
flavor
is
a
perfect
balance
of
fruity
sweetness
and
wonderful
sour
raspberry
notes
more
sour
and
less
sweet
than
the
lindemans
but
firmly
more
sweet
and
less
sour
than
the
cantillon
nice
and
bubbly
and
a
typically
high
drinkability
despite
the
sour
notes
very
refreshing
drinkability
easier
to
drink
than
an
oj
in
the
morning
d
it
is
a
bit
sweet
that
is
almost
overwhelming
however
it
could
be
nice
depending
on
the
time
drinkability
because
of
the
sweetness
i
would
not
recommend
too
many
but
one
is
an
absolute
must
strong
sweettart
flavor
far
more
candylike
than
the
smell
suggests
good
fauxraspberry
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
short
but
is
similar
to
that
of
a
dessert
wellbalanced
would
likely
taste
great
with
some
stinky
cheese
d
you
can
have
a
couple
of
these
and
be
just
fine
not
a
session
for
sure
avoid
nothing
like
the
offerings
from
some
of
belgiums
better
breweries
d
this
lambic
has
alot
going
for
it
its
an
all
around
concise
package
a
solid
lambic
that
doesnt
break
the
bank
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
bit
of
a
brownish
tint
slight
off
white
head
with
a
bit
of
purple
in
there
nose
brings
raspberries
and
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
more
raspberries
and
some
sugar
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
earth
in
the
background
feel
is
light
to
medium
with
decent
carbonation
a
bit
cloying
overall
a
nice
introduction
for
a
novice
but
not
a
terribly
great
beer
pours
a
cherry
red
color
hazed
from
sediment
nice
soapy
cap
of
pinkish
hued
head
scent
is
a
big
whiff
of
raspberry
sweetness
not
much
more
else
to
it
taste
thankfully
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
scent
was
leading
towards
much
more
tart
raspberry
but
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
lacks
the
funkyness
i
expect
from
the
style
body
is
medium
bubbly
and
the
drink
only
touches
the
dryness
im
used
to
in
the
style
a
good
lambic
that
knocks
artificial
ones
out
of
the
water
but
doesnt
touch
the
more
respected
brands
in
composition
although
it
comes
close
in
quality
of
ingredients
d
amazing
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
plan
to
in
the
future
d
it
tastes
great
and
is
fairly
light
in
body
yet
the
sweetness
really
reduces
the
drinkability
d
great
for
the
first
glass
but
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
it
all
night
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bad
lambic
not
sour
or
tart
taste
was
artificial
not
very
drinkable
overall
impression
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
went
down
nice
and
easy
out
on
the
porch
on
a
sultry
afternoon
overall
a
typical
framboise
nowhere
near
razz
tart
but
decent
this
is
very
quaffable
it
is
refreshing
like
a
glass
of
raspberry
juice
really
juice
is
what
this
beer
is
it
is
simplistic
and
even
enjoyable
if
you
take
it
for
what
it
is
d
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
the
mild
alcohol
content
says
its
okay
have
another
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
is
fine
drinkability
is
high
good
for
a
dessert
and
a
pretty
good
lambic
as
well
it
is
likely
that
this
beer
is
filtered
and
sugar
is
added
to
the
beer
after
filtration
to
emphasize
the
sweet
fruit
flavors
its
ok
for
what
it
is
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
sweetened
lambics
but
it
definitely
makes
its
points
and
achieves
its
goal
it
is
not
likely
ill
drink
this
again
anytime
soon
maybe
if
i
serve
chocolate
mousse
for
dessert
sometime
feels
like
carbonated
raspberry
juice
and
drinks
about
the
same
not
worth
the
money
mix
with
vodka
i
guess
not
recommended
d
this
is
a
perfect
dessert
beer
i
had
mine
after
a
nice
meal
and
found
it
more
than
up
to
the
task
definitely
a
style
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
but
when
i
am
this
is
one
id
happily
go
back
to
a
good
once
in
a
while
beer
im
still
surprised
at
how
sweet
it
is
sorbet
beer
i
tell
ya
might
be
good
for
cooking
even
i
imagine
drinkability
a
fantastic
lambic
a
touch
of
sourness
to
meld
with
the
sweetness
i
could
sip
this
all
day
pours
a
clear
ruddy
red
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offpink
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
strong
raspberry
slight
tart
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
hop
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
lambic
fruit
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
slight
tartness
present
tastes
of
strong
raspberry
sweet
malt
yeast
slight
tart
malt
and
slight
earthiness
overall
a
little
too
sweet
but
otherwise
still
good
pours
a
clear
garnet
with
a
nice
thick
pink
foamy
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
behind
the
nose
unsurprisingly
is
loaded
with
raspberries
with
a
touch
of
oakiness
and
toffee
as
garnishes
the
taste
emphasizes
the
berries
tart
and
sour
qualities
but
does
not
overdo
it
as
these
tempermellow
as
things
progress
the
oak
from
the
nose
is
there
as
well
creating
a
soft
boat
upon
which
the
berries
float
across
the
tongue
the
body
is
a
mediummoderate
with
a
pleasant
touch
of
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
feel
overall
a
tasty
tart
fruity
lambic
with
if
one
is
inclined
toward
them
high
drinkability
notes
not
my
favorite
style
but
that
did
not
keep
me
from
giving
it
a
favorable
review
if
a
framboise
is
what
you
are
looking
for
then
this
is
a
good
one
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
really
very
good
and
i
will
actually
consider
buying
this
again
d
this
is
not
my
favorite
proprietor
of
the
style
but
it
is
always
a
very
good
option
i
could
drink
a
keg
of
this
goes
down
like
candy
but
should
count
as
beer
due
to
extra
sugar
like
a
wine
cooler
meh
d
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
however
i
couldnt
drink
to
much
of
it
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
very
light
beer
but
slightly
more
carbonated
than
expected
given
the
head
was
so
small
as
far
as
drinkability
i
could
go
for
seconds
or
thirds
of
this
beer
without
hesitation
pours
a
brownish
red
color
that
is
clear
for
the
most
part
but
has
some
faint
particles
if
you
look
close
very
thin
spotty
lace
here
and
there
appears
mostly
white
but
has
a
hue
of
the
brownishred
color
to
it
aroma
is
mostly
raspberry
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
funk
taste
is
a
blast
of
raspberry
that
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
sour
and
tart
with
a
little
bit
of
funkiness
carb
is
fairly
high
with
a
light
feel
lingering
taste
of
the
fruit
and
a
bit
of
creaminess
left
on
the
palate
very
easy
drinking
with
a
tart
finish
md
smooth
and
champagnelike
in
dryness
and
proper
serving
it
is
quite
tasty
and
the
gf
loved
it
however
i
do
enjoy
the
sour
element
in
my
framboises
d
this
like
most
fruity
lambics
is
very
sweet
making
it
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
pretty
good
especially
for
the
price
di
like
the
lambic
style
especially
framboise
this
is
very
good
it
is
one
style
i
could
readily
drink
at
anytime
day
or
night
update
i
havent
had
this
in
over
three
years
to
thought
id
get
a
bottle
and
compare
it
to
my
original
review
thankfully
it
hasnt
changed
a
bit
ok
this
is
just
too
sweet
to
drink
too
much
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
will
order
it
again
but
im
still
unsure
i
can
drink
a
whole
one
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
you
can
drink
this
all
day
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
at
flying
saucer
it
is
pretty
cool
that
they
have
this
ontap
its
light
refreshing
and
makes
for
a
great
capper
to
an
evening
of
beer
d
low
abv
and
very
drinkable
i
like
this
better
than
lindemans
and
its
much
cheaper
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
does
not
get
cloying
and
is
refreshing
by
the
waythats
my
photo
for
this
beer
d
d
great
as
a
session
brew
extremely
drinkable
even
to
nonbeer
drinkers
d
i
could
drink
this
all
dayno
questions
asked
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
good
beer
but
its
just
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
drink
very
often
d
about
average
for
me
it
was
too
sweet
for
the
sour
i
am
having
trouble
finishing
this
750ml
and
it
is
only
4
this
has
session
beer
written
all
over
it
if
i
was
given
this
blindfolded
i
might
think
that
it
was
a
juice
that
was
a
bit
past
its
prime
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
few
lambics
of
this
abv
in
a
given
night
but
not
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
one
in
a
given
sitting
this
has
a
textbook
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
a
lambic
with
the
easy
to
drink
aspects
of
a
succint
raspberry
beverage
im
glad
i
started
my
foray
into
big
bottles
on
this
a
secondtier
lambic
st
louis
framboise
puts
forth
a
fine
example
of
this
style
worthy
of
a
festive
breakfast
or
as
an
aperitif
d
easily
drinkable
pours
purplishamber
you
know
there
is
fruit
there
head
is
light
aroma
is
distintly
raspberry
though
there
is
an
undescribable
funk
in
the
finish
tart
berry
not
subtle
but
fun
to
drink
and
light
enough
that
it
isnt
going
to
get
you
soused
lucious
silky
mouth
drink
as
a
refreshing
dessert
i
enjoy
it
but
cant
imagine
drinking
two
of
them
you
just
wouldnt
need
to
my
wife
who
doesnt
really
like
real
beer
or
even
many
kinds
of
alcohol
in
general
loves
this
and
the
competing
product
from
lindemans
personally
i
prefer
the
fruit
lambics
from
cantillon
enjoying
their
tarter
taste
that
being
said
this
isnt
quite
as
sweet
as
the
lindemans
framboise
but
it
is
a
modern
commercial
fruit
lambic
so
purists
likely
will
scoff
all
of
that
being
said
i
find
the
st
louis
fram
to
be
immensely
drinkable
and
just
plain
fun
at
least
my
mom
liked
it
so
we
switched
and
i
drank
her
eku
pils
absolutely
gorgeious
in
the
fluted
glassblood
and
cranberry
red
with
light
white
fluffy

on

strong

nose
of

fruit
is
strong
as
well
and
spectacular
which
just
follows
into
the
tastelambic
sour
witha
clear
clear
and
balanced
fruitcomplex
with
every
sip
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
such
a
beer
if
not
in
the
mood
i
could
see
this
being
very
ungood
with
that
said
when
poored
it
is
a
very
dark
red
as
i
expected
with
a
pink
head
also
expected
smells
a
bit
syrupy
and
a
bit
like
baccardi
raz
taste
is
once
again
good
if
you
are
in
the
mood
all
around
a
very
drinkable
beer
easily
the
best
i
have
had
this
year
absolutely
delicious
definitely
a
dessert
drink
and
by
that
i
mean
a
drink
you
have
in
place
of
dessert
it
was
so
fresh
and
tastey
i
had
to
have
three
glasses
the
aroma
of
raspberries
is
overwhelming
and
the
taste
will
knock
your
socks
off
worth
a
try
as
i
think
it
may
be
one
of
the
best
in
its
category
this
one
is
the
only
framboise
lambic
ive
tried
other
than
lindemans
which
i
enjoyed
much
more
this
is
ok
but
nothin
special
i
would
reach
for
lindemanns
over
this
note
while
this
beer
was
good
it
had
no
distinct
qualitied
that
set
itself
apart
from
say
lindemans
lambic
framboise
drinks
like
a
sweet
mixed
drink
but
a
really
good
one
some
might
think
its
just
a
sweet
lambic
but
it
does
have
more
going
for
it
than
just
a
sweet
outside
plus
its
darn
tasty
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
think
it
would
also
go
quite
well
on
a
cool
winter
night
possibly
in
front
of
a
fire
some
music
yeah
this
is
one
of
the
bettered
sweetened
framboises
ive
had
but
its
still
disappointing
its
my
first
st
louis
lambic
and
i
didnt
know
until
opening
it
if
it
was
a
traditional
lambic
or
a
modern
commercial
one
well
worth
the
price
as
this
is
not
sold
where
i
live
an
absolutely
delicous
lambic
wonderfully
tart
sweet
at
the
same
time
but
keeps
an
excellent
balance
not
tipping
one
way
or
the
other
light
but
not
wimpy
absolutely
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
stuff
like
it
was
juice
and
i
do
liquid
candy
not
recommended
had
this
ontap
at
romans
pub
it
certainly
has
an
interesting
appearance
whether
its
good
or
not
depends
on
if
you
think
cough
syrup
is
attractive
it
was
capped
by
a
very
pink
head
that
reminded
me
morbidly
of
the
bloody
froth
that
comes
from
peoples
mouths
after
a
lung
injury
smells
and
tastes
almost
of
straight
raspberry
with
a
slight
hint
of
a
perfumy
floralness
you
might
think
you
were
drinking
pleasantly
carbonated
raspberry
juice
it
was
so
fruity
that
my
girlfriend
had
to
move
on
to
something
more
beery
after
the
first
glass
which
wasnt
even
a
regular
glass
maybe
8
oz
basically
if
you
like
raspberries
you
will
like
this
beer
otherwise
you
will
probably
get
sick
to
your
stomach
hell
you
might
get
sick
anyway
even
if
you
do
like
raspberries
like
soda
pop
said
someone
with
zero
familiarity
with
the
lambic
stylewho
sampled
this
with
me
yeah
yeah
it
is
a
commercial
lambic
of
that
there
is
no
doubt
but
it
makes
for
adequate
dessert
sipping
and
isnt
really
bad
at
all
o
four
and
a
half
years
old
has
done
this
well
not
as
tart
or
funky
as
i
expected
but
very
woody
with
an
interesting
floral
honey
sweetness
very
delicious
overall
excellent
stuff
this
one
has
softened
out
really
nicely
and
the
flavors
work
great
as
a
whole
the
slight
touch
of
acidity
is
well
measured
as
well
lots
of
character
and
we
all
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
thanks
again
for
hanging
out
man
its
no
cantillion
kriek
and
doesnt
deserve
to
he
mention
in
the
same
breath
as
far
as
im
conserned
not
enough
cherry
amazingly
clean
with
subtle
funk
cherry
lightly
sour
light
body
mild
carb
with
almost
no
pop
when
the
cork
came
out
but
nicely
effervescent
when
swished
again
its
a
shame
i
didnt
get
both
dusty
bottles
off
the
shelf
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
maybe
with
a
few
less
people
everyone
absolutely
loved
it
even
the
i
dont
really
like

at
the
share
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
at
the
memphis
taproom
while
visiting
philadelphia
earlier
this
year
maybe
i
got
a
bum
bottle
or
my
tongue
was
off
that
night
but
compared
to
3fs
intense
red
kriek
and
oude
kriek
which
i
love
i
found
this
one
overpoweringly
and
onedimensionally
tart
lacking
the
bright
distinct
fruit
character
i
was
hoping
for
still
a
wonderful
sour
all
things
considered
but
more
assaultive
and
less
complex
than
the
other
cherry
3fs
ive
had
o
a
delicious
beer
sweet
and
sour
and
overall
just
amazibg
beer
cant
think
of
anything
that
would
make
it
better
for
the
style
owhat
a
great
beer
it
sounds
stupid
but
the
smell
and
flavor
are
so
simple
and
clean
that
the
beer
almost
becomes
more
complex
as
i
try
to
locate
all
the
little
subtle
aromas
and
nuances
that
make
this
beer
taste
so
good
unlike
some
true
belgian
lambics
i
found
this
beer
to
be
approachable
as
well
i
e
not
hugely
sour
or
funky
or
hard
to
appreciate
the
mouthfeel
is
also
nearly
perfect
for
the
style
pours
a
nice
reddish
black
beer
has
very
little
bubbles
yet
it
is
carbonated
smell
is
of
berries
cherries
etc
taste
is
very
tart
vinegary
it
is
not
a
thick
beer
it
is
medium
bodied
taste
remains
in
your
mouth
as
well
as
aroma
o
excellent
drinkability
state
of
art
lambic
beer
o
phenomenal
flavors
and
highly
drinkable
the
cherry
is
light
but
still
noticeable
and
the
light
to
moderate
tartness
makes
this
highly
drinkable
and
a
good
pairing
with
food
if
only
this
were
widely
available
i
could
see
drinking
this
all

i
dont
know
when
or
if
i
will
get
a
chance
to
pick
up
another
bottle
flavor
as
usual
for
style
this
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
and
it
is
much
fruitier
cherries
raspberries
and
vague
soft
fruits
in
a
moderately
tart

fairly
intense
as
promised
o
outstanding
overall
very
interesting
tart
cherry
flavour
much
more
organic
and
tart
than
that
of
intense
red
kriek
quite
sour
and
interesting
glad
i
saved
this
one
for
a
year
after
my
belgium
trip
cheers
verdict
a
really
fantastic
kriek
from
drie
fronteinen
one
of
their
better
fruited
beers
for
sure
its
jammy
pie
like
and
nice
and
delicate
with
nice
brightness
its
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
fruited
sours
perhaps
it
could
use
some
perk
in
the
body
to
really
take
this
to
the
next
level

like
the

this
suffers
from
insane
bandaid
phenols
in
the
nose
that
separates
these
from
being
cantillon

kriek
the
best
in
style
the
pour
is
gorgeous
inky
hazy
purple
pink
foam
that
settles
quickly
with
acid
cut
but
the
aroma
kills
the
experience
cherry
pie
tries
to
peek
through
huge
bandaid
and
plastic
the
taste
is
salty
sharp
but
medicinal
with
sucrets
and
some
numbing
character
overall
this
is
one
of
those
scroll
past
expensive
lambics
and
probably
the
worst
in
show
for
drie
fonteinen
overall
its
a
little
more
tart
and
cherry
forward
than
the
regular
3f
kriek
but
not
much
a
very
good
kriek
with
a
very
good
base
of
sour
cherries
the
label
was
molded
and
eroding
the
beer
was
deep
garnet
and
as
tart
as
advertised
this
kriek
uses
tarter
cherries
than
the
oude
kriek
which
was
pretty
transparent
i
preferred
the
7year
old
oude
kriek
and
its
decadent
finish
but
this
was
a
nice
treat
as
well
tart
notes
of
balsamic
enamel
decaying
bite
reviewed
22209
overall
a
great
kriek
but
at
the
40
price
point
i
may
not
buy
it
again
o
intense
dry
cherry
sour
its
like
eating
a
handful
of
fresh
sour
cherries
while
wearing
a
brand
new
high
quality
leather
catsuit
only
better
cascade
kriek
is
more
complex
and
tastier
than
this
but
this
is
quite
good
if
you
like
a
super
tart
cherry
beer
apparently
one
of
the
harder
to
find
beers
from
these
guys
and
it
is
a
real
beauty
this
is
the
2010
vintage
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
red
color
like
a
strawberry
frosted
donut
with
some
suspended
yeast
and
only
a
small
white
head
that
settles
quickly
the
nose
is
the
classic
kriek
smell
tart
cherries
sour
yeasty
notes
and
some
mild
residual
sugar
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
not
sweet
and
it
finishes
dryer
which
i
really
like
in
this
kriek
as
opposed
to
others
the
cherry
flavor
is
very
authentic
and
up
front
but
it
doesnt
dominate
the
funky
yeast
lambic
essentials
in
other
words
its
in
wonderful
balance
the
finish
is
super
sour
more
so
than
i
remember
in
any
other
kriek
ive
had
this
one
zaps
all
the
moisture
right
out
of
my
mouth
better
carbonation
than
you
gather
from
the
appearance
and
a
light
enough
body
with
hardly
any
sugar
left
over
when
you
swallow
its
really
got
an
extraordinary
mouthfeel
this
is
by
far
the
best
kriek
ive
had
its
quality
and
tradition
shine
through
still
this
is
a
style
of
beer
that
is
hard
for
me
to
drink
too
much
of
so
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
lot
of
friends
old
and
new
on
hand
to
share
this
with
wonderfully
drinkable
refreshing
light
i
could
drink
this
forever
probably
my
favorite
kriek
ive
had
so
far
on
par
with
the
05
lp
kriek
pours
a
clear
dark
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
cherry
and
cheesy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
funky
cherry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
nice
funky
and
cherry
aromas
and
flavors
o

sourness
very
mellow
sour
that
is
insanely
drinkable
with
the
7
years
on
it
nice
cherry
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
what
red
wine
should
taste
like
overall
lacking
the
drie
fonteinen
complexity
but
that
cherry
flavor
is
very
nice
thats
the
point
i
guess
overall
one
of
the
most
tartsour
lambics
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
really
good
kriek
and
worth
a
try
for
anyone
thats
a
fan
of
the
style
definitely
not
a
starter
sourlambic
though
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
kriek
for
sure
my
fruit

preference
goes
to
cantillon

this
is

i
like
overall
no

this

and
not
for
the

quite
an
extraordinary
beer
o
beautiful
beer
sour
and
wonderful
in
all
ways
after
tasting
it
the
sourness
overwhelms
the
cherry
overall
this
beer
was
great
and
had
a
great
tart
cherry
taste
would
have
liked
a
little
more
funk
but
im
glad
i
got
the
full
frontal

assault
out
of
this
this
is
very
dry

overall
this
is
the

ive
gotten
a
full

of
this

and
it
didnt
disappoint
jowl
tinglingly
sour
and
quite
refreshing
a
classic

overall
it
would
be
nice
if
i
hated
this
because
its
pricey
and
something
i
cant
justify
buying
often
no
dice
it
has
a
good
flavor
profile
the
cherry
notes
come
off
as
genuine
not
artificial
it
looks
good
and
it
has
a
pleasing
mouthfeel
o
this
is
what
i
am
looking
for
when
i
want
a
true
kriek
the
cherries
are
intense
yet
the
sour
funk
keeps
them
in
check
this
bottle
reminds
me
that
i
need
more
of
these
asap
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
up
there
with
cantillon
lp
kriek
and
cable
car
kriek
its
way
more
tart
than
the
other
two
if
thats
your
thing
but
it
still
feels
more
balanced
than
it
probably
is
if
it
werent
for
it
being
3235
a
bottle
id
drink
this
quite
often
o
very
very
good
no
major
flaws
apparently
i
need
to
add
more
characters
before
reviewing
more
characters
more
characters
yada
yada
yada
o
i
absolutely
loved
it
and
this
was
my
first
drie
fonteinen
i
think
i
may
prefer
this
brewery
over
cantillon
how
dare
i
said
this
overall
very
nice
kriek
unique
and
big
cherry
taste
o
excellent
drinkability
this
sour
treat
of
a
beer
was
very
good
d
i
do
enjoy
this
but
i
think
less
age
may
be
the
way
to
go
based
on
my
best
guess
with
the
cherries
really
being
the
emphasis
you
need
to
allow
that
fruit
to
exhibit
its
full
potential
alas
its
definitely
a
treat
of
a
lambic
and
a
cool
step
back
in
time
brilliant
ruby
red
with
a
pinkish
white
head
in
my
mini
duvel
tulip
the
nose
can
be
smelled
across
the
room
holy
cherries
tart
and
juicy
i
cant
remember
having
anything
this
cherryforward
before
aside
from
blabaer
ive
never
had
anything
this
tart
sour
with
just
enough
brettanomyces
funk
in
the
background
beautifully
crafted
refreshing
body
with
a
sparkle
of
carbonation
moar
o
very
tasty
kriek
the
flavors
from
the
fruit
are
very
nice
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
regular
3f
oude
kriek
wish
it
were
cheaper
and
easier
to
find
in
the
us
o
this
is
fantastic
if
only
it
cost
less
than
35
a
bottle
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
that
i
have
taken
for
granted
as
it
sits
on
the
shelf
while
the
cnatillon
flies
off
next
to
it
big
fan
ah
yes
that
expensive
bottle
that
always
just
sits
on
the
shelves
split
with
my
doppelganger
this
past
weekend
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
globe
poured
ruby
red
with
a
half
finger
pinkish
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacint
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
cherry
cherry
and
big
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
big
funk
earth
and
cherry
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
guys
at
gbx
warned
me
that
this
wouldnt
be
what
i
expected
it
to
be
i
must
say
they
were
completely
correct
on
this
fact
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
puckerpower
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
this
one
was
more
of
a
fruity
funkiness
brew
it
was
really
well
done
however
and
quite
enjoyable
definitely
glad
i
finally
decided
to
shell
out
the
dough
on
this
one
might
be
buying
more
in
the
future
to
see
what
that
funky
note
does
with
time
in
the
cellar
based
on
this
first
taste
bottled
april
26
2011
poured
into
some
goose
island
stemware
beautiful
cherry
red
body
with
a
thin
layer
of
pink
foam
musty
barnyard
brett
and
lightly
soured
cherries
on
the
nose
wet
hay
and
a
bit
of
cheese
the
flavor
is
filled
with
dry
tart
cherries
and
light
earthy
malt
in
the
background
the
cherries
in
this
are
excellent
the
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
tartsour
kick
light
spritzy
bubbles
slightly
more
acidic
than
i
remember
the
regular
oude
kriek
being
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
stuff
i
personally
like
it
more
than
the
oude
kriek
but
probably
still
prefer
cantillons
kriek
especially
with
the
28
price
tag
on
this
bottle
a
decent
kriek
but
ive
had
better
ones
deep
red
color
no
head
nice
looking
but
not
great
rich
smell
of
sour
and
cherries
vinegar
and
oak
there
is
some
earth
tones
but
the
cherries
are
the
focus
plenty
of
cherry
lemon
strawberry
seeds
wood
vinegar
there
is
a
lot
of
acetobacter
quite
dry
very
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
long
tart
finish
a
touch
of
astringency
very
fine
carbonation
maybe
a
little
too
much
so
its
kind
of
distracting
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
annoyed
i
paid
as
much
for
it
as
i
did
drie
fonteinen
schaerbeekse
kriek
was
far
more
tart
and
funky
than
i
was
anticipating
it
to
be
i
really
wish
my
bottle
was
a
bit
fresher
so
that
i
could
have
perhaps
tasted
some
of
those
iconic
schaerbeekse
cherries
this
was
enjoyable
but
definitely
not
worth
the
steep
38
price
tag
o
an
excellent
kriek
every
bit
as
good
as
cantillon
kriek
the
flavors
are
simple
but
done
extremely
well
its
a
pricey
beer
but
is
definitely
worth
trying
o
a
very
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
the
tartsourness
is
wonderfully
balanced
with
the
sweetness
which
makes
this
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
red
raspberry
bright
red
in
color
with
a
slight
white
lacing
around
my
snifter
the
nose
is
incredibly
sour
acidic
funky
earthy
and
has
some
yeast
to
it
its
probably
the
most
sour
nose
of
an
beer
not
named
cantillon
this
one
is
pretty
sour
its
so
sour
that
you
cant
get
much
cherry
or
perhaps
i
should
say
any
traditional
cherry
or
a
cherry
piecobbler
its
almost
pure
acid
its
also
a
little
vinous
i
like
it
it
just
isnt
overly
complex
it
cant
be
it
drinks
lighter
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
really
nice
kriek
and
ive
had
it
before
2005s
are
insane
right
now
but
i
feel
this
is
in
its
awkward
teenage
stage
at
just
under
two
years
old
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
at
the
price
of
this
bottle
ill
probably
not
be
sampling
this
one
very
often
but
i
certainly
intend
to
have
it
again
everything
here
is
clean
and
crisp
and
i
can
easily
see
why
many
prefer
their
fruit
lambics
on
the
young
side
before
the
brett
and
funkiness
take
over
i
also
think
that
the
variety
of
cherries
used
does
differentiate
this
from
krieks
made
with
other
tart
cherries
on
the
label
it
describes
these
cherries
as
being
prized
by
the
makers
of
kriek
i
understand
that
now
and
it
isnt
hyperbole
o
overall
this
is
another
great
kriek
from
drie
fonteinen
is
it
better
than
their
normal
kriek
probably
by
a
little
bit
but
when
you
consider
how
much
more
expensive
this
one
is
i
dont
know
if
it
is
worthh
the
price
certainly
not
often
the
difference
between
this
and
their
normal
kriek
is
not
as
wide
a
gap
as
it
is
between
their
oude
gueuze
and
oude
gueuze
vitnage
so
personally
id
rather
buy
23
bottles
of
the
normal
kriek
for
the
same
amount
of
money
definitely
a
good
beer
though
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
timy
bit
of
carbonation
but
it
seems
thicker
because
its
so
sour
really
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
could
find
this
on
the
shelf
all
the
time
extremely
lippuckeringly
sour
extreme
through
the
finish
short
aftertaste
surprisingly
little
cherry
flavor
and
absolutely
no
sweetness
not
your
typical
kriek
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
a
low
carbonation
level
o
this
beer
has
a
good
balance
of
sourness
and
cherry
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
a
little
below
average
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
i
love
cherries
so
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
for
a
while
the
tart
sour
cherries
were
really
great
in
it
pretty
awesome
beer
to
sip
on
this
new
years
eve
what
amazes
me
about
this
is
how
clean
and
crisp
all
the
nuances
are
all
without
the
huge
funky
cheesyness
of
some
other
versions
not
that
that
is
bad
at
all
just
different
here
the
acidicsour
fruits
and
barrel
character
being
the
hole
show
world
class
and
one
of
my
favorite
lambics
o
a
fantastic
kriek
it
has
a
lot
of
complex
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
sour
and
tart
flavors
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
the
standard
oude
kriek
but
the
price
tag
is
really
difficult
to
swallow
still
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
though
dark
blood
red
tiny
bit
of
pink
head
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
tart
cherry
with
a
ton
of
new
pool
toys
flavors
are
mild
sour
cherry
lactic
and
a
unique
funky
hay
and
moldy
wood
mild
carbonation
decent
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
i
love
3f
gueuze
their
fruit
beers
are
not
on
the
same
level
though
o
soft
and
light
but
super
tart
o
one
of
the
top
sours
ive
had
just
a
tasty
drinkable
brew
lively
and
bright
this
is
an
awesome
kriek
though
i
find
that
the
other
notes
that
i
am
enjoying
are
prying
my
focus
from
the
delicious
cherries
that
combined
with
the
price
tag
makes
this
not
quite
equal
to
cantillons
kriek
lambic
in
my
book
pours
a
light
red
with
no
head
but
visible
carbonation
aroma
of
oak
funk
and
cherries
just
as
any
good
kriek
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
where
this
really
shines
taste
rich
of
cherries
oak
and
funk
back
up
the
cherries
nicely
tart
like
no
other
ive
had
mouth
puckering
in
the
best
way
possible
this
is
a
real
treat
overall
a
very
tasty
kriek
the
smell
is
a
bit
offputting
but
still
very
drinkable
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
light
pink
head
scent
is
funky
as
shit
with
sweaty
gym
socks
and
sweet
cherries
tons
of
barnyard
funk
and
tart
cherry
aroma
not
nearly
as
funky
as
the
regular
kriek
from
3f
though
taste
is
immediately
sour
cherry
and
biting
vinegar
tons
of
sour
and
barrel
flavors
lovely
barnyard
funk
awesome
cherry
flavors
mouthfeel
is
sour
and
sticky
on
the
teeth
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
an
amazing
kriek
lambic
i
wish
i
could
do
a
side
by
side
with
the
regular
kriek
from
this
awesome
brewery
3f
never
lets
me
down
popped
this
cork
to
celebrate
my
recent
promotion
heres
hoping
it
was
worth
the
considerable
investment
it
pours
a
cloudy
tawnyrose
topped
by
a
few
fingers
of
pinktinted
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
cherry
light
cobweb
vanilla
light
caramel
very
akin
to
caramel
corn
dank
oak
lactic
acid
lemon
zest
and
a
twist
of
ruby
red
grapefruit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
lactic
acid
and
sour
citrus
notes
seem
to
cloud
the
cherries
out
a
bit
a
touch
of
white
wine
vinegar
is
tossed
into
the
mix
as
well
just
to
liven
things
up
a
bit
its
surprising
that
the
tartness
isnt
more
powerful
especially
considering
the
effect
it
had
on
the
back
of
my
teeth
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
rather
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
nice
lambic
though
its
hard
to
really
enjoy
it
for
an
extended
period
of
time
without
experiencing
some
negative
side
effect
of
the
sourness
though
i
feel
the
cherries
were
talkedup
a
bit
too
much
id
gladly
take
another
glass
but
i
doubt
id
shell
out
the
35
for
it
very
often
in
the
future
d
if
this
werent
so
expensive
id
buy
it
regularly
that
being
said
its
similar
in
price
to
lou
pepe
kriek
arguably
superior
and
is
much
easier
to
find
until
people
wise
up
and
start
hoarding
of
course
im
curious
if
ill
ever
have
the
patience
to
let
this
sit
on
my
shelf
for
five
years
again
a
truly
special
beer
one
of
my
favorites
awesome
sour
beer
so
many
other
sourwild
ales
really
just
cant
compare
to
the
folks
at
drie
fonteinen
sharp
tart
cherries
with
a
good
funk
a
pretty
solid
example
of
the
style
and
to
be
honest
i
am
surprised
how
well
the
fruit
has
held
up
in
this
one
this
was
the
last
bottle
on
the
shelf
at
one
of
my
favorite
shops
in
town
so
i
had
to
grab
it
seeing
as
proper
lambic
is
becoming
a
scarce
commodity
in
this
country
o
great
kriek
and
awesome
sour
i
love
lambics
and
wild
ales
theres
no
denying
schaerbeekse
kriek
is
a
quality
example
of
the
style
a
true
lambic
with
the
accompanying
tartness
and
funk
but
i
wish
there
was
a
touch
less
sour
stuff
and
more
sweetness
it
gets
a
little
too
abrasive
near
the
end
of
the
glass
and
i
find
myself
wishing
for
more
cherry
a
balanced
yet
tart
kriek
good
cherry
flavour
and
quite
nice
on
the
whole
though
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
o
overall
i
think
i
am
drinking
this
beer
too
young
maybe
i
was
expecting
more
brett
complexity
the
fruit
flavor
is
great
but
the
sourness
could
be
overshadowing
the
other
flavors
great
tasting
cherry
lambic
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
i
wanted
to
tackle
this
offering
with
as
fresh
a
bottle
as
possible
to
see
how
much
fruited
flavor
was
in
one
of
these
before
it
fades
and
the
funk
overtakes
it
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
least
i
really
enjoyed
the
natural
flavoring
of
this
brew
and
it
was
very
easy
drinking
at
no
point
did
i
pick
up
on
the
5
alcohol
that
was
listed
on
the
bottle
while
its
not
the
most
impressive
looking
or
smelling
fruit
lambic
schaerbeekse
kriek
is
definitely
among
the
most
fruit
forward
and
tastiest
probably
one
of
if
not
the
most
impressive
widely
available
lambic
out
there
now
fresh
vintages
take
almost
completely
blow
away
the
competition
in
my
opinion
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
very
high
drinkability
tasty
enough
to
be
good
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
sour
enough
to
scratch
that
sour
itch
the
biggest
strike
against
this
beer
is
the
37
price
tag
o
the
barnyard
and
cherry
notes
are
nice
but
turn
a
bit
watery
as
the
beer
opens
up
the
very
soft
tartness
and
not
much
depth
make
it
a
bit
drap
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
overall
enjoyable
light
sour
and
interesting
but
im
left
wanting
to
try
this
in
a
verticalstyle
setting
where
we
can
really
see
the
beauty
of
the
yeast
taking
the
edge
off
of
the
sweetness
worth
seeking
out
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
forget
about
it
for
a
while
and
tackle
it
on
a
warm
day
as
its
tasty
now
and
i
can
only
imagine
how
tasty
itd
be
later
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
best
kriek
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
the
schaerbeekse
cherries
are
truly
unique
and
are
an
obvious
choice
to
pair
with
lambic
style
beer
be
ready
to
sip
as
this
beast
is
very
very
tart
lightbodied
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
and
a
thin
dryness
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
great
tasting
lambic
for
sure
id
say
the
price
is
justified
a
bitwas
just
hoping
to
have
experienced
a
bit
more
considering
the
rarity
of
these
cherries
just
lucky
to
have
been
able
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
and
give
it
a
try
another
welldone
item
by
armand
mouthfeel
not
over
the
top
cherry
is
a
little
cloying
refreshing
but
not
as
good
as
the
rest
750
ml
bottle
bottled
in
april
2010
pours
a
dark
red
with
small
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
huge
cherry
some
cherry
pits
some
lactic
acid
light
barnyard
funkiness
and
just
the
smallest
hint
of
acetic
acid
awesome
the
taste
is
again
huge
with
cherry
flavor
without
sweetness
cherry
pits
a
decent
amount
of
sourness
with
a
good
lactic
tartness
on
the
finish
medium
body
low
carbonation
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
a
bit
low
and
felt
the
beer
would
have
definitely
benefited
from
more
carbonation
still
a
phenomenal
beer
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
fresh
lou
pepe
kriek
i
had
on
tap
a
few
weeks
ago
i
found
the
lou
pepe
to
be
slightly
more
enjoyable
but
certainly
loved
this
as
well
not
a
bad
kriek
and
a
pretty
bright
and
unapologetically
acidic
one
it
doesnt
have
a
great
deal
of
complexity
and
the
rampant
acidity
makes
me
consider
it
a
little
unbalanced
but
its
a
respectable
beer
nonetheless
no
head
to
speak
of
color
was
a
cloudy
raspberry
red
nose
smelled
of
oak
and
cherries
i
was
reminded
of
some
of
the
better
homemade
wines
my
uncle
made
while
we
were
out
in
the
bay
area
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
initial
cherry
tartness
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
pleasant
oakiness
finish
was
tart
but
not
puckeringly
so
very
cherry
underlain
by
oak
l
like
drie
fonteinen
and
this
was
another
shining
example
of
their
beers
750

pours
a
ruby
redpurple
color
with
a
very
small
light
pink
head
head
retention
is
low
and
theres
also
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
tart
cherries
barnyard
funk
vinegar
and
some
oak
i
think
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
its
all
tart
cherries
funk
vinegar
and
oak
the
sourness
isnt
overpowering
at
all
but
its
a
pretty
good
tasting
brew
theres
also
a
lingering
tart
finish
the
beer
just
tastes
better
and
better
the
longer
i
drink
it
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
it
has
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
its
somewhat
slick
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
ages
my
only
complaint
about
this
beer
is
the
price
at
33
99
a
bottle
but
even
then
i
dont
think
i
was
ripped
off
for
the
price
and
i
would
likely
buy
this
again
at
the
same
or
similar
price
if
i
come
across
it
overall
unique
to
try
significantly
different
from
the
bottled
and
refermented
one
this
is
like
a
lambic
with
fresh
cherries
juice
i
had
world
class
fruit
beers
before
hommage
framboos
fou
foune
blabaer
but
this
must
be
the
best
fruit
taste
i
ever
had
pure
juice
amazing
d
a
great
sour
pucker
this
is
darn
good
i
love
the
funky
aroma
most
of
all
this
beers
acidity
is
high
thus
making
it
one
to
take
slowly
edit
the
last
bottle
i
had
could
have
used
a
tad
more
carbonation
still
lovely
but
had
to
change
the
4
85
score
it
was
well
see
if
it
rises
back
to
the
top
still
have
plenty
of
bottles
on
hand
this
beer
pours
a
purple
reddish
color
with
thin
to
barely
there
head
the
smell
is
huge
barnyard
funk
with
a
faint
cherry
note
and
some
tart
notes
mixed
in
as
well
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
funkiness
taking
the
cake
cherry
flavor
is
all
but
gone
and
there
is
a
tart
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
slightly
acidic
overall
a
good
beer
but
would
like
to
try
fresh
o
the
only
thing
i
can
seriously
slam
this
on
is
the
price
tag
although
the
style
can
vaguely
justify
it
this
beer
does
an
amazing
job
balancing
everything
out
especially
considering
there
isnt
really
that
sweetness
that
you
get
in
some
lambics
definitely
seek
this
out
if
you
can
afford
it
drink
i
wanted
to
go
big
for
600
and
i
have
seen
this
at
two
bars
and
i
never
pulled
the
trigger
due
to
so
when
a
friend
of
mine
had
this
at
his
shop
i
had
to
pounce
on
it
so
glad
i
did
it
was
true
to
its
nature
and
tasty
id
have
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
a
great
sour
though
as
usual
i
wish
the
cherries
were
a
bit
stronger
really
nice
funk
though
and
very
drinkable
considering
the
style
the
finish
of
this
is
superb
the
cherry
wine
vinegar
and
vinous
notes
combine
to
form
a
great
flavor
o
with
a
bit
less
tartness
this
would
hold
up
the
the
lou
peppe
kriek
however
for
the
time
being
cantillon
takes
the
crown
in
my
opinion
overall
i
was
a
bit
let
down
considering
the
high
price
tag
associated
with
it
the
regular
drie
fonteinen
kriek
has
a
bit
of
a
better
cherry
flavor
quite
good
i
had
no
issues
drinking
this
and
if
the
price
was
cut
back
drastically
i
would
buy
this
far
more
often
a
very
clean
beer
in
aroma
and
taste
this
is
one
of
the
best
balanced
fruit
lambics
ive
had
revealing
a
nice
sweet
flavor
while
maintaining
the
wonderful
yeast
tartness
the
feel
is
this
is
great
perfectly
light
body
with
soft
carbonation
when
it
comes
down
ot
it
i
really
wonder
if
it
gets
better
than
this
a
real
treat
here
dr
an
excellent
beer
i
have
to
admit
given
the
rarity
and
price
tag
this
one
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
unfair
standards
i
think
i
would
actually
give
this
one
more
time
in
the
future
to
allow
some
of
the
brett
to
play
out
a
bit
more
also
i
am
not
sure
if
the
cherries
just
faded
but
they
didnt
play
as
big
a
role
as
i
was
expecting
d
im
hard
pressed
to
find
the
6
abv
drinks
fantastic
and
is
very
refreshing
on
this
beautiful
spring
day
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
russian
river
supplication
which
is
a
bonus
as
rr
does
not
distribute
to
the
midwest
the
750ml
was
a
bit
pricey
but
for
the
style
this
is
par
for
the
course
cheers
d
overall
it
is
a
solid
fruit
lambic
there
are
better
ones
out
there
especially
considering
the
it
costs
for
one
of
these
nonetheless
this
is
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
just
wish
it
had
something
more
to
offer
considering
the
higher
price
tag
this
demands
on
the
shelves
the
taste
is
not
as
sour
as
id
have
guessed
but
it
does
have
some
lactic
strength
i
actually
think
the
cherries
are
responsible
for
some
of
the
tart
character
at
least
it
seemed
that
way
a
very
good
match
of
fruit
and
lambic
this
was
a
nice
surprise
on
cask
bottle
thanks
to
glouglouburp
fairly
dark
brownish
red
pour
with
slightly
pink
foam
aroma
is
nice
and
fruity
but
not
the
classic
cherry
pie
cherry
aroma
more
of
a
subtle
tart
nose
of
cherries
with
hints
of
blueberries
there
is
something
fresh
about
the
aroma
that
makes
it
so
memorable
a
fresh
breeze
of
mint
and
pine
classic
lambic
funk
character
superb
taste
is
very
sour
with
a
nice
red
berries
twist
but
not
very
funky
with
a
very
dry
finish
a
lambic
for
the
purist
maybe
a
little
bit
too
sour
and
dry
for
me
but
still
excellent
thanks
to
ba
dannyhipps
for
the
bottle
best
anniversary
present
ive
gotten
in
a
while
truly
a
delightful
drink
lots
of
clean
sour
flavor
you
can
taste
and
smell
the
cherries
in
just
the
right
proportion
i
will
be
seeking
this
beer
out
again
so
far
the
most
complex
kriek
ive
tried
very
demanding
while
not
a
pretentious
beer
being
an
ancientrustic
almost
primordial
style
it
is
still
one
to
be
sipped
cherished
and
engaged
with
your
full
attention
would
pair
very
well
with
a
variety
of
cheeses
d
super
drinkable
probably
my
favorite
sour
thus
far
pours
the
most
brilliant
bright
red
you
could
imagine
with
a
small
but
tight
pink
head
the
aroma
is
dirty
laundry
and
dirty
barnyard
with
some
animal
waste
and
hay
in
there
for
sure
there
is
plenty
of
intense
cherry
sourness
in
there
throughout
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
strong
sourness
and
lots
of
tart
cherries
the
beer
is
earthy
and
complex
with
light
leathery
notes
and
a
very
complimentary
nuttiness
the
palate
is
both
full
and
well
carbonated
like
a
sparkling
wine
magnificent
an
absolute
masterpiece
d
very
drinkable
tasty
and
satisfying
the
exceptionally
high
level
of
tartness
makes
one
750
enough
bottled
october

2008
awesomer
purer
fruitier
moresour
and
nuttier
than
the
regular
drie
oude
kriek
is
the
best
point
of
reference
i
can
give
pours
a
hazy
and
kind
of
glowing
pinkred
with
a
pink
head
that
crackles
and
fades
to
a
collar
that
sticks
the
whole
time
nose
is
an
acidic
blast
of
superclean
bright
cherry
and
hints
of
other
fruits
i
swear
i
get
raspberry
and
plum
too
along
with
some
nuttiness
earth
mushroom
and
oak
theres
definitely
some
dark
almost
roasty
underlying
flavor
that
is
hard
to
describe
that
just
fills
everything
out
knocks
my
socks
off
but
not
huge
and
overpowering
just
subtle
and
elegant
taste
is
sour
cherry
fruity
nutty
blast
in
perfect
balance
im
sure
age
has
soured
it
up
a
bit
and
zipped
it
up
a
bit
in
the
mouthfeel
but
it
seems
about
prime
right
now
i
would
love
to
do
a
vertical
with
a
fresh
one
of
these
in
the
mix
awesome
i
could
drink
this
all
day
makes
me
dream
of
cherry
trees
somewhat
underwhelmed
with
this
brew
but
i
suspect
its
just
because
its
so
young
really
dug
the
3
year
old
oude
kriek
that
i
drank
recently
though
tasted
of
mild
fruit
but
mostly
tart
and
acidic
with
some
overly
sweet
tones
brett
all
over
here
with
an
oaky
woodiness
to
just
over
the
top
funkiness
that
really
cradled
the
sweet
fruit
juice
flavors
drinkability
great
beer
not
worth
36
for
a
750
ml
but
worth
trying
i
still
promote
the
cantillon
cherry
kriek
if
looking
for
a
great
lambic
this
one
only
being
2025
depending
on
where
you
purchase
it
lighter
body
nice
carbonation
some
dry
and
sticky
feels
but
plenty
of
bubbliness
which
invigorates
the
sense
drinks
easy
throughout
the
entire
serving
the
tartness
is
fairly
aggressive
but
still
enjoyable
and
this
goes
down
pretty
smooth
for
the
most
part
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
but
nice
fizz
on
the
tongue
without
being
sparkling
this
feels
alive
an
authentic
sour
i
could
drink
all
day
long
without
suffering
from
heartburn
or
loosing
the
enamel
on
my
teeth
just
amazing
business
here
it
cuts
through
with
tons
of
acidic
properties
fruit
flavor
is
very
subtle
overall
this
is
a
great
kriek
i
went
in
thinking
this
was
going
to
be
super
sour
like
the
lou
pepe
and
was
a
little
disappointed
but
after
drinking
more
i
really
enjoy
the
added
complexity
it
brings
to
the
front
the
only
real
downfall
it
has
is
the
finish
highly
recommended
overall
i
much
prefer
this
fresh
to
the
older
vintages
the
fruit
flavor
is
much
more
dominant
and
brings
a
wonderful
balance
to
this
beer
also
love
the
level
of
sourness
just
enough
to
make
the
mouth
pucker
but
not
to
the
point
where
it
will
put
a
hole
in
your
stomach
another
awesome
lambic
looking
forward
to
the
day
where
i
can
just
pick
up
an
american
lambic
and
have
it
taste
just
as
great
as
this
beer
i
have
to
give
drie
fonteinen
schaerbeekse
kriek
a
super
uber
nom
noms
d
d
i
liked
it
but
at
the
risk
of
earning
alfrantzells
wrath
and
being
a
target
for
narke
xantus
pt
ii
i
thought
it
wasnt
worth
35
i
will
try
it
once
more
fresh
and
see
if
that
changes
my
impression
but
i
can
certainly
say
the
price
is
not
worth
it
for
an
aged
bottle
on
the
plus
side
i
seem
not
to
have
any
reactions
to
this
beer
so
maybe
its
just
cantillon
that
bothers
me
d
not
as
tartsour
as
other
lambics
like
cantillon
but
extremely
drinkable

the
taste
to
me

just
a

would
definitely
drink
more

this

even
better
than
the

i
though
was
the
benchmark
before
this

actually
blows
it
away
one
of
the
most

comments
overall
a
fine
kriek
lambic
it
carries
many
of
the
fine
characteristics
found
within
the
gueze
style
this
is
my
kind
of
lambic
j
this
is
decent
but
nothing
special
not
worth
pursuing
wildly
sour
dry
and
drinkable
describe
this
beer
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
as
lambics
are
always
interesting
beers
to
drink
taste
is
awesome
so
tart
an
sour
and
super
funky
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
thin
but
its
very
drinkable
its
super
tasty
and
drinkable
worth
seeking
out
overall
the
medicine
is
what
kills
this
beer
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
others
i
have
had
from
them
not
worth
the
price
tag
imo
somewhat
drinkable
if
one
can
get
past
the
medicine
flavor
d
we
easily
finished
the
bottle
and
we
both
wanted
more
this
is
going
to
be
a
classic
in
due
time
stock
up
now

its

isnt
my
favorite
kriek
that
probably
goes
to
the
cantillon
lou
pepe
kriek
but
it
is
probably
the
most
unique
when
compared
to
other
krieks
and
for
that
it
will
always
have
a
favored

a
truly
unique

with

charachteristics
of

overall
a
beautiful
beer
that
was
incredibly
balanced
and
drinkable
its
a
masterpiece
what
else
can
i
say
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
at
appropriate
levels
this
one
drinks
very
nicely
never
becoming
overwhelming
for
the
palate
overall
i
am
very
impressed
by
the
balance
of
this
beer
top
quality
kriek
for
sure
d
based
on
the
way
it
looked
i
thought
i
was
in
deep
trouble
but
i
could
probably
drink
this
one
on
my
own
even
though
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
beer
to
me
3f
schaerbeekse
kriek
pours
a
very
rich
and
beautiful
shade
of
red
with
a
huge
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
and
leaves
no
trace
of
lacing
behind
very
tart
cherry
scents
fill
the
olfactory
senses
from
several
feet
away
there
is
a
great
funkiness
to
this
beer
that
has
developed
over
the
six
years
it
spent
in
the
cellar
the
taste
is
musty
and
sour
with
tart
cherries
truly
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
with
mild
acidity
present
in
the
finish
there
was
still
plenty
of
fruit
present
after
six
years
i
recommend
aging
this
great
fruit
lambic
as
it
will
only
get
better
f
lingering
sour
cherry
very
sour
and
tangy
especially
on
the
finish
a
touch
of
balsamic
vinegar
taste
as
well
dry
very
dry
with
a
touch
of
yeasty
flavor
and
more
funk
this
time
a
combination
of
sour
fruit
funk
and
barnyard
a
little
bitterness
seems
to
come
from
the
yeast
and
funk
as
well
tart
puckering
medium
body
that
is
pretty
sweet
and
not
very
acidic
soft
carbonation
up
front
with
some
slight
funk
earthy
oak
and
vanilla
the
cherries
are
very
prominent
providing
an
extremely
fresh
sweet
juicy
fruit
flavor
which
is
an
excellent
balance
to
the
funky
tart
sourness
im
also
picking
up
a
slight
nut
presence
that
adds
to
the
earthy
character
dry
finish
this
beer
is
very
complex
well
balanced
and
insanely
drinkable
highly
recommended
beer
is
quite
sour
lots
of
lactic
and
some
citric
acetic
is
lesser
but
is
still
there
the
cherries
are
not
as
forward
as
i
would
have
wanted
i
think
the
off
aroma
i
was
smelling
was
actually
the
cherry
flavor
second
taste
not
as
tart
as
i
want
it
to
be
its
like
a
big
red
gueze
with
a
fruity
aftertaste
interesting
very
nice
lambic
but
not
really
worth
the
price
over
the
oud
kriek
all
things
considered
while
this
is
very
good
beer
though
disappointing
id
have
to
take
the
oude
kriek
over
it
overall
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
good
but
not
this
good
i
was
floored
by
this
and
if
not
for
the
price
tag
i
would
buy
a
lot
of
this
to
stock
up
notch
below
most
3f
offerings
and
one
of
the
most
expensive
here
in
the
states
at
that
40
d
low
abv
with
a
nearperfect
level
of
lactic
sourness
this
is
one
to
be
savored
but
one
that
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
utterly
drinkable
but
one
to
savor
for
sure
the
fruit
may
have
faded
slghtly
but
so
has
the
acidity
and
right
now
this
is
a
fine
kriek
one
ill
be
picking
up
indefinitely
overall
this
is
one
of
the
crisper
smelling
sours
ive
had
in
a
while
and
the
way
it
opens
up
as
it
warms
is
very
nice
well
worth
a
shot
i
bought
multiple
bottles
to
confirm
each
expressed
the
same
delicate
funk
the
same
full
figured
fruit
the
same
balance
one
last
bottle
awaits
me
in
the
cellar
but
it
wont
wait
long
who
would
have
thought
perfection
would
be
pink
corked
and
caged
750
pours
a
brilliant
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
pink
head
that
was
gone
quickly
and
no
lacing
wow
great
color
on
this
beer
and
leaves
me
with
high
hopes
for
the
amount
of
cherry
that
must
be
in
play
here
nice
funky
brett
notes
come
out
at
first
notes
of
wood
leather
and
mustiness
only
a
small
amount
of
cherry
comes
out
in
the
nose
but
it
starts
to
show
more
as
it
warms
flavor
is
bracingly
tart
and
acidic
nice
mixture
of
acidity
oak
and
tartness
with
hints
of
lemon
in
the
front
followed
by
an
earthy
herbal
almost
cheesy
like
flavor
and
just
a
touch
of
cherry
on
the
back
end
that
almost
turns
medicinal
as
it
warms
and
gets
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
musty
funky
and
sour
are
the
best
words
to
describe
this
perfect
medium
body
on
this
with
some
abrasive
carbonation
at
first
but
turns
light
and
delicate
near
the
end
wow
what
can
i
say
i
wish
this
one
came
in
a
33cl
bottle
because
the
750ml
is
getting
to
be
tough
to
put
away
by
myself
should
have
shared
this
with
others
but
i
be
a
glutton
for
the
evening
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
fruit
lambics
ive
ever
had
and
certainly
blows
away
lindemans
kriek
in
not
only
flavor
but
also
complexity
great
brew
and
glad
i
had
the
chancce
to
try
it
before
drie
fonteinen
moves
away
from
producing
lambics
and
looks
more
towards
distilling
and
blending
d
im
glad
to
have
finally
been
able
to
give
this
lambic
a
try
great
cherry
and
funk
to
this
one
and
id
drink
it
again
any
day
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
tart
lip
smacking
funky
and
addictive
drinkability
is
good
but
not
quite
outstanding
overall
though
this
beer
is
outstanding
easily
one
of
the
better
fruit
lambics
out
there
not
a
bad
fruit
lambic
and
its
got
some
nice
complexity
in
the
nose
and
flavour
but
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
in
fact
id
say
that
drie
fonteinens
regular
kriek
is
preferable
to
this
one
hopefully
that
one
is
still
going
to
be
produced
at
boon
while
not
overly
sour
this
one
is
a
gut
buster
could
feel
it
part
way
through
and
i
think
drinking
a
while
750
might
make
you
regret
it
in
the
morning
with
all
those
bugs
not
as
drinkable
as
i
could
have
hoped
due
to
carbonation
still
quite
complex
and
nice
but
just
not
a
regular
d
nicely
complex
a
real
winner
gives
cantillon
kriek
a
run
for
its
money
over
all
a
nice
lambic
pretty
tasty
i
suppose
ill
need
to
try
a
fresher
batch
the
beer
didnt
quite
meet
my
expectations
but
i
admit
that
they
were
high
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
it
again
i
had
no
trouble
drinking
the
bottle
edit
10
june
2010
i
got
to
try
this
at
the
great
lambic
summit
in
philly
side
by
side
with
the
2007
lou
pepe
kriek
while
i
preferred
the
lou
pepe
the
schaerbeekse
was
almost
as
excellent
as
i
remembered
it
being
the
fruit
character
of
the
sk
is
more
explosive
a
touch
funkier
maybe
a
touch
solventy
certainly
more
leathery
and
a
little
more
tannic
as
well
drinkability
high
no
overwhelming
flavor
or
sweetness
all
mixed
together
very
well
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
to
enjoy
thanks
bo
d
quite
nice
overall
much
better
than
the
other
overly
sweet
krieks
that
are
widely
available
d
a
very
good
fruit
lambik
with
an
interesting
cherry
character
impressive
interesting
very
good
huge
thanks
to
koopa
for
sending
this
my
way
thank
you
so
much
i
included
it
as
part
of
a
larger
sour
tasting
reddishpink
color
and
different
than
the
hommage
smells
like
cherry
lambic
but
not
as
fruity
as
i
hoped
then
again
this
was
bottled
in
march
of
2005
so
that
could
be
a
factor
the
taste
was
spritzy
cherries
that
reminded
me
of
cherry
7up
this
was
a
good
enough
kriek
but
nowhere
close
the
hommage
d
all
day
long
so
good
and
easy
to
drink
they
are
one
of
those
breweries
that
you
see
their
beer
you
do
not
even
think
about
it
twice
thanks
to
a
friend
for
bringing
this
back
from
the
cracked
kettle
in
amsterdam
oude
kriek
how
about
old
funky
kriek
the
cherries
are
just
barely
in
here
sure
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
red
with
a
short
pink
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
big
on
horseblanket
leather
fresh
garden
herbal
tea
the
flavor
has
more
lemon
peel
and
lime
with
a
drop
of
cherry
sugar
candy
the
finish
is
tart
farmhouse
funk
thanks
to
bifrostguard
for
opening
this

at

750ml
into
a

this
beer
pours
a
clear
glowing
garnet
color
with
a
finger
of
cherryred
foam
the
nose
is
muted
at
colder
temperatures
but
it
begins
to
open
up
around
60
degrees
sour
cherries
at
the
forefront
juicy
and
sharp
with
a
leathery
barnyardlike
funky
backbone
the
cherries
are
beautifully
expressed
in
the
aroma
swirling
brings
out
one
of
the
most
intense
tart
cherry
aroma
ive
come
across
in
beer
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
sharp
and
acidic
from
start
to
end
massively
fruity
but
subtly
complex
earth
leather
and
tobacco
undertones
lead
into
a
crisp
biting
finish
the
sourness
is
very
lactic
and
concentrated
and
the
beer
on
the
whole
is
surprisingly
clean
which
really
helps
to
showcase
the
character
of
the
fruit
this
ones
tart
as
hell
a
definite
sipper
but
one
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
for
over
an
hour
this
beer
seems
younger
or
greener
than
the
oud
kriek
the
shaerbeekse
cherries
may
be
a
more
tart
version
of
those
used
in
the
oud
kriek
or
perhaps
i
have
a
new
bottle
that
is
less
aged
regardless
the
comparisons
are
so
slight
that
i
might
not
recognize
them
if
not
having
both
within
the
same
week
fresher
more
tart
and
with
an
overall
vibrant
quality
i
may
give
the
slight
edge
to
the
shaerbeekse
version
almost
definitely
the
best
kriek
ive
ever
had
and
probably
the
best
lambic
as
well
d
this
reminds
me
of
blending
a
lambic
and
quelque
chose
not
as
tartsour
as
other
lambics
but
extremely
drinkable
d
one
to
share
with
friends
no
way
i
could
polish
off
a
bottle
of
this
low
in
abv
and
high
in
flavor
but
not
too
harsh
on
the
palete
im
quite
liking
this
offering
from
fonteinen
would
drink
again
im
just
not
sure
if
i
will
be
able
to
find
it
again

not

everything
is

the
carrythrough
of
the

is
pretty
amazing
very

indeed

this

not
over
the

despite
the
fairly
strong

it
does
possess

quality
it
also
has
a

this
is

from

lovely

overall
this
was
excellent
easily
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
in
the
style
and
well
worth
its
reputation
and
ranking
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
getting
this
one
again
any
day
really
a
top
notch
beer
and
something
that
any
fan
of
sours
really
needs
to
give
a
try
this
was
a
nice
sour
and
very
tasty
not
much
cherry
for
a
kriek
beer
but
i
didnt
mind
it
so
much
it
is
very
straightforward
good
but
not
sure
if
it
is
worth
the
high
price
tag
to
be
buying
to
much
of
this
stuff
best
to
split
the
cost
with
a
friend
my
girlfriend
took
one
smell
and
made
a
face
then
she
took
a
sip
and
almost
gagged
at
the
sourness
i
guess
she
was
expecting
lindemanns
thank
god
she
didnt
like
it
since
i
had
absolutely
no
problem
finishing
off
the
entire
bottle
this
is

amazingly

then
shaking
my

the
intense
puckering

takes
over
then
slowly
subsides
im
really
enjoying
it
the
bottle
was
a
touch
pricey
but
id
happily
get
this
one
again
good
beer
but
best
held
for
those
special
occasions
when
you
have
a
nice
meal
to
pare
it
with
this
beer
was
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
not
quite
as
sharp
and
focussed
as
the
cantillon
lou
pepe
imo
still
very
tasty
pours
an
absolutely
brilliant
color
of
purplish
red
like
some
exotic
variety
of
blood
transluscent
with
haze
and
fine
suspended
particles
but
no
protein
coagulation
nice
head
that
is
tinted
pink
absolutely
magnificent
in
the
glass
with
the
light
hitting
it
just
right
the
smell
is
sharply
sour
but
witth
a
touch
of
cream
as
well
predominant
component
aroma
is
sour
cherrries
very
little
barnyard
funk
but
very
nice
zingy
cherries
the
taste
is
complex
with
cherrry
sourness
and
unlike
the
aroma
quite
a
bit
of
funk
there
are
also
some
fairly
pronounced
phenolic
notes
but
these
are
fairly
well
integrated
and
fade
a
bit
with
the
beer
opening
up
the
cherrry
flavors
are
very
pure
and
sort
of
float
over
the
other
flavors
in
the
glass
still
its
not
a
perfectly
harmonious
whole
and
although
good
something
is
lacking
a
bit
to
bring
it
all
together
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
a
delight
good
drinkability
but
the
phenols
and
lack
of
totally
integrated
whole
make
it
a
bit
challenging
i
like
this
beer
a
good
bit
just
not
quite
as
much
as
some
of
the
cantillon
examples
or
quite
as
much
as
far
as
taste
goes0
as
i
thought
i
might

isnt

odd
going

here
just
a
traditional
kriek
lambic
here
with
a
pretty
full
taste
and
a
bit
of
a
sharp
edge
well
crafted
and
worth
trying
the
only
detractor
is
the
sharp
edge
that
might
turn
some
people

some
scant
lacing
aroma
of
course
has
a
very
strong
presence
of
acid
but
the
overall
funk
seems
a
bit
muted
and
restrained
still
has
a
mossy
old
attic
aroma
thing
going
on
has
one
of
the
more
pronounced
fresh
cherry
aromas
out
of
any
other
kriek
ive
had
i
get
a
little
faint
earthy
hop
in
the
background
flavor
gets
kicked
off
with
intense
acid
and
a
touch
of
rubber
and
woodiness
this
segues
into
a
bright
fresh
cherry
flavor
along
with
some
mild
accompanying
sweetness
which
rides
out
into
the
drying
and
tart
finish
has
a
bit
of
a
fungal
element
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
straddles
the
line
between
light
and
moderate
in
weight
and
has
a
lively
carbonation
although
this
is
not
one
of
the
most
complex
lambics
this
like
all
traditional
lambics
is
really
drinkable
overall
a
real
nice
drinking
beer
shared
it
with
a
wine
loving
buddy
of
mine
and
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
tons
of
flavor
with
an
insane
amount
of
spritz
the
tartness
of
this
one
makes
it
extra
special
if
this
is
their
kriek
i
cant
wait
to
try
their
gueuze
that
i
have
in
the
fridge
d
a
year
ago
i
never
wouldve
thought
something
tart
and
sour
could
be
considered
even
remotely
refreshing
i
guess
that
proves
our
palates
are
always
evolving
this
is
awesome
poured
from
750ml

port
bottle
shop
poured
into
guezue
glass
poured
a
murky
rust
red
color
with
nice
white
bubbly
head
smells
are
a
low
amount
of
farmhouse
funk
but
a
big
vingear
cherry
aroma
springs
out
to
you
taste
is
cherry
with
a
little
vingear
followed
by
a
nice
tart
dryness
the
low
level
of
carbonation
gives
a
smooth
feel
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
kriek
every
time
i
want
a
kriek
the
smoothest
kriek
ever

character
natural
pure

and
lingering
on

mouth
feel
seems
a
bit
off
awfully
outstanding
still
but
not
my
favorite
of
3f
whats
it
say
when
a
sip
of
beer
makes
you
think
of
a
savory
cherry
pie
albeit
one
with
some
downhome
farm
funkitude
it
says
someone
is
a
master
with
their
fruit
lambics
its
in
turn
subtle
bold
patient
and
brisk
i
was
almost
worried
about
getting
a
pit
with
my
cherries
well
not
really
but
you
know
what
im
saying
and
ill
tell
you
i
was
sad
to
empty
this
bottle
and
even
sadder
that
it
was
the
only
one
i
had
but
there
is
more
in
my
future
of
this
you
can
be
sure
extreme
tartness
dries
the
mouth
and
the
carbonation
is
very
appropriate
if
you
like
sour
its
very
easy
to
finish
off
an
entire
bottle
great
lambic
drinkability
would
be
a
5
if
i
could
have
this
all
the
time
an
8
hour
round
trip
prevents
me
from
that
bottle
courtesy
of
boboski
poured
a
cloudy
bright
redpink
color
lambic
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
some
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sour
cherry
and
oak
is
pretty
dominant
and
overly
enjoyable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sour
cherry
tart
and
oaky
notes
are
also
very
present
i
thought
the
level
of
acidity
was
quite
low
or
at
least
well
balance
that
it
was
not
getting
in
the
way
this
was
definitely
a
notch
above
the
regular
kriek
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
had
a
year
and
a
half
later
and
the
ageing
and
being
a
very
fortunate
bottle
made
it
exceptionally
smooth
good
oaking
a
touch
of
astringency
very
fine
carbonation
nice
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
absolutely
stellar
stuff
and
worth

so

such
a
classic
dry

with
pure
delicious
expression
of
fruit
no
sweetness
to
speak
of
initial
sharpness
softens
and
mellows
as
this
amazing
creation
changes
and
develops
in

a
treat
had
this
once
before
at

devil

ruby
color
with
absolutely
no

clarity
is
moderately
clear
and
there
is
no
carbonation
at
all
good
looking
cherry
lambic
this
one
smells
of
lots
of
sourness
with
a
light
kiss
of
cherry
there
is
a
big
mustyness
in
there
as
well
this
one
defintately
is
not
focused
on
the
fruit
with
a
very
nice
sour
and
musty
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
flavor
does
with
this
one
taking
a
sip
i
get
nice
mild
sourness
accentuated
by
very
spicey
oak
tannin
and
fruity
cherry
the
sourness
is
mild
just
enough
to
balance
the
fruity
cherry
this
one
is
not
heavy
in
flavor
but
the
subtlty
of
it
really
accentuates
the
fruity
notes
i
really
like
it
feel
is
moderate
with
a
minimal
carbonation
it
is
only
slightly
puckering
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
so
it
really
keeps
this
one
drinking
very
easy
i
really
like
this
one
i
think
the
flavors
are
really
well
balanced
with
a
really
nice
spicey
tannin
and
cherry
in
the
aftertaste
i
could
probably
drink
this
one
all
night
very
good
show
served
from
a
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
at
coopers
seafood
in
scranton
pa
the
beer
poured
a
nice
redish
color
with
a
medium
thickness
pink
head
and
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
cherries
but
also
a
nice
kick
of
barnyard
funk
the
taste
is
very
tart
and
strong
cherry
taste
along
with
the
funk
but
the
funk
is
not
overpowering
a
very
enjoyable
taste
as
if
the
cherries
were
freshly
picked
this
ranks
right
up
there
with
any
cantillon
offerings
definitely
worth
trying
this
great
blender
and
brewer
of
lambics
has
a
very
limited
product
line
but
their
tuff
is
top
notch
it
uses
the
same
type
of
cherries
as
the
draft
version
schaerbeek
but
that
is
where
the
similarity
ends
the
bottled
version
is
dry
sour
and
has
a
bit
of
cherry
in
the
nose
it
is
definitely
not
sweet
and
the
cherry
is
not
too
apparent
in
the
flavor
the
kriek
is
the
typical
deep
red
color
and
was
quite
tasty
of
course
there
is
the
lambic
flavor
present
to
balance
and
enhance
the
subtle
cherry
flavor
the
750ml
bottle
had
a
bottled
on
date
of
march
of
05
dark
red
body
with
a
small
white
bubbly
head
that
quickly
recedes
down
leaving
some
light
rings
of
lacing
big
aroma
filled
with
tart
cherries
woody
notes
and
some
light
funkiness
a
light
sweetness
peaks
through
the
mainly
sour
nose
i
am
surprised
how
much
the
cherries
come
through
the
flavor
starts
off
with
the
sour
cherries
some
lambic
funk
and
some
wood
notes
the
tartness
is
pretty
strong
but
not
huge
finishes
up
with
a
dry
acidic
bite
with
lingering
light
cherries
the
cherries
come
through
well
in
all
aspects
of
the
beer
and
while
this
isnt
a
sour
monster
its
more
than
tart
enough
for
any
sour
beer
fan
mouthfeel
is
great
with
perfect
carbonation
amazing
drinkability
as
the
only
thing
limiting
me
from
having
this
all
the
time
is
the
price
and
rarity
drinkability
notes

easier
to
drink
than
just
about
any
other
lambic
i
have
had
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
american
products
like
belgian
red
or
supplication
than
a
traditional
belgian
kriek
because
the
sourness
is
more
restrained
and
the
fruit
flavor
is
fuller
and
fresher
a
must
try
if
you
can
find
it
even
at
the
steep
price
taste
the
cherries
came
out
as
real
and
as
potent
as
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
lambic
it
was
like
eating
fresh
ripe
cherries
it
was
relatively
sweet
so
the
acidity
seemed
a
bit
more
shadowed
but
still
plenty
puckering
the
funk
factor
was
also
a
bit
toned
down
in
the
taste
in
fact
im
really
surprised
that
mélanie
didnt
like
this
more
than
her
usual
halfsip
and
puckered
face
the
drinkability
for
me
was
through
the
roof
pours
a
dark
pink
color
with
orangey
tints
no
head
whatsoever
very
very
tart
smell
also
shows
a
lot
of
gueze
in
the
mouth
immediatly
very
dry
austere
very
tart
and
puckering
as
in
i
could
feel
my
cheeks
sucking
in
very
dry
finish
delicate
cherry
flavors
gueze
funk
tartness
and
some
cherry
funk
too
interesting
still
not
as
good
as
the
cask
oude
kriek
though
overall
a
damn
fine
kriek
serve
it
very
lightly
chilled
to
get
the
best
and
the
difference
that
the
shaerbeekse
cherries
will
be
very
apparent
then
this
is
well
worthy
of
a
purchase
but
at
1718
a
bottle
unfortunately
this
will
never
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
in
fact
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
bottle
i
purchased
at
somerville
supersaver
in
nj
and
lugged
west
and
then
shared
with
bas
davo
and
erica
before
the
pizza
port
strong
ale
festival
will
probably
be
the
only
one
i
ever
buy
in
the
us
it
was
a
pleasure
to
revisit
this
marvelous
kriek
it
is
indeed
one
of
the
better
traditional
krieks
out
there
but
it
is
just
too
damn
expensive
to
drink
in
the
us
sadly
maybe
ill
snag
one
more
bottle
to
stash
away
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
one
will
age
nicely
holds
up
well
to
its
blended
brothers
takes
top
prize
in
the
drinkability
category
and
despite
its
medium
harshness
still
caters
mostly
to
friends
of
cantillon
a
brewing
achievement
and
worth
a
try

im
not
sure
i

could

the
red
is
so
brilliant
that
it
scores
a
5
anyway
aroma
is
complex
of
lambic
funk
spicier
than
most
with
cinnamon
cloves
the
cherries
are
very
nice
feeling
unriped
both
black
and
red
cherries
intense
and
bold
for
a
lambic
earthy
mold
palate
is
very
lactic
with
its
typical
yoghourt
sourness
balsamic
and
citric
moderately
salty
funky
brett
with
nutty
earthy
branches
and
leafy
undertones
it
didnt
strike
me
as
spectacular
from
the
first
sip
and
sniff
but
it
grew
on
me
and
i
realised
i
drank
my
glass
very
fast
i
like
its
grapey
vinous
character
and
as
weird
as
it
sounds
to
me
this
is
a
quaffable
offering
despite
its
a
real
crime
to
just
think
about
drinking
this
fast
this
is
a
very
complex
kriek
with
a
good
backing
medium
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
just
what
a
brewery
a
little
too
much
cough
medicine
flavor
for
me
opened
2
batch
2
bottles
together
really
jammy
however
the
aftertaste
was
slightly
reminiscent
of
bandaids
did
not
feel
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
overall
a
world
class
beer
from
one
of
the
best
sour
breweries
in
the
world
id
put
this
right
up
there
with
their
oude
gueuze
vintages
as
their
best
beer
never
had
framboos
and
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
in
a
long
time
loved
it
then
a
medium
funk
and
a
good
tart
quality
comes
up
oak
cleans
up
the
beer
a
touch
of
sesame
comes
up
not
the
most
exciting
drie
f
or
fruited
lambic
despite
the
hype
not
sure
if
we
got
an
infected
bottle
but
we
had
a
large
sour
tasting
last
night
and
this
was
by
far
the
worst
of
the
bunch
for
lack
of
a
better
description
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
band
aids
we
have
10
people
all
agree
on
the
assessment
and
we
ended
up
drain
pouring
the
remaining
fantastic
fruit
flavor
if
were
being
picky
its
a
little
on
the
tart
side
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
distracting
but
thats
being
really
picky
dirty
dirty
bandaids
definitely
dont
care
to
ever
revisit
this
beer
looks
great
smells
and
tastes
like
a
mix
of
raspberries
and
band
aids
2013
vintage
expected
much
better
curious
that
people
freak
out
for
this
and
happily
drop
50
bucks
a
bottle
for
it
its
good
but
its
also
weird
and
has
some
unpleasant
features
i
thought
although
it
definitely
improves
a
lot
as
it
opens
up
and
warms
up
over
time
the
color
is
murky
pink
muted
and
old
looking
still
with
a
nice
bit
of
off
white
head
on
top
and
plenty
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
nose
is
amazing
a
nice
mix
of
wood
and
the
two
fruits
with
a
slight
edge
going
to
the
cherry
in
my
opinion
nice
funk
levels
lots
of
lacto
dry
enticing
unique
the
flavor
starts
off
fine
like
any
other
fruited
lambic
really
but
it
goes
weird
about
halfway
through
at
first
i
start
tasting
iodine
and
bandaids
but
it
does
beyond
that
to
a
novocaine
almost
hospital
medicinal
plasticy
thing
that
lasts
forever
on
the
palate
not
sure
if
this
is
denaturing
fruit
or
weird
bottle
conditioning
yeasty
notes
or
what
but
its
intense
and
its
sharp
and
its
not
very
appealing
this
drops
out
a
bit
after
it
warms
up
and
breathes
and
i
also
am
getting
used
to
it
as
i
drink
this
beer
but
it
never
really
goes
away
and
i
think
its
a
distraction
from
the
intended
flavors
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
aside
from
the
numbing
aspect
is
nice
with
a
dry
feel
and
big
boy
carbonation
the
fruit
and
funk
are
great
and
acidity
is
only
mid
range
for
the
style
i
like
it
more
and
more
as
i
drink
it
but
to
call
this
one
of
the
best
lambics
going
is
a
huge
stretch
for
me
i
appreciate
it
but
dont
love
it
at
all
verdict
a
delightful
lambic
with
an
excellent
representation
of
both
cherries
and
raspberries
despite
being
only
5
the
sour
cherry
really
shines
through
and
balances
well
with
the
raspberries
and
the
touch
of
citrus
zest
really
and
mild
funk
emphasizes
how
delicate
of
a
beer
this
is
brief
notes
from
a
bottle
tasting
dense
fruit
raspberry
forward
jammy
syrupy
and
slightly
medicinal
some
bandaid
phenols
the
funk
is
there
in
full
force
but
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
fruit
i
think
it
might
benefit
from
some
age
overall
a
very
nice
lambic
but
not
a
favorite
exquisite
body
flavor
and
carbonation
it
was
in
my
top
3
at
a
recent
bottle
share
in
my
top
3
and
i
hate
everything
o
not
sure
if
this
bottle
was
off
but
the
numbing
taste
and
sensation
was
really
offputting
i
will
have
to
rereview
this
one
the
next
time
i
have
it
o
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
3f
its
sourness
is
matched
perfectly
by
its
sweet
finish
definitely
worth
the
hype
ironically
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
rodenbach
charactre
rouge
very
fruit
prominent
with
the
amazing
funk
that
drie
fonteinen
has
amazing
beer
pours
a
light
red
color
with
a
pink
head
and
good
clarity
the
aroma
has
faint
dark
cherries
tart
wild
yeasts
and
plenty
of
horse
blanket
stank
the
taste
is
very
tart
and
fruity
nicely
layered
and
sufficiently
dry
oak
tannins
round
out
great
notes
of
cherry
and
berry
long
standing
sour
notes
light
bodied
crisp
and
satisfying
this
is
world
class
lambic
seldom
seen
in
my
area
this
is
definitely
a
top
notch
beer
the
balance
of
the
fruit
and
sour
flavors
is
very
impressive
but
other
than
that
not
too
much
beyond
what
youd
expect
i
just
dont
get
it
cherries
and
raspberries
dont
complement
each
other
overall
nose
and
taste
is
medicinal
to
me
overall
a
great
lambic
apart
from
the
slight
medicinal
notes
in
the
fruit
although
this
comes
out
more
in
the
aroma
than
the
taste
the
feel
is
sprite
light
bubbly
and
carbonated
but
not
too
sharp
i
am
a
fan
of
lambics
but
nothing
about
this
beer
worked
for
me
well
this
was
awfully
disappointing
i
assume
this
was
a
bad
bottle
they
had
4
of
them
there
but
i
only
got
a
pour
from
one
no
way
this
is
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
again
if
i
can
ever
find
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
purple
like
the
color
of
cherries
an
inch
of
pink
infused
cream
colored
head
that
holds
pretty
well
head
remains
at
the
surface
and
a
thick
collar
fair
legs
and
poor
lacing
aroma
is
a
ton
of
cherry
and
an
odd
funk
smells
almost
like
cherry
cough
medicine
taste
is
lightly
tart
rich
raspberry
more
than
cherry
flavor
and
an
oakiness
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
with
a
fruitlike
stickiness
to
the
mouthfeel
great
beer
but
the
slight
cough
syruplike
quality
is
off
putting
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
ive
noticed
that
people
have
noticed
the
bandaide
presence
in
both
the
07
and
13
i
believe
it
might
just
be
a
matter
of
bottle
variation
with
some
of
them
having
it
and
some
of
them
not
i
based
my
scores
off
the
07
we
opened
which
was
far
superior
to
the
13
we
had
honestly
this
bottle
was
something
of
a
disappointment
ive
heard
many
people
say
this
is
as
good
or
better
than
framboos
which
ive
not
had
the
opportunity
to
try
but
i
have
to
think
that
either
thats
not
true
or
framboos
is
significantly
overrated
at
any
rate
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
after
this
particular
beer
again
o
what
a
fantastic
beer
perfect
to
split
with
the
wife
went
down
much
to
quickly
and
easily
would
love
if
this
was
an
annual
release
biggest
detracter
is
the
price
point
if
u
can
bite
that
bullet
your
in
for
a
real
treat
tons
of
funk
and
tons
of
fruit
sourness
builds
with
each
sip
and
reaches
a
nice
drie
level
with
that
authentic
lambic
presence
overall
really
good
quality
freshsour
fruit
and
funk
flavors
very
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
quite
possibly
the
second
best
fruit
lambic
ive
ever
enjoyed
behind
only
cantillons
fou
foune
they
are
hard
to
compare
to
one
another
due
to
the
different
fruits
utilized
but
this
one
is
outstanding
with
aggressive
notes
of
oak
and
funk
alongside
a
fantastically
ripe
raspberry
element
its
too
bad
this
bottle
costs
so
much
and
is
only
produced
ever
several
years
because
it
is
truly
amazing
drink
its
very
good
i
like
it
ill
just
call
it
wælsbro
and
say
i
spent
too
much
for
this
but
tickers
gonna
tick
cheers
well
i
may
have
overpaid
but
novare
res
had
it
and
i
didnt
so
i
pulled
the
trigger
no
regrets
either
phenomenal
from
top
to
bottom
just
layers
and
layers
of
sensory
satisfaction
the
raspberry
is
dominant
over
the
cherry
but
allows
a
yet
another
layer
of
flavorthat
doedoesnt
come
from
either
fruit
alone
super
funky
with
big
raspberry
tartness
as
it
warms
the
tart
mellows
and
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
gets
better
and
better
just
heaven
o
i
had
extraordinarily
high
expectations
considering
the
40
price
tag
i
payed
for
this
but
i
was
very
impressed
worth
every
penny
o
very
fruitforward
right
now
young
id
have
to
imagine
this
will
be
even
better
in
a
few
years
id
lay
down
any
other
bottles
you
have
right
now
for
a
while
this
is
a
lot
like
how
vsb
drank
out
of
the
gates
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
transforms
into
a
worldbeater
a
year
later
yet
this
is
phenomenal
even
fresh
overall
the
fruit
is
really
intense
in
the
nose
but
the
lambic
shines
in
the
taste
pours
a
murky
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of

the
remaining

on
the
drink
down
smell

sour
with
malt
grain
funk
cherry
and
raspberry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
super
sour
cherry
raspberry
and
funk
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
really
nice
sour
fruit
and
funk
qualities
all
around
o
this
is
definitely
good
stuff
but
i
cant
see
myself
trading
my
cellar
to
get
more
of
it
fruitier
and
less
aggressively
blue
cheese
than
the
foufoune
mamouche
and
golden
doesjel
which
i
drank
in
the

session
pours

very
enjoyable
armand
has
once

knocked
it
out
of

the

the

a

of
a
heafty

pour
a

definitly
funky
decent

menthol

reminds
me
of
old
3f

taste
is
rich
raspberries

intense
sourness
mostly
citric
is
balanced
by
fruity
sweetness
full
bodied
and
rather
low
carbonation
which
accentuates
the
richness
of
this
fruit
lambic
this
is
not
your
everyday
fruit
lambic
it
is
however
wonderfully
complex
for
a
lambic
this
age
4
3
batch
2
in
its
current
state
is
very
good
but
has
a
bit
of
nail
polishy
scent
to
it
i
think
it
will
develop
nicely
over
time
but
right
now
its
more
of
a
4
on
the
arbitrary
rating
system
o
what
a
real
treat
why
cant
every
day
be
like
this
day
it
is
amazing
how
the
fruit
flavors
have
lasted
so
long
on
this
one
so
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
have
this
edit
the
last
glass
of
hommage
was
the
best
anything
i
have
ever
had
the
dreg
hits
once
again
o
this
wasnt
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
the
fruit
barrel
and
funk
are
all
really
interesting
and
different
the
aroma
alone
is
pretty
incredible
a
really
wonderful
beer
taste
fruity
start
raspberries
very
sour
quite
cheesy
as
well
aftertaste
is
burning
sourness
bit
cheesy
little
dirty
raspberry
jam
bit
metallic
o
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
was
hard
not
to
drink
it
down
too
quickly
didnt
expect
the
fruit
to
taste
as
fresh
considering
it
is
six
years
old
was
very
fortunate
to
procure
this
bottle
and
slay
my
1
personal
white
whale
bottle
poured
a
deep
cherry
red
nose
was
straight
up
raspberry
jam
a
delicate
balance
between
cheese
funk
sweetness
from
the
raspberry
and
tartness
by
far
the
most
complex
out
of
the
three
bottles
we
had
although
well
balanced
flavors
all
of
the
flavors
were
explosive
overall
a
fantastic
lambic
that
has
probably
lost
a
lot
of
its
fruit
flavour
going
by
the
ingredients
worth
the
70
no
but
what
beer
is
a
fun
experience
for
sure
this
is
clearly
a
wellcrafted
lambic
i
thought
that
raspberries
would
be
the
dominant
fruit
but
i
was
not
disappointed
that
the
cherries
came
through
so
strongly
the
plastic
flavor
in
the
flavor
was
enough
for
me
to
knock
down
the
flavor
and
overall
score
but
everything
else
was
solid

pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
lots
of
cherry
some
raspberry
a
light
medicinal
note
and
funky
oak
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
some
cherry
and
raspberry
there
is
also
lots
of
funky
oak
and
a
light
medicinal
note
the
finish
is
tart
and
funky
medium
body
medium
carbonation
quite
tasty
o
overall
unreal
beer
just
phenomenal
one
of
the
highlights
of
an
insane
day
the
beer
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
no
head
the
nose
is
a
ripe
almost
rotten
tomato
thats
very
potent
and
possesses
almost
no
sour
no
additional
fruit
comes
through
the
taste
changes
to
a
beefy
sour
but
seems
more
like
drinking
a
v8
with
some
gueuze
mixed
in
it
almost
tastes
like
rasberry
but
not
quite
the
aftertaste
is
a
slightly
vegetalfruity
with
an
interesting
bitterness
that
lingers
its
very
drinkable
regardless
and
presents
an
unlikely
mix
of
both
vegetable
and
fruit
worth
trying
again
but
i
wouldnt
hold
onto
this
beer
any
longer
oi
think
a
lot
of
the
slack
this
beer
gets
is
unwarranted
it
holds
up
very
well
to
framboos
and
despite
having
some
plastic
character
to
it
it
doesnt
detract
much
from
the
beer
its
an
incredibly
good
lambic
and
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
o
a
delicious
beer
for
sure
not
quite
as
good
as
framboos
but
this
is
very
nice
smooth
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
good
fruit
lambic
it
might
have
been
a
bit
better
a
year
or
two
ago
but
still
very
nice
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
but
not
because
i
wouldnt
be
willing
o
sick
ass
beer
was
fun
to
savor
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
night
was
to
have
this
o
definitely
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
nice
acidity
and
fruit
presence
though
the
slight
plastic
presence
is
distracting
still
very
enjoyable
in
small
quantities
overall
completely
not
wasted
on
me
this
was
the
only
sour
i
gladly
went
back
for
a
second
pour
on
i
will
admit
that
i
didnt
expect
this
to
be
that
good
however
the
fruit
flavors
were
delicious
and
decadent
and
the
sourness
played
unbelievably
well
with
the
fruit
component
perhaps
a
little
one
dimensional
if
im
honest
with
myself
but
that
one
dimension
is
definitely
otherworldly
look
forward
to
the
day
i
get
to
drink
this
one
again
thanks
again
for
sharing
ron
and
jeroen
this
was
a
game
changer
cheers
thanks
to
jh1982
for
bringing
this
whale
to
the
party
o
very
good
o
this
beer
really
did
live
up
to
its
reputation
changing
nearly
every
time
i
took
a
sip
the
pucker
is
strong
but
it
is
still
manageable
i
hope
they
do
make
this
again
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
all
is
forgiven
upon
the
first
sip
this
lambic
is
heavenly
in
flavor
with
a
super
tart
lactic
punch
to
the
sides
of
the
tongue
offset
by
a
decadent
funky
raspberry
jam
note
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
dry
tart
and
refreshing
with
a
perfect
carbonation
level
overall
an
amazing
beer
i
am
grateful
that
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
hommage
its
a
shame
the
nose
hadnt
held
up
but
the
deliciousness
more
than
makes
up
for
that
fact
thanks
again
michael
o
my
favorite
3f
fruit
lambic
to
date
the
nose
was
not
as
good
as
it
could
have
been
but
age
might
have
something
to
do
with
that
saying
that
the
2007
vintage
we
opened
was
not
nearly
as
funky
in
the
nose
as
the
hommage
i
wish
i
was
sitting
on
3
like
some
people
but
a
alas
this
was
my
only
bottle
this
is
a
tart
brew
that
is
very
funky
it
is
medium
bodied
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
a
very
solid
salivation
factor
follows
each
sip
of
this
brew
and
there
is
seemingly
no
alcohol
inclusion
it
was
nice
to
finally
get
a
chance
to
try
this
brew
and
for
that
i
say
thank
you
nate
with
talks
of
this
being
released
again
i
look
forward
to
seeing
the
difference
with
a
more
fresh
bottle
regardless
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
an
incredible
sour
beer
plenty
of
fruit
with
the
sour
flavor
pushing
the
envelope
yet
still
so
drinkable
you
want
to
go
back
again
and
again
the
fruit
flavors
are
great
with
subtle
oakiness
a
really
top
notch
example
i
enjoyed
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
night
very
interesting
flavors
and
not
overly
raspberry
forward
i
hate
to
compare
to
the
coolship
red
we
had
earlier
but
its
inevitable
that
brew
was
on
a
higher
level
this
one
is
good
but
doesnt
quite
get
to
that
top
tier
really
glad
to
try
it
o
solid
i
like
this
more
than
other
framboises
or
krieks
ive
had
good
acidity
fruit
and
wood
balance
is
nice
excellent
depth
good
dirtiness
complex
and
long
finish
overall
a
majestic
beer
that
i
am
delighted
to
try
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
would
expect
no
less
5
pours
a
pinkishred
color
similar
to
a
rose
with
a
thin
cap
of
head
carbonation
bubbles
stream
up
the
side
the
smell
is
incredible
on
this
pungent
raspberry
jam
is
dominant
with
a
faint
barrel
funk
the
taste
is
more
sour
and
lactic
with
the
fruit
falling
towards
the
end
but
still
quite
prevalent
after
4
years
of
sitting
in
the
bottle
tart
lemons
balsamic
vinegar
and
fairly
acidic
but
not
overwhelming
and
quite
balanced
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
keeps
things
lively
on
the
acidic
and
keeps
things
refreshing
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
that
ive
had
an
almost
perfect
balance
of
fruit
and
sour
and
very
glad
that
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
and
given
the
scarcity
will
likely
be
the
last
one
ill
come
across
had
this
many
times
since
its
release
back
in
the
summer
of
2007
the
appearance
was
very
nice
but
short
lived
with
the
hazy
reddishorange
thin
pink
head
aroma
is
raspberries
sourness
and
slight
mild
acidic
nose
but
as
i
drank
more
bottles
over
time
it
they
became
more
and
more
medicinal
phenolics
and
a
touch
of
plastic
notes
bandaids
a
little
dry
with
a
solid
lactic
tartness
woody
raspberry
pit
note
and
a
medicinal
phenolic
finish
that
doesnt
come
on
quite
as
strong
as
it
did
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
gets
used
to
the
acidity
and
funk
as
the
raspberry
notes
pick
up
in
intensity
a
bit
still
a
kind
of
dry
with
a
raspberry
pulp
flavor
with
touches
of
cherry
skins
to
it
carbonation
is
definitely
on
the
light
side
hopefully
the
next
batch
will
produce
a
much
more
fruity
smell
and
taste
and
not
the
phenolicbandaid
aromas
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
after
all
the
other
great
beers
this
one
really
stood
out
holding
up
quite
well
phenolics
could
make
this
bad
but
they
are
in
check
enough
to
let
the
rest
of
the
beer
speak
for
itself
extremely
tasty
very
tart
on
the
first
taste
but
maybe
a
little
sweeter
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
think
it
actually
tasted
better
once
the
darker
sediment
was
in
the
glass
deep
fruity
sweetness
balanced
very
well
by
the
acetic
bite
i
could
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
so
good
notes

thanks
to
beddachedda
or
westcoastbeerlvr
not
quite
sure
second
time
that
ive
tried
it
and
this
glass
seemed
better
somehow
pours
a
cloudy
golden
pink
aroma
is
a
big
and
wonderful
sour
raspberry
flavor
the
sour
cherries
just
seem
to
punch
up
the
berry
flavor
with
some
nice
funk
mildly
cheesy
taste
has
a
lot
of
sourness
and
is
quite
dry
at
this
point
tons
of
berries
and
funk
on
the
palate
everything
comes
together
well
pretty
good
pucker
710
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
to
the
style
not
too
effervescent
but
fairly
light
tried
at
the
same
time
as
malvasia
and
preferred
that
one
but
only
by
a
small
margin
another
excellent
lambic
from
3f
o
amazing
complex
raspberry
flavor
that
is
just
awesome
very
well
put
together
definitely
one
of
the
greats
o
not
always
a
big
framboise
fan
but
this
was
pretty
damn
good
overall
one
of
the
best
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
has
change
in
some
interesting
ways
according
to
some
the
fruits
still
give
it
to
ya
and
the
sour
funky
goodness
is
kickass
o
overall
this
was
a
treat
but
i
would
doubt
i
could
get
through
a
whole
bottle
at
this
time
this
is
a
different
machine
than
the
scharbeekese
which
im
not
entirely
sure
is
a
fair
comparison
o
amazing
sour
really
delicious
and
drinkable
great
fruit
presence
is
balanced
really
well
by
all
the
funk
and
tartness
absolutely
delicious

bottling
hommage
pours
medium
amber
red
and
not
too
dark
to
see
through
the
smell
is
crazy
i
get
very
rotten
sweet
fruitespecially
raspberryalong
with
funky
puke
poop
rhubarb
cheese
the
taste
definitely
connects
to
the
smell
but
is
much
less
offensive
to
me
with
tons
of
funky
raspberry
hearty
fruit
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
not
very
dry
but
a
bit
sweet
not
very
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
and
in
a
negative
way
because
it
was
hard
to
get
passed
the
smell
i
think
this
may
have
been
an
off
bottle
or
improperly
stored
will
rereview
if
i
get
to
try
it
again
poured
into
my
russian
river
tion
glass
and
this
beer
appears
quite
oily
with
a
rather
vibrant
reddish
brown
appearance
capped
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
offwhite
head
leaves
some
lace
and
looks
very
oily
in
the
glass
i
heard
and
read
the
descriptor
bandaid
used
to
when
characterizing
various
funky
beers
but
up
until
this
one
i
had
never
actually
experienced
in
first
hand
smells
exactly
like
a
bandaid
and
this
is
quite
musty
and
funky
on
the
nose
some
aspects
are
appealing
while
other
are
a
little
offputting
getting
some
fruit
in
the
form
of
raspberries
that
were
perhaps
sitting
in
someone
basement
wrapped
in
a
ace
bandage
for
a
decade
or
two
the
smell
is
unique
enough
and
enticing
enough
to
warrant
a
higher
score
than
i
might
usually
give
for
a
bouquet
as
foul
as
this
taste
is
certainly
an
improve
as
the
bandaid
has
taken
a
backseat
and
the
fruit
funk
tart
and
sour
qualities
make
a
push
to
the
forefront
earthy
raspberries
are
the
focus
and
dare
i
say
that
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
worlds
apart
with
the
taste
being
highly
superior
very
nice
mouthfeel
with
spoton
carbonation
a
nice
lambic
but
not
necessarily
earthshattering
in
anyway
pour
yields
a
bright
red
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
nearly
immediately
fades
to
a
thin
collar
around
the
edges
the
nose
brings
forward
some
slight
earth
along
with
quite
a
bit
of
musty
raspberry
in
the
background
theres
a
bit
of
light
oak
overall
the
nose
is
kind
of
like
a
damp
vineyard
theres
a
bit
of
bandaid
lingering
in
the
background
of
the
nose
though
this
disappears
in
the
flavor
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
raspberry
and
damp
earth
light
wood
and
a
moderate
amount
of
acidity
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
sour
dry
finish
not
too
much
funk
anywhere
more
toward
a
light
earthiness
overall
a
very
nice
beer
with
the
mouthfeel
as
the
highlight
appearance
an
amber
red
color
with
a
light
pink
head
which
turns
to
a
nice
lacing
smell
whooaahhh
this
must
be
the
best
smelling
lambic
i
ever
had
the
waitress
was
not
even
close
to
the
table
and
i
could
already
smell
it
raspberry
upfront
extremely
natural
smell
funk
is
there
nicely
blended
with
some
citrus
notes
taste
lives
up
to
the
smell
raspberries
but
hardly
any
fruitsugar
there
fine
notes
of
strawberry
brett
citrus
and
some
wooden
tones
mouthfeel
a
very
refreshing
medium
carbonated
medium
bodied
and
crisp
drink
drinkabillity
everything
about
this
beauty
is
just
awesome
extremely
well
balanced
another
absolute
masterpiece
of
armand
hats
off
the
beer
is
ruby
hued
with
an
oily
thin
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
musty
funky
and
fruity
dank
basement
comes
to
mind
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
with
plenty
of
raspberries
and
a
hint
of
cherries
also
a
bit
of
oddness
and
bandaids
though
these
characteristics
dont
completely
overrun
the
beer
the
finish
brings
a
puckering
sensation
in
the
cheeks
the
ones
on
your
face
a
quality
lambic
recommended
o
a
masterful
stroke
of
the
brewing
arts
one
of
the
best
fruit
lambics
ever
made
overall
this
beer
is
would
be
world
class
if
not
for
that
one
offflavor
cant
wait
to
give
it
another
shot
dthis
has
a
nice
little
balance
to
it
not
the
funk
i
would
have
expected
from
a
drie
fonteinen
beer
but
the
fruit
flavor
is
very
pronounced
actually
more
acidic
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
not
burning
the
body
is
so
juicy
and
creamy
on
the
palate
it
is
very
inviting
the
flavors
are
subtle
and
well
integrated
very
drinkable
tasty
and
smooth
with
a
nice
solid
bite
of
sour
tartness
not
exactly
everything
i
was
hoping
for
but
quite
good
nonetheless

track
this
beer

this
weekend
pours
a
cloudy

with
a
small
foamy
head
great
nose
of
tart
fruit
and
raspberry
nicely
carbed
a
little
wood
and
mineral
flavor
adds
to
the
sweetness
has
an
insane
amount
of
berries
floating
on
the
palate
mixing
with
the
funk
to
make
this
a
fantastic
fruit
lambic
for
me
yummy
stuff
d
ive
had
this
a
number
of
times
and
it
never
fails
to
disappoint
its
worth
every
penny
even
with
the
exorbitant
price
tag
extremely
wellbalanced
and
integrated
flavor
profile
with
loads
of
fresh
raspberry
whats
not
to
love
d
good
stuff
can
be
a
sipper
as
it
is
so
tartfunky
that
you
kind
of
have
to
drink
it
slowly
thanks
to
alex
for
sharing
this
on
brys
birthday
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
bells
tulip
a
reddish
mud
brown
water
poor
light
pink
head
good
retention
the
aroma
is
great
with
a
ton
going
on
funky
a
super
fresh
and
most
accurate
raspberry
taste
there
is
also
a
distinct
aroma
of
strawberries
the
funk
is
the
perfect
amount
taste
is
great
funky
the
exact
amount
of
puckering
tartness
to
make
you
happy
but
not
so
much
you
cant
drink
the
whole
bottle
yourself
light
sweetness
adds
to
a
great
drinkability
after
having
several
of
these
i
would
conclude
that
this
is
a
really
impressive
fruit
lambic
one
of
the
best
ive
had
however
the
acidity
had
increased
significantly
with
age
and
i
dont
see
it
improving
any
further
at
about
1
5
years
this
was
stunning
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
it
would
have
been
even
better
had
it
not
had
the
medicinal
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
this
one
is
very
drinkable
i
am
curious
to
know
what
the
next
batch
will
be
like
d
quite
a
treat
looking
forward
to
hommages
return
in
the
near
future
really
liked
this
one
i
must
track
down
some
bottles
for
the
cellar
trade
me
some
beer
is
thin
and
strongly
acetic
finishes
dry
ultimately
with
this
odd
bitterness
in
there
very
drinkable
although
i
imagine
the
high
sourness
would
eventually
get
to
me
mouthfeel
is
good
d
what
separates
belgian
lambics
from
their
american
counterparts
is
the
immense
amount
of
complexity
that
separates
itself
from
the
funk
wood
and
earth
that
are
present
as
a
result
of
the
bacteria
this
is
a
prime
example
an
amazing
beer
that
really
shows
off
european
fruit
lambic
handywork
outstanding
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
its
ever
available
d
very
nice
beer
super
easy
to
drink
tasted
from
bottle
at
lush
cbc
event
courtesy
of
dr
bill
pours
redorange
with
a
thin
pink
head
the
nose
is
of
kirsch
cherries
sour
apple
and
raspberry
and
vinegar
the
flavor
is
a
drying
sour
with
cherry
raspberry
and
bitter
blood
orange
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
sweet
grenadine
on
the
midpalate
the
carbonation
is
very
much
alive
with
a
medium
almost
tannic
body
the
finish
is
very
long
with
cherry
flavor
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
i
feel
lucky
to
have
tasted
thank
you
dr
bill
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
tasting
right
alongside
deviation
and
blauw
cant
wait
to
give
this
beer
another
try
d
weighing
in
at
6
or
so
this
is
a
sessionable
dream
im
glad
i
splurged
the
lambic
did
not
disappoint
d
nope
i
really
hope
this
one
is
infected
d
i
was
a
little
hesitant
to
spend
this
much
on
a
beer
but
it
is
worth
every
penny
extremely
smooth
sourness
with
a
boatload
of
raspberry
goodness
ohhhh
myyy
goddd
this
is
unbelievably
good
pours
a
delicious
looking
cloudy
red
with
big
head
that
instantly
recedes
to
form
a
ring
at
the
top
no
lace
as
to
be
expected
smells
like
the
clone
of
dr
funkenstein
musty
wood
sweet
raspberry
wet
earth
and
a
touch
of
broccoli
tastes
of
raspberry
and
wood
with
slight
chocolate
notes
its
sour
sweet
and
tart
all
at
the
same
time
theres
little
to
no
astringency
but
a
zing
that
you
could
associate
with
raspberry
soda
very
balanced
the
taste
of
the
raspberry
isnt
masked
by
the
sourness
at
all
whats
wonderful
about
this
is
the
fact
that
the
fruit
really
shines
here
and
the
sour
is
almost
secondary
this
is
the
best
lambic
i
think
ive
ever
had
pretty
much
the
main
beer
i
went
to
novare
to
try
and
it
didnt
disappoint
at
all
palate
awesomely
dry
and
sharp
really
stays
with
you
an
awesome
fruit
lambic
overall
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
yet
drinkability
is
top
of
the
line
not
just
for
lambics
but
for
all
beer
nothing
short
of
miraculous
dwithout
question
one
of
the
most
odd
interesting
sour
dry
astringent
and
complex
brews
i
have
ever
had
it
is
such
an
amazing
train
wreck
of
flavours
you
are
urged
to
come
back
time
after
time
for
another
sip
i
doubt
i
could
ever
drink
this
with
regularityi
value
my
taste
budsbut
to
sit
and
enjoy
a
bottle
with
friends
absolutely
i
cant
believe
how
sour
this
beer
has
become
with
the
aging
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
this
fresh
to
see
how
prominent
the
berries
were
either
way
this
beer
is
very
complex
with
lots
of
delicious
flavors
bouncing
off
of
one
another
i
picked
something
else
up
with
each
sip
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
raspberry
beers
or
raspberries
for
that
matter
but
this
beer
was
very
impressive
all
sour
heads
should
seek
this
one
out
dill
pickle
sorry
a
bucket
of
pickles
i
drank
the
entire
750ml
ok
but
unlike
the
blabaer
there
were
no
tears
when
the
bottle
was
empty
and
i
quickly
moved
on
im
wondering
whether
a
different
bottle
of
hommage
may
have
given
a
different
story
as
somebody
else
said
pretty
good
but
something
missing
will
have
to
try
another
one
o

drinkability
i
would
score
it
higher
but
the
amount
of
tartness
dryness
and
acidity
holds
it
back
this
was
a
really
nice
bright
pink
color
with
a
tenacious
head
that
was
only
slightly
less
colorful
the
smell
was
delicious
raspberries
with
a
hint
of
lambic
the
flavor
was
really
outstanding
like
eating
raspberry
jam
with
huge
chunks
of
raspberries
the
fruit
component
was
fantastic
i
didnt
detect
much
funkiness
and
it
was
only
slightly
tart
but
overall
i
was
very
impressed
this
is
probably
the
best
fruit
lambic
i
have
had
if
not
a
close
second
to
cantillon
fou
foune
amazing
beer
good
stuff
probably
the
most
sour
of
the
3f
beers
i
have
had
difficult
to
come
by
and
personally
i
would
buy
a
couple
bottles
of
the
oude
kriek
to
drink
instead
of
going
out
of
my
way
to
find
another
bottle
of
this
delicious
though
cheers
overall
blown
away
here
i
have
alot
of
sours
to
go
through
in
the
coming
week
and
this
was
the
start
of
it
i
have
to
say
i
am
simply
thrilled
the
price
of
this
one
makes
it
a
bit
difficult
to
follow
through
on
but
i
have
to
say
it
will
be
oh
soo
worth
it
in
the
end
beautiful
clear
ruby
red
color
with
a
white
head
that
sits
atop
it
head
falls
gracefully
until
it
just
sticks
around
the
glass
aroma
is
largely
of
raspberries
but
almost
like
a
very
light
raspberry
i
mean
that
in
the
sense
that
it
isnt
the
over
the
top
flavor
and
slight
astringency
one
would
get
from
actually
eating
a
raspberry
its
more
like
a
raspberry
juice
was
used
theres
also
some
definite
cheesy
notes
in
this
that
i
find
a
bit
distracting
various
barnyard
funk
notes
are
also
perceptible
but
hidden
beneath
to
me
which
is
unfortunate
taste
is
another
story
i
actually
enjoy
it
qutie
a
bit
same
thing
again
with
the
raspberry
taste
theres
no
slightly
astringent
kickyouintheface
raspberry
flavor
that
i
love
but
it
is
enjoyable
lactic
tartness
is
one
of
the
other
things
that
comes
right
to
the
forefront
followed
by
some
very
pleasing
funkiness
if
this
funkiness
andor
the
raspberries
were
a
touch
stronger
this
beer
would
be
much
better
especially
if
some
of
the
cheesy
notes
were
no
longer
coming
through
in
the
nose
about
medium
carbonation
with
a
decent
body
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
nice
dry
finish
a
good
beer
that
id
surely
have
another
of
however
price
and
availability
do
limit
that
nb
the
raspberries
are
much
more
subdued
in
this
one
than
i
expected
would
not
age
it
further
d
i
dont
remember
what
this
cost
so
im
able
to
judge
this
purely
on
the
would
i
have
this
again
criterion
yes
i
would
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
thought
it
was
a
phenomenal
beer
even
while
triplefisting
it
next
to
toronado
20th
and
cable
car
please
dont
tell
me
how
expensive
this
was
taste
is
more
sour
fruit
and
a
lot
less
funky
a
decent
amount
of
sourtartness
comes
through
in
the
flavor
personally
i
would
like
more
funk
and
less
fruit
i
guess
aging
my
bottle
should
accomplish
this
decent
beer
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
brews
that
ive
tried
todate
and
certainly
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
d
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
great
razor
sharp
fruit
profile
and
clean
flavors
good
balance
between
the
fruits
and
the
rustic
lambic
flavors
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
for
this
beer
and
is
very
well
done
as
for
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
anytime
anywhere
unfortunately
the
hefty
price
tag
prevents

i

it

we
all

it

i

a

damn
fine

that
i

i
had
more

it
is
to
be
savored
i
really
loved
the
funky

blew

pretty
good

the

really
came

thanks

is
spot
on
overall
this
is
precisely
what
i
would
expect
it
to
be
amazing

and
masterfully

im
not
really
sure
where
there
could

a

i
havent
felt
like
ive
had
a
good
raspberry
lambic
in
awhile
even
with
rose
and
oud
beersel
framboise
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
its
a
nice
lambic
style
drinkability
fairly
mellow
and
easygoing
for
a
lambic
very
nice
not
as
intensely
fruity
as
i
was
perhaps
expecting
and
it
is
on
the
soft
side
for
a
traditional
lambic
even
for
a
3
fonteinen
one
a
bit
harder
with
a
more
pronounced
fruit
character
would
make
this
just
about
perfect
it
seems
to
be
missing
that
jamlike
sans
sweetness
of
course
fruit
intensity
that
i
was
expecting
though
i
like
that
this
is
quite
dry
and
quaffable
still
this
is
a
very
good
beer
though
i
have
a
feeling
this
wont
age
nearly
as
well
as
the
framboos
has
did
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sour
with
phenols
of
funky
plastic
and
exotic
plants
drinkability
the
sourness
is
pretty
intense
but
i
could
get
through
a
bottle
by
myself
to
savor
the
beer
worth
seeking
out
but
it
isnt
available
in
the
states
yet
cheers
the
color
is
like
a
pastel
tint

red

is

the
head
diasappears
quickly
with
a
lot
of
fizzing
the
aroma
is
sour
but
is
somewhat
softened
by
the
cherries
the
taste
is
also
sour
the
cherries
give
it
a
nice
taste
whitout
making
it
a

carbonation
is
relatively
high
nice
beer
beautiful
red
beer
with

the
scent
is
kind

the

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer

without

lpk
this
is
not
but
its
a

to

so
heres
to
trying
many
more
cheers
serving

bottle
generally
notes
are
cherry

with
a
decent

quality
the
beer
lacks

as
it
pours
almost
flat
a
classic
excellent
kriek
lots
of
complex
rich
cherry
flavor
with
a
solid
lambic
underneath
has
just
enough
of
everything
and
not
too
much
of
anything
and
thats
how
it
should
be
this
is
probably
the
best
kriek
that
ive
ever
had
so
good
great
to
try
and
a
wonderful
treat
to
tick
off
the
sweetness
from
the
fruit
tones
down
the
sourness
that
i
was
expecting
o
big
bracing
sourness
funky
acidity
the
cherries
are
just
there
to
accentuate
i
personally
prefer
a
bit
more
of
a
balance
of
fruitsourness
but
this
is
nice
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
good
choice
when
if
youre
looking
for
that
intense
sour
kick
sweet
cherries
has
the
characteristic
belgian
funk
though
not
as
pronounced
as
other
3f
beers
ive
had
a
pleasant
oaky

i
wonderful
standard
for
the

i
love
this
beer
i
am
glad
i
have
another

with

o
very

overall
this
is
a
new
style
for
me
and
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
i
can
definitely
see
myself
getting
into
these
a
very
woundup
brew
not
overly
flamboyant
or
selfsufficient
lots
of
action
in
this

kinda

its
still

lacking

i
want

overall
a

so
very
refreshing
overall
a
very
refreshing
pleasant

i
have
very
little
experience
with
traditional
krieks
so
my
opinion
on
this
one
is
probably
worth
very
little
right
now
but
of
all
the
ones
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
acquire
so
far
this
is
clearly
the
best
one
its
not
sweetened
and
its
not
unpleasantly
sour
i
do
wish
it
had
more
cherry
flavor
to
it
but
its
aged
so
i
cant
fault
it
for
that
its
pricey

certainly
recommended

edit
bumping
up
a
few
marks
here
may
have
had
this
a
bit
young
before
the
beer
has
changed
a
lot
more
funk
more
genuine
fruit
and
less
of
the
residual
weirdness
a
true
champion
among
krieks
and
upon
reading
my
review
from
just
a
few
short
months
ago
i
am
disappointed
i
rated
it
as
poorly
as
i
did
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
very
best
examples
of
the
style
going
period
othis
is
a
delicious
and
truetostyle
belgian
beer
it
is
not
as
complex
or
wild
or
manufactured
tasting
as
some
but
the
relatively
subtle
flavors
work
well
and
do
not
overwhelm
my
palate
i
could
have
gone
for
a
little
less
carbonation
and
a
little
more
cherryfruit
to
make
this
beer
worldclass
but
i
would
happily
drink
more
of
this
if
i
could
find
it
o
a
phenomenal
beer
with
great
flavors
very
well
crafted
and
a
joy
to
drink
a
bit
pricey
for
a
bottle
though
an
interesting
beer
i
guess
and
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
but
this
is
another
one
of
those
intensely
sour
lambics
gueuze
and
wild
ales
that
i
just
cant
appreciate
or
understand
how
anyone
else
could
appreciate

i
was
hoping
for
something
a

more
effervescent
but
perhaps
it
sat
on
this
one
a
little
too
long
a
very
good
kriek
but
im
sorry
i
didnt
drink
this
one
fresher
ill
definitely
need
to
track
down
a
fresher

in

o
a

one
is
enough
for

a
murky

capped
by
a
light
pinkish
sea

dissipates
almost

the

brings
whiffs

overall
an
truly
exceptional

this
has
aged
absolutely
fantastic
not

better
the

is
so
rich

decadently

this

style
but
i
do
wish
there
were
higher
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
id
never
turn
down
i
bet
you
could
slip
this
to
countless
wine
snobs
and
get
them
to
believe
this
was
a
nice
sonoma
red
good
beer
some
active
carbonation
may
really
have
done
it
a
favor
o
this
was
a
great
kriek
that
stands
up
with
some
of
the
best
belgian
fruited
beers
the
smell
seemed
just
a
tiny
bit
off
with
a
very
subtle
plastic
presence
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
fantastic
id
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
and
try
aging
it
a
bit
as
i
think
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
could
be
a
little

more
subtle
with
letting
a
tiny

more

come

am
once
again
impressed
by
3
fonts
brewing
it
has
a
really
great
sour
flavor
while
maintaining
balance
it
isnt
the
greatest
beer
ever
but
i
really
like
it
and
as
far
as
kriek
goes
it
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
nice
beer
would
age
and
drink
again
overall
a
pretty
good
kriek
lambic
but
could
done
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
there
are
lots
of
better
easier
to
find
options
out
there
far
more
subtle
than
other
lambics
ive
had
in
this
style
but
nevertheless
retains
complexity
and
solid
flavor
throughout
i
do
think
that
in
the
future
i
will
try
to
hunt
down
a
750ml
bottle
and
cellar
it
for
a
few
years
so
that
the
funk
starts
to
shine
through
over
time
this
beer
is
definitely
a
good
way
to
introduce
people
to
traditional
belgian
sours
and
not
make
them
run
away
screaming
quite
a
masterfully
crafted
kriek
overall
very
tart
feel
it
in
the
jaw
no
head
but
it
does
have
carbonation
medium
bodied
bone
dry
o
overall
was
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
and
will
be
seeking
out
some
more
of
this
o
tart
a
light
crisp
fruit
with
a
sour
finish
tasted
along
with

cantillon
kriek
07
boon
kriek
mariage
parfait
and
10
drie
fonteinen
schaarbeekse
kriek
ranked
2nd
to
cantillon
overall
really
nice
kriek
not
my
favorite
but
its
very
enjoyable
i
normally
do
not
gravitate
towards
the
super
funky
sours
but
this
beer
had
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
without
crossing
the
line
by
being
an
overly
funky
beer
brouwerij
drie
fonteinen
makes
incredible
beer
while
oude
kriek
is
an
excellent
example
its
actually
not
one
of
their
best
that
in
and
of
itself
is
a
testament
to
their
skills
oude
kriek
is
damn
impressive
its
very
refined
complex
and
sophisticated
art
in
a
bottle
find
some
o
excellent
drinkability
i
would
like
to
taste
a
younger
one
this
is
a
6
years
old
bottle
to
compare
absolutely
great
beer
no
more
comments
the
appearance
is
a
light
red
color
with
a
short
foamy
white
head
its
nose
has
sour
cherries
dusty
cellar
and
hay
tipping
it
back
for
a
taste
and
i
get
some
funk
a
good
dose
of
cherries
and
a
nice
tart
quality
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
heavy
handed
sourness
where
the
finish
was
a
little
sharper
than
i
like
in
fruit
lambics
but
with
all
things
considered
this
is
nonetheless
a
fine
beer
certainly
one
that
is
great
to
open
with
friends
to
celebrate
and
perhaps
discuss
the
interesting
qualities
of
it
overall
a
very
nice
kriek
indeed
but
as
i
mentioned
not
quite
on
par
with
the
gueuze
i
had
earlier
in
the
week
meybe
im
just
spoiled
these
days
oude
kriek
is
an
adventure
through
and
through
and
its
one
i
recommend
having
375
ml
bottle
pours
a
clear
reddish
pink
with
a
small
pink
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
and
leaves
some
very
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
lots
of
tart
cherry
a
light
musty
funk
a
bit
of
lemon
raspberry
and
some
grape
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
initial
sweetness
with
tart
cherries
then
there
is
some
lemon
lactic
acit
raspberry
and
some
musty
funk
the
finish
has
a
lingering
cherry
flavor
and
a
bit
of
funk
with
some
astringency
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
like
medium
body
low
carbonation

vintage
european
release
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
deep
cherry
red
in
color
with
a
nice
slightly
pink
lacing
the
nose
is
smooth
and
tart
there
is
nice
acidity
and
plenty
of
sour
cherry
the
flavors
are
as
well
rounded
as
you
can
find
from
a
kriek
it
is
very
smooth
and
offers
a
nice
amount
of
both
sour
and
fresh
cherry
it
drinks
very
smoothly
and
the
yeast
isnt
overbearing
at
all
this
is
a
kriek
fans
kriek
i
wish
this
was
easy
to
find
in
750mls
i
like
it
a
lot
more
than
schaersbeeks
this
is
a
must
try
this
bottle
was
the
best
kriek
ive
had
yet
overall
a
really
fantastic
lambic
and
i
would
love
to
see
what
more
again
would
do
to
this
beers
flavor
profile
t
tons
of
sour
cherries
throughout
with
a
slight
lactic
tartness
a
touch
of
unripe
raspberry
with
a
rich
jammy
finish
a
touch
of
lemon
and
tannins
on
the
finish
overall
a
very
good
intro
to
authentic
belgian
sourslambics
interested
to
get
into
the
geuzes
excellent
lambic
and
brutally
sour
the
gritty
sensation
in
the
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
muted
aroma
other
than
the
horseblanket
are
my
only
real
knocks

very
sour

quite
balaced

bearing
in

this
is
a
real
sour
beer
style
of
course
aftertaste
is
long
dry
and
some
sweet
very
enjoyable
this
beer
makes
me
ache
for
the
few
weeks
it
was
available
on
the
shelves
of
the
chain
stores
in
reno
pricey
yes
but
a
worthwhile
treat
that
hopefully
fate
permitting
i
can
continue
to
keep
a
few
just
hanging
out
around

for
that

properly
aged

flute
glass

a
dark

virtually
no

a
few
lazy
bubbles
on
the
pour
then
flat

of
cherries
light
oak
and
a
hint
of
vinegar
sour
cherry
start
then
other
flavors
develop
including
a
surprising
pie
crust
flavor
that
ultimately
reveals
itself
to
be
related
to
the
oak
aging
complex
finishes
with
an
interesting
sweet
sour
cherry
and
fruit
flavor
a
hint
of
funk
an
very
nice
flavor
progression
im
not
a
sour
beer
fan
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
to
drink
im
really
glad
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
to
try
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
dont
know
whether
the
complete
flatness
of
this
kriek
was
due
to
age
or
not
still
enjoyable
overall
i
absolutely
loved
this
as
my
first
experience
with
a
fruit
lambic
i
cannot
wait
to
explore
this
style
further
o
the
age
helped
to
smooth
this
bottle
out
and
it
was
awesome
im
glad
that
i
have
another
bottle
o
not
very
complex
or
surprising
but
sharp
pleasant
and
well
blended
a
nice
kriekenlambic
o
this
is
a
great
tasting
cherry
lambic
especially
if
you
like
them
sour
and
not
so
sweet
mfd
smooth
velvety
feel
to
it
lighter
in
body
than
expected
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
wish
i
paired
this
with
something
very
nice
kreik
375
ml
bottle
split
with
my
doppelganger
this
weekend
bottled
december
2
2005
served
from
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
globe
poured
ruby
red
with
a
very
minimal
pinkish
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
funk
and
subtle
tart
cherry
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cherry
funk
and
sour
cherry
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
have
to
be
honest
that
this
one
has
become
very
still
with
the
age
on
it
however
the
cherry
flavors
are
still
lingering
around
which
is
always
nice
to
see
also
a
nice
musty
funk
has
come
into
play
as
well
keeping
the
beer
exciting
the
aroma
was
definitely
the
highlight
though
for
me
with
a
nice
sweet
cherry
note
definitely
worth
trying
this
vintage
if
you
get
the
chance
or
if
you
prefer
still
oude
krieks
poured
a
deep
violet
color
with
about
a
half
finger
of
white
head
as
soon
as
i
opened
this
my
father
sitting
across
the
room
said
i
can
smell
that
from
here
what
are
you
drinking
vinegar
the
smell
was
full
of
funk
sweet
cherries
oak
and
lactic
acid
big
tartness
and
sourness
up
front
and
the
cherries
reveal
themselves
towards
the
back
a
nice
balance
between
funk
fruit
and
sour
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
lambic
overall
great
authentic
funky
kriek
i
preferred
the
cantillon
and
hanssens
but
i
will
still
be
buying
this
one
again
in
the
future
body
is
fairly
light
to
mediumlight
with
aggressive
carbonation
producing
a
crisp
and
effervescent
mouthfeel
as
expected
for
the
style
finish
is
dry
o
as
always
drie
does
it
well
all
the
lambics
they
create
are
wonderful
and
this
one
is
no
exception
lots
of
fruit
forward
flavor
and
good
oak
character
the
only
reason
this
is
not
a
five
to
me
is
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
including
other
krieks
from
drie
other
lambic
krieks
that
i
would
consider
a
little
better
that
being
said
this
a
wonderful
beer
and
is
well
worth
the
fancy
import
price
tag
86100
o
this
is
an
ugly
beer
that
is
under
carbonated
however
the
sour
cherry
flavor
is
quite
nice
and
is
very
well
integrated
with
the
other
flavors
all
the
flavors
are
quite
balanced
and
support
each
other
very
well
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
towards
the
back
end
there
is
no
shortage
of
lambic
flavor
this
beer
pours
a
lovely
ruby
color
with
a
decent
light
light
pink
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
wonderful
earthy
barnyard
funk
with
a
nice
tart
cherry
hint
in
the
finish
of
the
nose
after
about
5
years
in
the
bottle
the
cherries
are
still
present
the
flavor
is
funky
a
nice
tartness
lemony
cherry
goodness
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
well
carbed
almost
puckerinbg
but
not
quite
overall
an
excellent
kriek
o
sour
ales
have
stolen
my
heart
and
i
appreciate
a
good
lambic
this
delivers
fairly
well
in
both
departments
but
is
slightly
too
thin
o
love
it
the
best
lambic
ive
had
so
far
one
i
could
see
drinking
all
the
time
o
very
good
stuff
expensive
so
probably
wont
splurge
again
on
this
but
worth
a
try
once
bottled
march
31
2009
this
beer
opens
with
a
big
pop
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
pinkish
red
color
with
an
off
white
just
pink
head
spots
of
lacing
a
nice
film
remains
on
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
big
cherry
pie
with
a
mild
funky
must
and
a
mild
vinegar
big
tart
note
flavor
is
largely
cherry
again
with
a
nice
balance
of
acetic
and
lactic
balance
very
tart
with
some
nice
funk
notes
good
light
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
less
carb
than
i
was
expecting
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
vinegar
than
i
expected
but
very
enjoyable
this
beer
is
a
very
pretty
dark
garnet
red
with
a
vividly
pink
tinted
head
the
foam
quickly
subsides
leaving
just
a
feather
of
bubbles
on
top
the
beer
smells
soooo
funky
and
acrid
the
beer
tastes
equally
funky
with
a
lot
of
lactic
acidity
upfront
that
fades
out
to
the
mineral
musty
swampy
almost
spoiled
flavors
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
salty
tart
cherry
tang
the
mf
is
very
effervescent
with
abundant
carbonation
that
just
sparkles
this
is
a
nice
kriek
lambic
but
the
overly
funky
imo
flavors
really
mutes
the
brightness
from
the
fruit
however
the
vibrant
acidity
is
nice
although
my
stomach
might
hate
me
in
the
morning
for
it
a
delicious
kriek
and
fairly
available
o
the
beer
is
quite
tart
and
even
thought
it
starts
off
very
acidic
it
kind
of
dies
down
a
bit
good
brew
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
initially
is
quite
fizzy
and
highly
carbonated
while
enjoying
this
brew
throughout
a
fairly
long
duration
i
was
able
to
swirl
some
of
the
carbonation
out
making
for
a
more
rich
tasting
cherry
and
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
the
smoothness
to
the
finish
is
quite
unique
and
really
melds
out
that
acidic
nature
of
the
brew
the
alcohol
while
listed
as
5
was
completely
hidden
throughout
this
experience
it
doesnt
matter
to
me
if
fruited
drie
fonteinen
offerings
are
7
months
old
or
7
years
old
i
cant
say
no
and
throughly
enjoy
each
experience

this
one
wasnt
a
brightly
colored
as
the
fresh
one
i
had
last
week
red
but
more
dull
nose
isnt
as
intense
more
cherry
than
the
2011
vintage
and
the
sour
notes
are
more
subdued
also
a
bit
of
funky
must
the
taste
is
barely
sour
at
all
compared
to
the
fresh
one
the
cherry
flavor
is
way
more
dominate
than
the
sour
flavors
almost
cherry
pieesque
for
big
sour
notes
and
less
cherry
get
the
2011
vintage
for
more
kriek
flavors
though
seek
out
the
2009
o
the
lack
of
head
and
almost
nonexistent
carbonation
seems
off
almost
flat
375ml

pours
a
beautiful
sparkling
red
color
with
a
large
light
pink
head
that
goes
down
slowly
scent
is
wow
extremely
funky
tons
of
barnyard
funk
horse
blanket
and
just
a
bit
of
gym
socks
a
bit
of
must
too
but
amongst
all
those
strange
aromas
there
lies
some
inviting
cherry
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
awesome
oh
so
sour
much
more
sour
than
i
was
expecting
mouth
puckering
funky
barnyard
and
sour
cherries
attack
the
taste
buds
instantly
this
is
very
acidic
musty
and
quite
oaky
with
some
more
cherry
and
sweet
fruit
finishes
nice
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
puckering
highly
carbonated
and
leaves
the
teeth
feeling
strange
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
lambic
that
i
wish
i
had
access
to
all
the
time
absolutely
delicious
nice
kriek
overall
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
i
love
lambics
with
a
lot
of
funk
to
them
and
this
one
delivers
as
all
the
drie
fonteinen
lambics
seem
to
do
the
acidity
is
still
strong
but
enjoyable
good
stuff
and
i
look
forward
to
comparing
it
to
the
schaerbeekse
i
have
stashed
away
o
very
nice
and
fresh
its
nice
to
have
a
fresh
kriek
even
though
it
is
still
6
months
into
the
bottle
but
its
also
nice
to
hoard
one
too
o
a
i
really
like
this
one
i
think
this
is
a
staple
for
the
sour
arena
even
though
i
am
a
rookie
with
them
at
this
point
o
as
far
as
the
style
it
is
one
of
the
best
that
is
relatively
easy
to
find
the
price
can
be
a
sting
and
the
sourness
is
definitely
above
average
o
very
good
kriek
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
will
definitely
get
again
oa
good
not
great
lambic
i
prefer
cantillon
and
hannsenss
krieks
overall
quite
possibly
the
worst
smelling
beer
ive
ever
smelt
yet
one
of
the
best
tasting
perfectly
sour
with
just
the
right
amount
of
cherry
flavor
coming
through
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
kriek
while
i
probably
prefer
cantillons
this
one
is
more
accessible
and
almost
just
as
good
very
well
done
this
was
a
scrutinous
review
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
gladly
have
it
again
i
will
try
aging
the
other
bottle
and
rereview
in
a
couple
a
delightful
beer
that
is
sure
to
get
even
better
as
time
and
my
cool
dark
cellar
work
magic
o
great
beer
a
classic
in
the
style
cant
go
wrong
with
this
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
soft
it
finises
kind
of
dry
overall
another
hit
from
drie
fonteinen
awesome
cherry
flavor
here
notes
a
five
yearold
lambic
that
has
aged
to
perfection
this
beer
is
a
work
of
art
it
is
everything
it
should
be
im
glad
i
didnt
let
it
go
much
longer
because
this
beer
is
what
i
believe
to
be
at
its
peak
outstanding
stuff
and
wish
i
had
more
do
pretty
dark
drinkable
its
sour
but
not
puckeringly
sour
a
good
beer
to
give
to
wine
drinkers
the
feel
on
the
palate
towards
the
end
really
reminds
me
of
wine
id
definitely
have
another
but
i
do
love
this
style
great
for
a
warm
summer
evening
overall
this
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
and
really
nicely
done
o
oude
kriek
is
simple
but
sophisticated
delicious
and
drinkable
wadsey
needs
more
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
splendid
beer
but
the
price
tag
does
not
really
match
the
quality
i
feel
that
i
have
had
many
better
kriek
beers
than
this
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
a
smallish
pink
head
that
leaves
a
pretty
pink
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
tons
of
sour
cherries
a
bit
of
dirty
laundry
some
earthy
tones
and
some
horseblanket
the
flavor
is
very
sour
with
a
clean
woodiness
and
loads
of
sour
cherry
flavor
the
beer
is
very
dry
and
very
tart
with
a
corklike
and
earthy
character
in
the
finish
overall
another
near
perfect
beer
from
armand
o
a
very
nice
kriek
the
smell
was
a
bit
off
putting
but
the
taste
was
pretty
pleasant
not
overtly
sour
but
it
is
a
very
funky
beer
the
brett
is
strong
with
this
one
i
found
an
early
2005
vintage
today
so
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
an
extra
2
5
years
does
for
it
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
found
this
one
surprisingly
drinkable
in
that
i
kept
taking
one
sip
after
another
while
trying
to
figure
out
what
i
was
tasting
if
i
had
another
bottle
it
would
go
in
the
fridge
right
now
in
hopes
that
i
could
have
a
second
one
this
evening
ill
be
putting
this
one
on
my
shopping
list
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
an
outstanding
beer
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
i
now
understand
the
reasons
why
the
brewerblender
is
so
highly
regarded
by
so
many
overall
a
tasty
remarkably
sour
lambic
small
cherry
presence
the
flavors
mesh
well
together
could
age
for
quite
some
time
o
quality
brew
easy
drinkability
low
carbonation
though
not
sure
if
thats
what
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
like
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
carbonated
overall
very
enjoyable
pours
a
deep
deep
ruby
with
a
massive
fluffy
pink
head
aroma
is
filled
with
tons
of
sour
cherries
barnyard
funk
and
vanilla
some
slight
vinegar
characters
in
the
nose
but
not
overwhelming
or
offputting
the
flavor
hits
you
with
a
huge
soursweet
cherry
oak
and
earthy
funk
very
sour
beer
but
not
overly
acidic
finishes
dry
and
musty
effervescent
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
absolutely
love
this
beer
every
vintage
i
have
tried
has
been
phenomenal
od
very
nice
little
kriek
tasty
and
complex
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
it
was
nice
to
try
good
but
not
remarkable
perhaps
aged
too
long
update
ba
chrispoint
was
kind
enough
to
share
a
bottle
of
the
07
vintage
of
this
beer
and
it
could
hardly
have
been
more
different
from
the
06
reviewed
above
from
notes
the
cork
comes
out
without
a
pop
and
the
beer
is
essentially
still
pouring
a
flat
hazy
maroon
body
understated
juicy
cherries
and
clean
sourness
on
the
nose
fairly
sweet
slightly
tannic
cherryladen
flavors
tasty
but
definitely
a
step
down
compared
to
the
brighter
06
a
bit
of
life
does
show
up
with
tongue
action
but
more
carbonation
would
have
really
helped
the
juicy
cherries
to
pop

overall
this
is
a
solid
kriek
from
one
of
the
best
lambic
breweries
in
the
world
a
great
beer
if
youve
got
a
sweet
tooth
and
love
cherry
quality
all
the
way
through
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
a
solid
kriek
that
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
like
but
it
is
not
too
sweet
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
by
this
again
due
to
the
price
tag
pours
a
semiopaque
crimson
red
with
a
small
light
red
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
all
lacing
drips
back
down
into
the
beer
on
the
drink
down
smells
fantastic
with
sour
cherries
red
wine
vinegar
and
funkmust
a
very
mouthwatering
sour
smell
taste
is
fantastic
with
the
sour
cherry
taste
up
front
and
a
vinegar
and
funky
must
flavor
taking
over
on
the
finish
there
is
an
acidic
twang
to
this
beer
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
there
is
a
medium
to
high
level
of
carbonation
that
is
very
bubbly
and
prickly
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
very
good
sour
cherry
lambic
that
is
still
super
tasty
more
than
2
years
after
the
bottling
date
o
absolutely
delicious
and
worth
the
buy
ive
had
few
krieks
better
than
this
one
o
not
bad
but
definitely
a
little
underwhelming
this
kriek
has
little
complexity
found
in
others
of
the
same
style
a
perfect
kriek
d
extremely
drinkable
i
wish
i
would
have
tried
this
one
sooner
but
at
11
bucks
for
a
375ml
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
often
o
yet
another
awesome
kriek
nowhere
near
as
sour
as
i
like
but
full
of
flavor
and
insanely
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
i
really
loved
this
beer
full
disclosure
though
i
absolutely
love
cherries
the
cherry
flavor
it
had
was
really
fantastic
in
my
opinion
it
showed
off
some
great
tart
and
sour
flavors
but
still
managed
to
have
some
fruity
cherry
sweetness
very
nice
beer
overall
o
its
alright
i
sort
of
like
sweeter
krieks
more
than
the
really
sour
ones
id
still
like
to
try
some
more
though
they
seem
to
be
gaining
on
me
drinkable
for
sure
not
going
to
kick
your
ass
even
my
wife
liked
it
perfect
for
the
occasion
youre
not
going
to
regret
buying
this
one
drinkability
the
first
few
sips
were
extremely
sour
but
i
adapted
to
it
quickly
this
one
definately
stuck
to
my
tongue
after
drinking
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
pretty
good
cherry
character
nice
depth
a
bit
sour
but
good
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
real
solid
kriek
hits
all
the
right
spots
thanks
russ
drinkability
i
like
it
but
its
too
oaky
not
too
funky
and
not
carbonated
enough
this
was
imho
a
very
nice
kriek
not
the
sweet
soda
like
stuff
you
often
get
as
an
apart
if
or
dessert
beer
this
one
could
really
shine
an
excellently
crafted
beer
drink
these
weird
belgian
beers
are
starting
to
grow
on
me
this
was
pretty
damn
good
drinkability
is
surprising
its
not
sour
enough
to
turn
me
off
and
the
cherry
flavors
mesh
with
the
lambic
funksour
incredibly
well
could
drink
this
like
water
if
it
was
available
from
a
tap
very
good
kriek
2009
vintage
poured
into
a
rodenbach
glass
deep
purple
red
and
clear
not
much
head
sits
atop
this
beer
but
what
is
there
is
white
and
produces
the
faintest
lacing
smells
like
sour
cherry
brown
sugar
acetic
acid
and
light
funky
barnyard
brett
taste
is
big
sour
cherry
pie
pie
crust
and
graham
cracker
nicely
dry
with
just
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
for
a
sour
they
just
dont
come
more
drinkable
d
i
am
glad
i
shared
this
but
wish
i
hadnt
plunked
down
as
much
cash
as
i
did
for
this
one
the
result
may
differ
for
you
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
kriek
i
would
recommend
this
kriek
to
anyone
trying
to
get
a
good
feel
for
the
style
drinks
very
well
its
easy
going
and
flavorful
drie
fonteinen
continues
to
amaze
me
a
really
good
kriek
with
plenty
of
balance
and
fruit
character
this
is
an
example
of
where
you
dont
need
cantillon
style
tartness
to
make
a
kriek
work
but
it
can
be
done
with
a
bit
of
finesse
im
looking
forward
to
searching
for
some
more
drie
fonteinen
on
my
next
trip
to
the
us
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
everything
is
in
perfect
harmony
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
usually
i
opt
for
cantillon
when
in
front
of
a
bunch
of
good
lambic
beer
but
tonight
3f
seemed
the
better
choice
it
is
difficult
to
beat
the
color
on
fruited
lambics
like
this
no
heading
comes
up
but
the
color
is
a
pinkish
red
with
some
hazy
hues
as
well
the
cherries
in
the
nose
come
off
sweet
yet
sour
at
the
same
time
earthy
notes
can
also
be
detected
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
funk
the
cherry
flavor
here
is
sweet
at
the
beginning
and
more
sour
towards
the
end
it
never
becomes
too
sour
but
instead
remains
moderately
tart
what
i
love
is
that
you
can
really
taste
the
pits
of
all
those
cherries
which
add
a
tremendous
amount
of
complexity
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
very
little
carbonation
just
a
small
hint
drinkability
is
lovely
not
too
sour
and
not
too
sweet
as
expected
this
is
some
seriously
delicious
beer
here
from
3f
one
to
sip
and
savor
on
special
occasions
i
only
rate
the
drinkability
at
4
0
because
it
was
12
99
and
because
it
is
so
complex
i
was
extremely
satisfied
with
just
one
an
amazing
beer
made
in
the
traditional
style
without
sugar
added
my
wife
loved
it
also
what
a
wonderful
lambic
good
year
this
is
something
i
would
very
much
enjoy
with
fresh
fruit
maybe
even
chocalate
d
i
really
like
this
but
its
so
sour
its
hard
to
finish
by
yourself
d
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
it
not
being
too
sour
tasted
from
375ml
bottle
purchased
at
west
lakeview
liquors
bottled
on
14
december
2007
pours
a
cloudy
light
red
that
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
darker
cabernet
sauvignon
roses
that
i
have
tried
the
head
starts
off
large
and
pink
and
slowly
recedes
to
light
lace
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
nose
is
super
sour
acidic
and
funky
with
some
barnyard
and
the
everpresent
underlying
sweet
aroma
of
kirsch
this
beer
is
undoubtedly
dry
starting
off
with
stinging
acid
and
vinegar
funk
then
moving
onto
the
sour
cherry
flavor
and
finishing
with
a
combination
of
the
above
with
the
funky
addition
of
a
slight
burnt
rubber
flavor
there
is
a
hint
of
vanilla
oak
in
the
middle
as
well
the
body
is
light
with
sparkling
acidity
and
a
long
funky
and
sour
cherry
finish
the
acidity
lingers
for
quite
a
long
time
causing
my
mouth
to
continue
watering
very
easy
to
drink
perhaps
not
the
best
kriek
ive
had
but
certainly
a
treat
and
a
very
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
d
pretty
good
all
around
this
one
would
of
probably
done
well
with
a
few
more
years
on
it
as
well
as
it
stands
now
though
i
found
it
quite
refreshing
flavorful
and
drinkable
without
too
much
sweetness
overall
induces
mouthwatering
sensations
just
thinking
about
it
due
to
the
age
of
the
bottle
i
wonder
how
much
has
been
lost
versus
when
only
one
or
two
years
have
gone
by
still
an
excellent
kriek
that
i
would
return
to
repeatedly
particularly
a
more
newlyreleased
version
d
a
very
good
kriek
quite
tasty
and
very
drinkable
notes
all
about
fruit
here
even
being
in
the
bottle
for
3
years
i
was
expecting
some
nuttiness
or
oxidation
but
its
bright
and
lively
love
it
beats
the
pants
off
of
most
other
krieks
ive
had
really
looking
forward
to
the
schaerbeekse
i
have
in
waiting
this
lambic
is
up
there
with
the
boon
oude
kriek
mariage
parfait
in
my
opinion
but
this
one
might
be
my
current
favorite
now
amazing
job
mr
debelder
if
you
want
a
kriek
that
is
not
overly
fruity
this
is
the
lambic
for
you
very
good
an
excellent
transition
for
wine
drinkers
or
those
wanting
to
live
lambics
d
highly
drinkable
for
a
fruit
beer
never
turns
sweet
or
cloying
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
about
4
to
5
years
of
age

aroma
is

the
first
sip
was
really
funky
and
musty
but
after
that
the

settled
down
some
and
the
sourtart

became
more
noticable

is

good
the
low
carbonaton
helps
make
this
brew
go
down
pretty
easy
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
its
a
fine
example
of
a
fruit
lambic
id
definitely
buy
this
again
note
bottled
on

2009
drinkability
beautifully
complex
and
balanced
quite
possibly
the
smoothest
wild
ale
ive
ever
encountered
highly
recommended
this
lambic
appears
a
purple
hue
with
a
light
pink
colored
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
if
fabulous
its
hard
for
me
to
remain
unbiased
i
must
admit
as
i
get
very
excited
about
authentic
belgian
fruit
lambics
this
beer
tastes
great
and
is
a
wonder
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
pours
a
nice
bright
light
red
color
with
a
slightlypink
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
bright
cherries
with
modest
funk
and
oak
not
too
much
acidity
the
taste
is
unfortunately
mostly
cherries
and
not
too
much
of
the
funk
oak
and
acidity
i
normally
really
enjoy
from
drie
fonteinen
fairly
nice
cherry
presence
and
a
bit
of
tartness
from
them
in
the
end
this
is
just
too
cherry
forward
without
much
involved
will
have
to
get
an
aged
bottle
at
some
point
not
as
drinkable
as
others
but
i
will
revisit
this
again
for
sure
the
beer
was
really
nice
looking
dark
ruby
red
with
a
thick
pink
foam
i
swear
there
was
still
foam
in
the
glass
once
id
finished
all
the
liquid
not
only
lace
but
actual
head
over
empty
glass
bottom
cherry
comes
through
strongly
in
the
aroma
not
far
from
cantillon
cuvee
moeder
which
id
just
had
the
previous
day
very
sweet
but
not
sodapop
sweet
just
a
whole
lot
of
cherries
really
i
could
drink
this
often
no
matter
how
girly
it
looks
it
was
just
so
delicious
if
i
find
myself
at
the
brewery
again
ill
definitely
get
at
least
one
glass
of
this
o
ive
waited
a
while
to
try
this
and
it
wasnt
a
letdown
very
nice
and
makes
me
want
to
try
more
examples
of
the
style
for
sure
pours
a
beautiful
red
that
is
so
dark
it
even
looks
like
a
cherry
sitting
in
my
glass
thin
wispy
pink
head
that
leaves
a
delicate
ring
of
light
foam
around
the
glass
and
minimal
lacing
immediately
i
smell
cherries
and
oak
funkyearthy
brett
and
winelike
characteristics
are
dominant
in
the
nose
too
taste
is
sour
cherries
tart
and
juicy
coupled
with
slight
bitter
flavors
old
oak
barrels
and
brett
make
up
the
rest
of
the
taste
no
flavors
really
linger
a
very
clean
flavor
profile
light
in
body
with
carbonation
that
is
not
high
but
definitely
more
than
moderate
very
appropriate
and
refreshing
sweet
tart
acidic
and
puckering
but
very
refreshing
and
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
any
time
and
be
happy
about
it
overall
a
really
exceptional
lambic
the
flavors
are
crisp
and
well
blended
and
the
cherries
really
do
stand
out
highly
recommended
pours
a
ruby
redpurplish
body
with
pink
head
that
quickly
dies
and
leaves
some
minor
lace
and
the
aroma
is
simply
tart
cherries
i
pick
up
a
touch
of
oakiness
and
some
sour
vinous
funk
but
mostly
i
just
get
tart
cherry
a
smooth
body
with
sharp
tart
cherry
taste
for
a
sour
edge
and
crisp
finish
not
overly
tart
and
while
its
a
light
bodied
beer
w
not
too
much
in
it
it
balances
well
with
oak
so
it
doesnt
wear
on
taste
buds
a
pleasant
beer
to
enjoy
w
or
after
dinner
light
to
medium
body
with
acidic
and
astringent
textures
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
can
be
very
crisp
but
that
also
helps
with
a
lift
in
flavors
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
will
have
to
send
a
bottle
to
my
father
who
loves
sour
cherries
reminds
me
of
something
i
would
have
in
michigan
up
near
traverse
city
very
good
d
extremely
drinkable
and
will
definitely
buy
more
it
pours
out
a
deep
dark
cherry
red
it
has
a
minimal
head
but
lots
of
bubbles
constantly
rising
the
aroma
is
stereotypical
drie
fonteinen
it
has
that
gnarly
musty
brett
character
on
top
of
the
lactic
sourness
it
really
shows
how
each
of
these
lambic
producers
really
have
distinct
house
flavors
not
on
purpose
the
taste
is
lactic
sour
balanced
nicely
against
sweetnest
from
the
cherries
as
with
all
great
sours
the
drinkability
is
incredible
great
beer
the
nose
definitely
detracted
from
this
beer
for
me
otherwise
it
was
pretty
much
spot
on
at
first
sip
this
beer
has
lively
spritzy
carbonation
on
the
tongue
halfway
through
the
glass
the
carbonation
has
all
but
vanished
leaving
a
mellow
creamy
almost
flat
brew
thats
delicious
very
ripe
fresh
cherries

the
taste

good
sweetness
from
the

not
sugary
mustybarnyard
tart

but
balanced
with
the
cherries
clean
cherry
pie
bready
finish
tart
and
refreshing
sourness
isnt
too
acidic
on
the
stomach
like
some

great
musty

funk
mixing
with
the
fruit
layers
of
foam
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
beer
drinks
with
4
or
5
years
bottle
age
from
the
celler
would
drink
a
lot
of
this
world
class
brew
drinkability
perfect
i
could
drink
quite
a
lot
of
this
d
very
tasty
and
low
enough
abv
just
dont
think
i
would
care
to
do
more
than
one
at
a
time
very
cherry
super
tart
face
hurting
sour
lip
puckering
very
sour
hits
in
the
back
of
mouth
the
cherry
flavors
are
very
very
nice
in
this
one
its
well
balanced
with
the
acetic
sour
i
really
love
this
beer
better
than
the
other
fonteinen
kriek
lambic
in
my
opinion
im
going
to
get
some
more
of
this
and
age
them
the
higher
carbonation
in
this
batch
tickles
the
tongue
and
pronounces
the
brett
a
little
more
its
fun
and
interesting
to
try
in
this
state

you
must
be

pouired
a
cranberry
juice
red
with
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
a
little
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
nice
consisting
of
cherries
oaky
barrel
barnyard
funk
cork
acidic
lemons
some
brett
and
slight
vanilla
notes
in
the
back
ground
you
can
definitely
tell
its
gonna
have
a
sour
bite
upfront
on
the
palate
the
sour
cherries
do
run
the
show
but
seem
more
natural
tasting
then
juice
like
cherries
but
has
barrel
oak
funk
citric
lemon
slight
vinegar
and
brett
accents
the
brew
was
medium
body
with
good
tingly
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
sour
and
slight
dry
finish
it
drank
really
good
and
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
krieks
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
honestly
like
how
big
the
sour
punch
was
and
wasnt
overly
acidic
very
well
balanced
overall
its
labor
day
and
one
of
the
hottest
days
weve
experience
in
sf
in
some
time
for
menowthis
kriek
really
hits
the
spot
big
on
flavor
but
the
acid
keeps
it
feeling
light
making
it
seem
all
the
more
drinkable
in
this
climate
d
this
is
not
the
ultra
dry
complex
super
kriek
that
cantillon
was
but
its
still
a
damn
good
beer
its
in
that
hanssens
realm
while
still
being
very
traditional
the
true
fruit
flavour
shines
through
very
tasty
a
worth
a
pick
up
to
try
but
i
dont
know
if
ill
ever
buy
it
again
as
it
is
freakishly
expensive
i
can
buy
a
750
of
hanssens
for
the
same
price
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sours
ive
had
sourness
is
wellcontrolled
and
taste
is
wellbalanced
a
very
nice
beer
i
like
other
lambics
better
i
e
cantillon
lou
pepe
kriek
but
this
is
good
i
think
that
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
more
sour
and
had
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
taste
drinkability
highly
drinkable
it
might
just
be
that
im
really
into
the
sours
right
now
but
yeah
i
might
have
to
go
back
and
grab
some
more
since
i
know
they
are
in
short
supply
color
red
blood
quite
similar
to
the
young
red
wine
the
nose
evokes
course
cherries
in
a
rather
sour
but
also
the
cork
and
wood
as
the
body
of
the
beer
it
offers
hints
acids
where
the
tannins
show
a
very
nice
way
and
spread
in
the
palace
in
the
mouth
the
taste
of
cherries
is
far
from
being
intrusive
it
is
suggested
in
much
the
acidity
of
the
drink
and
the
bitterness
of
its
nuclei
somewhat
soft
it
gets
dressed
in
mouth
what
it
loses
acidity
final
dry
and
astringent
d
a
very
nice
lambic
with
some
sour
and
tarty
fruit
to
it
would
try
again
o
good
but
not
great
my
experience
with
lambic
is
limited
but
this
selection
is
encouraging
drinkability
just
one
at
a
time
for
me
otherwise
id
find
myself
trying
to
sneak
a
little
sugar
into
it
this
is
one
nice
offering
by
drei
fonteinen
this
is
excellent
and
world
class
so
well
balanced
between
the
tart
sour
and
acidic
cherries
and
everything
else
everything
a
fruit
lambic
should
be
as
good
as
anything
that
i
have
had
from
cantillon
something
i
highly
recommend
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
light
pink
head
the
aroma
is
strong
cherry
with
some
vanilla
i
get
a
little
funk
but
less
than
in
the
schaerbeekse
kriek
the
flavor
is
vanilla
cherries
and
some
tartness
the
beer
is
very
dry
and
doesnt
have
much
funk
to
it
at
all
possibly
because
it
is
so
newly
bottled
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
probably
not
quite
as
good
as
the
schaerbeekse
kriek
but
if
you
take
into
account
the
price
difference
i
think
this
one
is
the
better
value
december
2007
bottling
not
much
of
a
pop
as
this
is
uncorked
but
its
not
for
lack
of
carbonation
magenta
with
light
pink
head
nose
is
laced
with
tart
cherries
and
a
musty
funk
that
foreshadows
just
how
tart
this
is
on
the
palate
quite
fruity
flavor
with
loads
of
cherries
dry
and
tart
but
the
funk
is
restrained
body
is
on
the
medium
side
with
plenty
of
carbonation
quite
refreshing
on
a
98
degree
day
d
superb
a
really
nice
kriek
its
a
little
different
than
the
schaerbeekse
kriek
which
is
a
touch
more
sour
and
has
more
distinct
cherry
flavors
should
keep
aging
gracefully
dwell
done
brew
lots
of
things
going
on
working
together
well
more
sweetness
to
accompany
the
extremely
dry
finish
would
have
helped
the
overall
drinkability
but
the
funk
is
quite
present
and
well
done
as
the
cherry
takes
a
back
seat
pours
a
hazy
dark
pinkish
color
with
a
light
pink
head
in
the
aroma
tart
dark
cherries
and
a
hint
of
oak
in
the
taste
a
dry
small
oakiness
and
a
big
tart
cherry
a
sour
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
sour
cherry
aftertaste
nice
sour
yet
not
too
much
even
with
the
sour
cherries
it
is
almost
a
palate
cleanser
taste
is
phenomenal
one
of
the
best
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
its
so
amazing
tart
and
fruity
and
this
batch
is
way
better
than
normal
if
you
find
it
drink
it
d
very
sour
very
funky
and
loaded
with
cherries
that
linger
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
it
could
become
hard
to
drink
the
half
sized
bottle
that
i
got
is
just
about
the
right
size
cherry
flesh
and
tart
skins
with
moderate
tannins
and
oak
in
the
aroma
the
fruit
is
explosive
i
know
my
opinion
is
in
the
minority
but
i
prefer
this
to
the
schaerbeekse
less
brett
and
more
fruit
a
light
and
pleasant
sweetness
is
evident
in
the
flavor
moderately
tart
and
tannic
with
prominent
cherries
cherries
cherries
strong
acetic
presence
vibrant
fruit
explosiveness
drinkability
tartness
builds
on
the
palate
which
reduces
scope
for
this
to
be
consumed
in
a
session
then
again
i
cant
really
imagine
consuming
any
kriek
in
a
session
i
love
krieks
but
there
is
plenty
of
pleasure
in
having
just
one
bottle
at
a
time
d
a
different
beer
for
the
style
than
i
am
used
to
i
dont
know
if
this
is
meant
to
have
such
a
low
carbonation
level
but
it
does
has
much
more
funk
to
it
than
normal
but
by
no
means
is
it
a
complaint
just
different
a
big
sipper
than
took
me
a
good
hour
or
three
to
finish
this
guy
overall
this
is
a
greatsmelling
beer
although
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
deliver
still
a
nice
beer
and
id
have
to
imagine
it
would
be
much
better
with
any
semblance
of
carbonation
wow
simply
put
sour
cherry
beer
and
very
red
red
in
the
head
like
the
dick
on
a
dog
poured
with
a
deep
pink
small
to
medium
sized
head
that
mostly
subsided
and
a
wee
bit
a
lace
color
is
a
hazycloudy
burnt
red
aroma
is
sour
cherry
yeast
musty
flavor
is
like
aroma
the
tartness
totally
dominates
all
of
the
other
flavors
which
are
cherries
malt
yeastoids
good
body
and
excellent
carbonation
burp
finish
is
like
flavor
cant
think
off
hand
when
id
be
in
the
mood
for
another
of
these
despite
my
score
d
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
pleasure
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
by
the
firkin
md
low
carbonation
overall
in
the
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
it
went
down
easily
and
nicely
d
this
is
a
great
beer
wonderful
flavoring
nice
tartness
that
doesnt
make
you
quite
pucker
nice
little
kick
to
it
i
only
wish
that
i
had
picked
up
another
bottle
pretty
good
beer
nothing
that
really
sets
it
apart
or
would
make
me
seek
it
out
specifically
in
the
future
this
bottle
was
1
year
old
would
like
to
try
one
after
34
years
and
see
what
is
going
on
db
price
is
nuts
1212
7
oz
but
it
is
a
great
tasting
spontaneously
fermented
beer
love
the
balance
of
the
classic
kriek
flavors
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
bottled
121606
not
much
to
look
at
a
touch
of
a
head
and
faint
traces
of
carbonation
with
a
lovely
purplish
hue
no
real
carbonation
to
speak
of
smell
is
much
better
a
dry
sourness
and
multifaceted
complexity
subdued
cherries
peppery
grapish
fruitiness
a
vinous
backbone
burgundy
and
bread
oak
taste
is
superb
much
like
the
nose
but
the
cherries
step
up
a
bit
and
add
to
the
sophistication
of
the
flavor
if
this
doesnt
pucker
your
mouth
nothing
will
there
is
a
light
vanilla
and
oaken
woodiness
that
adds
to
the
finish
which
is
super
tart
and
dry
vinous
and
clean
feel
is
light
enough
but
with
a
lighter
heaviness
that
betrays
just
the
beer
for
tonight
easy
drinking
and
classy
the
sourness
lends
itself
to
meals
and
a
measured
approach
im
wondering
if
this
one
would
be
more
bracing
a
little
bit
fresher
really
wanted
this
to
be
more
sour
and
tasty
overall
a
very
solid
kriek
it
is
good
but
i
like
cantillon
better
the
medicine
flavor
keeps
coming
back
and
it
is
really
bothering
me
i
dig
it
very
expensive
but
solid
it
has
a
creamier
fuller
mouthfeel
for
the
style
without
being
full
bodied
great
beer
drinkability
is
good
but
i
want
some
carbonation
in
my
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
for
the
price
deep
ruby
color
thin
white
head
with
hints
of
red
the
nose
is
sweet
and
tart
cherry
with
oak
yeah
tart
cherry
cherry
shock
tarts
pretty
much
it
and
yet
i
am
so
satisfied
with
this
beer
wonderful
kriek
just
extremely
tart
cherry
cherry
pixie
sticks
deep
rich
tart
cherry
notes
as
mentioned
by
dyan
this
beer
pushed
the
cork
out
as
soon
as
the
cage
was
loose
i
was
afraid
this
was
going
to
be
a
gusher
but
after
the
cork
flew
across
the
room
there
was
only
a
little
carbonation
released
from
the
beer
a
really
nice
lambic
nice
full
fruit
with
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
the
body
feel
was
heavier
than
other
lambics
but
i
kind
of
enjoyed
it
very
solid
not
as
good
as
cantillon
but
great
nonetheless
overall
this
beer
is
quite
unique
and
if
you
can
get
past
the
omnipresent
sourness
you
wont
regret
getting
it
not
for
everyone
i
gather
but
i
liked
it
lots
of
tartness
lots
of
fruits
just
like
the
2003
a
bit
sweeter
but
not
much
hint
of
vinegar
again
an
amazing
beer
d
not
overly
tart
or
acidic
but
definitely
enough
i
really
found
this
to
be
close
in
quality
to
the
schaerbeekse
version
with
that
one
having
just
a
slight
edge
would
i
have
3
of
these
375s
or
1
750
of
the
schaerbeekse
kriek
undoubtedly
the
latter
but
id
hedge
my
bets
and
cellar
a
couple
of
these
for
2
years
im
not
a
big
fan
of
aged
fruit
lambics
but
i
think
this
could
use
a
little
time
375
ml
bottle
home
the
bottle
is
about
11
months
old
this
a
fantastic
beer
it
pours
a
raspberrymahogany
color
with
a
small
pink
head
that
dissipates
slowly
the
aroma
is
naturally
fruity
and
sweet
theres
a
big
cherry
note
that
borders
on
raspberrystrawberry
jam
sweet
the
aroma
also
has
a
balanced
refined
horseblanket
funk
thats
just
wonderful
the
flavor
is
fairly
dry
and
medium
tart
i
havent
had
all
that
many
lambics
but
this
seems
quite
balanced
theres
also
a
medium
acidic
vinegar
flavor
throughout
the
aroma
and
flavor
very
nice
fruit
sour
overall
its
a
good
fruit
lambic
it
is
delicate
and
fruity
but
sour
enough
to
interest
gueuze
fans
amazing
this
is
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
had
the
cherry
flavor
is
perfect
and
blends
well
nothing
stands
out
because
it
is
blended
so
well
amazing
i
cannot
wait
to
see
what
time
does
to
this
d
this
knocked
me
out
and
provided
me
with
a
greater
appreciation
for
sours
i
could
probably
drink
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
only
i
could
afford
it
excellent
brew
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
red
color
with
a
thin
pink
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
intensely
sour
lambic
scent
with
loads
of
cherries
this
is
so
sour
that
it
makes
my
nose
burn
the
taste
is
damn
good
as
well
it
has
an
intensely
sour
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
with
some
mild
cherry
notes
the
sourness
is
out
of
control
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
powerfully
enjoyable
beer
it
has
excellent

d
an
unforgettable
brew
this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
drie
fonteinen
and
a
very
accessible
fruit
lambic
d
pretty
challenging
it
was
only
a
375ml
bottle
and
yet
i
was
very
happy
i
was
splitting
this
with
my
wife
the
flavor
was
in
line
with
the
aroma
but
with
an
initial
flavor
of
chlorine
followed
by
plastic
cherry
funk
oak
and
a
very
reserved
cherry
flavor
medium
acidity
and
carbonation
level
with
a
semidry
finish
quite
good
but
not
among
the
best
fruit
lambics
ive
had
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
example
to
compare
i
decided
to
pair
my
second
glass
with
some
cheese
so
i
shaved
up
some
ewephoria
a
sheeps
milk
gouda
from
friesland
holland
produced
for
the
u
s
market
the
combination
was
superb
bringing
out
a
little
more
sweetness
in
the
lambic
and
emphasizing
the
grassyherbnut
notes
of
the
cheese
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
strength
of
the
acidity
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
an
excellent
oude
kriek
scoring
this
beer
is
hard
i
always
try
to
score
to
style
and
while
the
extreme
nature
is
reflected
in
the
lower
scored
i
gave
it
for
some
of
the
category
it
is
nevertheless
what
i
love
about
this
beer
funky
sour
tart
intensity
up
front
that
is
puckering
and
mouthwatering
but
also
very
acidic
again
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
are
organic
and
not
artificial
or
syrupy
this
sweetness
is
balanced
by
the
very
funky
tart
notes
and
the
earthy
wooden
oak
d
this
is
an
awesome
lambic
but
hard
to
put
it
high
on
drinkability
given
the
pucker
factor
i
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
this
one
again
though
there
is
so
much
i
love
about
this
beer
most
of
which
is
the
mix
of
flavors
where
i
taste
something
different
every
sip
and
how
the
flavor
experience
in
just
one
sip
can
reveal
so
many
changing
flavors
i
will
look
for
another
bottle
of
this
and
if
it
has
a
bit
more
carbonation
i
will
up
the
scores
here
because
this
is
surely
a
great
beer
d
tasty
and
worth
the
praise
this
is
different
from
other
lambics
that
really
concentrate
on
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
it
is
pretty
drinkable
it
does
however
almost
burn
as
it
travels
down
into
my
stomach
its
that
acidic
tm
sharp
sourness
up
front
woody
tannins
and
a
big
sweetsour
cherry
flavor
leathery
and
earthy
midpalate
with
a
sour
dry
and
lightly
tannic
finish
mediumlow
carbonation
not
as
complex
or
intense
as
the
schaerbeekse
kriek
but
still
a
great
beer
drinkability
is
good
tasty
beer
but
not
otherwordly
sour
and
flavorful
without
being
over
the
top
cherry
comes
out
enough
to
really
speak
without
being
overly
lost
in
the
sour
quality
as
well
insanely
good
beer
drie
foneinen
has
figured
this
whole
belgian
thing
out
this
kriek
is
no
different
holding
true
to
what
krieks
are
this
beer
has
a
delicate
acidity
that
steers
clear
from
sharpness
or
astringency
a
clean
tartness
that
comes
from
the
cherries
are
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
vineous
blended
lambic
base
beer
tartness
take
the
shape
of
pie
cherries
underrippened
berries
crabapples
and
malt
thats
right
a
steady
stream
of
pilsner
malts
add
just
enough
sweetness
body
and
creaminess
to
buffer
the
palate
from
the
intensity
of
the
sour
beer
a
light
cork
mustiness
gives
an
earthy
complextion
to
the
beer
from
the
nose
to
the
finish
despite
the
synthetic
cork
a
real
surprise
is
the
lowlying
carbonation
which
keeps
the
acidity
from
becoming
amplified
still
the
beer
does
not
rest
heavily
on
the
tongue
rather
giving
a
mellow
soothing
demeanor
to
the
session
krieks
just
dont
get
better
super
sower
not
for
beginners
the
cherry
flavor
is
very
nice
recommended
overall
damn
good
brew
and
i
would
very
much
recommend
for
fans
of
the
style
overall
a
great
brew
so
long
as
the
sour
is
what
you
are
looking
for
drie
fonteinen
oude
kriek
is
a
solid
sparkling
red
beer
with
a
small
frothy
pink
head
it
has
a
musty
wooden
aroma
like
cherries
and
barrels
there
are
champagne
notes
in
the
nose
it
has
a
bubbly
light
body
with
a
lively
finish
it
is
very
sour
with
no
sweetness
its
mostly
sour
cherry
and
bret
theres
a
resiny
oak
flavor
that
creeps
in
and
the
aftertaste
is
all
sour
cherry
this
sounds
silly
but
if
you
toss
a
little
disaronno
in
this
it
makes
a
great
cocktail
i
was
dying
to
try
a
drie
fonteinen
beer
ever
since
i
got
into
lambics
and
having
this
only
made
me
want
more
great
mouthfeel
not
particularly
drinkable
smells
exquisite
cinnamon
cherry
vanilla
almost
smells
like
cognac
sort
of
flat
and
the
mouthfeel
is
flat
taste
is
nice
cherry
but
the
smell
is
really
the
winner
for
this
vintage
at
this
point
i
could
sniff
this
all
damn
day
i
find
this
style
hard
to
judge
not
having
much
experience
with
it
but
i
cant
say
i
wanted
to
stop
drinking
the
beer
drinkability
a
fine
fruit
lambic
but
in
all
honesty
it
makes
me
more
than
wistful
for
another
dose
of
that
hommage
a
well
done
lambic
but
id
stick
with
cantillon
notes
from
and
tasted
on
121205

how
much

not

tag
i
found
drie

kriek
to
be
unique
amongst
its
fruitinfused
lambic
brethren
although
i
suppose
all
real
kriek
are
different
from
one
another
as
each
traditional
maker
or
in
this
case
blender
has
their
own
distinctive
style
mr
debelder
i
like
your
sense
of
fashion
like
has
been
said
before
drinkable
is
not
a
word
that
i
would
associate
with
a
sour
this
brew
is
a
fine
sipper
and
great
on
a
warm
summer
day
this
brew
is
a
tad
expensive
so
i
wont
be
drinking
many
of
them
but
i
would
drink
it
again
d
probably
wouldve
been
better
in
hotter
weather
as
is
it
was
a
perfect
lunch
session
brew
to
jazz
up
an
otherwise
regular
lunch
this
kind
of
beer
puts
the
lie
to
the
kinds
of
sweeping
statement
dulcie
is
occasionally
prone
to
i
dont
like
belgians
there
are
such
varied
styles
and
this
one
is
way
out
there
nice
cranberry
color
and
interesting
complex
slightly
yeasty
and
currant
aroma
on
the
palate
the
sourness
is
otherworldly
it
is
reminiscent
almost
of
a
very
dry
riesling
quite
a
lot
going
on
in
the
glass
i
cant
give
it
a
high
drinkability
score
since
one
can
only
sip
it
which
is
just
as
well
at
the
price
a
12
7oz
bottle
bottling
date
21205
on
the
label
served
in
a
tulip
glass
it
was
a
deep
red
color
with
a
little
haze
the
head
except
for
a
few
bubbles
was
nonexistent
it
had
a
cherry
aroma
with
an
oaken
background
tart
cherry
taste
the
first
few
sips
were
a
little
too
spritzy
for
me
but
then
it
settled
down
decent
beer
but
i
didnt
finish
this
and
think
that
i
wanted
another
right
away
drinkability
never
a
beer
that
i
would
characterize
as
highly
drinkable
this
is
nonetheless
a
very
nice
middle
of
the
road
kriek
im
giving
this
one
all
4s
its
a
solid
kriek
but
the
cherries
could
stand
out
a
bit
more
in
flavor
and
aroma
the
rest
of
it
quite
good
i
think
it
is
easy
to
overrate
these
beers
bc
they
are
so
pungent
and
unique
good
drinkability
refreshing
and
clean
good
kriek
delicous
so
dry
and
acidic
yet
very
drinkable
expensive
in
the
us
but
worth
the
money
pours
from
the
bottle
a
cranberry
rose
color
with
very
thin
head
and
a
low
ring
of
lace
gorgeously
small
carb
bubbles
rise
quick
and
consistently
from
the
bottom
and
edges
of
the
glass
the
front
nose
smells
of
toy
plastic
strong
bright
and
perfumey
smells
like
a
sweet
poly
coupled
with
barnyard
manure
earthy
tart
very
sour
and
lactic
incredibly
full
and
complex
the
front
taste
is
straight
tart
front
to
back
light
tart
and
crisp
middle
with
notes
of
cherry
crab
apple
and
unripe
pear
airy
in
the
middle
like
the
spring
overall
very
bright
with
strong
cranberry
characters
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
with
a
light
to
medium
body
could
definitely
sip
on
this
one
for
a
while
d
refreshingly
tart
but
not
overpowering
very
drinkable
excellent
nice
ruby
red
color
but
no
head
at
all
the
smell
is
loaded
with
tart
cherries
and
oak
it
is
also
acidic
and
the
horse
blanket
is
lower
than
in
others
but
i
prefer
it
this
way
taste
is
acidic
right
off
the
bat
tart
cherries
and
oak
are
blended
nicely
with
some
horse
blanket
coming
through
in
the
finish
this
one
had
very
low
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
the
finish
being
somewhat
dry
this
one
was
pretty
good
and
id
say
taste
is
higher
than
4
but
i
cant
give
a
4
5
i
also
cant
say
ill
be
getting
this
again
as
its
just
not
worth
the
extremely
high
price
i
have
to
pay
to
get
it
im
intrigued
and
will
have
to
try
the
schaerbeekse
kriek
for
comparison
d
i
this
is
a
great
lambic
yeah
i
have
had
some
better
but
this
is
up
there
so
take
my
review
for
what
its
worth
december
2005
bottling
pours
a
mostly
clear
ruby
body
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
very
still
aroma
of
old
oak
logs
tart
cherries
vinegar
and
barnyard
mouthfeel
barely
has
carbonation
taste
is
tart
and
acidic
vinegary
very
funky
with
a
geuze
character
very
oaky
and
outdoorsy
no
sweetness
at
all
not
like
the
sweet
krieks
im
used
to
very
interesting
lambic
pours
a
wonderful
looking
ruby
red
with
a
nice
head
but
lacing
the
smell
like
a
strong
flavor
of
horse
blanket
and
thats
it
the
taste
isnt
very
tart
just
a
light
sour
slightly
fruity
flavor
with
dominate
horse
blanket
the
most
horse
blanket
i
have
ever
had
in
a
beer
before
the
body
is
very
light
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
theres
nothing
bad
about
that
overall
drinkability
isnt
that
high
but
i
would
try
again
if
i
was
in
a
belgian
mood
and
it
was
the
best
option
this
is
a
kick
ass
kriek
its
not
as
funky
as
cantillon
but
much
fruitier
its
just
as
sour
but
in
a
more
focused
less
harsh
way
truly
a
wonder
to
behold
and
prerequisite
tasting
for
any
lambic
lover
mouthfeel
is
sweet
up
front
quickly
becoming
tart
and
running
along
the
sides
of
the
tongue
overall
a
nice
fruit
lambic
not
the
most
sour
or
funky
but
it
has
enough
of
those
elements
to
balance
the
fruit
nicely
d
wonderful
experience
not
a
taste
all
would
enjoy
but
i
and
my
wife
who
shared
this
bottle
with
me
would
love
to
have
more
would
be
interested
in
pairing
it
with
food
as
we
drank
it
alone
one
limiting
factor
is
high

ah
an
aggressive
sourness
grips
hold
of
my
mouth
as
soon
as
i
take
my
first
sip
completely
devoid
of
any
sweetness
during
my
initial
sips
this
beer
is
quite
dry
again
there
are
some
healthy
woody
tannic
notes
reminiscent
of
barrels
joined
by
just
a
touch
of
cherry
character
the
combination
of
tannins
and
fruit
make
me
think
of
cherry
stones
and
puckering
cherry
skins
that
have
been
stripped
of
any
sweetness
this
is
just
an
aggressively
sour
lambic
it
is
not
nearly
as
funky
as
some
in
fact
the
funkiest
that
it
gets
is
that
plasticlike
phenolic
note
that
almost
seems
a
bit
like
lacquer
of
some
sort
the
combination
of
the
astringent
wood
notes
and
the
sour
acidity
make
for
one
mouth
puckering
experience
which
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
as
puckering
or
complex
as
others
in
the
style
but
worth
trying
beautiful
balanced
and
drinkable
taste
wild
cherries
with
sourness
and
astringency
the
sourness
snaps
the
palate
but
not
agressively
more
of
a
love
pat
the
drying
wood
waves
its
branches
around
deserving
attention
this
is
a
tame
banshee
wild
yes
but
civilized
a
fine
dance
partner
shes
respectable
and
could
meet
most
of
my
friends
as
she
warms
up
she
provides
enticing
sweet
nibbles
with
each
sip
very
enjoyable

kept
to
a

but
there
is
tons
of

finishes
with
a
bitter

flavor
great
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
little
more
user
friendly
than
cantillons

but
this
one
doesnt
lack
for
flavor
at
all
a
bit
expensive
but
well
worth
the
price
this
is
a
fast
finish
and
the
aftertaste
is
not
very
pronounced
i
would
call
it
sweaty
cherry
this
is
a
very
pleasant
kriek
lambic
but
for
complexity
it
is
less
than
the
much
older

i
reveiwed
earlier
i
may
try
to
get
some
more
of

foiund
this
to
be

that

a

detergenty
for
some
reason
i
loved
their
gueuze
but
couldnt
really
get
into
this
one
still
interesting
and
on
the
whole
pretty
good
i
will
surely
sample
another
day
though
11
framboos
opened
in
march
15
o
really
delightful
o
the
nose
and
taste
were
almost
polar
opposites
but
this
beer
managed
to
provide
everything
i
enjoy
in
a
fruit
lambic
really
wish
armand
would
bring
this
one
back
4

o
this
was
wayyyyyyy
better
than
the
hommage
we
popped
to
do
a
side
by
side
tough
to
land
but
at
a
large
share
like
this
definitely
worth
it
verdict
a
delicious
framboise
from
drie
fonteinen
one
i
wish
they
would
make
more
often
its
not
as
delicate
and
bright
as
the
lou
pepe
framboise
for
me
but
still
a
wonderful
showing
of
raspberries
with
nice
layers
of
funk
and
acidity
that
dont
overpower
the
beer
or
let
it
get
too
sweet
cost
40
for
a
750
ml
bottle
overall
significantly
more
sour
than
hommage
totally
different
representation

i
am
not
born
to
like
this

funky

huge

with
an
additional

in

of
cheesy

quite
sour
a
bit
of
lactic
creaminess
and
a
touch
of
oak
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
despite
being
more
sour
than
i
expected
a
top
notch
lambic
for
sure
but
i
think
some
additional
time
will
do
this
well
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
completely
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
then
some
would
love
to
see
how
it
is
doing
in
another
5
years
as
i
believe
it
has
legs
but
i
doubt
i
will
ever
cross
paths
with
this

even
with

i
dont
know
whether
ill
ever
have
an
opportunity
to
try
this
another
time
but
ill
be
very
excited
if
i
do
o
i
gave
up
a
lot
to
try
this
brew
it
lived
up
to
my
standards
and
more
from
what
i
have
heard
hommage
makes
framboos
look
like
childs
play
i
imagine
this
statement
was
exaggerated
i
need
to
try
lpf
too
o
very
very
good
and
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
but
not
so
vastly
better
than
a
similarly
aged
cantillon
lp
framboise
that
its
worth
giving
up
the
farm
for
im
quite
happy
i
was
able
to
try
this
but
its
not
something
ill
be
seeking
out
a
repeat
bottle
of
given
the
cost
of
acquisition
a
really
exceptional
experience
one
i
feel
lucky
to
have
had
a
stunning
beer
o
this
is
a
really
wonderful
beer
the
flavors
are
delicious
and
very
complex
its
just
damn
impressive
easily
amongst
the
best
fruit
lambics
ive
tasted
now
if
only
i
had
a
few
cases
of
this
this
is
simply
an
incredible
raspberry
sour
which
i
have
soft
spot
for
anyway
with
more
time
in
the
bottle
i
am
sure
some
of
the
fruit
will
give
way
to
more
of
the
trademark
drie
fonteinen
funk
it
will
be
tough
for
it
to
improve
on
how
much
i
like
it
now
but
it
should
mellow
out
for
sure

massive
thanks
go
to

sharing
this

its
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
i
never
thought
id
get
to
try
deep

a
thin

of
light
pink
foam
robust
and
soapy
look
that
stays
very
strong
smells
of
straight
up
strawberry
jam

some
other
juicy
berry
flavors
some
shaper
acidity
and
funky
notes
burn
the
edges
of
the
nose
a
bit
jam
and
funk
what
a
combo
taste
has
like
a
tart
rhubard
thing
going
on
with
some
backing
sugars
funky
sourness
on
the
edges
with
a
dry
oaky
finish
medium
bodied
with
some
initial
sharpness
and
a
softer
bubbly
feel
that
fills
out
the
rest
not
hugely
complex
but
balanced
crisp
and
very
drinkable
thanks
again
adam
for
the
cost
value
etc
i
found
this
lacking
hoping
time
takes
this
to
another

like

not
really

hommage
dark

almost
purple

and
no

not
necessarily
inviting
aroma
is
rotten
raspberry
some
rubber
very
earthy
taste
is
better
with
tart
raspberry
the
acidity
is
still
quite
tamed
which
makes
it
drinkable
light
and
flat
palate
i
prefered
hommage
as
their
was
less
of
rotten
raspberry
and
cherries
added
a
nice
twist
i
really
had
a
hard
time
drinking
my
pour
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
but
my
tasting
friends
liked
their
glass
so
old
raspberries
might
no
be
my
style
1999
vintage
pours
a
cloudy
red
with
a
very
minimal
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
rim
raspberry
nose
to
be
expected
but
the
raspberry
is
a
little
more
muted
than
i
anticipated
some
wood
notes
as
well
and
funk
tart
and
sweet
raspberry
caramel
with
a
nice
building
level
of
sourness
very
nice
medium
mouthfeel
a
little
under
carbed
and
i
think
more
carbonation
would
benefit
this
beer
overall
very
good
3f
please
make
more
this
was
good
but
far
from
great
i
would
take
an
lp
framb
or
a
rose
d
g
over
this
one
dispite
the
rarity
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
not
one
i
would
trade
my
cellar
for
solid
carbonation
good
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
beer
1999
was
better
than
2011
but
both
are
very
solid
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
it
is
super
drinkable
with
zero
alcohol
impact
a
super
solid
jamlike
fresh
raspberry
inclusion
jumps
out
and
is
very
enjoyable
mixed
with
afterthoughts
of
funk
and
earth
this
brew
flirts
with
perfection
as
it
captures
everything
i
look
for
in
a
fruited
lambic
my
only
gripe
being
the
plastic
that
emerged
from
this
didnt
blend
into
the
entire
experience
quite
like
i
wish
it
would
have
regardless
this
was
a
wonderful
treat
and
something
id
love
to
have
again
it
hurts
knowing
how
rare
this
bugger
is
o
the
best
in
its
class
for
a
raspberry
fruit
beer
a
great
lambic
too
but
not
the
best
or
my
favorite
thats
not
to
say
this
isnt
an
awesome
awesome
beer
i
would
drink
this
everyday
thanks
for
the
treat
chad
note
a
couple
months
after
this
review
i
tried
framboos
side
by
side
with
hommage
and
was
surprised
how
tart
the
raspberries
were
in
framboos
i
didnt
notice
it
as
much
when
i
had
it
on
its
own
but
they
were
puckeringly
tart
when
i
tried
it
again
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
balances
out
with
the
funkiness
in
a
couple
years

enjoyable
but
not
amazing
o
overall
im
floored
this
beer
blew
me
away
lots
of
these
talked
about
beers
fall
short
but
this
one
really
lived
up
to
the
chatter
about
it
amazing
funk
magic
berries
beer
on
a
whole
new
level
of
world
class
given
the
hype
surrounding
this
beer
im
a
little
disappointed
very
good
but
this
isnt
as
impressive
as
hommage
was
and
its
close
to
on
par
with
the
scharbeekse
kriek
in
my
opinion
a
great
offering
from
a
great
brewery
but
its
not
worth
the
trouble
in
this
case
a
great
sour
nonetheless
very
glad
i
got
to
tick
this
overall
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
fruity
beers
even
some
of
the
best
ones
in
the
world
but
this
beer
is
a
fruit
lovers
wet
dream
so
good
so
much
fresh
raspberry
flavor
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this

of
raspberries
in
a
fantastic
way
with
some
oak

funk
hanging
out
there
as
well
the
raspberries
really
carry
the
flavor
but
theres
a
nice
tart
and
funky
lambic
sourness
that
complements
it
its
only
moderately
sour
though
not
puckeringly
so
and
the
flavors
come
together
really
nicely
mouthfeel
is

nice

overall
this
was
really
quite
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
better
fruit
lambics
ive
had
it
was
especially
impressive
for
me
as
raspberry
beers
tend
to
disappoint
me
but
this
one
really
came
through
overall
this
is
perfect
that
i
obtained
enough
for
cellaring
as
i
will
be
opening
up
a
bottle
once
every
other
year
with
my
swedish
or
chicago
friends
alongside
me
there
is
so
much
potential
as
its
a
little
bit
unruly
and
so
much
complexity
will
occur
over
the
years

smooth
easy

and
just
really
enjoyable
the
balance
is
just
perfect
i
was
stoked
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
beer
at
sb
while
also
purchasing
a
couple
bottles
for
takeaway
im
excited
to
see
how
this
one
ages
as
it
is
still
quite
young
but
all
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
both
are
good
debatable
if
they
are
worth
the
effort
to
acquire
but
that
is
a
different
story
we
opened
a
rose
de
gambrinus
next
to
these
two
bottles
it
couldnt
even
look
on
them
i
found
the
1999
slightly
better
and
it
would
be
a
4
75
overall
it
is
hard
for
me
to
pick
a
winner
but
i
guess
i
liked
the
newer
one
better
i
think
what
makes
the
beer
different
from
any
other
3f
sour
is
the
fruit
which
was
way
way
more
forward
in
in
the
newer
one
it
would
probably
be
better
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
but
after
more
than
a
decade
the
1999
is
probably
over
the
hill
a
little
overall
both
vintages
were
delightful

a

overal
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
i
noticed
some
differences
in
the
level
of
carbonation
between
the
two
bottles
but
besides
that
this
beer
is
stunning
again
if
you
want
a
more
complex
taste
take
a
geuze
or
let
the
framboos
age
for
several
years
because
the
lambic
is
still
a
bit
too
young
but
if
you
want
to
experience
the
best
fresh
fruit
lambic
ever
made
drink
it
now
overall
a
very
good
framboise
with
an
exceptional
aroma
i
would
have
liked
more
carbonation
but
the
low
level
of
it
was
not
detrimental
overall
this
was
the
star
of
the
show
tonight
and
it
certainly
put
on
a
stunning
performance
with
awesome
raspberry
flavor
all
over
the
room
a
light
tartness
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
as
balance
this
beer
was
a
real
decadent
treat
it
is
still
very
fresh
at
this
point
so
the
nose
and
taste
are
almost
completely
dominated
by
the
fruit
given
some
time
however
it
will
mellow
out
a
bit
and
allow
the
lambic
to
mature
and
play
a
larger
roll
as
a
comparison
hommage
which
is
also
a
raspberry
lambic
and
has
been
maturing
since
2007
is
mellower
and
somewhat
more
complex
now
that
the
fruit
has
faded
and
the
lambic
has
developed
regardless
the
increadibly
bold
flavors
that
framboos
brings
to
the
table
right
now
are
a
real
treat
and
im
very
glad
my
mate
twisted
my
rubber
arm
and
convinced
me
to
attend
the
festival
it
will
be
fun
to
see
this
beer
develop
over
time
as
well
thanks
for
bringing
this
one
back
from
the
grave
armand
this
was
phenomenal
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
think
it
will
get
even
better
with
age
it
smells
absolutely
wonderful
cheers
d
i
initially
wrote
that
this
wasnt
significantly
better
than
hommage
then
i
tried
hommage
and
realized
i
was
totally
wrong
its
perhaps
too
sour
to
drink
in
mass
quantities
and
the
the
rarity
and
price
tag
make
it
unlikely
id
ever
be
able
to
have
more
than
2oz
still
its
clearly
a
superior
lambic
that
has
held
up
quite
impressively
even
after
12
years
as
much
as
i
nursed
my
glass
it
emptied
depressingly
quickly
d
simply
impressive
the
raspberry
is
all
over
this
one
which
truthfully
i
wasnt
expecting
after
all
these
years
destroys
all
other
sour
raspberry
beers
with
ease
and
just
excellent
will
i
ever
have
it
again
probably
not
how
sad
drinkability
is
great
great
balance
restrained
but
prominent
sourness
and
acidity
great
berry
character
wow
this
is
one
damn
good
beer
if
only
there
were
an
endless
supply
available
those
who
say
this
one
is
past
its
prime
are
wrong
the
carbonation
was
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
was
light
i
suspect
the
age
had
something
to
do
with
the
carbonation
being
a
little
low
for
a
lambic
this
is
the
drie

enjoyed
thanks
to
jorisppattyn
and
martint
with
martint
kimchee
oakes
and
tiggmtl
as
joris
points
out
this
is
refermented
in
bottle
the
vintage
is
1986
and
i
swear
this
bottle
is
like
1
inch
thick
the
cork
looks
completely
ravaged
like
in
an
horror
movie
apparent
soil
lie
everywhere
under
the
cage
which
is
barely
holding
in
place
there
is
no
label
on
this
bottle
the
vintage
is
written
with
chalk
simply
despite
its
age
it
opens
up
with
a
serious
pop
a
nice
offwhite
to
pink
head
forms
over
the
top
of
the
reddish
pinkish
orange
body
such
a
head
seems
like
a
mirage
from
the
past
and
scores
an
easy
5
the
aroma
is
totally
unique
and
exploding
of
raspberries
they
hit
the
deep
end
of
your
nose
and
penetrate
your
brain
and
you
know
when
it
happens
that
the
smell
will
haunt
your
memories
for
a
while
it
feels
very
dessertlike
wet
creamy
some
sweetness
seems
to
come
from
the
vanilla
notes
its
earthy
leafy
with
leathery
peaks
very
complex
lemon
and
citrus
complement
the
lactic
tartness
and
funky
brettanomyces
character
in
mouth
its
definitely
the
most
lactic
beer
ive
ever
had
extremely
dry
and
fruity
dusty
outofdate
yoghourt
potent
lemon
juice
with
the
wheaty
acidity
really
coming
out
with
the
slightest
effort
and
its
really
not
that
demanding
actually
you
grasp
all
the
typical
barnyardy
and
horsey
characteristics
aftertaste
is
long
tart
astringent
salivating
begging
for
more
but
begging
to
let
this
moment
be
enjoyed
for
a
while
medium
bodied
very
dry
and
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
which
seems
like
a
miracle
once
youll
have
tried
it
youll
know
but
its
one
of
those
beers
that
is
such
a
labyrinth
of
flavors
and
at
the
same
time
keeps
such
a
nice
focus
that
its
just
adorable
and
deserves
to
be
seeked
out
and
tried
to
be
believed
its
hard
to
paint
in
words

the
nuances
a
brewer
can
attain

a
lively
carbonation
bready
soft
malts
which
interact
well
with
the
huge
but
gentle
cherry
fruitiness
at
no
point
does
the
sourness
of
this
beer
roll
over
the
fruity
cherry
impression
which
comes
along
with
red
vinous
grapes
and
a
subtle
oak
defined
maltiness
bretts
stay
in
the
background
of
the
composition
they
only
support
the
cherries
with
an
enjoyable
tartness
in
the
end
accompanying
the
fermented
fruits
oakiness
goes
incredibly
well
with
the
bursting
cherries
print
exposing
their
fullbodied
smooth
fruitiness
wine
and
oak
define
the
body
of
this
beer
leading
to
a
well
balanced
superior
cherry
fruitiness
the
palate
opens
quite
pronouncedly
sour
lactic
and
lemony
with
a
leathery
sour
cherry
character
being
most
noticeable
up
front
this
then
yields
to
a
fruity
midpalate
with
plenty
of
cherry
flavor
ranging
from
the
bright
tartness
of
sour
cherries
to
the
floral
and
fruity
complexities
of
the
sweeter
varietals
funk
in
the
form
of
earth
and
barnyard
are
present
drying
faintly
sweet
and
very
tart
on
the
finish
this
is
very
enjoyable
a
faint
oiliness
is
present
a
heft
from
the
cherries
that
isnt
present
in
a
regular
kriek
including
the
lou
pepe
adds
a
unique
dimension
to
this
beer
it
does
however
get
in
the
way
of
the
lemony
base
lambic
and
the
tannins
from
firming
up
on
the
finish
leaving
it
just
a
little
watery
instead
all
said
though
this
is
a
marvelous
beer
though
maybe
not
worth
the
24
or
so
it
goes
for
retail
i
really
like
a
lot
about
this
beer
awesome
sourness
huge
cherry
nose
but
i
cant
get
over
the
fact
that
it
reminds
me
exactly
of
all
the
terrible
cough
medicine
i
used
to
drink
as
a
kid
this
is
medium
bodied
moderately
carbonated
and
overall
very
enjoyable
calling
it
intense
red
is
very
fitting
the
cherry
character
is
the
star
of
the
show
almost
to
a
fault
as
it
hides
what
i
love
about
3f
still
worth
trying
and
something
i
would
buy
again
if
the
price
was
right

lightly

and
if
you
focus
theres
a

the

which
i
find
unfortunate
light
to
medium

sticky

low

and
a
lippuckering

drinkability
a
surprisingly
good
sour
beer
to
me
i
hope
they
make
more
one
of
the
most
complex
krieks
ive
had
even
with
age
the
fruit
keeps
on
delivering
what
a
beer
thanks
to
clay
station
for
acquiring
and
sharing
this
rare
beauty
a
ruby
red
color
like
a
fire
truck
true
to
its
name
an
intensity
and
vibrancy
not
seen
since
atrial
not
much
head
on
it
but
it
doesnt
need
one
aromas
of
exploding
pie
cherries
and
cherry
jam
funky
as
anything
ive
had
from
these
guys
and
quite
heavy
in
the
lacto
its
mature
and
my
mouth
is
watering
hard
the
cherry
flavor
is
so
robust
and
sour
like
candy
almost
brilliantly
alluring
sexy
oh
man
its
even
more
cherry
forward
than
their
other
krieks
although
i
dont
know
by
how
much
sour
too
i
thought
it
might
be
cloying
but
its
just
perfect
oak
mellows
its
feel
a
lot
its
really
dry
too
for
what
it
is
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
here
but
it
would
be
so
sick
to
line
all
these
krieks
up
for
one
tasting
you
can
taste
it
for
miles
more
depth
with
every
sip
and
a
pungency
uncommon
even
in
the
wild
ale
world
here
on
the
yeast
up
there
with
any
ive
ever
had
im
in
love
my
current
favorite
beer
thus
far
the
best
kriek
ive
ever
had
intensity
is
the
proper
description
of
this
one
delicious
pours
an
extremely
dark
garnet
hue
which
is
what
helltowns
kriek
should
have
looked
like
instead
of
pink
lemonade
wads
and
wads
of
cherries
on
a
sour
tone
kind
of
a
punch
in
the
mouth
with
not
as
much
nuance
on
the
character
as
i
would
have
hoped
for
but
its
still
good
just
as
a
sour
should
be
in
all
aspects
definitely
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
a
new
version
of
the
real
deal
i
enjoyed
the
heck
out
of
this
beer
in
terms
of
pure
fruit
beers
it
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
but
judged
against
other
lambics
it
lacked
a
bit
of
the
complexity
to
put
it
in
the
upper
echelon
4
25
is
a
harsh
rating
honestly
that
is
more
of
a
comparison
to
other
lambics
compared
to
other
fruit
abominations
i
have
tried
this
is

love
the
smell
of
sour
cherries
the
taste
is
of
the
same
tart
and
sour
cherries
this
is
mouth
puckering
love
the
feeling
on
back
end
of
my
cheeks
light
to
medium
body
slight
carbonation
tart
too
overall
a
delicious
sour
brew
o
great
beer
but
not
worth
too
much
hassle
to
get
i
would
not
buy
this
one
again
due
to
the
price
but
it
is
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
delicious
lambic
with
great
cherry
notes
intense
cherry
notes
some
nice
dryness
and
sweetness
that
slightly
balances
the
acetic
tones
o
drinkable
but
a
dominated
by
an
intense
cherry
flavor
i
like
cherry
but
it
has
an
artificial
and
medicinal
quality
to
it
somewhat
enjoyable
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
will
not
purchase
again
overall
good
but
not
great
its
a
decent
beer
with
nice
cherry
but
a
little
too
much
in
some
ways
and
not
enough
in
others
this
doesnt
seem
like
a
3f
beer
more
like
a
cheaper
belgian
kriek
than
the
awesome
stuff
they
usually
put
out
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
carbonation
is
lacking
but
the
cherry
isnt
too
fake
light
body
with
minimal
soft
carbonation
the
big
fruit
aroma
didnt
translate
in
taste
unfortunately
o
so
yeah
this
is
pretty
intense
a
good
deal
of
pucker
power
in
this
one
it
proved
far
too
intense
to
pair
with
my
duck
breast
but
as
a
standalone
beer
its
a
great
drink

i
was
told
by
the
store
owner
that
this
was
a
oneoff
beer
because
3f
had
accidentally
used
too
many
cherries
if
thats
the
case
then
im
glad
that
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
out
and
sad
i
didnt
get
more
o
decent
but
probably
my
least
favorite
drie

to
date
the
must
is
out
of
control
and
the
cherries
just
cant
make
up
the
difference
compared
to
the
allagash
red
this
was
nowhere
near
as
good
and
they
are
about
the
same
age
wow
no
added
sweetener
and
an
experienced
lambic
blender
makes
for
one
badass
brew
expensive
but
worth
every
penny
o
very
disappointing
considering
armand
is
behind
this
it
is
not
up
to
his
usual
mastery
of
the
style
also
considering
the
16
price
tag
on
this
you
are
better
off
with
something
else
for
the
style
not
cheap
but
i
bought
a
couple
bottles
and
have
no
regrets
worth
tracking
down
for
the
nose
alone
o
good
kriek
maybe
a
bit
overvalued

i
suppose
that

call

from

maybe

otherwise
but
the

while
pungent
isnt
quite
the
palatewrecker
i
was
expecting
tasty
like
an
unsweetened

and
well
worthy
of
a
try
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
subdued
leaving
a

tingle
as
the

goes
down

red

sourness
to
it
lacks
much
carbonation
which
would
do
well
to
help
these
flavors
along
just
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
the

the
schaerbeekse
not
bad
by
any
means
but
nothing
too
special
o
decent
kriek
very
enjoyable
but
not
the
best
representative
of
this
style
i
would
definitely
drink
again
and
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
d
intense
is
appropriately
named
when
it
comes
to
the
cherry
flavor
overall
a
decent

and
to
the
point
made
with
40
cherries
amazing
depth
withi
one
dimension
huge
cherry
flavors
with
a
touch
of
funk
and
vinous
notes
this
is
great
in
terms
of
fruit
flavor
a
total
cherry
bomb
but
it
comes
at
a
price
i
think
i
may
have
paid
18
for
this
375ml
oh
well
a
nice
treat
id
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
this
is
probably
the
best
fruitbased
beer
that
drie
fonteinen
makes
simple
but
so
deliciously
in
your
face
intense

is
aptly
named
and
totally

bottle
from

thanks
to
a
vigorous

big

dry
and
maybe
a
hint
of
the
oak
and
vanilla
flavor
is
sour
cherry
vinegar
up
front
with
an
oaky
finish
a
bit
of
a
musty
undertone
not
as
dry
and
effervescent
as
i
expected
with
only
low
to
medium
carbonation
lingering
cherry
malt
left
on
the
palate
very
much
on
the
lambic
and
wheat
flavor
more
so
than
the
cherry
overall
which
is
good
and
keeps
it
from
being
medicinal
like
i
get
from
some
krieks
overall
a
solid
offering
but
would
not
spend
18
99
again
for
12
7
oz
as
a
side
note
it
kinda
makes
me
mad
3f
here
is
like
a
rock
band
that
decides
to
make
a
weird
and
mostly
crappy
album
just
to
see
if
people
will
praise
them
for
it
for
the
price
i
had
to
pay
for
this
beer
at
a
bar
it
probably
ranks
as
the
worst
beer
purchase
i
have
ever
made
oddefinitely
worth
a
try
the
cherry
came
off
as
a
bit
artificial
in
some
aspects
of
the
flavor
then
the
other
parts
were
great
and
made
up
for
it
a
sample
pour
was
good
enough
and
i
dont
think
it
would
be
worth
20
for
a
375ml
overall
okay
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
this
will
age
well
im
sure
but
the
cherries
need
to
subside
substantially
verdict
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
from
drie
fonteinen
but
im
not
convinced
its
better
than
oude
kriek
it
needs
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
the
cherry
is
definitely
front
and
center
and
executed
perfectly
it
just
doesnt
offer
too
much
else
like
their
schaerbeekse
kriek
or
oude
kriek
very
interesting
kriek
its
so
heavy
on
the
cherries
it
tastes
like
a
thin
but
flavourful
cherry
jam
highly
recommend
trying
at
least
once
for
any
sour
head
out
there
dont
know
if
i
would
recommend
buying
more
than
one
bottle
though
given
its
price
point
19
99
for
a
375ml
bottle
youre
better
off
spending
another
5
on
a
golden
blend
which
is
a
deliciously
worldclass
sour
if
resting
entirely
on
first
impressions
the
beer
is
a
less
dry
kriek
than
is
expected
from
the
great
brewers
but
a
few
sips
in
the
beer
begins
to
open
up
in
highly
unexpected
ways
sure
its
not
as
tart
or
as
sharp
as
traditional
lambic
but
if
you
are
like
me
a
big
fan
of
the
more
balanced
flanders
reds
then
this
kriek
might
also
find
favor
overall
i
really
prefer
my
kriek
to
have
more
carbonation
than
intense
red
has
it
has
satisfying
sourness
and
nice
funk
profile
to
balance
but
the
carbonation
could
be
a
deal
breaker
for
serious
sour
beer
afficianados
o
expensive
flat
and
sort
of
boring
this
was
just
not
very
good
the
aroma
is
nice
but
this
is
a
serious
downgrade
over
the
standard
oude
kriek
o
cherries
and
lots
of
them
nice
fruit
without
being
overly
sweet
o
a
beautifullooking
beer
with
a
potently
funky
nose
a
very
mild
fruit
character
and
a
surprisingly
moderate
acidity
level
on
the
palate
certainly
not
my
favorite
kriek
ever
but
definitely
enjoyable
the
smell
is
incredible
the
taste
is
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
i
believe
oude
kriek
is
the
better
beer
but
i
would
just
be
nitpicking
this
is
still
tasty
stuff
o
very
good
beer
incredibly
interesting
its
more
cherryfull
than
lou
pepe
kriek
and
almost
like
a
pinot
noir
i
would
probably
buy
at
least
a
few
more
at
this
price
ill
be
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
since
there
is
so
much
flavor
at
this
point
overall
a
fantastic
kriek
as
expected
would
like
to
try
this
again
in
a
few
years
to
see
how
intensely
sour
it
will
become
anyone
calling
intense
red
fake
needs
a
reality
check
its
good
loaded
with
enough
cherry
to
kill
a
moose
i
know
ive
been
spoiled
by
some
other
sours
because
i
wouldnt
necessarily
describe
this
as
intense
it
is
very
tasty
though
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
o
great
beer
wish
i
got
more
overall
a
tastefully
done
kriek
the
cherries
are
really
in
your
face
but
almost
taste
slightly
fake
for
that
reason
i
cannot
get
behind
this
beer
my
vote
is
to
stick
with
cantillon
kriek
as
the
1
cherry
beer
i
really
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
one
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
strong
fresh
cherry
jamminess
overpowers
some
but
the
flavor
is
so
good
it
doesnt
matter
not
as
complex
as
some
other
3f
but
delicious
nonetheless
i
wish
i
wouldve
ordered
more
the
beer
is
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
pinkishpurple
head
the
aroma
is
all
about
the
cherries
in
your
face
sweet
and
tart
cherries
gravitating
to
the
sweet
side
a
bit
i
dont
want
to
say
the
beer
is
one
dimensional
because
it
isnt
however
cherries
really
steal
the
show
here
juice
and
jam
with
just
a
bit
of
oak
and
tart
character
an
outstanding
beer
even
if
not
my
favorite
kriek
lambic
armand
has
created
a
nice
little
deviation
here
a
wonderful
pairing
with
chocolate
overall
it
is
an
intense
cherry
flavor
delicious
cherry
if
nothing
else
overall
not
the
most
sour
funky
or
complex
lambic
ever
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
cherry
bomb
this
one
is
for
you
bottle

this
beer
is
ridiculous
absurd
cherry

and
flavor
complete
with
cinnamon
brown
sugar

tart
but
not
really
sour
literally
a
beer
expression
of

so
goooddd

really
fruity
very
subdued
lambic
character
taste
is
also
very
fruity
without
being
overly
sweet
low
lambic
character
but
mostly
because
of
its
young
age
rather
than
too
much
sugar
palate
is
smooth
and
silky
meddry
with
medium

delicious
pours

solid

there
are
some
deeper
berry
and
red

taste
is
actually
sweeter
than
expected
theres
a

of
cherry
juice
in
the
beer
some
light

mild
to
medium
sour
pucker
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
normal
theres
some
body
to
the
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
lots
more
juicy
cherry
sweetness
o
this
is
worth
trying
but
is
greatly
lacking
in
funk
sour
and
complexity
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
time
will
do
to
this
though
if
you
love
krieks
youll
still
enjoy
this
if
you
dont
opaque

substantial
fizzing
but
little

deep
sourness
an

quality
less
complex
than
a
traditional
kriek
mildly
cloying
in
the
mouth
which
works
itself
out
while
its
supposed
to
be
billed
as
an
aperitif
i
would
suggest
only
a
small
serving
to
let
the
acidity
open
up
the
mouth
for
other
things
o
im
sorry
but
i
think
the
emperor
has
no
clothes
this
strikes
me
as
a
batch
that
wasnt
very
good
that
then
had
a
ton
of
fruit
dumped
in
and
still
isnt
very
good
the
beer
pours
a
deep
and
dull
looking
maroon
with
a
light
pink
halo
of
head
that
modestly
laces
the
nose
is
quite
potent
with
booming
notes
of
cherry
not
coughsyrupy
and
funk
the
taste
presents
even
more
aspects
of
the
cherry
including
the
leaves
pit
and
twig
mixed
with
some
funk
interesting
the
mouthfeel
isnt
nearly
as
tart
as
expected
with
bold
cherry
sweetness
upfront
and
a
semidry
lingering
tartness
i
expected
something
that
was
a
lot
more
tart
and
dry
possibly
just
a
bit
underdeveloped
i
think
this
is
definitely
a
potent
kriek
that
highlights
the
cherry
in
a
unique
way
id
let
it
hang
out
in
your
cellar
a
bit
before
opening
o
woh
another
masterpiece
from
armand
this
is
very
complex
and
actually
i
would
not
advise
to
try
this
to
someone
unused
to
drie
fonteinen
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
offer
from
this
blender
and
i
see
this
aging
very
well
beautiful
pour
hazed
dark
blood
red
color
with
an
iridescent
dark

head
from
a

slightly
tart
light

association
sweet

but
not

lambicy
flavor
is
fairly
sweet

start

and
skin
with
a
light
sour
finish
some
acidic
and
doughy
notes
linger
in
finish
medium
thick
body
with
very
soft
carbonation
from
the
color
and
aroma
id
guess
this
almost
has
too
much
fruit
id
expect
trying
this
again
in
event
just
a
few
months
might
be
a
much
differentenjoyable
experience
but
fresh
this
is
disappointment
lacking
much
depth
complexity
acidity
or
just
all
around
good
ol
lambic
ness
overall
the
beer
feels
too
young
and
lifeless
its
not
particularly
fruity
and
the
acidic
character
is
far
to
weakfleeting
and
the
body
is
just
way
too
watery
it
has
a
great
impressive
bold
nose
but
then
it
makes
what
happen
next
even
more
disappointing
pours
a
hazy
dark
red
with
a
foamy
red
head
that
settles
to
wisps

intense
sour
cherry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
fantastic
cherry
presence
that
is
super
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
just
not

quite

i
find
the
plums
give
this
beer
a
strange
combination
of
funky
and
tart
that
doesnt
work
for
me
not
my
favorite
offering
from
tilquin
o
4
5
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
it
i
thought
this
might
be
like
a
kriek
a
more
plummy
flavor
but
its
very
different
the
flavors
and
aromas
i
love
in
their
gueuze
are
present
here
with
subtle
fruity
flavors
its
rare
to
have
a
unique
beer
that
this
wellbalanced
this
is
a
very
nice
gueuzelambic
before
the
plums
even
come
into
play
once
they
do
they
add
a
nice
unique
twist
to
the
brew
i
could
use
more
plum
flavor
certainly
but
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
o
tastes
awesome
but
wish
it
were
a
bit
more
carbed
and
had
a
bit
of
a
more
advanced
acid
profile
its
a
good
beer
but
not
enough
different
from
gueuze
tilquin
in
my
opinion
and
as
i
recall
to
warrant
a
different
label
and
a
jacked
up
cost
i
liked
the
gueuze
well
enough
and
liked
this
well
enough
for
the
same
reasons
maybe
its
a
bit
tarter
but
the
plum
which
i
had
expected
to
really
be
the
defining
characteristic
of
this
beer
was
barely
present
for
me
which
makes
it
interesting
that
some
others
here
got
so
much
plum
character
while
others
got
so
little
this
is
the
second
plum
beer
ive
had
and
the
previous
one
was
the
same
surely
some
of
the
tartness
comes
from
there
but
what
i
was
hoping
for
was
more
wonderful
perfumey
plum
flavor
and
didnt
get
it
it
went
nicely
enough
with
thanksgiving
dinner
regardlesss
sours
arent
cheap
but
the
price
for
a
12
7oz
bottle
of
this
was
nuts
and
i
didnt
notice
it
until
id
paid
for
my
whole
haul
would
not
buy
again
the
dude
behind
tilquin
is
amazing
this
is
great
stuff
this
lived
up
to
the
hype
quite
tasty
overall
4
5
a
fantastic
beer
and
while
im
not
surprised
given
the
adeptly
done
gueuze
tilquin
the
plum
adds
a
fantastic
depth
to
the
otherwise
classic
sour
beer
not
too
many
are
doing
plum
lambics
but
based
on
the
taste
of
this
one
perhaps
more
brewers
should
be
unexpected
low
carbonated
with
a
very
sour
dry
citric
foundation
underneath
the
dominant
acidic
tartness
refreshing
sour
notes
become
recognizable
with
a
subtle
lovely
hint
of
fermented
fruit
to
it
the
fruitiness
itself
is
surprisingly
sour
of
unripe
plums
and
green
apple
which
is
very
soft
on
tongue
while
the
brett
acidity
dries
out
the
palate
not
too
fruity
compared
to
the
sour
aspect
of
the
beer
a
subtle
addition
during
the
finish
acidity
reaches
its
peak
overwhelming
the
fruit
flavor
completely
leaving
back
a
slick
tremendous
sourness
another
nice
little
rarity
added
to
the
crowded
shelves
in
alberta
i
dont
need
too
trade
anymore
if
i
just
wait
long
enough
everything
will
just
come
to
me
2012
edition
absolutely
stunning
some
huge
quantity
of
plums
in
this
gives
it
just
a
pink
shade
and
isnt
overly
fruity
or
sweet
a
testament
to
its
maturity
hazy
as
orange
as
it
is
pink
the
nose
here
is
tart
from
the
plums
not
sweet
almost
not
ripe
or
something
with
the
lactic
funk
of
quality
lambic
and
the
oaky
maturity
of
a
well
blended
gueuze
wishing
for
nothing
else
the
flavor
just
explodes
for
me
the
right
mix
of
sour
and
funk
its
weird
and
open
fermented
feeling
and
farmy
and
all
of
that
but
its
also
quite
puckery
especially
in
the
finish
but
it
never
really
gets
acidic
or
churny
in
the
stomach
like
many
others
its
balance
there
is
insane
the
fruit
adds
less
than
expected
maybe
a
product
of
age
but
it
just
adds
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
that
tartness
you
get
from
the
skin
of
the
plum
it
really
is
a
cool
use
of
fruit
and
an
expertly
made
beer
the
tilquin
gueuze
has
come
to
prominence
recently
given
the
sour
craze
we
all
seem
to
be
on
but
this
is
a
level
better
than
the
base
beer
its
incredible
really
one
of
the
better
fruited
sours
i
have
ever
encountered
a
beer
you
have
to
try
to
believe
i
had
this
a
borefts
2014
i
remember
that
i
was
quite
excited
about
the
beer
being
used
to
the
strong
tartness
of
cantillon
brews
i
was
surprised
to
get
this
nose
of
quite
typical
geuze
flavors
but
more
retrained
than
usually
and
combined
with
the
scent
of
sweet
plums
the
beer
tastes
tart
enough
to
qualify
for
the
honorary
title
of
oude
but
with
the
fruitiness
comes
along
pretty
harmonic
and
drinkable
like
it
overall
an
exceptional
sour
beer
o
decent
enough
but
nothing
outstanding
the
plum
comes
through
on
the
nose
but
less
so
on
the
palate

i

i
liked
the

better
perhaps
this
would
dry
out
if
i
let
it
sit
for
a
while
i
think
the
bottle
pictured
is
from
the
first
batch
of
the
quetsche
as
stated
in
the
contributors
review
plumquetsche
now
has
a
notation

below
the
last
line
of
text
and
above
the
fluid
oz
number
saying
brewed
with
plums
o
nice
tartness
and
bright
fruit
overtones
this
is
my
first
fruit
lambic
and
i
can
appreciate
that
it
is
an
outstanding
ale
but
didnt
feel
comfortable
going
higher
in
my
scores
considering
my
lack
of
reference
points
within
the
style
i
dont
know
that
lambics
or
fruity
or
sour
beers
will
ever
be
a
goto
for
me
but
i
have
really
enjoyed
them
when
ive
had
them
certainly
an
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
ale
that
fans
of
the
style
must
really
dig
ogreat
fruit
lambic
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
complex
and
quite
drinkable
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
light
brownreddish
color
lambic
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
carbonation
aroma
consists
of
tart
a
funky
noes
with
some
very
subtle
notes
of
plums
taste
is
dominated
by
tart
notes
with
subtle
notes
of
plums
with
a
light
barnyard
finish
acidity
level
is
well
balanced
with
some
oak
notes
easily
distinguishable
body
is
quite
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
enjoyable
but
i
would
have
thought
the
plum
notes
would
have
been
more
pronounced
a
delicious
fruity
lambic
that
doesnt
quite
showcase
the
plum
fruit
but
delivers
on
other
flavors
two
complaints
needs
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
a
more
assertive
funk
presence
in
the
flavor
profile
other
than
that
most
all
marks
are
hit
right
and
drinks
akin
to
a
grape
infused
sour
with
tannic
and
bright
fruit
notes
o
great
drinkability
excellent
lambic
for
sour
beer
lovers
even
though
i
picked
up
no
plum
notes
in
either
the
aroma
or
the
flavor
profile
this
tilquin
offering
is
considerably
smoother
and
more
complex
than
their
original
gueuze
while
the
date
on
this
bottle
indicates
that
it
is
rather
fresh
i
would
love
to
sample
something
even
younger
to
see
if
the
plums
are
more
noticeable
o
what
a
treat
expected
big
things
and
wasnt
disappointed
incredible
complexity
and
depth
to
this
libation
incredibly
refreshing
salty
funky
treat
from
one
of
the
finest
breweries
on
the
planet
oude
gueuze
tilquin
à
lancienne
is
one
of
the
best
lambics
in
belgium
so
the
fact
that
adding
plums
to
it
didnt
result
in
much
of
a
change
really
doesnt
matter
bastardized
commercial
fruit
lambics
are
defined
by
their
fruitiness
but
authentic
traditional
fruit
lambics
are
defined
by
their
lambicness
great
lambic
is
great
lambic
and
this
is
certainly
that
overall
cracking
stuff
as
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
while
its
not
extremely
dissimilar
to
the
original
gueuze
it
adds
enough
of
a
twist
to
make
it
a
welcome
diversion
from
tilquin
these
guys
really
know
their
stuff
and
have
to
be
one
of
the
best
lambic
producers
in
the
world
a
fantastic
beer
what
a
great
use
of
the
plum
really
nice
fruit
lambic
that
has
an
incredibly
strong
geuze
character
with
the
plums
being
complementary
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelf
you
should
strongly
consider
buying
it
as
it
is
a
whole
other
level
beyond
the
regular
tilquin
geuze
it
can
be
expensive
but
i
would
argue
that
its
a
world
class
lambic
that
deserves
to
command
the
asking
price
light
body
with
zesty
and
sharp
carbonation
that
stings
at
the
tongue
and
really
opens
up
your
taste
buds
big
flavor
with
nice
brett
character
one
more
or
less
well
balanced
fruit
lambic
the
guest
star
doing
enough
to
offset
the
still
heady
tart
and
funky
character
it
was
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
chase
this
one
down
and
as
the
end
cap
of
my
last
shopping
day
of
this
2013
yuletide
season
it
was
totally
worth
it
i
think
naw
watch
me
be
able
to
get
this
at
the
better
bottleshops
in
the
new
year
at
half
the
price
the
idea
of
which
thankfully
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
the
quality
or
the
atmosphere
right
now
o
pretty
good
all
around
fruit
lambic
one
of
my
least
favorite
of
the
night
but
we
had
some
pretty
serious
beers
so
that
is
to
be
expected
to
some
extent
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
may
have
to
track
down
a
bottle
and
throw
it
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
o
a
top
quality
lambic
with
perfect
balance
and
an
absolute
thirst
quencher
o
easily
a
great
lambic
for
sure
just
not
as
fruit
forward
as
i
had
hoped
it
could
be
nonetheless
the
base
is
superb
and
has
a
great
balance
to
it
o
i
was
surprised
how
subtle
the
plum
was
but
i
am
not
at
all
disappointed
by
that
this
is
an
awesome
drinking
gueuze
this
was
delicious
and
easy
drinking
i
had
no
issues
killing
this
bottle
and
was
blown
away
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
worth
the
30
o
nice
light
funk
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
of
it
but
great
flavor
overall
another
fantastic
beer
from
tilquin
and
one
i
hope
to
having
again
soon
plums
make
a
fantastic
addition
to
lambic
and
i
am
surprised
that
there
arent
more
blenders
making
use
of
them
the
palate
opens
very
sour
with
a
blend
of
lemon
and
lactic
acids
biting
sour
cleansing
and
refreshing
the
sourness
segues
into
the
mellow
fruitiness
plums
mild
peach
grapefruit
and
juicy
lemons
the
plum
character
is
delicate
and
ephemeral
with
a
blend
of
sugar
juice
ripe
purple
dandy
pluots
those
are
all
i
have
on
hand
to
compare
to
and
is
most
noticeable
juts
before
the
finish
moderately
funky
though
not
as
strong
as
the
nose
would
suggest
theres
must
mushroom
and
petrichor
medium
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
finishes
long
with
a
blend
of
plum
sweetness
vanilla
sugar
and
grapefruit
peel
excellent
medium
bodied
with
a
really
nice
balance
of
acetic
acid
lactic
funk
earthy
oak
and
sweet
fleshy
dark
fruit
aggressively
sour
and
tart
but
not
harsh
overly
acidic
or
tough
to
drink
really
mellowed
out
by
lactic
funk
earthy
oak
sweet
fruit
and
acetic
vinegar
really
sweet
and
refreshing
wih
light
fruit
apple
and
pear
along
with
musty
bugs
lactic
cheese
and
sweet
plum
flavor
some
dry
earthy
pit
of
the
fruit
but
otherwise
its
really
juicy
and
fleshy
lingeng
acetic
vinegar
in
the
finish
but
not
solvent
like
or
harsh
at
all
the
plum
flavor
really
shows
in
the
finish
and
balances
out
the
sour
and
funky
gueuze
flavors
very
nicely
o
a
good
lambic
that
is
well
balanced
just
as
good
as
their
gueuze
i
know
it
is
pricey
but
i
feel
it
is
worth
and
will
pick
up
more
soon
o
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
fresh
it
really
leans
toward
the
huge
stone
fruit
flavor
and
acidity
over
the
brett
barnyard
and
while
i
obviously
havent
tried
this
one
aged
i
think
the
fruit
really
shines
in
its
current
form
i
cant
see
it
improving
much
absolutely
great
right
now
pours
a
murky
purplishred
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
tiny
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
small
chunks
of
sediment
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
after
the
pour
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
acidic
and
plum
or
other
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
dark
fruit
and
acidic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
there
is
definitely
a
lack
of
carbonation
in
this
375
ml
bottle
which
unfortunately
diminishes
what
has
the
potential
to
be
a
great
beer
overall
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
good
but
its
exceed
those
expectations
these
plums
make
an
amazing
lambic
thanks
again
jeffo
this
beer
ought
only
be
pronounced
with
a
yiddish
accent
anyway
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
halffinger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
lemon
zest
tart
plum
i
had
no
idea
such
a
thing
even
existed
and
a
mild
bit
of
tangerine
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
tartness
coming
on
rather
strongly
and
some
extra
plum
making
an
appearance
near
the
finish
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
especially
for
those
who
like
their
sours
to
live
up
to
that
adjective
with
vim
and
vigor
a
good
beer
not
my
style
but
enjoyable
very
tart
beer
with
a
complex
flavor
the
flat
appearance
is
a
little
turn
off
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
o
this
was
a
fantastic
fruited
lambic
that
was
very
well
done
using
some
of
the
best
lambic
im
definitely
glad
i
picked
up
a
couple
bottles
of
this
despite
the
price
of
16375ml
which
is
on
the
reasonable
end
i
think
this
would
do
well
with
some
age
on
it
bringing
out
the
funk
a
little
bit
more
although
id
say
its
perfect
for
drinking
now
i
figured
locating
this
one
at
a
remotely
reasonable
price
in
the
us
was
unlikely
so
i
was
pleased
to
find
one
at
a
reasonable
price
in
this
landmark
beer
bar
250
grams
of
plums
per
liter
of
lambic
this
impacts
all
aspects
of
the
beer
starting
with
its
deep
orangepink
body
down
to
its
tart
fruity
nose
and
finish
plum
seems
to
be
a
nice
and
possibly
underused
ingredient
in
lambic
due
to
the
nice
balance
of
tartness
and
sweetness
tasty
overall
a
great
lambic
that
will
improve
with
age
but
is
fantastic
to
drink
now
o
despite
the
low
carbonation
this
was
still
an
enjoyable
beer
it
had
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
the
body
lively
and
light
across
the
tongue
overall
terrific
a
lovely
beer
overall
awesome
o
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
great
plum
flavour
tart
and
delicious
overall
a
real
solid
memorable
gueuze
from
these
guys
the
parts
all
fit
they
may
not
be
the
greatest
but
the
all
add
up
to
a
real
impressive
and
very
drinkable
lambic
o
nice
sour
with
a
good
plum
presence
that
helps
cut
the
overall
tartness
taste
is
oaky
and
acidic
characteristic
yeast
from
the
house
barrels
lends
notes
of
damp
forest
floor
and
citrus
plum
pits
and
skins
are
there
not
overpowering
or
overly
assertive
but
theres
a
presence
that
sets
it
apart
from
the
oude
gueuze
plum
is
such
a
sweet
fruit
but
here
its
reduced
to
the
acidity
of
the
fruit
skins
and
the
slight
nuttiness
from
the
pits
overall
it
seems
a
little
more
oaky
than
the
gueuze
somehow
and
the
citrus
character
more
subdued
a
very
enjoyable
and
traditional
fruited
lambic
overall
good
stuff
but
id
like
a
more
distinct
plum
flavor
o
amazing
nearly
perfect
brew
and
i
hope
tilquin
continues
to
experiment
with
different
fruit
i
love
this
but
it
makes
me
want
to
see
what
cantillon
or
drie
fonteinen
could
do
with
plums
overall
good
not
as
good
as
regular
gueuze
high
price
tag
good
once
i
can
very
well
concede
that
i
have
gotten
a
compromised
bottle
and
will
likely
seek
that
out
before
much
more
commentary
on
the
ale
verdict
a
really
nice
lambic
from
tilquin
the
plum
came
across
quite
nicely
and
i
was
lucky
to
get
a
carbed
375ml
bottle
the
body
is
a
bit
heavy
for
a
fruited
lambic
but
overall
this
is
delicious
tangy
for
sure
but
delicious
excellent
beer
i
really
loved
it
worth
whatever
you
see
it
being
sold
for
at
the
store
i
paid
about
16
and
will
have
trouble
not
dropping
30
when
i
see
it
around
manhattan
tilquin
are
delivering
dont
sleep
on
them
if
you
like
lambic
because
they
wont
be
as
readily
available
as
they
are
now
forever
unless
they
price
like
drie
fonteinen
i
suppose
though
maybe
not
even
then
overall
i
love
this
lambic
simple
as
that
cant
wait
to
age
some
o
a
great
fruit
lambic
sour
fruity
funky
its
all
there
the
aroma
is
particularly
stunning
the
flavor
is
still
quite
good
but
is
not
quite
as
balanced
and
complex
as
the
aroma
overall
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
it
didnt
disappoint
i
probably
like
their
gueuze
a
little
better
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
o
this
was
a
damn
good
fruit
lambic
incredibly
sour
and
mouth
puckering
i
was
hoping
the
plums
would
be
a
bit
more
noticeable
but
its
still
a
really
impressive
beer
glad
to
have
a
few
more
bottles
to
age
up
a
bit
pours
an
redorangish
brown
color
probably
a
bit
too
red
for
a
wood
stain
but
it
would
be
a
bright
cherry
pine
kinda
garish
really
no
real
head
were
in
lambic
country
so
normal
rules
do
not
apply
not
that
im
much
of
a
believe
in
appearance
ratings
the
aroma
is
plum
jam
on
top
of
mild
vinegar
and
gueuze
funk
but
the
fruit
is
dominant
the
plum
smell
is
on
the
apricot
end
of
the
plum
world
it
definitely
smells
like
plums
but
theres
a
fair
bit
of
variation
within
plums
this
beer
smells
more
like
what
is
sold
as
fresh
french
prunes
around
here
rather
than
the
juicier
sweettart
santa
rosa
plum
that
i
more
closely
associate
with
the
fruit
though
i
have
no
idea
what
tilquin
actually
used
of
course
the
funk
is
mildly
cheesy
with
some
nice
horse
blanket
tendencies
bouncing
around
its
been
too
long
since
i
used
horse
blanket
in
a
review
the
taste
is
light
to
medium
tart
with
more
of
that
fruit
flavor
its
still
relatively
sweet
and
a
tad
lacking
in
flavor
for
what
i
expect
from
a
plum
sour
but
i
dont
mean
that
as
a
knock
its
just
a
tad
different
than
expected
the
fruit
flavor
is

and
melds
nicely
with

a

quite

it

extremely
smooth
for

especially
considering
the
acidity
overall
a
tremendous
beer
and
im
glad
i
have
more
in
the
cellar
you
know
this
might
be
my
favorite
sour
sweet
plums
fruityfloral
notes
and
plenty
of
leather
must
barnyard
and
funk
in
the
nose
on
the
palate
it
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
light
carbonation
that
adds
to
this
brews
smoothness
plums
dominate
throughout
and
add
a
subtle
balancing
sweetness
to
the
beer
the
plums
drive
this
beer
but
they
shine
because
of
the
subtle
and
gradual
lemony
lactic
acidity
that
culminates
in
the
finish
but
its
not
bitingly
sour
its
light
and
gradual
providing
a
long
sour
finish
this
is
an
absolutely
gorgeous
beer
that
is
beautifully
put
together
all
parts
pair
perfectly
with
each
other
and
make
for
a
crazy
drinkable
lambic
that
is
gloriously
complex
the
beer
poured
a
lovely
pink
color
super
citrusy
taste
almost
like
i
am
drinking
grapefruit
juice
but
without
the
associated
bitterness
i
would
describe
this
as
more
of
a
funky
and
lightly
tart
beer
than
anything
that
was
very
sour
quite
good
and
for
a
citrus
nut
like
myself
very
tasty
overall
phenomenal
overall
this
was
excellent
a
lovely
and
wellmeasured
dose
of
plumb
sweetness
balanced
the
tart
sourness
and
tilquin
acidity
perfectly
this
was
very
complex
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
lambic
to
look
at
as
well
i
should
have
loaded
up
on
this
when
at
tilquin
but
hopefully
i
run
into
more
of
this
at
some
point
well
worth
tracking
down
and
worth
drinking
now
while
fresh
highly
recommended
d
really
unique
stuff
curious
how
it
will
age
a
i
can
imagine
this
getting
quite
sour
in
time
in
any
case
another
great
addition
to
the
lambic
world
by
tilquin
well
worth
checking
out
i
could
easily
drink
a
375ml
bottle
on
my
own
o
im
a
big
fanboy
of
tilquins
regular
gueuze
and
i
have
looked
forward
to
this
one
for
quite
awhile
i
am
not
disappointed
at
all
this
is
an
outstandingly
balanced
fruited
lambic
just
enough
sour
funk
fruit
and
sweetness
to
make
for
an
extremely
enjoyable
experience
go
get
one
of
these
o
its
80
degrees
out
and
theres
nothing
i
would
rather
be
drinking
right
now
so
refreshing
my
only
complaint
would
be
for
more
plum
presence
but
it
would
not
stop
me
from
drinking
this
delicious
beer
highly
recommended
tilquin
is
a
very
undertheradar
blender
at
this
point
however
make
no
mistake
their
beers
are
very
good
and
quetsche
is
no
exception
a
plum
lambic
is
very
unique
and
here
its
done
very
well
the
fruit
is
subtle
but
it
works
and
the
aroma
look
and
feel
round
things
out
nicely
definitely
one
of
the
beer
lambics
ive
had
o
a
nice
brew
with
an
original
fruit
used
there
i
guess
this
will
age
gracefully
hopefully
more
will
be
produced

the

then
finishes
with
a
touch
of
tart
and
big
strawberry
from
start
to
finish
drinkable
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
o
good
for
style
but
could
be
more
complex

a
touch
more

overall
this
is
a

beer
nice
robustness
of
big
strawberry
flavors
with
light
yeast
and
earthy
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
it
really
doesnt
fit
the
lambic
style
profile
very
well
at
all
but
as
a
standard
fruit
beer
it
is
quite
enjoyable
as
long
as
you
dont
mind
the
sweetnesswhich
wasnt
that
bad
in
my
opinion
overall
quite
a
nice
lambic
very
natural
strawberry
fruits
that
arent
as
overly
sweet
as
some
being
balanced
with
earth
malts
and
lemon
citrus
tartness
the
price
being
over
au130
a
case
of
24
2014
is
a
little
prohibitive
however
people
hate
on
timmermans
for
no
reason
i
mean
sure
its
a
level
or
two
below
the
best
of
the
best
lambic
types
but
its
a
very
approachable
version
a
possible
gateway
to
the
real
good
stuff
and
more
widely
available
than
some
of
the
really
special
ones
it
serves
a
role
this
one
is
very
strawberry
heavy
to
the
point
where
the
yeast
and
grains
are
less
detectable
similar
in
that
regard
to
the
framboise
they
do
pale
red
tint
to
the
pour
and
a
nose
of
fresh
strawberry
jam
it
is
very
sweet
which
detracts
from
drinkability
but
the
fruit
is
authentic
if
a
bit
overdone
great
carbonation
cleans
it
up
pretty
well
though
and
in
general
i
like
this
much
better
than
some
of
the
other
common
strawberry
bombs
coming
out
of
belgium
i
think
this
is
a
cool
beer
and
one
that
may
turn
people
on
to
more
tart
and
acidic
traditional
lambics
although
this
one
is
lacking
much
of
that
character
fun
beer
not
world
class
cellaring
beer
thats
okay
sometimes
overall
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
so
the
fact
that
i
found
it
rather
curious
and
i
finished
it
says
a
lot
definitely
liked
it
better
than
i
thought
i
would
worth
a
try
o
really
like
this
my
first
strawberry
lambic
would
go
well
with
fruity
desserts
and
creamy
cheese
complex
and
interesting
one
of
their
better
sours
more
fruit
presence
here
pours
a
hazy
light
reddishorange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
those
cheap
strawberry
candies
strawberry
syrup
and
a
slight
aroma
of
the
strawberry
flavored
medicine
made
for
children
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
strawberry
candy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
slightly
artificial
with
the
strawberry
presence
and
quite
sugary
hmmmm
soso
drinkable
enough
and
the
sweetness
allows
it
to
go
down
easily
but
it
certainly
isnt
a
quality
lambic
the
chunky
sediment
is
rather
vile
smells
nice
if
onedimensional
but
the
flavour
has
some
vague
offnotes
that
detract
from
the
overall
character
the
body
also
has
something
that
isnt
quite
right
a
sort
of
dry
viscosity
that
feels
somehow
artificial
an
ok
brew
if
you
want
something
sweet
and
fruity
but
falls
far
short
of
the
true
potential
of
lambic
overall
this
was
good
my
wife
thought
it
was
excellent
when
i
opened
the
25cl
bottle
i
immediately
smelled
the
strawberries
colour
is
orangy
like
a
regular
gueuze
beer
flavour
is
predominantly
sour
strawberry
flavour
is
there
but
discretely
glad
it
isnt
one
of
those
extremely
sweet
beers
it
is
sour
but
moderately
nice
refreshing
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
just
a
soso
lambic
ive
had
much
better
o
the
big
candy
flavor
is
all
artificial
strawberry
and
there
is
no
malt
or
hops
to
challenge
it
the
carbonation
helps
to
cut
the
sweetness
a
bit
but
it
is
not
enough
smaller
bottle
helps
with
the
enjoyment
have
this
with
some
cheesecake
low
c
o
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
the
beer
is
just
a
little
too
sweet
artificial
for
my
preference
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
sessionable
body
is
medium
effervescence
is
light
just
wafting
across
the
tongue
a
solid
lambic
but
not
a
standout
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
strawberry
cream
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sugar
cream
strawberry
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
had
this
one
a
little
while
back
out
of
the
bottle
and
really
enjoyed
it
however
the
on
draught
version
left
something
to
be
desired
there
was
more
of
an
earthy
note
on
the
nose
that
was
a
little
abrasive
with
all
the
other
aspects
going
on
here
the
flavor
was
very
light
which
made
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
most
enjoyable
thing
i
drank
this
night
i
would
suggest
this
to
a
new
craft
beer
drinker
that
was
a
fan
of
fruit
but
for
the
refined
lambic
drinker
i
wouldnt
bother
with
it
on
tap
taste
calms
the
sweetness
down
and
a
little
bit
of
tartness
and
some
earthy
yeastmalt
comes
out
i
actually
kind
of
like
it
although
admittedly
i
tend
to
like
fruit
beers
from
time
to
time
this
one
is
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
some
and
there
is
a
light
touch
of
funk
underneath
maybe
because
it
is
2
years
old
is
a
welcome
addition
belgiums
finest
limbic
beer
it
is
not
but
a
nice
little
fruit
beer
sure
ill
be
happy
to
quaff
this
again
o
lambics
are
not
my
usual
thing
so
take
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
i
dont
think
this
is
something
id
go
for
again
overall
i
liked
this
beer
the
most
of
all
the
other
fruit
beers
i
had
had
ive
tasted
the
samuel
adams
strawberry
and
raspberry
beers
but
this
one
i
enjoyed
the
most
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
even
right
now
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
can
drink
a
whole
six
pack
if
they
sold
it
in
one
session
recommended
if
you
want
to
try
a
fruit
beer
but
dont
know
where
to
start
the
supersweet
fruit
beers
like
these
are
what
gives
fruited
lambics
and
other
well
made
fruitforward
ales
a
bad
wrap
while
the
beer
tastes
much
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
its
slightly
embarrassing
to
find
it
beside
better
beers
in
the
craft
beer
section
of
the
store
definitely
backsweetened
lots
of
strawberry
flavors
i
may
even
git
a
tiny
hint
of
natural
flavors
i
stand
by
strawberries
and
cream
candied
sugar
sweet
its
like
a
lindemans
lambic
fantastic
dessert
beer
for
sure
but
in
terms
of
lambics
its
missing
any
kind
of
funk
or
acidity
overall
a
very
sweet
and
tart
lambic
that
was
mildly
refreshing
its
a
brew
that
would
be
great

at

but
i
enjoyed
this
glass
overall
a
decent
beer
if
youre
into
strawberry
lambics
otherwise
you
will
probably
not
find
anything
in
here
to
like
m
lively
carbonation
but
a
heftier
mediumthick
body
make
for
a
disturbingly
oxymoronic
mouthfeel
in
this
beer
feels
more
like
a
thicker
cream
soda
in
texture
than
any
beer
ive
ever
had
definitely
not
worth
the
sticker
price
for
me
i
cant
recommend
it
o
this
has
alright
drinkability
it
goes
down
pretty
good
and
has
decent
flavor
it
has
too
much
sweetness
though
really
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
most
of
the
lambics
out
there
it
has
no
sourness
or
funkiness
if
you
want
a
sweet
strawberry
you
have
found
it
my
girlfriend
did
love
it
though
pours
a
ruddy
golden
strawberry
blonde
color
closer
to
the
color
of
the
bottle
than
the
foil
wrapper
i
smell
strawberry
puree
and
taste
something
akin
to
a
strawberry
jammy
flavor
mixed
with
a
basic
belgian
pale
ale
cloyingly
sweet
effervescent
with
a
dry
finish
im
really
not
excited
about
this
and
i
still
have
two
more
bottles
left
wonderful
smell
horrible
taste
cant
recommend
spending
the
money
just
to
smell
it
pass
on
this
one
smells
of
pints
and
pints
of
ripened
fresh
fruit
pours

hazy
garnet
colored
body
with
frothy
whitebutshort
lasting
head
laces
glass
continuosly
tastes
of
tart
strawberry
its
a
liquid
dessert
o
to
call
this
a
lambic
is
a
disgrace
to
the
style
this
poured
out
as
a
pink
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
that
leaves
not
retention
or
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
like
a
strong
slightly
sour
strawberry
soda
very
sweet
taste
here
not
much
of
a
sour
flavor
of
tartness
at
all
in
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bubbly
but
mostly
feels
a
little
watered
down
despite
the
strength
of
the
flavor
overall
its
more
like
strawberry
candy
in
a
glass
or
something
overall
this
is
too
sweet
not
tart
enough
and
just
not
really
good
i
will
buy
some
more
of
the
framboise
for
my
wife
but
will
be
passing
on
this
one
as
with
the
other
timmermans
lambic
that
i
tried
the
framboise
it
is
overly
sweetenedquite
reminiscent
of
strawberry
fruit
snacks
overall
a
bad
representation
of
a
fruit
lambic
with
no
wild
or
tart
characterit
is
entirely
one
dimensional
tasty
but
i
can
get
welchs
strawberry
soda
for
a
fraction
of
the
price
poured
into
a
tulip
snifter

color

aroma
filled
up
the
whole
side
of
the
bar
with
sweet
and
sour
strawberries
in
the
taste
good
fresh
strawberry
flavor
and
a
small
tartness
semisweet
upfront
greeted
by
a
nice
restrained
sour
tang
of
wild
yeast
funk
has
all
the
trademarks
of
a
good
fruit
lambic
mild
sour
complimentary
fruit
mildly
effervescent
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
was
happy
with
this
little
find
a
decent
lambic
if
you
dig
strawberry
which
i
do
the
first
sip
was
the
best
it
all
went
down
hill
from
there
it
is
light
and
heavily
carbonated
on
the
palate
and
sweet
very
sweet
with
a
lot
of
fruit
but
the
more
i
drank
the
dryer
it
got
the
dryer
it
got
the
more
sulfur
and
cloying
it
got
by
the
end
i
regretted
this
experiment
and
my
sweet
tooth
i
wont
bother
having
it
again
5
a
bottle
cant
recommend
it
unless
you
just
like
to
smell
beers
taste
is
light
sweet
strawberry
up
front
with
light
rustic
earthy
yeasty
character
underneath
and
a
juicy
lively
zesty
light
tartness
its
dryish
not
overly
sweet
crisp
and
zesty
but
the
character
is
all
a
bit
light
and
subdued
and
there
is
not
enough
lambic
rustic
character
for
me
i
really
had
no
clue
what
to
expect
going
into
this
beer
it
was
an
interesting
lambic
but
really
sweet
and
artificial
tasting
for
my
likings
my
girlfriend
felt
the
same
way
its
nothing
id
order
again
thanks
to
schmittymack
for
bringing
this
one
over
a
couple
weeks
back
poured
a
light
brown
color
with
a
head
a
shade
or
so
lighter
aromas
of
artificial
strawberry
mostly
some
sweetness
and
candy
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
bodied
and
unimpressive
with
syrupy
sweet
artificial
strawberry
and
candy
sweetness
strawberry
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
both
dominated
by
sour
strawberries
it
reminds
me
of
a
nonalcoholic
strawberry
daiquri
something
that
is
best
suited
for
the
warmer
months
i
would
buy
again
but
not
at
10
dollars
for
11
ounces
i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
if
you
like
lambics
opinion
this
is
an
alright
malt
beverage
but
it
is
much
more
foofoo
than
any
beer
that
i
would
like
to
consume
regularly
i
mean
there
was
no
yeast
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
is
a
commercialized
lambic
beer
if
i
ever
saw
one
and
may
be
a
good
starter
beer
because
it
is
a
whole
lot
better
than
the
cranberry
lambic
that
boston
brewing
makes
but
that
isnt
saying
much
as
it
is
horrible
too
i
personally
will
stick
with
cantillon
and
the
likes
and
leave
this
for
the
ladies
or
newbie
beer
geeks
this
is
terrible
stuff
disgustingly
sugary
with
nothing
else
of
quality
to
round
it
out
or
otherwise
make
it
worthwhile
the
label
dubs
it
belgiums
finest
lambic
beer
bunk
more
than
half
the
bottle
went
down
the
drain
a
bad
interpretation
of
a
lambic
that
does
not
taste
like
a
lambic
far
too
sweet
i
could
not
drink
this
drinkability
not
the
best
taste
but
very
refreshing
would
drink
again
but
i
would
rather
drink
a
lindemans
basically
a
soda
pop
with
a
very
low
abv
amp
up
the
beer
qualities
a
bit
and
this
may
score
somewhat
higher
still
for
a
sodapop
its
a
pretty
enjoyable
sodapop
im
ok
with
stuff
like
this
because
a
ladies
who
dont
like
beer
often
like
this
stuff
and
b
even
i
cant
drink
saint
lamvinus
everyday
pours
translucent
pale
red
with
a
white
head
it
smells
like
a
strawberry
pie
taste
is
like
strawberries
but
weaker
then
i
was
expecting
also
less
sweet
which
in
some
ways
makes
it
have
more
in
common
with
other
beers
compared
with
most
lambics
the
beer
is
also
pretty
smooth
its
a
good
beer
to
sip
verdict
not
worth
searching
for
on
its
own
merits
and
the
price
pushes
it
further
into
the
dont
bother
category
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
offer
a
lot
of
complexity
youll
probably
get
bored
with
this
beer
pretty
easily
if
you
dont
do
much
tasting
d
the
beer
wasnt
too
difficult
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
that
i
would
try
another
one
of
these
ive
had
a
small
eye
on
this
for
a
while
now
but
was
never
able
to
pull
the
trigger
lets
see
how
it
goes
shall
we
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
topped
by
a
finger
of
nearly
white
foam
the
nose
is
unsurprisingly
strawberryheavy
resembling
very
closely
the
strawberry
syrup
i
used
to
put
on
my
pigsinblankets
back
in
the
day
sweetness
included
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
the
sweetness
is
partially
cut
by
a
lowlying
tartness
akin
to
real
strawberries
the
body
is
a
heftyfeeling
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
sticky
finish
overall
a
decent
little
fruit
lambic
but
nothing
i
can
really
rave
about
by
any
sense
of
the
imagination
pretty
tasty
if
youre
into
the
strawberries
though
18
month
old
bottle
d
this
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
perhaps
best
used
as
a
dessert
beer
or
aperitif
drinkability
i
wouldnt
exactly
describe
timmermans
craft
as
haunting
for
a
lambic
is
below
average
not
at
all
sour
lighter
tasting
pumpkin
lambic
not
too
sweet
some
spice
notes
present
decent
not
great
bottle
pour
murky
copper
color
with
small
head
aromas
are
of
apple
pie
with

and
a
little
allspice
flavor
is
slightly
tart
pumpkin
biscuitpie
crust
esters
smooth
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
overall
interesting
stuff
its
enjoyable
but
tastes
more
like
a
spiced
cider
than
a
beer
and
if
it
wasnt
printed
on
the
label
i
would
never
have
guessed
that
theres
any
lambic
component
to
this
whatsoever
light
brown
to
copper
in
color
and
slightly
hazy
in
appearance
no
head
is
present
lots
of
cinnamon
and
some
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
packed
with
cinnamon
and
some
pumpkin
pie
spice
its
over
spiced
and
cloyingly
sweet
the
mouth
is
massively
carbonated
and
sticky
great
amber
color
with
a
floral
aroma
not
much
pumpkin
flavor
but
has
an
impressive
white
head
overall
a
good
beer
oas
a
pumpkin
beer
good
as
a
lambic
meh
but
i
like
pumpkin
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
o
an
unusual
pumpkin
ale
worth
trying
pours
up
a
hazy
yet
brilliant
copper
with
a
big
bubbly
white
crown
not
gettin
a
whole
lotta
aroma
some
spicy
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
tart
red
apples
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
get
pumpkin
and
mild
pumpkin
spice
in
the
finish
mildly
acidic
nice
lingering
sticky
sweetness
in
the
finish
also
crispy
carbo
medium
bodied
a
very
linear
brew
straight
to
the
point
and
not
too
complex
pretty
solid
an
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
light
fruity
brew
from
the
750
ml
belgian
bottle
purchased
at
bottlecraft
north
park
thanks
to
aaron
for
sharing
this
one
an
interesting
take
on
the
lambic
style
i
hadnt
thought
of
the
appearance
was
a
dark
orange
almost
red
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
was
full
of
bright
fruit
such
as
raspberry
but
also
a
lot
of
pumpkin
as
well
the
taste
started
with
a
lot
of
pumpkin
and
finished
with
a
tart
finish
quite
tasty
feels
like
a
weak
pumpkin
beer
like
the
base
beer
doesnt
quite
match
the
style
but
the
pie
spice
has
been
thrown
in
as
an
afterthought
quite
soft
drinkesque
i
am
not
one
to
say
that
i
would
jump
off
a
cliff
to
gt
a
bottle
of
this
but
it
was
still
very
enjoyable
and
i
could
see
myself
with
another
glass
in
hand
when
this
one
comes
around
again
seeing
as
i
am
fairly
new
to
lambics
only
having
a
few
of
the
kriek
and
framboise
styles
i
did
not
have
a
lot
to
compare
this
to
for
me
this
was
a
very
tasty
experimental
beer
we
will
see
if
anyone
else
releases
a
pumpkin
lambic
way
to
go
timmermans
for
creating
something
new
here
this
ones
been
sitting
around
since
halloween
might
as
well
try
it
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
small
instafade
off
white
colored
head
smell
light
pumpkin
pie
aroma
mild
fruity
tartness
taste
green
apple
spice
cookie
sour
candy
dont
get
any
pumpkin
but
the
tartness
is
refreshing
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
high
on
carbonation
like
sparkling
cider
buuurp
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
but
its
not
bad
poured
from
corked
750
ml
bottle
into
a
wine
glasses
o
kind
of
an
odd
beer
and
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
its
kind
of
like
drinking
a
sour
pumpkin
pie
it
isnt
terrible
but
it
definitely
isnt
for
everybody
nice
clean
refreshing
taste
with
dominant
cinnamon
flavor
followed
by
a
little
nutmeg
and
cloves
slightly
sweet
with
some
sour
also
nice
orange
amber
color
did
not
detect
much
pumpkin
flavor
at
all
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
flavor
good
to
try
once
a
year
for
the
holidays
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
large
foamy
creamcolored
head
that
settles
after
a
bit
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
lovely
clear
red
amber
aroma
is
super
mild
bare
tart
and
spice
flavors
like
nose
with
all
qualities
magnified
chiefly
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
some
tang
dry
body
is
fairly
thin
and
carbonation
ok
finish
is
like
flavor
average
length
not
up
to
timmermans
usual
standards
pours
a
pale
orange
with
minark
head
nose
starts
with
earthy
notes
followed
by
pumpkin
flesh
and
some
sweet
notes
honey
and
light
vinegar
taste
starts
with
pumpkin
and
spices
this
is
followed
up
by
a
bit
of
honey
and
sweetness
this
lambic
definitely
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
of
things
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervesnt
overall
interesting
but
light
in
flavors
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
that
fell
a
little
flat
of
greatness
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
so
unique
it
is
hard
to
rate
if
you
are
expecting
something
along
the
lines
of
good
gourd
or
pumpking
with
an
emphasis
on
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
than
youll
be
disappointed
this
is
exactly
what
it
sais
it
is
a
pumpkin
lamibic
with
equal
hints
of
spicy
sweet
pumpkin
and
hints
of
sour
this
sour
pumpkin
ale
is
a
beautiful
exploration
of
what
can
be
but
this
varietys
oversweetened
fruitiness
lands
it
with
a
sense
of
overdoing
it
it
just
becomes
a
bit
too
sweet
however
i
do
think
that
this
level
of
sweetness
is
necessary
to
allow
the
slimmest
tinge
of
pumpkin
aroma
and
flavor
to
annunciate
o
well
as
im
sure
ive
mentioned
it
is
interesting
i
like
the
idea
and
its
brewed
well
the
pumpkin
and
apple
cider
combination
is
ok
but
not
great
its
a
little
pricey
so
if
you
dont
think
youd
like
the
combination
it
might
not
be
worth
it
id
been
curious
for
a
while
so
i
went
for
it
not
blown
away
but
definitely
not
a
drain
pour
m
lighter
side
of
medium
highly
carbonated
i
really
like
that
this
is
nicely
balanced
easy
drinking
and
not
a
giant
sugary
sweet
mess
i
think
this
might
be
my
pumpkin
beer
of
choice
for
the
year
we
may
have
a
new
champion
overall
only
just
okay
its
very
sweet
indeed
and
a
little
sickly
which
really
harms
the
drinkability
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
acidity
is
very
much
tamed
and
dumbeddown
and
the
pumpkin
is
almost
just
an
afterthought
its
like
the
particular
flavoured
syrup
that
happens
to
have
been
put
into
this
starbucks
lambiclite
being
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
when
i
saw
this
pumpkin
lambic
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
this
beer
proves
that
price
does
not
correlate
with
greatness
the
appearance
was
excellent
a
dark
orange
brown
with
frothy
head
unfortunately
after
that
everything
fell
off
the
cliff
the
aroma
was
similar
to
martinellis
sparkling
cider
with
maraschino
cherries
there
were
subtle
notes
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
but
nothing
like
a
good
framboise
the
taste
was
even
more
disappointing
very
little
sweetness
watery
sour
apple
peels
and
hints
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
considering
the
high
price
i
really
felt
cheated
where
is
the
pumpkin
wheres
my
pumpkin
sweet
and
loaded
with
apple
taste
like
a
lindemans
3
5
d
i
never
know
what
to
make
of
sweetened
lambics
but
they
always
taste
good
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
soft
drink
half
the
time
but
i
guess
its
not
so
bad
hm
definitely
pretty
different
but
definitely
still
tasty
i
kept
battling
in
my
mind
whether
this
was
more
of
a
regular
pumpkin
ale
or
more
of
a
lambic
and
by
the
end
i
still
dont
think
ive
decided
its
got
characteristics
of
both
but
just
maybe
not
enough
of
the
lambic
qualities
had
this
been
a
little
more
tart
it
might
be
a
different
story

very

really
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
overall
its
interesting
like
a
gingerbread
sour
i
did
like
it
a
bit
better
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
the
bottle
was
more
musty
and
subdued
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
above
average
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
the
sugary
fruits
dominated
a
little
too
much
a
little
more
of
a
funky
sour
lambic
presence
could
have
really
helped
balance
it
out
it
was
a
pretty
unique
and
interesting
beer
overall
though
i
think
they
also
could
have
labeled
it
apple
pie
instead
of
pumpkin
and
nobody
would
think
it
odd
o
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
one
that
i
am
glad
i
decided
to
pick
up
and
try
there
is
a
little
too
much
applepear
cider
flavorsaromas
in
it
to
be
great
but
definitely
worth
trying
in
my
opinion
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
combination
apple
and
pumpkin
pie
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
a
little
like
apple
pie
and
pumpkin
pie

kickbacks

very
slight
horse
blanket
in
the
distant
back
ground
taste
is
very
ciderlike
with
again
i
suppose
a
faint
pumkin
flavor
honestly
the
beer
tastes
more
like
a
cider
than
a
lambic
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
but
totally
unexpected
the
feel
is
pretty
fluffy
and
nicely
crisp
in
a
body
that
manages
medium
though
it
threatens
thinness
the
flow
keeps
up
though
and
the
carbonation
almost
builds
up
the
body
picked
up
a
bottle
at
ricks
in
alexandria
served
in
a
tumbler
on
thanksgiving
nose
is
somewhat
acidic
with
quite
a
bit
of
spice
the
flavor
is
overwhelming
spice
loads
of
pumpkin
pie
and
a
bit
cidery
as
well
cider
component
really
comes
out
as
it
warms
with
the
spicecider
combo
making
it
taste
like
liquid
apple
jacks
not
a
fan
o
this
made
a
great
dessert
beer
after
my
entree
of
quail
not
very
strong
in
the
pumpkin
but
very
enjoyable
overall
a
success
from
the
worlds
oldest
lambic
brewery
the
pumpkin
was
soft
and
let
the
other
flavors
come
out
more
this
is
an
oddity
of
a
beer
its
not
really
pumpkin
and
its
not
really
a
tart
lambic
as
long
as
youre
not
expecting
that
and
why
would
you
given
the
name
ugghhh
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
id
love
to
have
this
one
with
a
hearty
feast
i
think
it
would
pair
nicely
overall
as
i
said
not
much
pumpkin
but
plays
like
a
cinnamon
spiced
apple
cider
i
can
dig
it
not
your
typical
pumpkin
beer
and
a
beer
that
could
easily
been
a
disaster
gives
somewhat
complex
and
interesting
flavors
this
missed
the
mark
for
me
after
a
ton
of
anicipation
i
thought
this
would
be
a
fusion
of
two
great
styles
but
instead
it
seems
to
take
the
worst
elements
of
both
rather
than
the
best
opened
with
the
thanksgiving
feast
more
sober
than
i
usually
am
at
that
time
it
pours
a
light
hazy
orange
color
a
little
dull
with
an
inch
of
white
bubbly
froth
the
nose
is
both
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
less
funk
or
sour
than
i
was
hoping
for
as
call
i
can
really
smell
is
the
spice
profile
usually
associated
with
a
pumpkin
beer
flavor
is
really
odd
and
not
totally
nice
theres
some
allspice
and
clove
up
front
with
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
but
then
a
tart
yeast
comes
in
making
the
whole
thing
seem
off
its
almost
vinegary
which
doesnt
compliment
the
fall
flavors
or
aromas
at
all
and
then
the
sugar
comes
back
in
the
finish
making
for
one
strange
ride
nobody
who
i
shared
this
with
hated
it
but
we
all
thought
it
was
a
let
down
thin
body
effervescent
carbonation
low
alcohol
and
just
something
flat
out
off
i
dont
know
as
far
as
the
style
goes
i
thought
the
jolly
pumpkin
version
did
a
much
better
job
but
maybe
these
two
styles
of
beer
are
incompatible
after
all
pours
a
hazy
deep
orangeish
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
sourness
with
a
note
of
spice
in
the
taste
sweet
fruitiness
a
mellow
spice
and
a
small
tartness
a
small
spice
like
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
spice
and
a
small
tart
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
sweet
but
interestingly
different
overall
i
was
excited
to
try
this
when
i
saw
it
for
sale
but
it
falls
into
the
category
of
sweetened
lambics
and
just
is
not
that
interesting
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
latticework
of
lace
forms
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
some
apple
cider
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
but
only
mildly
sour
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
isnt
all
that
sour
and
doesnt
really
have
any
real
pumpkin
aromas
or
flavors
i
had
to
muck
with
the
appearance
rating
to
get
the
letter
grade
i
wanted
please
see
my
profile
for
more
information
about
my
ratings
system
beer
is
at
first
quite
gourdy
with
big
pumpkin
up
front
dry
finish
second
taste
is
all
tart
and
then
on
out
it
is
just
tart
i
dont
think
i
like
it
and
i
wont
have
it
again
but
i
dont
regret
drinking
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
the
words
cinnamon
lambic
were
used
by
more
than
one
person
the
pumpkin
was
overshadowed
a
bit
but
i
liked
the
beer
the
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
mediumlevel
amount
of
carbonation
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
though
carbonated
enough
to
produce
a
slightly
creamy
or
softbubbly
effect
at
times
this
is
a
bit
thin
or
watery
across
the
palate
and
a
bit
dissastisfying
as
a
result
closes
slightly
dry
mostly
wet
which
likely
arises
from
lack
of
acidity
in
the
beer
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
glass
pours
a
medium
pumpkin
amber
with
a
fine
offwhite
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
looks
nice
compelling
aroma
of
light
pumpkin
lambic
yeast
and
seasonal
spices
peppery
initial
flavor
is
pleasantly
sharp
and
spicy
mostly
from
carbonation
developing
into
sweet
sour
apple
pumpkin
and
pie
spices
especially
cinnamon
finishes
with
spice
bitterness
and
light
tart
apple
light
bodied
as
appropriate
with
active
and
spicy
carbonation
a
very
nice
refreshing
light
sparkling
lambic
with
a
nice
seasonal
combination
of
flavors
surprisingly
bright
flavors
for
the
low
abv
not
going
back
to
the
well
on
this
one
for
sure
o
like
most
sweetened
lambics
this
has
very
little
relation
to
a
traditional
lambic
it
does
work
as
a
nice
fall
dessert
beer
that
isnt
too
heavy
and
i
have
to
give
it
to
timmermans
for
being
unique
not
worth
the
money
though
imo
as
its
closer
to
a
thin
bodied
pumpkin
spice
ale
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
very
tealike
with
earthy
natural
tasting
cinnamon
flavoring
and
a
bit
of
pumpkin
i
am
having
a
very
difficult
time
putting
down
a
fair
reviewing
score
here
as
a
lambic
this
is
a
bit
of
a
failure
as
a
pumpkin
brew
it
is
ok
however
it
was
overall
super
unique
and
enjoyable
just
much
different
from
what
might
expext
from
the
description
im
glad
i
only
paid
a
few
bucks
to
try
this
on
draft
rather
than
a
handful
of
money
for
a
big
bottle
that
i
dont
think
i
could
finish
by
myself
the
single
glass
is
hard
enough
to
finish
o
lets
face
itthis
style
of
beer
does
not
sound
particularly
appealing
but
honestly
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
im
not
a
fan
of
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
but
have
enjoyed
this
one
on
multiple
occasions
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
to
celebrate
the
fall
weather
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
big
white
fizzy
head
on
top
the
retention
is
pretty
good
on
this
beer
as
well
as
some
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
look
of
this
is
really
quite
nice
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
subtle
sourness
on
the
nose
but
mostly
dominated
by
spices
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
of
the
beer
actually
reminded
me
more
of
an
apple
spice
more
than
a
pumpkin
spice
the
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
light
it
was
a
little
on
the
warming
side
as
well
overall
it
was
a
good
brew
not
something
i
would
need
to
buy
again
but
it
was
fun
to
try
pours
an
orangetinged
shade
of
amber
mild
haze
a
couple
fingers
of
sticky
white
head
very
good
lacing
id
be
interested
to
know
if
the
coloring
is
natural
id
guess
no
aroma
is
light
mineralish
lambic
funk
overlaid
with
fairly
mild
pumpkin
pie
spicing
nutmeg
cinnamon
tends
toward
the
cider
side
of
lambics
with
little
sourness
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
taste
is
similar
this
is
a
very
light
lambic
and
quite
drinkable
i
guess
its
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
terribly
so
very
mild
pucker
not
too
much
spice
mouthfeel
is
light
with
lots
of
creamy
gentle
bubbles
this
isnt
a
beer
thats
going
to
wow
anyone
but
its
light
and
enjoyable
and
theres
definitely
nothing
wrong
with
that
its
a
fun
little
pumpkin
beer
and
an
interesting
spin
on
lambic
overall
unimpressive
its
hardly
a
lambic
and
has
almost
no
pumpkin
flavor
the
spiced
cider
flavor
is
dominant
and
out
of
place
definitely
passing
on
this
one
in
the
future
d
another
pumpkin
down
pours
dirty
gold
in
body
with
white
bubbly
head
that
forms
a
solid
film
over
top
aroma
of
fruit
tartness
sour
edges
subtle
pumpkin
slides
through
and
some
funkin
spice
whew
thats
tasty
dry
character
with
light
pumpkin
cinnamon
fruit
tart
with
sharpness
reminiscent
of
kiwi
mild
funk
and
goat
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
dry
body
but
some
slickness
is
left
on
the
tongue
very
refreshing
a
lovely
drink
pumpkin
lambicus
pours
out
a
dull
shade
of
faded
orange
with
some
gold
spots
popping
out
the
head
is
minimal
and
barely
makes
a
dent
flat
looking
after
a
minute
or
so
no
stick
on
the
way
down
swirls
dont
even
bring
anything
back
the
smell
is
subtle
pumpkin
with
some
spice
some
buttery
appeal
pale
malt
and
pear
not
really
tart
scented
a
small
pucker
on
the
first
sips
with
some
faint
pumpkin
and
subtle
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
all
very
light
the
buttery
appeal
comes
through
in
the
taste
as
well
with
some
plastic
notes
not
all
together
real
smellingtasting
but
not
all
together
a
horrible
beer
i
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beer
or
anything
fall
seasoned
yet
i
got
through
this
one
ok
the
carb
is
minimal
and
barely
there
and
the
body
is
light
which
aint
all
that
bad
it
just
could
use
more
bubbles
i
think
this
is
a
good
effort
and
with
some
more
years
of
trying
the
same
thing
with
a
strongersturdy
body
timmermans
may
be
on
to
something
here
just
get
rid
of
the
butter
scents

brilliant

with
a

effervescent
white
foam
cap
that
quickly
settles
down
to
about
a
the
raspberries
dominate
the

and
the
balance
of

tends
towards
the
sweet
making
it
easy
to

unremarkable
it
is
just
a
little
too
close
to
soda
pop
overall
very
good
beer
i
dont
really
like
this
style
of
sweet
lambic
but
i
had
the
bottle
to
cook
with
interesting
and
not
as
offputting
as
i
expected
refreshing
and
balanced
lambic
fruit
not
too
sweet
nor
acid
a
bit
juicy
but
amazingly
easy
to
drink
o
delicious
beer
says
its
the
oldest
frambois
lambicus
in
the
world
drank
april
21
in
kunming
china
got
this
one
here
from
one
of
my
2
friends
who
sells
decent
imported
belgian
beers
i
havent
seen
this
beer
elsewhere
in
the
world
even
dare
i
say
belgium
that
i
can
remember
i
think
its
great
but
after
having
cantillon
i
know
this
has
sugar
added
certainly
not
as
much
as
lindemans
which
is
more
commonly
found
here
a
nicely
done
fruit
beer
but
in
the
context
of
other
belgian
framboise
types
its
a
step
below
the
best
pink
in
color
almost
as
much
so
as
the
label
and
very
well
carbonated
the
berries
lend
more
sugar
than
tartness
in
this
incarnation
but
there
is
plenty
of
both
elements
and
just
enough
acid
to
cut
the
sugar
good
use
of
fruit
pale
wheat
malt
almost
isnt
quite
enough
of
a
base
for
this
as
the
fruits
are
really
all
you
can
taste
or
smell
and
the
yeast
is
similarly
uneventful
if
you
are
a
lover
of
a
well
done
fruity
beer
this
could
be
your
choice
but
for
me
i
am
missing
the
other
beer
elements
and
the
snappy
dryness
of
the
best
versions
great
carbonation
though
and
with
such
a
low
alcohol
content
this
is
a
very
sessionable
brew
more
of
a
summer
thing
for
me
but
a
tasty
raspberry
jam
offering
from
timmermans
the
beer
purists
might
mark
it
down
for
its
softdrink
like
taste
but
i
think
its
great
full
of
raspberry
goodness
its
a
nice
contrast
to
the
majority
of
hop
filled
beers
which
i
greatly
enjoy
on
the
market
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
as
it
caters
for
most
tastes
pours
a
hazy
light
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
raspberry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
raspberry
juice
and
raspberry
syrup
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
decent
but
is
more
juicelike
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
nice
lambic
very
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
nothing
special
to
seek
out
but
i
would
definitely
drink
again
o
if
youre
someone
who
is
trying
to
explore
the
world
of
lambicsguezes
then
this
is
worth
a
try
at
least
once
it
is
not
bad
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
and
look
for
this
again
a
little
too
candied
for
my
personal
taste
ive
had
better
more
traditional
lambics
although
timmermans
holds
the
distinction
of
the
oldest
lambic
brewery
in
the
world
for
an
offering
that
is
so
heavy
on
fruity
sweetness
i
think
lindemans
is
a
safer
bet
and
theres
also
cantillon
if
youre
a
connoisseur
that
knows
where
to
look
positives
are
that
its
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
while
maintaining
a
light
body
a
nice
relaxer
after
a
day
at
work
and
mowing
the
lawn
in
the
hot
summer
sun
would
maybe
pair
this
with
a
chocolate
dessert
o
as
far
as
lambics
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
my
250ml
bottle
was
a
nice
dessert
after
dinner
wouldnt
drink
a
second
one
though
the
timmermans
framboise
lambic
was
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
it
had
a
pink
appearance
and
was
murky
the
aroma
smelled
like
fresh
strawberries
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
it
had
a
very
light
and
fruitystrawberry
taste
which
was
very
refreshing
presentation
packaged
in
an
eleven
point
two
ounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
limdemans
lambic
flute
o
this
has
a
nice
real
fruit
flavor
but
the
sweetness
just
overpowers
this
fruit
beer
there
is
a
bit
of
tartness
from
the
raspberries
but
it
is
not
enough
the
fruit
really
gets
to
syrupy
and
a
bit
artificial
in
the
after
taste
its
tough
to
get
through
this
bottle
this
is
my
first
ever
lambic
and
im
definitely
interested
to
try
more
i
found
it
to
be
tasty
and
enticing
to
my
palate
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
theres
no
sourness
that
one
would
typical
expect
in
the
style
it
tastes
good
but
like
a
raspberry
filled
cookie
the
body
is
rich
and
the
carbonation
is
very
low
it
has
a
bit
of
a
soda
feel
to
the
liquid
o
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
not
overly
sweet
or
syrupy
but
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
there
are
others
that
are
less
sweet
and
a
little
more
natural
tasting
overall
kind
of
sweet
without
much
acid
or
any
hint
of
funk
and
so
forth
its
a
fruity
sweet
brew
but
probably
just
a
little
bit
better
than
the
average
id
say
overall
this
is
a
middleoftheroad
raspberry
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
full
complexity
i
like
in
a
lambic
and
its
rather
sweet
decent
but
not
great
bottled

served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
stemmed
tulip
poured
ruby
red
with
a
two
finger
pinkish
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
quickly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
raspberry
earth
sour
and
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
strawberry
cream
sugar
and
subtle
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
fruit
profile
on
this
one
is
the
start
of
the
show
as
it
should
be
for
this
style
this
made
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
the
aroma
was
the
only
downside
on
this
one
as
the
earthy
tone
i
picked
up
on
was
the
true
dominant
factor
definitely
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
was
glad
i
was
able
to
find
and
try
m
highly
fizzy
and
carbonated
soda
pop
texture
to
this
one
tons
of
fizzy
bubbles
dance
on
the
tongue
to
the
point
of
distraction
not
really
worth
the
money
i
spent
on
this
one
unfortunately
overall
this
was
fun
to
drink
but
i
feel
that
i
will
seeking
out
more
complex
lambics
in
the
future
taste
is
lightly
sweettart
raspberry
hints
of
underlying
lambic
yeasty
character
its
not
great
but
its
good
enjoyable
and
with
just
enough
of
a
hint
of
complexity
and
lambic
rusticness
under
the
fruit
to
maintain
interest
and
provide
somewhat
more
wellrounded
character
than
many
which
are
sometimes
too
fruity
and
sweet
overall
a
tasty
framboise
that
favors
sour
over
sweet
i
really
havent
had
much
from
the
style
but
i
will
say
while
not
being
terrible
i
will
not
drink
this
one
again
rather
a
let
down
not
a
terrible
beer
but
one
of
the
weaker
versions
of
the
style
even
lindemans
offerings
are
significantly
more
complex
pours
a
reddish
color
pink
head
and
little
lace
aroma
of
raspberries
sweet
puree
and
a
touch
of
lambic
quality
in
the
taste
bitter
raspberry
mildly
funky
and
finishes
tart
quite
sweet
and
dry
raspberry
lambic
beer
with
a
small
sour
and
loads
of
sweetness
overall
a
decent
brew
went
well
with
a
waffle
for
breakfast
o
was
expecting
more
of
a
sour
here
it
isnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
it
isnt
great
either
poured
out
with
a
rad
looking
cody
to
it
almost
purple
with
a
pink
fizzy
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
funky
and
tart
but
mostly
very
sweet
smelling
the
taste
of
this
has
a
light
tartness
in
the
beginning
that
fades
into
a
sugary
sweet
raspberry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
like
soda
to
me
overall
its
a
decent
brew
in
my
opinion
could
be
better
though
very
much
like
a
fermented
lemonade
not
the
perky
lambic
feeling
i
enjoy
a
beer
disguised
as
cherry
7up
fuck
the
c
reviews
if
you
like
fruit
beers
give
this
one
a
try
this
is
a
pretty
decent
albeit
slightly
undercarbonated
raspberry
soda
with
a
dash
of
alcohol
thrown
in
for
good
times
and
such
however
as
a
raspberry
soda
it
is
rather
overpriced
and
not
of
good
value
in
all
seriousness
this
is
oversweetened
and
so
devoid
of
complexity
that
it
cannot
fairly
be
called
a
lambic
i
would
partake
in
a
second
bottle
without
hesitation
sweetened
lambics
a
guilty
pleasure
12
at
kulminator
o
sugary
sweet
and
too
highly
carbonated
not
a
very
good
or
traditional
lambic
o
if
i
drank
even
2
of
these
id
most
likely
wake
of
with
a
massive
hangover
from
the
amount
of
sugar
thats
probably
in
these
things
it
reminds
me
of
any
commercial
sugarenergy
drink
and
alcohol
product
nothing
tasty
kinda
a
girly
drink
a
little
but
that
might
be
why
the
can
and
bottle
were
bright
fucking
pink
well
then
if
youre
looking
for
a
more
authentic
version
look
for
oud
beersel
cantillon
drei
fonteneine
boon
or
elsewhere
o
decent
enough
beer
to
try
out
havent
had
too
much
experience
with
lambics
i
would
drink
this
again
its
pretty
nice
head
and
lacing
this
beer
is
sour
as
all
get
out
fruity
but
theres
also
a
bitterness
that
takes
a
good
hold
of
the
palate
light
mouthfeel
and
ample
carbonation
as
with
many
other
lambics
and
fruitveg
beers
before
or
after
a
meal
is
where
this
one
belongs
overall
pretty
damn
tasty
and
im
glad
my
girlfriend
let
me
try
some
i
cannot
really
consider
this
a
lambic
as
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
entirely
fruitjuicy
raspberry
juice
not
terribly
sweet
or
tart
but
slightly
carbonated
is
all
that
this
beer
is
evocative
of
decidely
nonbeery
however
it
is
a
refreshing
fruit
malt
beverage
so
i
can
drink
it
pours
a
clean
deep
reddish
color
with
a
pink
head
in
the
aroma
dry
and
tart
sugary
raspberry
in
the
taste
small
tart
to
sugary
raspberry
and
a
bit
syrupy
a
sour
like
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
sugary
fruity
raspberry
in
the
aftertaste
too
syrupy
more
sugary
than
sour
almost
too
americanized
a
summer
drink
for
the
women
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
being
the
bear
of
a
man
i
am
may
be
a
lie
a
nice
change
of
pace
just
not
as
wellrounded
as
a
lindemans
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
well
im
a
little
torn
it
tastes
really
good
but
it
doesnt
bring
any
of
the
expected
funk
element
to
the
lambic
like
i
was
hoping
super
flavorful
and
a
bit
like
drinking
a
real
sugary
and
over
flavored
soda
it
was
fairly
refreshing
but
seems
to
lack
the
craftsmanship
that
i
appreciate
from
the
brewers
of
the
style
that
seem
to
do
it
so
much
better
definitely
worth
trying
though
medium
bodied
medium
effervescence
with
a
fairly
clean
finish
which
kind
of
annoys
me
more
aftertaste
is
desired
decent
but
not
to
the
level
of
lindemans
d
really
drinkable
a
lot
sweeter
than
id
like
though
reminds
me
of
lindemans
fruit
beers
if
you
like
those
youd
probablly
like
this
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
it
unless
i
had
a
serious
sweet
tooth
really
gets
dinged
for
using
the
term
lambic
and
not
really
being
one
d
this
was
average
i
would
base
all
framboise
off
this
one
now
that
i
have
had
it
not
at
all
what
i
was
looking
for
and
a
little
less
than
what
i
had
hoped
for
overall
a
nice
little
brew
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
a
sweet
lambic
for
sure
not
much
if
any
funk
or
sour
flavors
feels
and
tastes
a
tad
watery
definitely
wont
try
this
again
i
prefer
more
authentic
lambics
lindemans
is
about
the
lowest
quality
ill
go
with
a
lambic
and
this
is
way
lower
too
damn
sweet
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
prevents
the
sweetness
from
feeling
syrupy
on
the
palate
im
not
sure
if
i
would
try
this
one
again
because
there
are
fruit
lambics
that
do
not
taste
as
one
dimensional
and
overly
sweet
drinkability
it
seems
almost
as
if
you
were
drinking
a
soda
which
can
be
attributed
to
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
apparent
carbonation
the
raspberry
flavoring
is
strong
but
not
entirely
overpowering
d
just
boring
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
no
reason
to
come
back
poured
a
clear
cranberry
in
color
with
a
medium
sized
light
pink
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
course
heavy
with
the
scent
of
raspberrys
light
bread
malts
and
a
sweet
yeast
it
tasted
sweet
a
loaded
with
raspberry
at
first
then
moved
to
sweetsour
raspberry
flavor
at
the
end
with
the
flavor
only
staying
on
the
tastebuds
a
short
time
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
lively
carbonation
overall
a
nice
and
refreshing
lambic
d
this
is
probably
the
sweetest
beer
that
ive
come
across
by
a
large
margin
not
a
traditional
lambic
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
and
probably
too
sweet
even
to
be
called
a
fruit
beer
if
you
like
excessively
sweet
fruit
soda
this
is
right
up
your
alley
otherwise
avoid
at
all
costs
my
cantillon
glass
almost
feels
tainted
by
this
one
dark
red
body
pillowy
pink
head
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
raspberry
scent
kind
of
sour
taste
is
pretty
much
all
raspberry
pretty
sour
a
bit
of
yeast
note
very
sharp
on
the
tongue
thin
bodied
and
wet
not
really
horrible
but
not
particularly
complex
kinda
tastes
like
a
fruit
soda
the
taste
is
lightly
tart
and
not
overthetop
sweet
has
a
nice
biscuity
base
that
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
norm
for
these
types
of
beers
raspberries
are
prominent
but
not
overbearing
i
actually
think
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
but
neither
falls
in
the
category
of
a
cantillon
puckering
sour
nor
the
sweet
dessert
beer
lambics
kinda
in
the
middle
somewhere
makes
a
delicious
morning
beverage
and
is
soft
on
the
palate
not
exactly
belgiums
finest
lambic
beer
as
the
label
claims
but
i
certainly
am
not
regretting
my
purchase
and
look
forward
to
the
kriek
version
i
have
in
the
fridge
merry
christmas
everyone
poured
a
reddish
purple
with
translucent
ruby
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
almost
no
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
did
have
big
raspberry
notes
that
were
jelly
like
with
tart
sweet
notes
the
taste
was
also
dominated
by
the
raspberries
along
with
the
jelly
character
and
tart
adidic
accents
no
funk
to
speak
of
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
fruity
and
tart
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
but
was
lacking
the
funky
sour
punch
i
expect
from
traditional
lambic
beers
it
tastes
like
raspberry
jello
not
very
good
watery
crappy
wow
im
impressed
so
sweet
and
artificial
it
makes
lindemans
seem
like
a
wellcrafted
lambic
the
beer
pours
a
red
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
strong
and
one
dimensional
i
get
nothing
but
raspberry
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
the
beer
is
very
sweet
and
syrupy
and
heavy
on
the
raspberry
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
may
be
a
traditional
lambic
but
it
has
nothing
in
common
flavor
or
aromawise
with
the
better
versions
of
the
style
most
timmermans
are
fruit
to
a
fault
and
sweet
this
is
neither
and
a
very
poor
representation
of
a
fruit
beer
certainly
better
than
lindemans
so
give
it
a
try
there
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
the
lindemans
type
fruit
lambics
but
this
and
the
strawberry
version
is
just
bad
way
to
much
fake
an
artificial
flavoring
avoid
a
nose
with
a
powerful
scent
of
raspberry
suggesting
the
use
of
a
syrup
it
is
safe
obviously
not
on
this
one
because
the
mouth
is
the
same
ilk
that
is
to
say
strong
on
the
fruity
and
syrupy
but
without
being
saturated
with
sugar
the
lambic
is
discreet
if
not
nonexistent
and
the
omnipresent
scent
of
raspberry
d
you
can
drink
it
about
as
easily
as
koolaid
the
alcohol
isnt
overpowering
but
its
still
there
so
you
have
to
be
pretty
responsible
with
this
one
loved
this
lambic
and
it
is
a
lambic
so
its
not
supposed
to
taste
like
a
traditional
beer
beautiful
color
and
nice
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
perfect
balance
of
fizziness
and
smoothness
raspberry
flavor
and
smell
were
fresh
not
artificial
like
many
lambics
very
nice
tartness
to
break
up
the
sweetness
clean
finish
could
drink
this
one
all
night
it
appeared
much
like
a
wheat
beer
overloaded
with
raspberry
juice
might
look
like
soda
pop
with
a
bright
fizzy
head
that
after
a
few
minutes
reduced
to
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
was
very
very
sweet
raspberry
and
had
some
artificial
characteristics
almost
medicinal
the
taste
was
worse
like
raspberrycherry
cough
syrup
with
a
very
cloying
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
and
even
hard
to
swallow
it
made
my
tongue
feel
funny
and
slick
and
made
the
other
things
i
ate
or
drank
taste
differently
as
well
a
poor
showing
that
should
never
be
called
a
lambic
a
very
drinkable
belgian
fruit
beer
refreshing
and
a
nice
balance
between
the
tartness
of
a
true
lambic
and
the
sickly
sweetness
of
a
beer
pummelled
with
fruit
syrup
it
does
perhaps
err
on
the
side
of
sweetness
and
it
is
quite
effeminate
but
its
undeniably
drinkable
ive
had
far
more
sickly
fruit
beers
d
if
i
would
be
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
soda
and
looking
for
a
substitute
id
definitely
go
for
this
one
but
as
a
beer
it
falls
really
short
its
to
sweet
overly
simplistic
and
quite
boring
after
a
while
its
not
that
it
tastes
awful
or
anything
its
just
not
a
good
beer
a
poor
version
of
the
fruit
lambic
this
is
pleasantly
drinkable
but
its
not
overwhelmingly
good
and
to
be
perfectly
brutally
honest
i
prefer
things
that
taste
like
beer
its
just
a
quirk
of
mine
quite
a
fizzy
beer
but
light
on
the
mouth
in
all
honesty
it
didnt
taste
like
beer
at
all
more
of
a
girly
beer
this
one
i
dont
mind
it
and
could
quite
easily
drink
it
but
its
missing
a
vital
part
that
is
beer
overall
i
think
that
my
senses
were
caught
unaware
and
i
could
only
feel
the
raspberries
all
over
it
aroma
taste
and
finish
it
could
be
refreshing
if
not
for
the
huge
amount
of
sugar
in
short
a
raspberry
soft
drink
first
and
last
very
interesting
results
here
reddish
pinkish
purplish
color
transluscent
with
little
or
no
head
smells
unpleasant
weird
musty
metallic
smell
is
very
unappetizing
tastes
very
yummy
though
good
taste
kills
the
smell
sweet
in
a
raspberry
cream
sort
of
way
raspberries
and
vanilla
sweet
but
more
like
real
fruit
than
a
lot
of
them
nice
spritz
too
not
very
tart
a
fairly
solid
lambic
but
nothin
world
changing
notes
their
claim
of
genuine
lambic
matured
in
oak
barrels
and
brewed
in
the
brussels
region
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
its
missing
the
depth
and
complexity
of
cantillons
rose
de
gambrinus
very
one
dimensional
and
the
raspberries
are
just
overpower
i
assume
that
this
is
just
another
framboise
lambic
tailored
to
the
general
public
a
well
crafted
fruitlambic
not
too
sweet
not
artificial
can
poured
a
bright
pink
beer
with
almost
no

aroma

very
enticing
taste
is
quite
a
letdown
with
some
artificial
flavour
of
raspberry
covering
everything
and
no
tart
sourness
or
acidity
noticeable
this
tastes
more
like
a

then
beer
there
is
no

im
going
to
try
something

sour
for
it
to
be
a
very
good
kriek
ive
definitely
had
a
lot
worse
nb
timmermans
big
sky
but
ive
definitely
had
a
lot
better
too
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
too
thick
sweetness
is
probably
the
right
amount
but
tastes
a
tad
high
prolly
because
i
wanted
more
acidic
tart
sour
and
dry
notes
coming
out
of
it
definitely
the
darker
cherry
variety
low
a
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
with
a
pretty
pink
quilt
smells
fucking
stinks
jesus
anal
farts
diacetyl
feet
popcorn
rotten
corn
and
a
bit
of
pinot
this
is
one
if
not
the
most
offensive
smelling
beers
ive
come
across
just
a
fucking
abomination
of
a
nose
so
scared
to
taste
it
tastes
real
bad
metal
and
fetid
mushrooms
and
rotten
sox
rubbed
on
fungus
infected
ball
sacks
fucking
nasty
hella
dry
and
thin
with
hi
carb
im
repulsed
also
this
one
should
have
winemakers
shakin
in
their
boots
t
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
sweet
but
this
is
tart
as
hell
tons
of
unripe
cherries
and
tannic
cherry
skins
some
notes
of
funk
in
the
background
another
solid
beer
from
alpine
this
is
a
fantastic
north
american
take
on
a
lambic
all
the
right
funk
in
the
right
places
and
a
good
fruit
presence
ultra
dry
as
well
try
this
beer
id
say
its
underrated
here
d
pretty
drinkable
tastes
a
bit
off
but
not
too
bad
the
sour
cherry
flavor
is
nice
just
a
bit
of
cheese
mixed
in
o
im
steadily
losing
faith
in
alpines
ability
to
produce
reliable
barrelaged
beers
this
was
quite
awful
even
at
a
large
party
most
of
the
bottle
was
left
unfinished
o
overall
a
decent
and
interesting
beer
though
not
my
favorite
from
alpine
the
taste
is
nice
and
pretty
much
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
the
nose
is
very
funky
in
a
bluecheese
kind
of
way
which
knocks
it
down
for
me
glad
to
try
it
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
o
seems
the
bottles
have
been
better
then
the
draft
i
enjoyed
the
entire
contents
of
the
bottle
and
went
though
it
with
no
problem
which
is
saying
a
lot
gave
some
to
the
wife
and
she
enjoyed
it
as
well
surprisingly
pleasant
kriek
with
wellbalanced
fruit
flavors
and
tartness
wasnt
expecting
it
to
taste
this
good
based
on
the
aroma
a
decent
beer
id
be
happy
to
revisit
again
in
the
future
beer
is
light
and
very
sweet
definitely
not
a
favorite
of
the
night
and
not
a
repeat
shame
on
me
shame
on
you
pours
a
murky
cherry
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
cherries
and
some
funk
blue
cheese
like
aromas
taste
is
of
very
sour
cherries
and
some
extremely
funky
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
kriek
with
a
weird
smell
but
a
very
nice
taste
pours
a
reddish
purple
with
a
thin
light
pink
head
that
fades
down
into
a
collar
the
nose
carries
some
cherry
juice
and
light
earthiness
to
the
background
somewhat
musty
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
an
odd
creaminess
to
it
along
with
mild
must
and
earth
light
to
medium
body
and
slightly
chewy
not
really
a
bid
fan
whether
as
a
wild
or
just
as
a
fruit
beer
d
a
decent
beer
not
worth
the
price
imho
however
i
realize
it
would
have
a
high
cost
to
produce
a
decent
american
interpretation
of
the
style
but
there
are
significantly
better
options
within
the
style
at
far
more
inexpensive
price
points
o
pretty
average
as
far
as
lambics
go
flavors
are
fine
but
lacking
complexity
quite
mild
on
the
sourness
scale
mfd
crisp
bubbles
dance
across
the
tongue
could
easily
drink
several
glasses
or
bottles
of
this
sour
delicious
osmell
gets
more
complex
as
it
warms
and
becomes
enjoyable
this
beer
is
good
now
and
has
enough
body
to
hold
up
and
add
complexity

time

pours
a
dark
ruby
light
pink
head
not
a
very
big
head
about
a
finger
disappears
into
a
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
nose
is
funky
much
like
provolone
cheese
no
tartness
comes
through
a
bit
of
sweet
cherry
can
be
found
in
the
back
on
the
tongue
it
is
sweet
sweet
cherry
flavor
with
a
hint
of
funk
and
residual
tartness
a
little
vanilla
towards
the
end
the
sour
character
is
not
big
at
all
its
very
subtle
this
allows
the
delicate
cherries
to
shine
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
with
low
carbonation
but
gets
sticky
as
it
warms
up
lasting
flavor
afterwards
awesome
treat
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
due
to
the
fact
that
there
was
only
a
mild
sourness
to
it
so
i
found
it
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
contrast
of
sweet
and
sour
and
layered
flavors
i
could
see
nonbeer
fans
enjoying
this
brew
especially
those
that
prefer
wine
drink
im
not
sure
i
know
who
brought
this
but
i
cant
help
be
thank
them
for
this
retired
beauty
of
a
beer
simple
clean
and
holding
up
well
would
love
to
grab
a
batch
2
if
they
do
one
o
a
fun
surprise
to
try
for
sure
allaround
a
wonderful
beer
my
palate
was
all
kinds
of
shot
when
this
was
consumed
but
it
was
still
quite
memorable
solid
if
unremarkable
wild
ale
from
notes
pours
a
cloudy
light
reddish
amber
with
a
pink
head
aroma
has
lots
of
sour
cherry
pie
flavor
its
sour
and
fruity
with
good
funk
and
a
touch
of
malt
in
the
background
lots
going
on
theres
some
oak
and
acetic
notes
in
there
as
well
taste
has
some
mild
sweetness
that
works
pretty
well
and
a
good
puckery
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonated
and
surprisingly
sour
some
drying
oak
in
the
finish
no
booze
always
good
to
see
more
lower
abv
sours
good
stuff
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
alpine
beer
company
i
always
associate
them
with
ipas
who
knew
theyd
do
such
a
nice
job
with
a
barrelaged
lambic
featuring
wild
yeast
im
honestly
a
bit
shocked
at
how
good
this
is
i
never
tried
it
fresh
perhaps
its
just
improved
over
the
past
three
years
i
dont
know
if
alpine
ever
plans
on
brewing
this
again
but
they
should
strongly
consider
it
very
impressive
o
i
liked
the
flavor
but
it
felt
like
it
was
missing
something
the
cherry
wasnt
over
the
top
nor
was
the
oak
tartness
or
dryness
i
enjoyed
it
though
and
would
drink
again
o
a
nice
surprise
in
a
rather
crazy
tasting
the
sour
really
hits
hard
and
you
can
feel
its
for
a
good
while
after
the
beer
is
a
light
orange
color
and
is
mostly
clear
the
head
is
fairly
thin
and
fades
after
a
few
moments
leaving
faint
traces
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
huge
delectable
scents
of
oak
and
sour
cherries
the
beer
tastes
great
it
is
sour
but
not
puckering
the
aftertaste
is
fleeting
i
do
wish
the
tartness
and
fruit
would
linger
longer
it
is
acetic
but
not
overly
so
i
am
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
an
ok
beer
fairly
enjoyable
and
a
bit
above
average
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
of
this
one
drinkability
although
it
lacks
the
horseblanket
funk
there
is
plenty
of
mouthpuckering
tartness
here
the
oak
is
nicely
done
too
d
tartness
is
kept
in
check
and
balanced
very
drinkable
for
the
style
if
you
dont
know
what
chez
monieux
means
then
shame
on
you
this
is
another
corker
from
the
good
folks
at
alpine
that
should
please
aficionados
of
the
style
to
no
end
i
still
prefer
their
hopblasted
american
ales
but
this
one
is
a
real
treat
that
deserves
to
be
brewed
again
if
abc
decides
not
to
then
chez
monthem
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
wild
ale
to
drink
as
its
not
overly
sour
and
doesnt
have
much
if
any
funk
to
it
that
said
its
not
my
favorite
for
these
reasons
but
serviceable
could
use
more
carbonation
a
gentle
introduction
to
the
style
d
surprisingly
drinkable
drinkability
i
know
this
doesnt
sound
like
the
greatest
endorsement
ever
but
the
beer
is
still
good
just
not
very
lambic
like
its
fairly
fresh
and
fruity
at
times
with
a
slightly
vinous
side
interesting
and
tasty
but
definitely
not
worth
the
price
tag
thanks
much
jack
we
got
this
on
a
recommendation
and
it
turned
out
very
well
a
very
solid
sour
that
i
hope
to
have
again
dnice
and
tart
well
done
a
lambic
made
as
well
as
thier
hoppy
beers
the
accomplished
brewmaster
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
well
done

thanks
to
deuane
for
sharing
a
bottle
of
this
at
his
recent
tasting
party
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
on
32109
poured
into
my
glass
and
appears
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
pinkish
hue
topped
by
barely
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
like
a
huge
bowl
of
vinegar
soaked
tart
sour
cherries
mouth
puckering
pungent
funky
fruity
and
spicy
moderate
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
and
a
dry
dry
finish
for
me
a
sour
beer
such
as
this
is
rather
quenching
but
i
personally
would
never
seek
out
another
glass
in
an
evening
overall
a
very
decent
first
attempt
on
alpines
part
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
other
sours
come
out
of
this
brewery
in
the
future
d
very
good
take
on
the
style
especially
for
their
first
try
while
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
found
this
to
be
nicely
done
and
on
the
mark
d
if
not
as
pricey
id
definitely
have
this
again
and
again
very
interesting
and
unique
lambicstyle
beer
i
dont
think
the
vanilla
from
the
oak
meshes
well
here
but
overall
it
was
well
worth
a
try
drinkable
good
after
taste
smooth
very
little
carbonation
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
18
dollars
paid
for
it
but
meh
3
35
pours
reddish
copper
lots
fo
carbonation
and
a
flat
white
head
vinuous
cherry
nose
some
oak
and
malt
almost
like
a
cherry
cobbler
puckertype
sour
as
opposed
to
the
brettydank
sour
good
blalance
of
the
sour
cherry
and
sweeter
malt
tempered
by
the
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
a
bit
medicinal
at
times
but
not
enough
to
ruin
the
beer
always
a
treat
with
alpine
i
think
i
liked
this
more
than
anyone
else
that
had
it
that
night
lovely
lovely
beer
overall
this
beer
is
great
i
love
it
and
i
wish
i
had
more
it
was
worth
the
wait
way
to
go
alpine
mouthfeel
is
lighter
with
mellow
carbonation
goes
down
easily
enough
just
make
sure
you
have
some
antacids
nearby
a
tasty
interpretation
of
a
kriek
here
but
i
do
agree
that
at
28
it
was
overpriced
a
good
bottle
to
share
and
im
glad
autumnaldave
shared
this
one
with
me
as
i
shared
my
briscoe
notes
from
81308
pours
a
red
hue
with
a
touch
of
white
foam
at
the
top
nose
is
harshly
sour
with
strong
vinegar
tones
real
strong
antiseptic
fragrance
flavor
is
actually
quite
smooth
sour
and
fruity
the
cherries
add
a
nice
touch
to
a
moderately
sour
brew
definite
barnyard
funky
on
there
as
well
i
also
feel
like
i
am
getting
vanilla
here
liquid
is
smooth
and
the
carbonation
is
low
this
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
the
nose
was
advertising
different
but
it
ends
up
being
quite
nice
tastes
clean
bright
light
cherry
strong
carbonation
mies
with
tart
from
cherry
and
lifts
the
beer
off
the
tongue
so
the
finish
dries
almost
an
unripe
cherry
flavor
lactic
tart
is
not
overbearing
mdlight
body
great
summer
quencher
and
good
drinkability
pinkish
yellowish
color
small
white
head
that
unfortunately
doesnt
have
any
pink
shades
fairly
nice
nose
with
hints
of
cherries
as
well
as
some
wood
flavor
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
but
has
some
nice
elements
of
cherry
sourness
and
wood
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
i
like
this
ale
quite
a
bit
pours
a
very
interesting
strawberry
red
color
but
with
very
little
head
what
there
is
fades
almost
immediately
smells
of
tart
cherries
and
a
bit
phenolic
a
touch
of
almond
and
cream
as
well
as
a
bit
of
funk
the
taste
is
amazing
however
bright
bright
cherries
followed
by
some
acetic
qualities
and
some
light
horseblanket
funk
that
then
fades
into
a
beautiful
cherry
cream
flavor
very
pure
tasting
especially
the
fruit
and
the
sour
elements
but
with
just
enough
fruit
to
make
it
interesting
a
bit
of
sweetness
at
the
end
rounds
it
out
and
gives
it
the
slightest
bit
of
cherry
creamsicle
flavor
overall
though
it
is
quite
tart
and
not
sweet
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
pure
and
nicely
sour
very
nice
effort
and
definitely
a
bit
different
from
other
sours
thanks
dave
for
plopping
down
the
for
this
one
it
was
one
i
wanted
to
try
but
had
not
sprung
for
the
body
is
dry
with
a
nice
tart
finish
very
light
carbonation
as
per
style
overall
a
fun
beer
for
the
palate
a
lot
of
hidden
descriptors
to
really
enjoy
the
cherries
real
add
a
depth
to
this
beer
and
as
the
beer
warms
the
wood
characteristic
add
even
more
complexity
and
intensity
that
really
a
fun
beer
to
drink
even
the
wifey
enjoyed
drinkability
amazing
i
can
drink
this
all
night
long
i
rarely
say
this
but
the
hefty
28
is
well
spent
not
over
hyped
at
all
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
year
bottle
courtesy
of
gford217
poured
a
light
red
color
ale
with
a
light
pink
bubbly
head
with
some
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
red
wine
and
tart
notes
with
some
light
sour
cherries
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sour
cherries
with
some
tart
notes
with
loads
of
oak
and
some
red
wine
notes
average
carbonation
with
limited
funk
notes
when
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
the
description
overall
i
though
this
was
easily
drinkable
and
maybe
a
bit
light
for
the
kind
of
beer
it
would
like
to
be
as
much
as
it
pains
my
wallet
i
will
be
seeking
out
another
bottle
of
this
beer
its
worth
it
pours
a
thin
reddish
almost
rosy
pink
color
smell
is
lightly
creamy
butterscotch
and
sour
cherry
taste
is
thin
and
tart
cherries
definitely
shows
sign
of
tartness
but
still
feels
overly
simplistic
like
thin
juice
and
doesnt
have
any
funky
complexity
or
anything
a
certain
amount
of
acidity
and
dryness
in
the
finish
as
well
but
also
has
a
faint
buttery
finish
to
it
perhaps
from
the
diacetyl
too
while
this
wasnt
terrible
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
it
with
or
without
consideration
of
the
price
overall
i
would
have
to
say
this
one
was
excellent
was
it
worth
28
a
bottle
i
am
not
sure
however
i
will
tell
you
this
i
would
most
certainly
buy
another
one
i
think
this
is
something
everyone
should
get
to
try
it
is
rare
to
see
an
american
brewer
but
forth
such
a
quality
effort
in
this
style
and
this
was
simply
outstanding
i
cannot
wait
to
get
to
try
it
again
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
pours
a
clear
dark
pinkish
red
color
with
a
light
rose
head
that
fades
really
fast
the
smell
is
tart
at
first
but
after
that
it
is
big
on
the
sweet
and
sour
cherry
you
get
both
components
but
mostly
a
sour
cherry
smell
the
taste
is
nice
and
moderately
acidic
cherry
there
unmistakably
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
very
light
and
effervescent
i
actually
wouldnt
have
minded
a
fraction
higher
body
on
this
really
a
good
and
interesting
sour
beer
to
drink
not
as
complex
as
i
would
think
but
pretty
straight
forward
as
far
as
acid
cherry
goes
tasty
beer
d
after
the
initial
sip
and
i
was
skeptical
about
paying
27
a
bottle
for
this
good
thing
no
one
i
know
likes
lambics
so
i
had
to
drink
the
entire
bottle
this
gave
me
and
the
beer
some
time
to
warm
up
to
each
other
this
was
a
great
treat
but
probably
a
one
time
deal
for
me
at
the
price
give
it
a
shot
but
share
the
weath
my
only
regret
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
love
to
drink
it
again
but
the
price
is
a
big
setback
around
28
a
bottle
id
say
that
alpine
did
a
good
job
with
this
beer
price
tag
scared
me
at
first
but
i
am
sucker
for
both
alpine
and
lambics
although
at
a
little
over
a
dollar
an
ounce
i
was
still
skeptical
so
that
did
not
help
me
out
in
holding
back
on
this
one
one
of
their
best
brews
yet
probably
would
not
drink
again
for
this
price
but
it
was
awesome
and
i
enjoyed
every
drop
of
my
glass
highly
recommended
good
lambic
overall
but
not
spectacular
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
the
finish
falls
off
pretty
abruptly
otherwise
this
could
have
been
really
good
i
really
like
to
see
another
american
brewer
take
a
shot
at
a
lambic
and
this
is
a
good
first
effort
indeed
that
said
the
28
price
tag
is
a
pretty
steep
price
to
pay
when
there
are
bottles
of
cantillon
kriek
available
for
8
pours
a
stunning
rustic
ruby
with
a
half
finger
faint
pink
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
ring
of
various
sized
bubbles
stickiness
is
just
about
nonexistant
hohum
smell
is
super
funky
a
lot
of
sour
oak
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
i
was
hoping
the
cherry
would
be
strong
but
unfortunately
i
was
let
down
weak
sour
cherries
with
some
cranberry
and
a
grassy
scent
some
pepper
and
spice
tickle
the
nose
as
well
interesting
but
i
could
use
more
cherries
in
the
aroma
funky
cherries
up
front
on
the
tongue
followed
by
vanilla
and
oak
a
strange
combination
of
pepper
and
buttery
biscuits
midway
through
weird
aftertaste
is
a
bit
dry
with
a
touch
of
merlot
leather
and
oak
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
bodied
with
stinging
carbonation
refreshing
for
sure
this
beer
went
down
much
easier
than
i
expected
after
the
first
sip
chez
seems
to
grow
on
me
as
my
tongue
adjusts
to
the
funkiness
not
too
sure
about
the
28
price
tag
but
its
still
a
good
beer
none
the
less
keep
up
the
good
work
alpine
purchased
south
bay
drugs
pharmacy
imperial
beach
ca
notes
very
nice
stuff
definitely
not
a
lambic
not
in
the
traditional
sense
at
least
theres
absolutely
no
funk
here
and
the
sourness
is
quite
tame
this
beer
is
more
comparable
to
russian
rivers
supplication
or
lost
abbeys
red
poppy
this
thing
blew
me
away
really
amazing
beer
d
best
zwanze
in
years
i
was
really
glad
the
event
was
so
lowkey
that
i
was
able
to
have
multiple
glasses
of
this
one
hopefully
i
can
drink
a
bottle
at
the
brewery
in
a
few
months
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
patio
on
a
sunny
fall
day
o
another
great
zwanze
creation
the
cherries
complement
the
base
version
of
iris
very
well
and
it
is
very
drinkable
i
am
really
glad
i
made
the
trip
down
to
try
it
this
year
i
hope
to
try
the
original
version
in
the
future
beer
is
light
in
body
and
bright
on
the
palate
it
is
sour
with
hints
of
fruit
sweetness
but
dry
finish
it
is
super
easy
drinking
and
a
wonderful
not
overly
fruited
beer
i
really
loved
this
beer
serving
type
ontap
burgundy
ruby
body
with
a
small
off
white
collar
that
gradually
receded
to
a
thin
collar
aromas
of
red
wine
huge
oak
presence
musty
funk
basement
light
cherries
as
expected
this
is
lovely
the
unblended
earthy
mineral
qualities
of
iris
are
complemented
by
a
soft
tart
cherry
presence
offering
a
delicate
sweetness
similar
to
a
fine
burgundy
musty
funky
throughout
with
low
carbonation
delicious
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
some
very
nice
stuff
here
but
i
think
the
base
is
also
amazing
without
the
fruit
addition
wonderful
beer
would
love
to
have
it
again
some
time
o
glad
i
was
able
to
enjoy
this
in
belgium
fantastic
blend
with
tons
of
great
sourness
and
bright
fruit
flavors
overall
4

this
is
a
fantastic
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
as
one
might
expect
from
a
hoppy
lambic
aged
on
a
small
amount
of
cherriesthere
are
just
so
many
components
and
its
a
testament
to
the
guys
at
cantillon
that
it
doesnt
become
a
mess
of
a
beer
instead
blending
all
the
various
components
into
seamless
refreshing
beer
o
not
to
be
redundant
but
oh
what
a
treat
i
barely
got
a
ticket
which
makes
this
special
worth
the
early
morning
line
it
is
a
beer
to
be
celebrated
and
the
staff
and
patrons
at
the
holy
grale
in
louisville
made
this
the
case
an
excellent
beer
with
many
characteristics
of
a
kreik
just
delicious
ruby
red
pour
with
a
small
cherry
red
head
big
sour
aroma
of
cherries
flavor
has
a
an
amazing
acidic
sour
cherry
flavor
backed
by
just
a
touch
of
yeast
light
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
great
tart
finish
o
as
i
expected
this
is
a
more
than
solid
beer
very
significant
improvement
on
the
iris
grand
cru
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
here
more
than
anything
else
sour
cherries
dry
hopping
pale
wheat
and
plenty
of
that
cantillon
brewery
funk
that
never
fails
to
remind
me
of
my
visit
to
the
brewery
last
year
ah
memories

overall
really
good
very
glad
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this

a
vast
improvement
over
last
years
zwanze
impressive
pinkish
red
almost
purple
in
appearance
slight
bloom
that
dissipates
quickly
some

very
complex
flavor
profile
definite
notes
of
cherry
lemon
and
slightly
yeasty
flavors
smooth
refreshingly
tart
and
very
drinkable
another
classic
from
what
may
be
the
greatest
brewery
in
the
world
very
nice
lots
of
sourness
and
lots
of
sour
cherries
enjoyed
it
taste
is
like
a
young
kreik
the
cherry
is
in
a
good
spot
but
not
all
that
sour
very
fruity
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
easy
drinker
really
nice
beer
very
happy
to
try
it
not
mind
blowing
but
way
better
than
i
expected
how
can
ya
go
wrong
a
day
of
cantillon

what
you
would

from

creamy

high

interesting
experiment
i
think
successful
o
yes
i
bought
this
one
at

in

brought
it
back
to

i

it
aged
gracefully
and
was
absolutely
delicious

aged
well
at

lambic
in
brussels
this
was
the
2001
vintage
i
see
why
this
is
a
popular
beer
the
brewers
seem
disappointed
that
most
people
prefer
the
more
fruitforward
lou
pepe
versions
but
it
makes
sense
to
me
the
lou
pepe
versions
will
really
make
you
pucker
with
the
sour
fruit
this
one
was
even
better
than
fou

the
most
drinkable
but
yet
complex
sour
i
have
ever
had
massive
raspberry
here
on
a
night
we
tried
fou
foune
st
lam
and
iris
this
was
easily
the
highlight
this
is
not
sweet
or
syrupy
this
has
a
strong
raspberry
flavor
that
is
tight
in
line
with
the
tart
level
and
influence
from
the
barrel
another
home
run
from
cantillon
as
i
finally
get
to
try
more
cantillon
i
seem
to
understand
the
allure
of
sours
more
and
more
this
one
was
so
good
by
far
the
best
framboise
ive
ever
had
its
light
body
is
both
softened
with
carbonation
but
is
also
given
a
sprite
effervescent
that
springs
from
the
tongue
like
brut
champagne
acidity
strips
the
thirst
from
the
palate
and
ushers
in
a
high
rate
of
refreshment
and
drinkability
that
outweighs
its
intense
raspberry
sourness
with
an
afterglow
of
fruit
wheat
cork
and
white
pepper
it
holds
up
with
the
best
of
them

this
one

big
thanks
to
jcvanderbilt
for
the
trade
pours
a
bright
juicy
reddish
pink
with
nice

and
minimal

the
nose
is
unbelievable
full
of
jammy
raspberries
a
hint
of
earth
layers
of
signature
cantillon
funk
a
hint
of
vinegar
and
oak
but
mainly
ripe
fresh
berries
i
could
smell
this
all
day
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
delightful
smell
with
fresh
juicy
berries
waves
of
tartness
which
are
counterbalanced
with
sweetness
each
flavor
pops
as
this
is
the
tastiest
lambic
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
definitely
the
best
of
the
loons
i
have
tried
and
one
that
i
will
have
to
seek
out
again
this
particular
tasting
was
a
fine
bottling
id
love
to
have
easy
access
to
but
not
something
to
write
home
about
a
fruity
tart
and
complex
beer
at
this
age
it
has
a
great
balance
of
fruit
and
lambic
character
the
color
on
this
is
beautiful
bright
red
nice
two
finger
pink
head
smell
of
vibrant
raspberries
some
lemon
a
tad
sour
the
taste
is
right
on
with
the
smell
its
so
good
i
almost
dont
believe
its
real
such
a
great
balance
of
favors
and
the
perfect
amount
of
sour
carbonation
is
nice
tingles
on
the
tongue
but
not
too
much
allowing
you
to
focus
on
the
intense
raspberry
flavor
cant
say
much
more
i
love
it
and
im
gonna
savor
the
rest
of
this
glass
d
would
have
more
often
if
i
could
afford
it
overall
between
lp
kriek
and
lp
fram
the
clear
winner
is
the
framboise
what
a
great
sour
beer
by
cantillion
o
i
was
very
very
impressed
by
this
beer
really
fantastic
framboise
from
cantillon
odelicious
sour
for
all
raspberry
lovers
like
the
balanced
flavors
overall
not
surprisingly
this
is
another
winner
from
cantillon
huge
fresh
jammy
raspberry
with
tartness
and
funk
that
are
strong
enough
to
add
additional
complexity
without
overwhelming
the
fruit
character
best
raspberry
lambic
and
possibly
best
fruit
lambic
of
any
kind
that
ive
had
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
without
a
doubt
the
best
framboise
ive
ever
had
rose
de
gambrinus
is
a
great
beer
and
this
one
is
just
like
rdg
but
on
steroids
an
excellent
beer
in
the
finest
cantillon
style
the
lou
pepe
range
truly
is
the
pinnacle
of
what
they
produce
the
even
rarer
stuff
is
hardly
worth
the
effort
compared
to
this
sublime
product
of
all
the
dozens
of
lambics
ive
reviewed
on
my
home
north
american
turf
none
have
recaptured
and
recalled
the
charm
character
and
cuisine
of
belgium
at
least
those
elements
that
ive
always
taken
away
from
it
better
than
lou
pepe
framboise
each
trip
to
brussels
is
relived
with
every
sip
it
is
a
dazzling
beer
and
easily
one
of
the
more
memorable
ones
ive
tried
o
nice
tart
underripe
raspberry
flavor
profile
with
a
light
and
refreshing
body
rose
colored
head
very
small
bubbles
you
can
hear
the

this

interesting
raspberry
aroma
not
a
big
fruity
nose
but
rather
delicate
masks
the
funky

from
this
2010
vintage
taste
is
certainly
on
the
tart
not
sour
side
pronounced
yet
not
heavy
berry
notes
enough
funk
to
keep
your
interest
nice
balance
with
the
raspberries
mouthfeel
on
the
light
side
delicate
huge
effervescent
mouthfeel
wow
beer
of
the
gods
the
exemplar
of
the
style
overall
a
perfectly
executed
infinitely
drinkable
and
endlessly
complex
framboise
o
overall
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
aroma
was
top
notch
and
the
taste
could
stand
up
to
many
of
the
best
sours
out
there
im
taking
off
a
little
extra
just
because
as
it
warmed
a
bit
past
cellar
temp
which
is
what
it
was
served
at
the
flavor
dropped
off
slightly
and
became
more
vinegary
which
i
dont
necessarily
mind
much
but
it
took
over
the
raspberries
which
i
feel
are
meant
to
be
featured

o
incredible
i
tend
to
prefer
fruited
sours
and
this
might
be
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
the
raspberry
character
is
just
incredible
im
thankful
i
have
another
bottle
o
solid
though
not
exceptional
not
as
fruit
forward
as
i
would
like
but
complex
and
well
integrated
maybe
i
would
prefer
a
fresh
bottle
overall
a
great
example
of
a
framboise
of
a
different
nature
surprising
example
of
what
sweet
and
sour
can
accomplish
in
a
beer
odeasily
my
favorite
framboise
the
depth
of
flavor
is
impeccable
i
was
super
excited
to
try
this
and
it
blew
me
away
a
delicious
beer
must
try
the
other
lou
pepe
brews
o
cantillon
really
knows
oohs
to
make
their
lambics
i
prefer
the
lp
kriek
slightly
over
this
but
both
are
incredible
id
like
to
try
this
with
some
more
age
as
i
think
the
funk
would
come
out
a
bit
more
while
still
blending
nicely
with
the
cherries
not
the
easiest
bottle
to
get
at
least
in
e
us
but
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
can
o
my
first
time
having
this
one
fresh
and
it
was
interesting
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
fruit
than
i
got
from
it
mostly
the
trademark
cantillon
musty
funk
combo
but
that
is
fine
as
well
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
lou
pepes
but
still
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
ruby
red
bright
with
pink
hues
the
lp
framboise
is
beyond
jammy
its
exploding
with
sweet
and
tart
berry
with
a
seedy
finish
acetic
musty
vinegar
moderate
tartness
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
lou
pepes
but
i
think
thats
just
a
style
preference
thing
an
exceptional
framboise
reviewed

overall
what
an
incredible
drinking
experience
this
cantillon
is
worldclass
nearperfection
of
what
a
fruited
funky
sour
should
be
im
thoroughly
excited
to
try
my
lou
pepe
krieks
and
might
even
hang
onto
my
2009
lou
pepe
gueuze
bloody
nice
wonderfully
cheerful
tasty
as
hell
excellent
beer
i
do
believe
i
am
going
to
like
it
here
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
beyond
better
than
rosé
as
it
is
more
complex
while
being
more
fruity
and
brings
out
the
other
flavours
of
the
brewing
process
very
well
still
raspberries
dont
provide
as
much
complexity
as
the
cherries
do
in
the
corresponding
krieks
i
prefer
lou
pepe
kriek
to
this
but
this
is
still
an
absolute
delight
to
drink
overall
this
is
really
nice
lots
of
good
fruit
flavor
with
a
solid
lambic
as
a
base
and
a
full
creamy
feel
to
support
the
show
well
balanced
and
very
flavorful
the
look
was
a
little
lackluster
though
we
can
forgive
that
for
sure
good
stuff
and
well
worth
checking
out
recommended
overall
strong
raspberry
and
not
a
lot
of
lambic
complexity
still
very
nice
high
a
as
someone
who
loves
raspberries
this
is
the
best
cantillon
beer
ive
tried
phenomenal
on
cask
at
moeder
lambic
on
472013
pours
a
beautiful
raspberry
hue
slightly
hazy
in
clarity
with
a
fluffy
cloudlike
light
pink
head
similar
to
the
color
of
cotton
candy
nose
expresses
citrus
rind
cork
and
a
wisp
of
raspberry
essence
at
the
back
taste
consistent
with
nose
no
real
surprises
here
citric
acid
is
very
assertive
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
puckeringly
tart
and
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
overall
a
very
good
fruit
lambic
however
id
like
to
have
had
a
little
more
raspberry
flavor
update
the
following
day
i
opened
the
2008
vintage
bottled
in
2010
this
has
a
deeper
red
color
and
the
raspberry
flavor
is
slightly
fresher
with
a
much
lower
acetic
acid
level
that
did
not
produce
the
wave
of
acidity
i
experienced
with
the
2006
and
is
better
carbonated
with
a
more
champagnelike
mouthfeel
i
could
enjoy
sipping
a
whole
bottle
of
this
vintage
which
is
what
i
am
about
to
do
because
the
2008
vintage
presents
considerably
better
i
have
upgraded
my
earlier
score
to
an
across
the
board
4
75
was
4
5
overall
with
these
beers
one
can
expect
variations
by
vintage
neither
the
lambic
nor
the
fruit
will
be
the
same
and
quality
also
depends
on
cellaring
time
and
conditions
but
2008
is
delicious
now
and
may
be
as
good
as
it
gets
until
i
get
to
try
a
newer
vintage
suffice
to
say
this
is
a
fun
and
lovely
fruit
lambic
at
a
decade
old
theres
still
plenty
of
life
in
this
bottle
a
bottle
which
i
plan
to
finish
on
my
own
tonight
verdict
spectacular
fruited
lambic
from
cantillon
and
my
personal
favorite
of
the
lou
pepe
beers
the
raspberry
is
just
so
fresh
and
juicy
and
doesnt
really
need
any
support
from
other
flavors
to
make
this
a
spectacular
beer
a
great
celebration
of
raspberry
o
this
beer
could
be
great
but
the
overcarbonation
in
this
bottle
is
really
a
problem
making
it
hard
to
serve
and
hard
to
taste
until
some
extended
vigorous
swirling
gets
most
of
the
carbon
dioxide
out
of
solution
the
smell
is
lovely
and
the
taste
is
also
very
appealing
once
you
can
get
to
it
but
the
carbonation
is
just
crazy
pours
a
red
color
with
a
light
pink
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
isnt
very
pleasing
kind
of
like
raspberry
farts
the
taste
is
much
better
im
getting
fruity
vinegar
notes
with
a
very
nice
funk
there
is
an
herbal
note
behind
the
fruit
the
raspberries
are
good
even
after
a
couple
of
years
blistering
sourness
super
puckering
juicy
raspberries
make
your
mouth
water
before
going
completely
bone
dry
nice
and
oaky
explodes
with
fruit
a
fuller
feel
with
a
slight
spritz
of
carbonation
balanced
acidity
and
a
light
hit
of
sharpness
stable
funk
with
soiled
hay
and
washed
rind
farmhouse
cheese
just
the
right
amount
of
nuance
and
equal
parts
sour
fruit
delivery
system
overall
by
far
the
best
bottle
of
lou
pepe
framboise
ive
tried
though
ive
only
had
the
beer
a
few
times
and
mostly
from
older
bottles
this
was
exceptional
with
a
radical
funky
fruit
presence
highly
recommended
o
amazing
beer
worth
getting
i
normally
dont
like
framboises
too
much
but
was
really
surprised
by
this
one
probably
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
it
on
a
clean
palate
liked
it
better
than
the
other
lp
beers
and
glad
i
still
have
a
bottle
left
in
the
cellar
t
nice
snap
of
unripe
raspberrycranberry
tartness
lemon
some
faint
oak
and
a
nice
dryness
on
the
finish
with
some
cherry
skin
absolutely
fantastic
overall
this
is
the
best
of
the
lp
series
for
my
money
though
this
one
isnt
worth
the
infkated
price
over
rose
de
gambrinus
o
a
great
framboise
its
massively
sour
even
for
cantillon
which
i
really
like
this
is
probably
the
oldest
fruit
lambic
ive
had
from
cantillon
who
i
know
recommends
drinking
these
young
but
even
a
few
years
out
this
is
drinking
damn
nicely
o
this
isnt
a
fresh
bottle
but
it
isnt
exactly
old
either
im
glad
the
fruit
component
is
still
bright
plenty
of
funk
in
the
nose
too
awesome
framboise
o
i
like
this
beer
more
and
more
everytime
i
have
it
i
still
think
i
prefer
lou
pepe
kriek
in
terms
of
lou
pepes
but
this
is
light
years
ahead
of
rose
pours
a
clear
redpink
color
14
inch
head
of
a
pink
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
strong
raspberries
tart
yeast
slight
dark
citrus
sour
notes
and
slight
earthiness
fits
the
style
of
a
lambic
fruit
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
low
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
bitterness
tastes
of
raspberries
tartness
pungent
sour
flavors
and
also
a
strong
tang
i
had
a
hard
time
discerning
what
ingredients
caused
the
basic
flavors
i
tasted
but
nonetheless
it
was
an
amazing
brew
overall
very
nice
certainly
not
my
favourite
beer
from
cantillon
but
a
very
good
lambic
i
approve
wholeheartedly
o
range
from
4
0
to
5
0
highlights
included
the
fresh
fruit
of
the
09
the
intense
sourness
of
the
02
and
the
still
wonderful
01
very
fortunate
to
have
been
a
part
of
this
event
thanks
and
happy
bday
mr
b
othis
is
just
about
perfect
for
days
after
drinking
this
youll
be
wanting
it
again
the
bottle
is
best
shared
though
its
so
sweet
beer
pours
a
dark
purplish
ruby
red
with
a
fluffy
pinkishwhite
head
the
smell
is
fantastic
raspberries
stand
out
most
but
theres
a
nice
mix
of
funk
sour
and
oak
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
still
good
but
not
quite
as
impressive
as
the
nose
its
a
bit
simpler
than
i
expected
the
raspberry
flavor
is
great
and
its
quite
sour
but
theres
not
much
funk
or
anything
else
happening
here
its
not
too
sweet
and
comes
off
much
drier
than
its
little
sister
rose
de
gambrinus
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
heavy
carbonation
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
body
here
overall
this
is
another
fine
beer
from
cantillon
but
i
wouldnt
rank
this
up
there
with
the
best
of
their
lambics
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
rose
de
gambrinus
but
of
the
lou
pepe
beers
its
definitely
the
simplest
a
good
fruit
lambic
but
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
this
out
again
given
what
it
costs
o
more
woody
than
fruity
in
this
case
i
prefer
the
lou
pepe
kriek
but
this
is
still
tasty
o
extremely
impressed
at
how
well
this
held
up
saying
i
want
more
of
this
is
obvious
o
very
drinkable
cantillon
pleasure
simply
phenomenal
im
new
to
cantillon
and
to
sours
in
general
but
ive
yet
to
find
a
loon
i
didnt
enjoy
another
hit
medium
body
decent
carbonation
extremely
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
great
example
of
how
delicious
and
unique
a
cantillon
beer
can
be
i
tried
a
small
taste
of
a
2007
bottle
right
before
this
and
the
sourness
had
definitely
become
amplified
from
the
extra
2
years
of
age
othis
wasnt
overally
exciting
for
me
i
am
a
bigger
fan
of
the
regular
version
overall
this
was
good
but
not
great
for
me
at
the
level
of
saint
lamvinous
or
fou
foune
to
be
honest
while
it
is
definitely
still
top
class
i
dont
have
the
urgeneed
to
seek
this
out
again
in
the
future
maybe
the
reputation
expectations
andor
the
awesome
aroma
got
me
too
hyped
up
here
pours
a
simply
gorgeous
razzy
red
really
lovely
cherry
blossom
caps
this
one
nose
carries
more
funk
than
id
anticipated
really
the
earthy
aspect
of
cantillons
arsenal
the
raspberries
come
through
acidic
and
sharp
with
hints
of
vinous
shreds
flavor
carries
surprising
balance
the
tartness
and
buxelles
funk
are
soo
well
balanced
with
generous
bounties
of
raspberries
the
whole
thing
comes
together
and
reminds
me
of
a
freshly
picked
raspberry
during
the
high
sun
of
an
august
day
mixed
with
the
grit
of
a
solid
days
hike
a
little
full
bodied
with
reserved
carbonation
accentuated
the
generous
fruit
endowment
for
the
beer
finish
made
me
want
another
sip
of
the
beer
and
a
gulp
of
ice
cold
water
really
a
step
up
from
the
rose
and
i
appreciate
the
attention
to
detail
here
o
a
light
sweet
symphony
on
the
tongue
makes
me
think
of
strawberries
and
cream
yum
a
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
cmrillo
for
bringing
this
one
out
during
his
own

poured
a
hazy
ruby
red
with
a
one
finger
light
pink
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
tart
funk
and
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
tart
and
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
great
brew
to
be
honest
this
was
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
one
this
one
was
really
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
while
not
being
overly
complicated
this
one
made
great
use
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
present
no
wonder
im
loony
for
these
things
additional
notes
paired
great
with
the
indian
food
as
the
acidity
cut
through
the
creamy
richness
of
the
food
and
as
the
fruit
and
rustic
character
dealt
great
with
the
spicy
floral
character
of
the
food
o
excellent
framboise
would
like
to
try
an
aged
bottle
to
see
where
the
tartness
and
funk
end
up

a
bit
hard
to
justify
the
price
but
good
for
a
special
occasion
like
a
pens
playoff
game
pours
a
murky
red
with
a
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
real
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
sour
and
tart
raspberries
and
some
funky
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
nice
tart
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
this
one
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
i
love
framboise
but
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
framboise
beer
ive
ever
had
my
new
benchmark
for
framboise
lambic
absolutely
wonderful
cheers
arguably
the
most
sour
lou
pepe
in
the
lineup
and
hands
down
the
best
framboise
ive
had
to
date
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
o
what
can
i
say
its
a
lou
pepe
its
great
if
you
can
get
a
bottle
or
two
you
should
is
it
my
favourite
cantillon
no
that
would
probably
be
the
iris
but
this
is
a
great
beer
it
ages
well
it
pairs
well
with
food
and
i
will
never
turn
down
a
glass
this
was
nice
it
had
a
bit
more
of
a
lambic
funkiness
to
it
than
i
expected
but
that
fresh
raspberry
flavor
and
a
lively
body
really
kept
this
energetic
feeling
in
the
taste
and
feel
despite
the
assertiveness
of
the
flavors
at
times
this
is
another
cantillon
well
worth
checking
out
o
overall
a
really
fantastic
beer
and
another
winner
from
cantillon
first
bottle
ive
ever
had
but
the
06
is
drinking
perfect
right
now
i
think
i
prefer
the
lou
pepe
kriek
a
little
more
but
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
buy
this
one
would
love
to
have
it
again
overall
just
awesome
perfect
with
the
eggs
benedict
we
had
for
breakfast
refreshing
sour
just
enough
funk
good
call
on
choosing
this
one
if
i
do
say
so
myself
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
very
high
carbonation
great
mouthfeel
and
spot
on
for
the
style
overall
a
great
fruit
beer
very
sour
all
in
all
but
complex
at
the
same
time
will
definitely
look
to
get
ahold
of
another
bottle
of
this
very
good
better
than
the
rose
de
gambrinus
for
sure
a
solid
framboise
this
blitzes
the
palate
and
mouth
with
both
fruity
sweet
taste
and
very
intense
sour
lactic
infused
flavor
the
acidity
intensifies
as
the
beer
is
held
in
the
mouth
but
there
is
enough
sweetness
in
the
flavor
to
balance
from
the
full
fruity
raspberry
enhancement
the
taste
comes
off
almost
as
bitterspicy
from
the
carbonic
acid
the
high
carbonation
level
provides
there
is
a
puckering
mouth
drying
quality
w
slight
woodiness
and
extra
tart
raspberry
juiciness
as
it
finishes
with
some
residual
berry
but
the
funk
and
bacteria
sour
flavors
linger
into
the
dry
end
simply
a
wonderful
fruit
lambic
not
many
out
there
that
are
this
complex
and
able
to
be
savored
in
the
way
i
found
this
to
be
intense
yet
drinkable
a
true
classic
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
lively
level
of
high
carbonation
that
is
not
overdone
for
being
several
years
old
at
this
point
and
in
the
bottle
for
more
than
a
year
i
found
this
brew
smellingtasting
exceptionally
bright
and
refreshing
i
really
enjoyed
the
other
lou
pepes
both
on
tap
and
in
bottles
when
i
had
them
but
this
came
across
even
more
appealing
to
me
i
need
more
of
this
brew
overall
unbelievable
one
of
the
best
cantillons
ive
had
i
really
dont
know
what
made
this
beer
develop
as
it
did
but
i
now
want
to
go
buy
a
ton
of
this
and
sit
on
them
for
years
to
hope
they
become
as
they
did
here
i
will
admit
despite
it
only
being
5
abv
i
dont
know
if
i
could
finish
a
bottle
of
this
myself
because
it
was
so
tart
and
acidic
but
wow
very
impressed
with
this
one
o
awesome
beer
my
first
framboise
and
what
a
great
one
ill
be
locating
some
more
asap
bottle
fing
semi
old
bottle
cork
04
date
pours
a
rich
red
color
with
a
light
pink
head
the
smell
is
a
pungent
musty
dusty
raspberry
the
smell
is
either
really
good
cheese
or
really
bad
meat
tanic
and
basement
like
the
taste
is
very
funky
and
intense
acidic
lemon
funk
and
fruit
really
glad
i
got
to
taste
this
the
sourness
sticks
around
for
a
while
after
your
finish
your
drink
d
really
solid
framboise
even
with
age
on
it
the
raspberries
popped
like
crazy
i
really
enjoyed
the
added
level
of
citric
tones
and
subtle
hints
of
funk
thrown
behind
the
raspberries
this
makes
we
want
to
try
the
other
lou
pepes
that
much
more
o
i
am
in
ore
of
cantillon
for
producing
beers
like
this
with
such
incredible
depth
and
flavour
i
was
a
bit
put
off
initially
by
the
nose
profile
but
lying
behind
it
is
a
delicious
drinkable
and
complex
beer
i
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
overall
an
outstanding
beer
top
notch
overall
i
am
a
sucker
for
good
raspberry
sours
and
this
is
probably
my
favorite
one
at
this
point
simply
fantastic
i
would
like
to
always
have
this
in
my
fridge
and
my
future
beer
purchases
will
probably
reflect
that
desire

recently
had
the
2008
version
and
i
enjoyed
the
freshness
of
the
beer
more
so
than
the
aged
version
love
the
fresh
raspberries
that
come
out
really
easy
drinking
nice
tartness
and
funk

1
word
amazing
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
it
was
amazingly
sour
and
tart
so
mouthwatering
a
very
well
done
beer
cantiloon
has
done
it
again
o
i
thought
both
2001
and
2002
were
pretty
close
taste
wise
i
didnt
prefer
one
over
the
other
both
were
excellent
ill
have
to
open
a
more
recent
vintage
and
compare
a
musttry
overall
as
full
a
drinking
experience
as
you
expect
from
aged
cantillon
excellent
beer
im
still
a
little
confused
by
the
style
but
im
enjoying
this
learning
experience
o
crazy
sour
and
very
dry
but
somehow
extremely
drinkable
in
the
only
way
a
cantillon
beer
can
no
one
does
it
better
thanks
again
for
sharing
chad
yes
lovely
the
fruit
is
just
right
in
this
one
and
the
cantillon
acidity
is
slightly
more
restrained
gorgeous
o
cantillon
gives
me
an
interesting
framboise
but
not
one
thats
really
that
good
earthiness
instead
of
sweetness
sounds
fine
to
me
leather
in
the
nose
awesome
but
this
is
a
framboise
where
raspberries
should
reign
supreme
the
raspberries
may
have
reigned
over
this
bottle
at
some
point
but
honestly
the
sensations
of
tartness
and
eventually
sourness
overwhelmed
a
subtle
berry
note
the
beer
looks
and
feels
of
quality
it
even
smelled
of
a
promising
interpretation
however
the
taste
ultimately
is
dominated
by
sensations
rather
than
flavors
perhaps
my
bottle
wasnt
the
best
but
it
was
by
no
means
compromised
beyond
reason
if
i
was
to
just
see
someone
drinking
this
beer
id
have
been
infinitely
jealous
having
tasted
it
not
so
much
the
visual
and
smells
keep
this
in
the
realm
of
respectability
o
though
my
fears
allayed
as
the
beer
warmed
up
i
did
pick
up
this
bottle
at
a
beer
shop
in
london
that
didnt
seem
to
know
anything
about
cantillon
much
less
beer
in
genral
and
i
cant
account
for
the
care
that
they
or
anyone
else
handled
this
and
whether
or
not
the
bottle
may
have
been
compromised
in
some
way
i
will
say
simply
that
tart
raspberry
with
a
handful
of
other
punching
notes
is
about
all
i
experienced
with
this
beer
and
it
wasnt
as
complex
sweet
or
flavorful
as
i
expected
if
its
what
the
beer
is
intended
to
be
then
great
it
was
good
if
not
and
my
bottle
was
compromised
then
the
beer
must
be
damned
amazing
because
thats
the
best
compromise
ive
had
d
yet
another
winner
from
cantillon
complex
refreshing
and
hugely
well
crafted
poured
hazy
purple
color
with
an
average
fizzy
purple
head
that
lasted
with
good
lacing
good
tart
raspberry
yeast
aroma
medium
body
with
tingly
texture
and
flat
carbonation
moderate
raspberry
tar
fruit
flavor
with
a
solid
tart
fruit
and
small
alcohol
bite
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
very
good
beer

many
thanks
to
whoever
shared
this
at
the
alewatcheroreo
tasting
o
best
i
have
had
ever
wonderful
overall
fantastic
this
is
my
idea
of
a
perfect
sour
at
the
top
of
my
list
hope
to
find
a
bottle
o
to
say
this
brew
is
one
dimensional
is
all
wrong
its
powerful
and
confrontational
in
flavor
but
very
pure
and
to
the
point
massively
sour
and
fruity
with
all
funk
playing
second
fiddle
but
in
a
good
way
each
and
every
time
i
have
this
beer
im
blown
away
by
it
joe
was
kind
enough
to
share
a
bottle
of
the
2002
vintage
bottled
in
2004
light
this
is
a
clear
amber
and
is
lightly
carbonated
the
nose
has
rotting
overripe
raspberries
and
nail
polish
remover
not
much
funk
theres
some
pielike
cooked
fruit
character
mildly
jammy
the
palate
opens
super
sour
definitely
too
much
so
not
really
acetic
or
lactic
is
this
what
an
excess
of
malic
acid
tastes
like
but
it
is
unpleasant
light
in
carbonation
this
is
too
sour
in
my
book

o
top
notch
ive
been
learning
to
appreciate
sour
beers
like
consecration
this
is
even
more
sour
but
it
is
so
good
theres
no
breakin
period
im
giving
it
an
a
my
wife
would
give
it
an
a
because
it
is
right
in
her
wheelhouse
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
raspberries
that
make
them
seemingly
poor
fruits
for
aging
with
bugs
for
a
long
time
but
this
was
the
second
year
in
a
row
that
the
raspberry
sour
v006
last
year
or
lambic
was
the
disappointment
of
the
tasting
i
would
like
to
review
this
fresh
as
i
imagine
that
how
it
is
meant
to
be
consumed
ive
enjoyed
lp
framboise
up
until
the
three
year
mark
but
i
always
enjoy
a
fresh
bottle
of
lp
for
the
vibrant
fruit
character
unbelievably
juicy
enjoyed
this
one
much
more
than
the
kriek
perhaps
the
raspberries
marry
better
with
the
style
and
blending
a
bit
more
based
on
their
inherent
nature
definitely
one
to
pick
up
if
its
available
the
fruit
does
this
one
justice
a
lambic
with
an
inherent
tartness
that
is
so
full
and
yet
blended
that
i
cant
really
apologize
for
the
difficulty
in
readily
discerning
other
flavours
i
e
the
fruit
which
is
generally
more
inferred
than
directly
tasted
if
i
wasnt
such
a
fan
of
sour
spicy
andor
tart
characteristics
i
dont
think
i
could
see
how
this
offering
might
score
so
high
however
i
am
and
it
surely
does
2007
bottle
clear
bright
red
medium
head
nose
is
tightly
woven
brett
fresh
raspberries
very
juicy
as
with
most
cantillon
fruit
lambics
mouth
is
very
tight
refined
juicy
raspberries
acidity
and
barnyard
brett
acidity
is
mostly
on
the
front
end
and
not
on
the
finish
the
high
acidity
makes
this
much
less
attractive
than
the
lou
pepe
kriek
from
the
same
year
im
thinking
its
just
really
difficult
to
make
a
raspberry
lambic
or
raspberry
sour
without
it
being
acidic
over
a
couple
years
great
beer
recommended
for
any
fan
of
lambic
not
only
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
tried
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
period
it
more
than
lived
up
to
the
hype
well
worth
the
29
i
paid
for
the
bottle
and
i
would
buy
another
bottle
again
in
a
heartbeat
this
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
the
tartness
of
the
beer
goes
perfect
with
the
fruit
flavor
highly
recommended
db
great
raspberry
flavor
but
especially
aroma
the
vinegar
is
there
but
enjoyable
hard
to
resist
a
cantillon
vintage
almost
always
going
to
be
a
great
experience
although
very
enjoyable
this
has
to
be
the
most
sour
beer
ive
had
as
ive
heard
of
the
lou
pepe
series
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
stunning
world
class
beer
supremely
balanced
with
a
nice
level
of
sourness
that
satisfies
my
craving
without
giving
me
rot
gut
huge
fruitiness
despite
sitting
2
years
in
the
bottle
like
with
most
cantillons
a
750ml
bottle
needs
to
be
split
at
least
2
ways
so
i
really
wish
this
one
was
available
in
375s
oh
well
a
beer
this
special
needs
a
friend
to
share
it
with
anyway
served
june
24
2010
d
right
before
my
son
thomas
tasted
it
he
said
i
have
a
feeling
im
gonna
really
like
this
one
he
took
a
sip
and
the
face
he
made
was
priceless
just
pure
sourness
he
said
it
was
awful
but
then
said
wow
that
was
bad
but
also
very
good
i
think
ill
take
another
sip
perfect
description
d
not
much
else
to
say
about
such
a
great
beer
except
the
heartburn
is
totaly
worth
it
overall
phenomenal
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
the
only
downside
is
the
nose
but
i
assume
that
is
partially
due
to
the
age
i
went
and
picked
up
an
07
soon
after
then
benc
hooked
me
up
with
a
04
and
an
03
this
beer
is
truly
excellent
while
definitely
tart
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
incredibly
sour
lou
pepe
framboise
is
extremely
drinkable
and
has
a
much
milder
acetic
finish
than
the
rosé
de
gambrinus
very
pleasant
lingering
tart
raspberry
aftertaste
a
terrific
offering
from
a
fabulous
brewery
pours
a
nice
ruby
with
a
pink
head
clearer
than
most
lambics
nose
of
heavy
leather
and
cherry
cranberry
and
strawberry
with
tropical
notes
i
know
it
has
raspberry
in
it
but
im
just
not
getting
that
on
the
palate
doesnt
matter
though
this
beer
is
delicious
starts
with
a
citrusy
strawberry
flavor
a
slight
hint
of
sweetness
enters
and
leads
to
a
tart
jolly
rancher
finish
d
top
notch
the
lou
pepe
fruit
lambics
never
fail
me
an
excellent
aged
framboise
but
there
is
room
for
improvement
perhaps
it
needs
more
time
to
cellar
or
maybe
it
is
better
when
very
fresh
beer
is
very
tart
and
not
as
acetic
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
this
is
probably
a
good
thing
but
the
acetic
character
would
likely
grow
over
time
slightly
there
is
nice
raspberry
flavors
and
good
fruit
tartness
at
the
back
some
lactic
notes
and
a
slightly
tannic
quality
overall
as
well
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
and
highly
drinkable
this
could
be
one
of
my
favorite
cantillons
so
far
dont
know
why
i
decided
to
crack
this
tonight
out
of
all
nights
but
just
felt
like
it
for
some
reason
its
a
750ml
corkedcappedcaged
bottle
that
states
it
is
2006
vintageit
pours
a
beautiful
cherryrose
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
and
little
lacingthe
aroma
is
so
strong
and
pungent
its
not
funny
with
sweet
cherriesraspberriesstrawberries
and
hay
all
on
display
in
the
aroma
very
nice
i
like
itand
on
taste
its
alot
the
same
which
starts
out
with
a
spritzymineral
water
mouthfeel
which
is
beautifully
suited
to
the
style
with
tastes
of
ripe
raspberries
and
cherries
and
it
finishes
with
a
very
sour
mouthpuckering
feel
to
be
expected
and
to
be
quite
honest
i
like
it
i
mean
im
gonna
easily
finish
this
bottle
but
if
i
had
another
bottle
i
wouldnt
crack
it
tonightoverall
a
beautiful
example
of
the
style
that
i
respect
and
i
think
really
highlights
the
raspberry
qualities
perfectly
d
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
very
good
a
huge
sour
kick
with
some
good
fruits
a
funkiness
that
i
appreciated
enjoyed
one
of
the
better
lambics
i
have
ever
had
now
i
need
to
try
the
kriek
cantillon
knows
their
sours
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
acidic
lambics
though
i
dont
really
expect
anything
less
from
cantillon
this
one
is
full
of
woody
barrel
which
adds
a
really
nice
dimension
to
the
tart
raspberries
lemon
pucker
and
a
hint
of
grapes
some
nice
funk
that
plays
with
your
stomach
later
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
but
ample
a
real
sipper
i
rate
it
a
little
less
drinkable
simply
due
to
the
acidic
nature
dthis
is
tasty
and
tart
nice
flavors
and
lots
of
raspberries
great
brew
d
this
is
a
great
lambic
i
wish
i
would
have
gotten
into
cantillon
earlier
this
is
a
great
sour
that
offers
lots
of
authentic
raspberry
flavors
and
is
quite
tart
pours
a
stunning
ruby
red
taste
offers
tart
raspberry
with
a
touch
of
oak
on
the
finish
there
was
little
chance
of
this
disappointing
and
it
assuredly
didnt
while
i
prefer
the
lp
kriek
to
this
its
tough
to
imagine
a
framboise
getting
much
better
pours
a
brilliant
deep
red
with
a
thin
head
the
beer
is
actually
surprisingly
clear
for
a
lambic
but
otherwise
it
looks
like
i
would
expect
it
to
the
smell
is
all
fruit
sweet
fruit
candy
like
maybe
a
bit
of
tartness
but
almost
reminds
me
of
a
fruit
soda
very
nice
though
sometimes
you
dont
mind
the
smell
of
garbage
in
a
wild
ale
the
flavor
comes
across
first
as
tart
and
acidic
but
it
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
balance
the
flavor
in
some
ways
reminds
me
of
raspberrylime
juice
if
there
were
such
a
thing
also
a
slight
sourness
that
is
really
nice
like
sour
candy
the
taste
is
just
surprisingly
clean
for
a
wild
ale
just
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
with
the
flavor
of
fruit
just
amazingly
balanced
the
bo
dy
is
a
little
fuller
than
i
expected
probably
from
the
sweet
fruit
juice
and
the
carbonation
is
low
but
you
can
tell
that
its
there
fairly
nice
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
the
sourness
is
there
in
its
fullness
but
it
is
just
held
in
balance
with
the
beautiful
blending
and
the
addition
of
fruit
its
not
too
acidic
and
doesnt
remind
you
of
garbage
its
just
a
great
lambic
really
a
joy
to
drink
theres
lots
of
carbonation
otherwise
a
light
body
similar
to
many
other
lambics
not
sure
how
much
of
the
puckering
tartness
is
due
to
age
or
the
particular
year
it
was
made
so
ill
be
getting
this
again
as
a
newer
year
sometime
to
try
it
again
upending
the
bottle
i
expect
to
see
whole
raspberries
in
suspension
nope
just
yeast
porridge
i
drink
it
anyway
d
nice
pleasant
lambic
fairly
uniform
not
used
to
paying
high
prices
for
beers
without
tons
of
complexity
but
i
guess
cantillon
is
worth
it
once
in
awhile
750ml
thanks
to
mrkanable
with
2005
on
the
neck
and
a
bottling
date
in
2007
i
was
excited
about
this
beer
but
the
moment
i
smelled
it
i
was
disappointed
i
have
never
smelled
a
beer
this
bad
and
i
love
funky
lambics
this
was
not
cheesy
it
was
not
barnyard
it
was
not
even
horsepiss
this
was
rancid
and
putrid
garbage
i
think
this
was
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
smelled
the
beer
looked
good
it
was
a
cloudy
reddish
color
the
taste
was
oddly
pretty
good
despite
the
vomit
and
trash
smell
i
tasted
funky
lambic
and
raspberries
like
i
expected
this
was
alsoa
little
more
acidic
that
i
would
like
but
the
smell
is
what
killed
the
experience
i
need
to
get
a
fresh
bottle
great
drinkability
kept
me
wanting
more
of
it
this
is
a
hell
of
a
fruit
lambic
easily
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
d
extremely
drinkable
low
abv
very
complex
and
an
allaround
nice
sipper
please
for
the
love
of
god
share
this
beer
with
friends
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
by
the
glass
dont
attempt
to
man
up
and
consume
this
bottle
by
yourself
the
results
could
be
troubling
d
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
perhaps
in
a
fresher
state
this
is
certainly
a
very
nice
lambic
even
with
a
fading
fruit
character
this
is
a
nicely
done
complex
lambic
its
not
my
favourite
on
the
basis
that
some
of
the
flavours
simply
dont
jive
so
well
with
me
and
at
times
it
almost
comes
across
as
harsh
that
said
a
good
experience
and
another
winner
from
cantillon
consumed
1292010
d
not
drinkable
in
the
traditional
sense
as
the
flavors
here
are
again
overwhelming
however
enjoyable
and
quite
complex
every
bit
worth
seeking
out
and
sampling
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
with
effervescent
carbonation
and
is
extremely
sour
and
puckering
from
the
flavors
described
above
a
sipper
from
the
complex
flavors
and
sourfunkiness
but
not
alcohol
presence
and
pleasant
bursts
of
sweetness
make
this
an
exceptional
lambic
this
is
a
sipper
d
it
can
be
difficult
to
drink
one
of
these
alone
even
though
its
pretty
weak
abvwise
due
to
the
intensity
of
the
sour
flavor
aside
from
the
low
abv
it
kinda
feels
like
im
drinking
a
whole
bottle
of
merlot
while
this
is
certainly
a
topshelf
lambic
and
i
rate
accordingly
i
think
i
prefer
the
kriek
d
not
a
session
beer
but
interesting
and
worth
revisiting
occasionally
d
a
spectacular
brew
among
the
best
of
the
cantillon
line
drinkability
is
good
very
sour
but
the
acidity
is
somewhat
restrained
great
depth
and
complexity
too
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
no
mistaking
that
its
a
cantillon
definitely
more
sour
than
most
but
i
like
that
end
of
the
spectrum
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
a
bit
thicker
than
most
cantillon
but
this
one
is
wickedly
tart
great
stuff
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
seek
this
out
and
cellar
it
for
up
20
years
as
recommended
on
the
bottle
d
out
of
the
3
lou
pepes
i
opened
this
was
our
least
favorite
an
excellent
and
complex
flavor
but
more
austerely
dry
than
any
of
us
really
preferred
id
get
it
again
but
i
would
pair
it
with
food
drinkability
drinkable
but
i
prefer
the
kriek
version
although
this
is
better
than
rose
de
gambrinus
which
i
find
to
be
a
bit
thinwatery
this
one
is
a
slow
sipper
d
good
very
drinkable
however
it
seems
to
lack
complexity
and
is
slightly
to
clean
in
character
it
seems
young

tastes
this
one
does
not
you
notice
the
take

of
this
kriek
upon
opening
the
bottle
as
tart
funky
cherry

flow
from
the

an
energetic
hazy

and
its

is
a

very
tart

with

over

and
a
hard
to

and
lives
up

the
hype
had
this
one
with
a
good
friend
of
mine
to
celebrate
the
birth
of
his
2nd
child
he
brought
it
back
from
cantillon
where
he
spent
his
honeymoom
3
years
earlier
excellent
fruit
notes
nice
light
tart
and
very
drinkable
had
after
tour
of
cantillon
in
brussels
overall
a
top
drawer
kriek
but
then
this
is
a
cantillon
after
all
well
worth
a
try
in
terms
of
sourness
its
quite
a
bit
tamer
than
its
raspberry
sibling
but
thats
not
to
say
youll
get
easy
sipping
sweetness
you
wont
well
worth
trying
if
you
can
track
it
down
availability
seems
to
vary
wildly
this
is
up
there
with
kasteel
rouge
as
my
favourite
cherry
beer
overall
a
splendid
lambic
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
facidic
cherry
with
a
nice
medium
body
overall
a
nice
beer
i
liked
that
the
fruitiness
was
subtle
man
this
beer
is
sour
worth
trying
but
would
not
seek
out
again
splendid
belgian
funk
mixed
with
some
ripe
tart
cherries
lemon
zest
hay
and
restrained
sourness
farmhouse
fresh
with
a
touch
of
hay
and
were
dog
fantastic
lambic
though
very
tart
it
is
not
at
all
one
dimensional
lots
of
cherry
character
though
just
a
touch
less
complex
and
jammy
as
drie
fonteinen
still
lovely
bottle
pours
light
pink
with
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
light
tart
cherries
flavor
is
more
funky
and
tart
excellent
a
real
treat
to
drink
hope
to
eventually
get
some
more
o
no
flavour
just
sourness
but
it
would
go
down
great
on
a
hot
summers
day
2009
vintage
very
tart
and
dry
beautiful
beer
overall
pretty
nice
tastes
like
complex
funky
lemonade
everythings
balanced
and
it
has
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
but
this
style
just
isnt
quite
my
cup
of
tea
gold
standard
for
krieks
in
my
opinion
so
refreshing
tart
cherry
overall
amazing
how
the
cherries
taste
fresh
and
not
artificial
like
they
tend
to
do
in
other
fruitsour
beers
great
balance
and
each
sip
brings
out
different
nuances
hard
to
find
and
pricier
than
other
krieks
but
worth
it
so
frigging
good
bottle
at
brasserie
cambrinus
while
in
bruges
side
by
side
with
rose
de
cambrinus
pours
deep
red
color
with
a
pink
half
finger
head
aroma
of
tart
cherries
wheat
malts
a
bit
of
oak
flavor
follows
with
big
cherry
though
not
overly
sweet
with
perfect
tartness
and
some
vanilla
coming
through
as
well
medium
dry
on
the
palate
light
plus
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
my
first
time
having
this
one
and
i
think
i
light
like
it
better
then
the
lp
kriek
awesome
stuff
it
is
nice
but
muddled
by
various
flavors
that
are
going
on
overall
my
first
cantillon
was
a
special
treat
i
really
couldnt
find
a
way
past
the
incredible
flavors
the
oak
produce
in
this
beer
the
oak
manages
to
round
all
of
the
corners
perfectly
together
especially
the
cherries
which
take
on
a
much
darker
profile
then
i
expected
a
truly
wonderful
experience
i
really
like
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
it
o
awesome
smooth
must
try
if
you
can
ever
swing
it
i
drank
this
one
at
the
brewery
cantillon
it
came
free
with
the
brewery
tour
o
what
is
there
to
say
that
hasnt
already
been
said
cantillon
just
has
that
distinctive
unique
funk
to
it
having
never
had
this
fresh
im
sure
the
fruit
is
much
brighter
and
prominent
but
i
like
the
funk
better
and
i
think
overall
this
is
an
exceptionally
wellrounded
beer
served
in
a
large
bottle
at
cask
in
london
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
appearance
is
a
redpink
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
champagne
like
smell
is
acidic
and
fruity
it
smells
like
cherries
the
taste
is
wonderful
tart
and
fruity
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
sours
that
i
have
had
overall
it
was
great
i
ended
up
sharing
it
with
my
wife
and
she
typically
does
not
like
sours
overall
an
awesome
kriek
in
its
balance
of
flavors
and
overall
drinkability
sometimes
too
much
cherry
knocks
the
drinkability
of
krieks
for
me
but
this
mixes
in
the
lambic
flavors
quite
nicely
out
of
the
more
standard
and
available
krieks
id
put
this
behind
3f
oude
kriek
and
mariage
parfait
kriek
but
thats
saying
a
lot
as
those
beers
are
phenomenal
i
have
no
idea
if
the
ratings
will
reflect
this
or
not
but
while
i
was
drinking
this
i
kept
thinking
its
as
good
as
the
lou
pepe
edition
does
it
need
twice
the
fruit
or
another
year
i
dont
think
so
at
all
this
is
a
candy
apple
red
pour
maybe
a
touch
pinker
but
really
blood
stained
red
clear
though
and
with
about
a
half
inch
of
just
tainted
pink
white
head
it
smells
like
candied
cherries
not
really
fresh
fruit
but
not
due
to
artificial
sugar
or
anything
it
think
its
more
a
product
of
the
lambic
base
which
is
tart
as
hell
a
lot
like
the
classic
gueuze
really
farmy
and
funked
to
high
heaven
with
a
subtle
barrel
profile
good
acidity
on
the
palate
not
overdone
in
the
slightest
with
the
cherry
getting
more
and
more
intense
as
the
beer
warms
wishing
for
nothing
i
find
this
supremely
delicious
and
while
it
may
not
be
as
complex
or
as
natural
cherry
flavored
as
the
lou
pepe
version
i
find
it
cleaner
equally
tasty
and
a
little
more
blonde
sour
basey
than
its
big
brother
carbonation
is
on
point
uncommon
is
real
lambic
and
frankly
just
freaking
awesome
i
find
myself
drinking
it
way
too
fast
but
thats
just
the
sign
of
killer
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
from
cantillon
but
on
par
in
terms
of
quality
with
any
of
them
beautiful
pour
on
this
one
bright
pinkred
nice
two
finger
pink
head
very
bubbly
the
cherry
is
very
upfront
in
the
smell
tart
cherry
skin
and
a
little
bit
of
funk
taste
isnt
as
tart
as
i
expected
pretty
gentle
nice
bubbly
mouthfeel
cherries
and
cinnamon
great
cherry
aftertaste
very
nice
lambic
even
if
it
isnt
incredibly
complex
low
a
notes
the
cork
was
cracked
in
the
bottle
and
there
appeared
to
be
some
sediment
stuck
to
the
cap
but
the
drink
itself
drank
within
reason
only
small
flavor
issues
that
i
didnt
mention
o
cantillon
makes
some
of
the
best
lambic
in
the
business
and
the
addition
of
the
cherries
adds
a
nice
fruit
presence
that
doesnt
dominate
the
base
too
much
the
beer
isnt
overly
sweet
like
some
fruited
lambics
ive
had
and
while
it
isnt
quite
as
fruity
as
the
lou
pepe
beers
it
still
has
a
nice
presence
balance
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
krieks
out
there
and
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
pinkishred
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
pinkishwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
sticky
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
funky
cherries
oak
and
yeast
lightbodied
with
flavors
of
tart
cherries
and
berries
funky
yeast
and
vinous
oak
the
finish
is
fruity
with
a
lingering
sour
cherry
and
apple
aftertaste
really
good
all
around
overall
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
need
to
get
my
hands
on
older
vintages
and
get
get
a
little
more
sour
o
excellent
tart
and
very
prevalent
cherry
tasty
and
crisp
deep
ruby
red
in
appearance
very

in

with
very
little
light
getting
through
a
minimal
bit
of
white
foam
only
covers
a
fraction
of
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is

tart

the
body
is

a

the
flavor

what

this
unique
beer
is
a
standard

great

a
little
rougher
than
the
previous
bottle
wonderful
cherry
pie
nose
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
high
on
the
acetic
acid
making
for
a
very
sour
and
slightly
astringent
offering
there
is
also
a
heavy
earthy
leathery
tone
an
incredible
sour
ale
a
good
straightforward
fruit
lambic
as
expected
from
the
likes
of
cantillon
i
dont
like
very
sour
beers
so
this
suited
me
fine
great
flavor
but
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
m
medium
body
exceptionally
dry
moderate
carbonation
o
clean
profile
with
a
soft
simple
well
balanced
complexity
overall
amazing
beer
that
defines
all
other
krieks
i
dont
have
to
tell
you
need
to
try
it
because
you
already
want
it
even
if
you
think
dont
like
fruit
beers
you
need
to
try
this
i
will
buy
this
anytime
i
see
this
without
fail
overall
a
rocksolid
kriek
that
for
me
at
least
sets
the
bar
pretty
high
for
the
style
this
brew
pours
a
beautiful
rich
red
indicative
of
the
cherries
used
to
make
it
no
head
at
all
but
more
carbonation
than
i
was
expecting
i
did
pour
very
slow
because
this
is
my
first
cantillon
lambic
and
i
wanted
to
savor
every
second
it
smells
of
sour
cherries
there
is
nothing
artificial
hitting
the
senses
you
can
smell
the
wood
barrels
that
this
kriek
was
aged
in
i
pleasant
funk
dominates
the
palate
and
by
holding
it
in
your
mouth
for
a
few
seconds
you
can
feel
the
flavor
evolve
from
sour
to
earthly
with
the
cherries
making
their
presence
known
throughout
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
well
balanced
mouth
feel
overall
this
is
the
best
lambic
i
have
had
to
date
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
i
would
buy
more
absolutely
outstanding
some
other
notes
i
have
tried
a
1992
375
ml
bottle
courtesy
of
martinus
rbbwg
2013
there
were
doubts
about
this
beer
prior
to
opening
it
which
all
instantly
vanished
once
we
tried
this
has
kept
incredible
well
even
better
integrated
than
younger
bottles
didnt
think
that
this
is
possible
ogotta
love
a
fresh
fruit
lambic
ov
i
love
lambics
sours
and
wild
ales
and
this
is
a
superb
offering
the
flavours
were
in
near
perfect
balance
with
each
other
nothing
dominating
nothing
really
complex
about
this
brew
but
when
its
so
well
crafted
like
this
it
doesnt
need
to
be
just
delicious
and
rewarding
a
true
treat
cantillon
never
lets
me
down
this
was
a
lot
more
sour
than
i
was
expecting
in
a
good
way
an
excellent
example
of
a
worldclass
kriek
must
try
for
all
belgian
sour
fans
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
i
likelove
it
very
sweet
cherry
flavor
as
much
like
a
wine
as
a
sour
but
the
sour
does
come
through
in
a
big
way
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
certainly
well
made
oak
flavors
add
to
the
complexity
and
enjoyment
if
youre
into
craft
you
gotta
give
the
best
lambics
a
try
and
this
is
one
of
them
me
likey
overall
this
is
a
fine
lambic
cantillon
has
proven
that
they
set
the
bar
for
most
sours
this
beer
is
no
different
the
cherry
flavor
is
top
notch
and
the
oak
and
funk
make
this
an
enjoyable
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
experience
this
i
guess
i
have
to
find
some
more
of
this
oa
good
kriek
bordered
the
line
of
overly
sweet
and
not
sour
enough
but
stayed
to
the
right
side
of
the
divide
o
the
cork
says
this
was
bottled
in
2007
and
if
thats
true
then
it
may
have
been
sitting
in
muggs
tavern
that
whole
time
i
think
it
is
just
too
old
and
past
its
prime
overall
this
is
way
too
sour
good
otherwise
o
i
like
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
understand
the
fuss
delicate
and
enjoyable
this
really
is
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
it
actually
has
some
similarities
to
supplication
based
on
my
limited
knowledge
of
wild
ales
though
not
as
sour
and
certainty
with
more
red
wine
characteristics
overall
really
good
kriek
the
cherries
and
sourness
are
the
stars
of
this
beer
more
so
than
the
funk
though
thats
not
to
say
its
not
there
this
is
another
example
why
cantillon
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
business
od
a
great
fruit
lambic
lovely
and
drinkable
with
tons
of
complexity
and
deliciousness
definitely
world
class
great
kriek
drinks
incredibly
well
and
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
love
the
flavour
profile
aroma
and
the
sourness
of
cantillon
beers
it
reminds
me
of
my
recent
vacation
in
belgium
where
i
visited
the
brewery
twice
and
that
smell
just
brings
it
home
for
me
putting
a
big
grin
on
my
face
love
it
ok
as
promised
i
am
back
with
a
younger
one
it
is
just
over
a
year
old
there
is
more
carbonation
and
more
fruity
taste
though
rather
raspberry
than
cherry
however
they
are
right
that
it
is
somewhat
better
when
young
i
knew
sooner
or
later
id
need
to
cough
up
the
cash
to
try
this
one
its
a
solid
brew
and
a
funk
monster
but
its
hard
to
drop
the
dough
when
i
could
get
few
great
brews
for
the
same
price
as
this
single
bottle
that
being
said
im
probably
going
to
buy
more
cantillon
in
the
near
future
for
no
other
reason
then
ive
yet
to
try

i
would
describe

as

and
not
at
all
in
an
acidic
way
that
many
sour
beers
develop
definitely
got
some
hints
of
cherries
here
this
was
truly
a
delightful
beer
did
not
score
a
t

at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
cantillon
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
is
my
second
75
cl
bottle
and
it
grows
on
my
each
time
the
sourness
will
come
as
a
surprise
to
people
unfamiliar
with
lambics
i
could
sip
on
this
all
day
so
i
will
o
solid
kriek
with
lots
of
tartness
to
it
instead
of
being
too
sweet
this
is
one
of
my
pet
peeves
with
some
of
the
beers
in
this
still
it
brings
nice
cherry
flavor
while
still
allowing
the
lambic
tartness
to
shine
through
t
a
big
meaty
sour
cherry
note
upfront
with
some
raspberry
preserves
lemony
tartness
and
cherry
skins
the
tartness
lingers
on
your
tongue
forever
never
really
becoming
overpoweringly
sour
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
keeps
the
mouthfeel
light
enough
without
detracting
from
the
flavors
this
is
awesome
stuff
my
first
cantillon
and
the
best
lambicstyle
ive
come
across
i
think
thats
because
the
sourness
is
not
as
intensely
inyourface
this
offers
a
balanced
intricate
tart
semisweet
flavor
profile
with
amazing
feel
and
complexity
a
work
of
art
in
every
sense
this
will
definitely
entice
me
to
try
more
from
cantillon

o
a
very
good
example
of
a
traditional
kriek
but
cascade
kriek
is
still
number
one
for
me
cantillon
kriek
pours
out
a
brilliant
ruby
with
a
small
light
red
head
that
quickly
drops
beautiful
looking
the
aroma
is
a
nice
musty
tart
cherry
with
a
solid
amount
of
acidity
the
taste
is
beautiful
providing
layers
of
yeast
tart
cherry
oak
and
lactic
acid
its
a
very
bright
and
crisp
beer
the
aftertaste
is
a
thing
of
beauty
with
a
lingering
delicate
tart
cherry
skin
flavor
hanging
out
for
quite
some
time
basically
if
you
like
fruit
beers
you
absolutely
have
to
try
this
cantillon
kriek
and
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
are
easily
the
best
two
cherry
beers
on
the
market
and
each
represent
a
different
side
of
the
coin
sweetness
for
the
new
glarus
and
tartness
for
the
cantillon
a
lovely
beer
to
be
drinking
when
the
cherry
trees
are
blooming
although
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
a
gueze
kriek
honesty
and
simplicity
is
this
beers
virtue
as
well
as
its
price
o
fruit
slight

complex
and
lovely
to
drink
an
excellent

and
great

was
but
still
a
delicious

an
excellent

balanced

is
displayed
perfectly
very
sour
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
an
excellent
kriek
overall
really
enjoyed
this
wont
hesitate
to
repurchase
if
i
see
it
again
it
was
brought
to
a
tasting
and
was
easily
the
most
enjoyed
beer
among
the
tasters
not

one
of
my
favorites
o

lives
up
to
the
reputation
this
is
my
first
loon

and
i
will
be

i
remember
a

more

to
it
too
overall
just
entirely

than
i
remember
and
believe
me
it
was
already
incredible
before
super
sour
and
acidic
cherries
raspberries
and
grapes
less
vinous
this
time
around
so
quenching
and
addictive
gotta
bump
the
score
up
on
this
one
great
stuff
all
in
all
a
little
too
tart
for
this
palate
i
had
high
hopes
of
excellence
but
never
mind
as
perfect
as
i
will
rate
overall
this
is
my
second

only
bested

via
jim
c
verdict
such
a
delightful
kriek
from
cantillon
the
fruit
is
so
fresh
right
now
and
the
pielike
experience
is
really
wonderful
its
always
a
treat
to
have
a
fruit
lambic
from
cantillon
as
they
really
dont
take
shortcuts
when
it
comes
to
using
fresh
fruit
overall
i
think
i
enjoy
this
better
than
the
lou
pepe
kriek
i
had
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
was
a
2007
sticker
vintage
so
it
would
definitely
be
more
sour
o
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
lambics
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
it
goes
down
with
ease
and
is
just
beyond
delicious
i
will
for
sure
be
ordering
this
beer
again
from
etre
gourmet
and
age
several
bottles
ogreat
beer
tough
to
decide
if
i
prefer
this
or
the
lou
pepe
kriek
cantillon
never
fails
with
the
fruited
lambics
pours
a
murky
light
red
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
malt
sour
cherry
and
earthy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
nice
acidic
sourness
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
heres
to
hundreds
more
like
this
everything
they
said
about
cantillon
is
true
it
seems
whenever
i
drink
a
kriek
memories
of
this
beer
will
flicker
on
for
comparison
this
is
the
standard
for
belgian
fruit
lambics
as
far
as
im
concerned
o
delightful
great
hints
of
fresh
cherries
with
a
lactic
sour
kick
and
a
restrained
funk
the
cap
came
off
and
the
cork
worked
itself
effortlessly
literally
without
a
corkscrew
out
of
the
bottle
the
contents
revealed
a
clear
ruby
red
effervescent
beverage
with
no
head
the
nose
is
relatively
dank
and
cultured
with
a
slight
fruitiness
almost
perfumelike
fortunately
the
beer
drinks
just
as
gentle
except
for
a
wickedly
underestimated
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
with
enough
fruit
sweetness
and
body
to
balance
out
the
dry
sour
aftertaste
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
a
rich
chocolaty
dessert
like
i
have
as
it
cleanses
the
palate
with
each
sip
and
complements
the
already
boozeinfused
cherries
in
the
dessert
overall
im
really
glad
i
finally
tried
a
cantillon
fresh
much
different
experience
than
aged
ones
that
get
sour
dominant
i
cant
believe
there
was
a
time
i
didnt
like
sours
if
you
are
looking
to
get
into
sours
seek
out
a
bottle
of
this
and
have
it
as
fresh
as
possible
medium
body
higher
carbonation
chewy
and
dry
on
the
tongue
this
is
fantastically
worth
the
money
and
completely
ahead
of
the
pack
when
it
comes
to
regular
storm
prep
big
thanks
goes
out
to
sincerenc
for
sharing
this
one
during
a
fair
sized
cantillon
tasting
2011
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
cantillon
balloon
poured
a
deep
dark
ruby
red
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
funk
tart
cherry
and
diaper
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
cherry
funk
sour
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
just
for
the
record
i
love
this
brew
i
opted
to
review
this
one
on
a
fresher
bottle
as
i
have
had
an
03
vintage
of
this
before
in
the
past
and
it
was
absolutely
crazy
how
sourtart
it
had
turned
this
one
really
allowed
the
cherry
and
funk
to
shine
throughout
each
sip
really
well
balanced
on
sweetness
from
the
fruit
and
the
tartness
going
on
i
would
suggest
anyone
try
this
one
at
least
once
but
i
wouldnt
make
it
my
first
sour
as
depending
on
the
age
it
could
be
quite
overwhelming
for
some
tart
and
puckering
with
the
perfect
amount
of
sour
acidity
balanced
out
by
sweet
fruit
sugars
this
is
a
recent
vintage
so
the
cherries
really
stand
out
with
an
almost
dessertpie
like
flavor
but
the
sweetness
is
excellently
balanced
by
earthy
barnyard
funk
dry
oak
and
acetic
vinegar
very
dry
and
tart
throughout
with
earthy
oak
lactic
and
acetic
funk
and
a
lingering
vinegarlike
flavor
in
the
finish
that
has
me
salivating
for
more
aggressively
sour
but
never
too
harsh
or
solvent
like
because
of
the
freshness
of
the
fruit
again
im
picking
up
the
skin
and
pit
of
the
fruit
which
adds
complexity
while
complimenting
the
sour
earthy
funk
flavors
not
a
beginner
sourlambic
but
i
find
it
delicious
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
o
i
like
it
better
than
rose
de
gambrinus
a
decent
kriek
however
i
will
need
to
search
these
beers
out
fresher
as
the
fruit
flavor
is
really
what
i
prefer
in
these
beers
over
the
sourtartness
pours
a
rich
crystal
clear
ruby
red
with
a
pink
head
that
builds
up
quick
and
dissipates
right
away
nose
is
tart
cherries
grapes
plums
and
sour
fruits
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
something
woody
the
taste
is
super
tart
sour
cherries
red
grapes
pears
raspberries
all
rounded
out
with
a
very
effervescent
kick
the
extreme
carbonation
fades
out
and
leaves
notes
of
tart
cherry
juice
sitting
on
the
tongue
originally
i
thought
id
prefer
this
over
the
raspberry
cantillon
i
bought
at
the
same
time
but
i
actually
think
i
may
have
liked
the
rose
de
gambrinus
slightly
better
this
is
still
a
great
lambic
and
it
satisfies
the
craving
i
had
for
a
sour
ever
since
i
had
gueze
fond
at
dinner
i
hope
to
find
more
cantillon
at
some
point
especially
blaeber
o
it
is
a
great
beer
but
you
have
to
expect
the
immense
tartness
of
this
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
sour
beers
this
is
a
no
brainer
o
a
decent
kriek
but
the
acetic
acid
is
a
bit
much
if
everything
was
tuned
down
a
bit
in
this
beer
the
complexity
would
come
out
a
bit
more
i
think
its
tough
to
rate
this
style
since
there
are
so
few
traditional
versions
of
it
but
i
prefer
3f
by
a
large
margin
loaded
with
tart
and
cherry
aggressive
but
complex
this
is
the
elixir
of
dreams
im
not
sure
a
fruit
lambic
can
really
improve
from
here
if
youre
in
to
the
super
tart
thing
a
bit
more
fruit
wouldnt
hurt
but
not
having
it
doesnt
hurt
it
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
as
it
is
from
cantillon
somehow
this
was
even
more
intense
than
i
expected
so
much
cherry
tartness
this
is
like
eating
some
kind
of
ridiculous
cherry
bread
but
more
magical
tied
with
foufoune
for
my
favorite
shelf
cantillon
very
drinkable
given
how
imposing
the
flavors
are
fantastic
stuff
375
ml
bottle
fairly
fresh
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
reddish
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
funky
cherry
a
bit
of
earthiness
a
very
light
sulfur
note
and
a
hint
of
raspberry
the
initial
taste
has
a
light
sweetness
with
some
cherry
there
is
more
cherry
in
the
taste
than
the
nose
there
is
also
a
funky
earthiness
and
lemon
tartness
the
finish
is
tart
with
cherry
and
a
bit
of
funkiness
medium
body
medium
to
low
carbonation
quite
enjoyable
this
is
quite
a
bit
dryer
than
the
3f
oude
kriek
o
love
the
tartness
but
id
like
a
little
more
fruitiness
o
overall
a
very
nice
and
tasty
beer
as
previously
mentioned
the
fruit
is
mostly
gonefaded
on
this
to
rebalance
itself
i
think
this
vintage
could
stand
to
sit
for
a
bit
and
mellow
out
however
classicvintage
cantillon
rarely
disappoints
and
this
follows
that
mantra
poured
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
light
pinkish
red
with
nice
clarity
rose
colored
head
forms
and
dissipates
quickly
minimal
lacing
present
the
aroma
features
tart
and
dry
cherries
with
notes
of
oak
and
tannins
the
flavor
starts
with
a
bit
of
tart
cherry
but
never
becomes
sour
instead
the
flavor
dries
quickly
and
has
a
very
neutral
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
nice
lambic
although
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
tartness
definitely
a
change
of
pace
compared
to
other
krieks
i
have
encountered
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
was
easily
found
perfect
mouthfeel
for
the
style
medium
to
very
slightly
light
with
spritely
carbonation
crisp
and
puckering
probably
the
best
kriek
ive
had
although
i
havent
opened
my
lou
pepe
yet
similar
in
intensity
to
hanssens
kriek
not
horrible
but
below
average
and
nowhere
near
the
standard
i
usually
expect
from
cantillon
the
cherry
sweetness
and
massive
acidity
create
a
medicinal
taste
overall
hype
is
definitely
deserved
for
this
brewery
and
i
will
seek
more
out
simply
stellar
deep
pinkviolet
colored
with
a
light
pink
head
strong
funk
and
soft
cherries
in
the
aroma
tastes
puckering
sour
and
clean
but
with
hints
of
vinegar
notes
of
oak
as
well
the
fruit
is
not
as
intense
as
the
color
led
me
to
believe
clean
dry
and
effervescent
feel
o
so
so
so
fucking
good
this
is
another
great
example
of
wonderfulness
from
cantillon
superbly
done
overall
good
sour
krieklambic
is
a
style
that
has
not
much
been
improved
on
since
its
inception
however
many
centuries
ago
the
modern
commercial
examples
that
add
fruit
juices
or
sugar
may
appeal
to
a
wider
audience
but
for
my
money
theres
nothing
more
appetizing
than
lemon
juice
acidity
mildewy
oak
wood
must
and
the
tartness
of
wild
yeasts
and
bacterias
o
a
fine
complex
sour
beer
which
i
came
to
appreciate
and
enjoy
even
though
sours
arent
my
favorite
i
prefered
the
raspberry
based
lambic
found
the
cherry
flavors
more
coughsyrupy
sweet
with
less
of
the
salty
tartness
more
dark
cherry
flavors
more
my
preference
i
could
see
how
others
would
enjoy
this
though
everyone
needs
to
sample
cantillon
brews
this
one
included
overall
i
loved
the
real
cherry
flavor
my
wife
who
doesnt
like
sours
ordered
one
after
having
mine
so
smooth
and
easy
drinking
o
pretty
much
what
i
had
expected
to
find
here
from
cantillon
a
well
executed
and
well
rounded
lambic
which
is
pretty
much
spot
on
as
i
mentioned
before
this
is
not
my
favorite
kriek
as
i
think
lindemans
beats
is
out
nicely
with
more
sweetness
and
drinkability
still
a
wonderful
lambic
and
im
very
happy
with
my
25
investment
here
thanks
patrick
and
thanks
to
my
wife
for
indulging
my
pilgrimage
to
the
cantillon
brewery
o
a
really
like
this
understand
how
good
people
say
it
is
o
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
tend
to
lean
towards
the
american
wild
alternative
to
krieks
like
consecration
especially
aged
however
the
lou
pepe
kriek
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
the
delight
to
try
ill
probably
sit
on
my
other
bottle
of
this
for
a
few
years
and
see
just
how
sour
it
gets
rating
94100
o
very
tasty
and
refreshing
kriek
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
a
few
years
in
the
bottle
does
to
this
pours
a
nice
pink
cranberry
color
head
quickly
dissipates
smell
is
cherries
and
some
sour
yeast
got
some
serious
action
going
on
in
the
taste
cheeries
and
the
tartness
abounds
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
a
total
pucker
fest
great
beer
o
ive
slowly
been
converting
to
the
dark
side
or
should
i
say
the
sour
side
and
with
this
exploration
i
begin
to
understand
the
infatuation
with
cantillon
kriek
is
no
different
although
the
funkiest
of
the
bunch
ive
tasted
still
a
world
class
beer
this
brewery
understands
the
style
and
thus
far
every
variation
is
worth
checking
out
however
the
common
ones
seem
to
be
just
as
tasty
if
not
more
tasty
than
some
of
the
trickier
ones
to
acquire
although
my
exploration
has
been
minimal
compared
to
whats
out
there
cheers
and
thanks
for
a
great
brew
o
if
you
like
sour
and
you
like
cherries
this
is
your
beer
not
sure
it
gets
much
better
in
the
beer
world
with
this
combo
its
sharp
yet
works
perfectly
together
good
stuff
my
first
sample
of
the
style
but
i
found
it
enjoyable
quite
sour
but
the
funkiness
helps
give
it
a
balance

com
this
was
my
first
cantillon
ever
and
i
was
very
impressed
and
i
know
this
is
not
the
best
they
have
i
have
a
rose
de
gambrinus
which
i
look
forward
to
try
i
first
had
this
years
ago
in
philly
either
at
monks
or
the
belgian
cafe
i
believe
but
ive
also
just
recently
revisited
it
poured
a
deep
red
color
with
a
fizzy
cap
of
pinkishwhite
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
of
delicate
bubbles
aroma
of
tart
cherries
notes
of
yeast
and
grassy
funk
as
would
be
guessed
the
taste
is
pretty
much
fullblown
cherries
up
front
some
tartness
some
sweetness
with
slighter
undertones
of
barnyard
funk
acetic
and
citric
acids
medium
body
a
little
syrupy
quite
drinkable
and
quite
exemplary
of
the
style
even
if
not
the
best
d
a
nice
but
rather
simple
sour
while
i
enjoyed
my
introduction
to
cantillon
and
sours
in
general
i
dont
know
that
i
could
make
it
through
a
bottle
of
this
too
often
m
dry
and
tart
no
carb
overall
greatcrisp
and
refreshing
not
to
sweet
cherries
are
there
but
balanced
by
intense
sour
notes
not
overly
complex
but
very
enjoyable
i
would
definetly
recommend
this
one
light
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
i
really
like
this
and
can
more
than
understand
why
cantillon
beers
are
highly
sought
after
overall
a
delicious
offering
easy
to
see
why
these
are
sought
after
light
body
with
some
light
carbonation
very
refreshing
pretty
tasty
kriek
othis
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
of
course
im
a
huge
fan
of
sours
and
lambics
but
this
just
raised
the
bar
i
want
a
never
ending
supply
of
this
i
wish
it
were
cheaper
its
a
taste
i
just
cant
get
out
of
my
head
body
is
mediumlight
to
medium
with
noticeable
but
not
aggressive
carbonation
pleasant
excellent
for
sipping
and
trying
to
discern
the
flavors
finish
is
dry
o
the
tartness
is
a
little
overwhelming
at
first
but
after
a
few
sips
it
becomes
less
noticeable
as
the
tongue
adjusts
the
big
cherry
flavors
mix
very
well
with
the
sourness
a
very
enjoyable
lambic
worthy
of
being
my
100th
review
mediumlight
body
with
some
greatfeeling
sourness
carbonation
has
good
life
to
it
the
feel
is
lovingly
friendly
to
the
flavors
absorbed
by
the
palate
o
greatness
in
a
bottle
love
the
balance
of
this
beer
a
musttry
for
sour
fans
o
absolutely
fantastic
glad
my
local
bottle
shop
has
this
regularly
my
first
cantillon
and
definitely
the
best
sour
beer
ive
had
to
date
this
was
awesome
and
im
so
glad
i
stopped
in
for
this
on
draft
cantillon
is
becoming
scarce
around
here
so
whenever
it
pops
up
either
in
bottle
or
on
draft
i
have
to
get
my
hands
on
it
bought
this
one
while
in
brussels
directly
from
the
brewery
it
was
bottled
on
november
10
2011
the
color
is
red
or
if
you
prefer
dark
pink
nice
pink
foamy
head
thrones
on
top
of
it
the
aroma
is
typical
of
cantillon
this
is
their
signature
aroma
cherry
are
present
in
the
nose
but
only
mildly
taste
is
intriguing
i
would
have
expected
more
cherry
than
this
not
sugary
as
the
other
ones
i
tasted
in
the
past
tart
but
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
what
surprise
me
from
this
brewery
it
is
very
tart
but
in
a
good
way
ive
had
some
vinegar
gueuze
or
lambic
but
so
far
from
cantillon
i
only
got
excellent
beers
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
mild
level
of
carbonation
it
is
fairly
well
done
for
the
style
and
very
much
lives
up
to
my
expectations
of
a
cantillon
offering
very
nice
and
tart
with
lots
of
funk
wouldnt
have
it
any
other
way
solid
the
5
abv
is
perfectly
integrated
in
this
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
thirsty
it
makes
me
overall
very
nice
sour
the
cherries
taste
good
but
could
go
for
a
little
more
of
that
action
o
a
delicious
beer
one
of
the
few
krieks
you
can
find
made
with
traditional
methods
and
ingredients
the
tartness
and
the
sweet
cherry
flavors
complement
each
other
excellently
ill
definitely
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
at
some
point
500th
review
750
ml
bottle
into
tulip
bottled
aug
28
2007
pours
fairly
clear
blood
red
color
with
a
minimal
thin
red
head
with
surprising
retention
as
i
swirl
it
small
bubbles
slowly
cascade
to
the
top
some
nice
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
big
sour
and
tart
cherries
cider
vinegar
wet
hay
funk
oak
yeast
spices
and
big
acidity
fantastic
aromas
with
great
strength
taste
of
big
tart
cherries
light
cider
vinegar
hay
barnyard
funk
oak
and
light
yeast
spices
extremely
tart
cherry
finish
that
turns
into
a
puckering
sour
acidity
after
the
finish
that
lasts
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
lingering
notes
of
cherry
cider
vinegar
oak
and
light
spiciness
on
the
finish
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
lightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
as
i
was
expecting
high
acidity
limits
the
drinkability
but
this
is
incredibly
enjoyable
to
sip
on
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
as
expected
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
kriek
lambic
with
a
ton
of
great
tart
cherry
flavor
if
it
had
more
carbonation
it
probably
would
have
scored
even
higher
o
the
first
couple
drinks
of
this
beer
blows
you
away
with
sour
tartness
after
a
while
you
get
adjusted
and
are
able
to
appreciate
some
of
the
other
finer
nuances
going
on
with
it
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
appreciate
it
for
something
different
and
realize
that
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
me
ive
had
it
a
handful
of
times
now
and
ive
always
thought
this
was
perfect
clearly
it
is
this
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
huge
white
head
the
bartenders
had
two
pictures
going
allowing
the
foam
to
settle
because
the
beer
was
pouring
with
way
to
much
head
the
smell
is
slightly
funky
more
so
on
the
earthy
side
than
the
horse
blanket
side
that
is
followed
by
cherries
very
tart
cherries
te
flavor
is
very
similar
but
the
funk
is
pretty
well
covered
up
by
the
sourness
and
big
tart
cherry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
puckering
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
truly
excellent
kriek
i
like
it
more
than
3f
and
hanssens
o
really
liked
this
one
not
as
crazy
in
your
face
funky
as
the
lou
pepekriek
but
a
great
kriek
nonetheless
poured
blood
red
with
a
nice
pink
head
great
retention
with
some
substantial
density
nose
has
some
sour
cherry
mild
chlorophenols
and
some
typical
but
somewhat
subdued
cantillon
funk
tastes
of
more
sour
cherries
akin
to
an
amped
up
handful
of
sour
patch
kids
some
oak
really
funky
and
complex
sour
as
hell
mouthfeel
extremely
high
puckerinducing
capabilities
drying
and
cleaning
mouthfeel
a
pseudopalate
cleanser
borders
on
palate
shredder
a
great
lambic
very
tasty
and
appetizing
gets
me
pumped
to
try
the
lou
pepe
kriek
at
some
point
blood
red
colour
ring
of
pinkishwhite
head
some
lace
left
as
well
smell
is
very
tart
funky
and
yeasty
cherry
and
some
balsamic
notes
as
well
some
notes
of
hayearthy
grass
are
there
but
quite
subtle
taste
is
of
very
tart
cherries
incredibly
sour
and
whacks
you
straight
in
the
face
fruity
funky
and
yeasty
sour
notes
are
felt
for
a
while
after
swallowing
as
well
medhigh
carbonation
puckering
and
fairly
dry
mediumfull
body
this
was
quite
a
pleasure
really
enjoyed
this
needless
to
say
i
would
revisit
this
as
often
as
possible
o
beautiful
beer
that
is
delicately
balanced
it
tastes
and
feels
wonderful
cherries
n
funk
not
as
tart
as
say
their
rose
de
gambinus
the
flavor
and
tartness
just
work
perfectly
my
favorite
cantillon
so
far
i
could
drink
this
every
week
if
it
werent
for
the
high
price
tag
i
probably
wont
be
able
to
drink
krieks
or
hell
even
most
lambics
in
the
same
way
ever
again
overall
spectacular
just
awesome
mouthfeel
is
bright
and
carbonated
overall
an
amazing
brew
i
understand
why
its
so
coveted
based
on
factors
other
than
smell
this
would
get
a
solid
a
in
my
opinion
but
that
nose
is
funky
love
this
one
of
the
best
krieks
ive
had
highly
drinkable
this
my
first
time
trying
a
cantillon
beer
and
im
not
disappointed
just
a
wonderful
well
balanced
beer
like
all
great
beers
balance
is
the
key
to
this
one
the
flavors
all
work
together
and
are
unique
recognizable
but
exceptionally
well
blended
the
smell
stands
out
and
i
just
love
the
lambic
funk
giving
way
to
such
a
dry
finish
that
makes
you
crave
another
sip
o
this
is
very
very
good
balanced
tart
funky
easy
drinking
i
can
understand
why
these
are
so
hard
to
come
by
this
bottle
is
the
2005
vintage
and
courtesy
of
weirdbeer
thanks
joe
it
pours
a
medium
bodied
cloudy
cherry
pie
red
in
color
with
a
slightly
pink
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
pure
funk
with
barely
any
fruit
at
all
you
can
still
tell
its
cherry
but
the
fruit
is
no
longer
fresh
and
vibrant
the
flavors
too
are
pure
sourness
funk
bacteria
and
acidic
it
strips
the
enamel
off
my
teeth
its
very
good
and
is
one
agressive
drinker
it
leaves
your
mouth
desiring
more
and
more
cherry
this
is
a
premium
kriek
and
a
great
beer
to
try
this
is
the
freshest
cantillon
kriek
ive
had
to
date
all
the
cantillon
krieks
and
rose
de
gambrinus
ive
had
have
been
26
years
in
bottle
age
and
i
much
prefer
this
younger
fresh
versions
the
fruit
is
much
more
prounced
and
the
acidity
is
total
in
balance
with
the
beer
though
it
was
only
a
375ml
it
never
became
harsh
on
the
stomach
i
feel
i
coulda
easily
drank
a
750ml
of
this
fresh
on
my
own
with
or
without
food
amazing
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
i
prefer
higher
abv
beers
but
this
packs
in
the
flavor
nonetheless
one
of
the
better
lambics
ive
had
cantillion
kriek
pours
a
spot
on
solid
cherry
color
theres
just
a
wispy
crown
of
rose
tinged
foam
that
shows
a
little
bit
of
staying
power
but
is
a
bit
lacking
in
the
lacing
department
the
nose
is
very
interesting
its
a
fairly
even
blend
of
earthy
brett
funk
notes
of
oakwood
and
a
definite
sour
cherry
aroma
the
flavor
dials
up
the
sour
and
the
cherries
are
a
little
bit
more
prominent
as
well
it
tastes
like
a
soured
beer
with
cherries
as
opposed
to
what
came
across
as
just
slightly
tart
cherry
in
the
nose
the
notes
of
earth
and
wood
from
the
aroma
carry
through
from
the
aroma
and
fill
out
the
beer
nicely
the
mouthfeel
feels
pretty
much
identical
to
the
rose
de
gambrinus
i
just
had
the
body
is
very
dried
out
and
the
carbonation
is
active
though
stops
a
bit
short
of
being
truly
bubbly
in
general
i
prefer
beers
made
with
rasperries
to
ones
with
cherries
but
i
think
i
preferred
cantillon
kriek
to
rose
de
gambrinus
as
i
think
it
made
much
better
use
of
its
fruit
o
great
beer
would
drink
again
this
beer
to
me
epitomizes
fruit
over
funk
and
though
i
usually
prefer
lambics
that
emphasize
the
latter
i
really
enjoyed
this
not
endlessly
fascinating
or
especially
complex
but
a
delicious
beer
nonetheless
please
note
that
my
point
values
are
purely
a
best
guess
as
i
tried
this
beer
a
month
ago
i
do
know
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
just
not
sure
what
points
i
would
give
it
until
i
try
it
again
ive
strayed
from
sours
for
so
long
however
i
couldnt
resist
ordering
my
first
cantillon
when
it
was
offered
on
tap
here
at
the
wealth
of
riches
kickoff
event
at
the
blue
dog
in
chalfont
pours
a
brilliant
vibrant
yet
cloudy
rose
color
with
a
minimal
head
the
nose
is
dominated
by
vinegar
only
the
faintest
cherry
pushes
through
the
taste
is
sour
but
seemingly
only
because
of
the
vinegaresque
qualities
from
the
aforementioned
nose
i
had
raspberry
tart
last
night
and
felt
that
it
was
both
sweet
and
sour
this
is
just
sour
for
the
sake
of
being
sour
but
thats
cool
i
get
it
glad
i
tried
it
o
the
best
kriek
i
have
had
so
far
the
aroma
and
taste
is
excellent
it
just
get
to
be
a
bit
much
at
times
this
is
an
extremely
slow
but
satisfying
sipper
my
stomach
may
have
a
hole
in
it
now
awesome
fruity
and
acetic
tartness
with
good
barnyard
woven
throughout
a
more
tart
and
fruity
kriek
than
say
boon
or
drie
fonteinen
recommended
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
its
really
a
shame
that
cantillon
is
becoming
rather
hard
to
find
in
the
states
othis
was
a
betterthanaverage
lambic
but
it
wasnt
the
most
earthshattering
beer
i
had
over
the
weekend
o
this
was
my
first
lambic
i
wanted
to
try
the
best
so
picked
up
a
cantillon
very
disappointing
to
be
honest
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
maybe
lambics
are
just
not
for
me
but
i
dont
get
the
attraction
an
easy
to
drink
thirst
quenching
refreshing
drink
but
i
just
didnt
get
any
of
the
complexity
or
full
flavour
that
ive
read
about
overall
another
winning
beer
from
cantillon
could
do
better
if
the
cherry
flavors
were
amped
up
just
a
bit
but
this
is
an
excellent
fruit
lambic
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
others
which
are
either
too
fake
or
all
too
similar
brilliant
red
with
a
cherry
red
highlight
at
the
edges
highly
carbonated
with
a
quickly
fading
pink
head
the
beer
is
imbued
with
sweet
cherry
flavor
but
is
much
less
complex
in
the
funk
and
acidic
qualities
than
the
lp
its
a
more
simple
citric
tartness
that
tastes
kind
of
like
plum
or
grape
skin
there
only
a
little
brett
character
in
the
finish
that
gives
off
a
bit
of
a
mineral
bitterness
o
i
love
this
beer
and
wish
it
was
more
available
ive
only
had
it
3
times
but
its
never
disappointed
thats
for
sure
a
beer
and
style
that
i
wish
i
would
of
discovered
and
appreciated
much
sooner
than
i
did
as
these
are
delicious
celebrating
the
end
of
my
summer
class
with
this
beer
was
a
good
decision
calling
buttpuckery
pleasant
that
remains
to
be
seen
an
absolute
treat
of
a
kriekso
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
mediumbodied
with
great
carbonation
before
fully
warming
towards
room
temperature
leaves
a
lingering
dryness
on
the
palate
incredible
beer
overall
hopefully
i
can
try
more
of
cantillons
offerings
especially
the
lp
series
so
solid
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
cantillons
ive
had
but
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
others
like
the
lou
pepe
kreik
i
had
last
week
decent
beer
o
great
best
sour
ive
had
yet
o
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
and
they
have
yet
to
disappoint
cheers
edit
the
last
8
oz
or
so
of
the
750
were
much
more
palatable
after
getting
used
to
the
sourness
however
i
dont
think
a
beer
should
require
a
17
oz
introduction
nice
body
and
mouthfeel
pretty
silky
and
slightly
syrupy
but
not
too
heavy
o
so
worth
the
45
bucks
we
paid
defintely
a
treat
for
cantillon
fans
nobody
does
it
better
oim
blown
away
by
this
o
slightly
disappointing
worth
finding
but
not
worth
giving
up
too
much
for
good
brew
in
a
good
trade
thank
you
fairly
light
in
body
the
initial
vigorous
carbonation
diminishes
to
a
relatively
flat
brew
another
fine
understated
cantillon
offering
nicely
balanced
and
smooth
tulip
pour
and
a
cranberry
juiceruby
red
grapefruit
colored
ale
pours
out
with
a
bright
white
head
pure
awesome
the
aroma
has
some
tart
cherries
raspberry
vinegar
and
some
good
old
fashioned
funk
very
tart
cherry
taste
with
a
bitter
mouthpuckering
finish
very
dry
a
definite
sipper
this
bottle
was
a
little
on
the
older
side
and
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
and
rereview
d
this
beer
blew
my
mind
probably
the
most
sour
puckering
beer
ive
ever
had
other
krieks
and
lambics
didnt
prepare
me
for
this
absolutely
must
be
sipped
but
its
worth
it
if
you
can
handle
the
intensity
cellar
as
long
as
you
want
as
im
sure
itll
be
good
forever
i
wish
it
had
more
carbonation
to
help
moderate
the
taste
but
otherwise
this
was
a
fantastic
lambic
lighter
body
with
a
great
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
a
nonfactor
an
acquired
taste
for
sure
a
classic
o
challenging
but
so
rewarding
sort
of
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
overall
most
people
who
sampled
it
at
our
tasting
enjoyed
sips
but
a
full
bottle
would
be
out
of
the
question
o
very
nice
like
drinking
a
liquid
cherry
jolly
rancher
with
an
extra
kick
in
the
tart
department
if
youve
tried
lindemans
kriek
and
are
expecting
the
same
thing
out
of
cantillon
kriek
100
lambic
youre
coming
in
with
the
wrong
expectations
both
are
tasty
but
are
so
far
away
in
terms
of
character
that
they
might
as
well
be
on
different
planets
the
cantillon
version
is
the
truer
more
authentic
form
of
a
traditional
cherry
lambic
though
this
is
not
for
all
palates
o
solid
brew
from
cantillon
well
balanced
overall
easy
drinkability
was
able
to
spread
the
goodness
with
a
friend
who
has
never
had
a
sour
before
was
not
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
a
beer
of
this
age
it
is
a
few
steps
away
from
being
flat
but
thats
fine
given
all
of
the
acidity
like
all
cantillon
beers
it
finishes
so
so
dry
overall
this
is
the
best
kriek
that
ive
ever
had
though
there
are
notable
ones
that
i
have
yet
to
try
namely
a
few
from
drie
fontienen
supremely
drinkable
despite
its
intense
acidity
o
wonderfully
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
a
world
classic
o
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
its
good
but
i
was
expecting
a
more
powerful
and
complex
flavor
profile
and
maybe
a
bit
more
sourness
o
this
has
awesome
drinkability
it
goes
down
good
and
the
flavor
is
just
awesome
overall
i
thought
this
was
just
an
awesome
beer
it
is
my
first
cantillon
and
it
is
unlike
any
sour
that
ive
had
so
far
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
it
is
in
your
face
with
the
first
sip
this
is
an
explosive
sour
kriek
o
although
the
beer
is
very
sour
it
doesnt
have
a
funky
element
in
the
smell
or
taste
that
makes
some
beers
in
this
style
difficult
to
drink
on
the
taps
of
rattle
n
hum
had
right
after
the
lou
pepe
kriek
so
this
is
somewhat
biased
and
a
bit
by
comparison
ruby
red
good
carb
even
out
of
the
decanter
less
cherry
note
than
the
lou
but
definitely
still
evident
in
the
aroma
a
lot
more
funk
though
definite
barnyard
more
sour
and
tart
and
barnyard
tasty
but
seems
a
bit
out
of
balance
when
compared
to
the
lou
pepe
still
i
cant
complain
too
much
delicioso
overall
one
of
the
best
krieks
out
there
from
one
of
the
best
lambic
breweries
in
the
world
delicious
sour
cherry
with
a
nice
level
of
complexity
highly
recommended
for
the
style
o
my
new
favorite
lambic
sour
fruity
and
dry
everything
you
come
to
expect
from
a
world
class
lambic
and
cantillon
o
very
good
375ml
09
vintage
poured
a
bright
red
color
with
a
pinkish
head
aroma
is
funky
with
a
nice
sour
cherry
aroma
lots
of
carbonation
on
the
palate
along
with
loads
of
tart
cherry
and
fine
acidity
the
finish
is
very
dry
with
a
sweetsour
complex
going
on
not
a
whole
lot
of
cantillon
funk
on
this
one
but
plenty
of
tart
cherry
very
refreshing
o
this
beer
is
quite
delicious
probably
one
of
the
top
sour
ales
ive
ever
had
well
its
cantillon
so
it
scores
high
in
my
book
this
might
be
the
best
fruit
lambic
they
make
not
much
time
on
this
bottle
brewed
in
november
2010
pour
shows
tremendous
head
close
to
overflowing
looks
spectacular
bright
vibrant
pink
color
smell
is
tart
green
apple
and
cherry
very
dry
sourness
coming
through
with
first
sip
brett
is
evident
as
always
with
these
beers
and
it
just
works
i
prefer
the
drie
fonteinen
kriek
over
this
but
this
is
no
slouch
too
bad
we
dont
see
this
around
much
anymore
but
it
is
always
nice
to
revisit
when
you
can
just
a
great
beer
o
not
sure
if
im
a
sour
fan
i
figured
this
would
be
sweeter
and
more
cherry
flavored
like
lindemanns
kriek
but
this
one
was
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
me
a
bit
too
sour
for
my
taste
and
im
having
a
hard
time
finding
flavors
other
than
cherry
and
sour
2005
vintage
sampled
in
2011
6
years
old
the
cherries
really
faded
out
of
this
forming
a
more
sour
aciditic
shell
of
its
former
self
not
to
say
it
isnt
good
but
is
definitely
looses
the
cherry
flavors
that
i
love
so
much
about
this
beer
i
can
understand
why
this
one
is
recommended
to
drink
fresh
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
it
is
sour
and
a
little
funky
but
it
tastes
great
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
mouthfeel
the
slightest
wood
nuance
is
noticeable
very
dry
finish
to
this
sour
cherry
flavor
is
the
best
cherry
flavor
most
often
not
quite
as
stellar
as
the
lou
pepe
version
but
some
of
that
may
be
a
function
of
age
when
bottled
and
when
consumed
still
a
worldclass
example
of
the
style
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
found
each
sip
quite
easy
to
taste
when
one
first
approaches
sour
dry
beers
the
ideas
of
sourness
and
astringency
being
pleasant
seems
a
bit
strange
however
ive
found
that
when
done
right
the
sourness
and
tartness
are
similar
to
hop
bitterness
in
that
when
controlled
they
can
be
very
enjoyable
even
as
one
is
puckering
up
from
the
tartness
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
well
deserves
its
good
reputation
and
the
praise
it
has
received
from
others
ill
be
happy
to
have
it
again
i
like
it
i
updated
and
modified
my
review
and
overall
score
due
to
having
this
a
few
more
times
i
really
feel
like
this
deserves
the
updated
score
cheers
pours

red
mostly
clear
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
very
active
pink
head
persists
well
pleasantly
sour
cherry
aroma
with
funky
undertones
the
flavor
is
quite
sour

still
pleasantly
so
due
to
the
explosion
of
cherry
the
cherry
flavor
blends
nicely
with
strong
funkbarnyard

thinnish

nice

crisp

the

very
clean
tasting
complexity
sourness
and
funk
make
this
a
classic
kriek
complex
and
surprisingly
compelling
o
fantastic
beer
i
will
clean
the
shelf
next
time
i
see
this
one
nice
and
round
yet
soft
on
the
palate
not
overly
bracing
acidity
but
acidity
and
tartness
definitely
bring
this
to
a
great
level
of
complexity
tart
cherry
light
earthy
in
the
middle
with
some
barnyard
on
the
end
long
finish
sour
and
puckering
a
little
funky
but
again
a
very
distinctive
easy
drinking
lambic
a
beer
id
love
to
drink
on
a
daily
basis
if
only
i
could
find
and
afford
that
hobby
i
ended
up
getting
another
bottle
after
trying
this
and
it
was
bottled
in
late
2010
the
cherry
flavor
was
much
too
potent
and
while
it
was
very
sour
hadnt
developed
that
kickyourass
sourness
this
aged
one
had
ill
get
a
few
more
to
age
for
a
while
the
aged
one
was
far
better
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
o
a
solid
lambic
from
cantillion
and
easy
to
drink
i
was
thinking
that
it
would
be
more
sour
but
it
is
still
good
impressive
and
as
my
first
introduction
to
cantillon
i
can
understand
why
they
have
the
reputation
they
do
i
will
definitely
buy
their
more
extreme
brews
for
special
occasions
o
i
cant
imagine
a
more
drinkable
kriek
this
one
is
right
up
my
alley
excellent
really
enjoy
this
one
i
am
going
to
have
to
grab
it
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
lots
of
fun
here
d
while
this
was
not
my
favorite
cantillon
brew
by
a
long
shot
blevel
efforts
from
this
fantastic
brewery
is
still
better
than
agrade
stuff
from
many
other
breweries
the
cpj
the
taste
is
the
most
sour
thing
ive
ever
sipped
dry
and
unique
almost
like
chomping
on
a
sour
cherry
warhead
the
carbonation
delivers
the
dry
good
wetland
the
mouthfeel
that
saps
and
then
produces
saliva
in
my
mouth
is
crazy
unique
wow
the
drinkability
is
a
bit
hampered
by
the
over
the
top
flavors
but
im
loving
every
bit
of
it
wow
a
wonderful
kriek
i
had
this
on
tap
and
liked
it
a
bit
better
but
still
great
stuff
lots
of
cherry
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
more
balanced
cantillon
products
that
ive
ever
had
very
tasty
md
mouthfeel
was
biting
but
smoothed
out
quickly
with
great
aftertaste
and
a
slight
sour
burn
extremely
drinkable
with
such
a
great
balance
ddelcious
and
moderately
drinkanle
had
this
one
last
night
split
with
my
girlfriend
it
has
an
amazing
aroma
and
appearance
as
its
a
super
carbonated
dark
red
but
from
the
first
taste
its
kind
of
petrifying
its
definitely
the
most
tart
beer
ive
ever
had
and
the
sourness
of
it
really
brings
out
the
intensity
of
the
cherry
its
a
really
striking
beer
and
after
my
face
unwrinkled
from
the
first
sip
i
probably
laughed
for
a
good
minute
its
fun
to
drink
fun
to
share
and
an
awesome
blend
overall
a
really
solid
flavorful
crisp
and
complex
interpretation
of
the
style
everything
is
executed
extremely
well
definitely
a
top
notch
sour
i
would
get
again
the
cherries
used
in
this
really
provide
a
nice
contrast
and
range
for
the
fruit
the
sweet
notes
are
incredibly
lush
and
full
while
it
still
contributes
the
necessary
tart
character
the
fruit
is
still
really
there
after
a
year
on
this
as
well
id
be
curious
to
see
how
this
evolves
over
time
as
the
fruit
is
my
favorite
compliment
the
flavors
are
interesting
the
beer
is
quite
sour
and
is
not
easy
to
drink
in
high
quantities
i
do
not
suggest
that
those
who
are
new
to
sours
attempt
to
tackle
a
750
ml
bottle
of
this
on
their
own
its
not
s
beginners
sour
cherries
are
somewhat
obscured
i
wonder
if
thats
because
its
a
relatively
new
bottle
dated
jan
2010
i
do
like
the
fact
that
what
cherry
flavor
there
is
is
natural
tasting
rather
than
artificially
sweet
i
would
have
given
this
1s
across
the
board
a
few
months
ago
but
this
is
a
damn
good
sour
before
i
begin
this
review
i
would
like
to
say
this
has
been
one
of
the
absolutely
most
fantastic
beers
ive
ever
had
pours
an
extremely
bright
cherry
red
with
a
half
a
finger
head
though
it
quickly
dissipates
when
smelling
it
it
screams
of
cherry
cherry
cherry
and
some
more
cherry
you
can
definitely
smell
the
red
fruits
and
the
tartness
when
tasting
god
o
mighty
this
is
soo
tart
it
almost
makes
your
lips
pucker
at
the
front
of
your
palate
you
get
cherry
light
fruits
and
plain
of
tart
once
that
goes
away
you
get
the
taste
of
an
absolutely
perfect
lambic
cantillon
has
really
done
a
number
with
this
one
and
with
most
of
their
other
brews
it
still
has
its
effervescence
and
its
just
the
right
amount
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
i
could
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
drinkability
this
was
my
first
cantillon
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
right
now
i
am
learning
more
about
lambics
and
like
the
learning
process
this
one
is
growing
on
me
a
little
i
am
finding
that
i
like
more
sweetness
in
this
style
but
even
without
this
one
has
complexity
and
a
real
high
quality
to
it
this
wont
be
for
everyone
but
will
please
people
wanting
sour
d
half
point
knocked
off
for
the
tartness
this
is
intense
even
for
a
sour
this
is
the
original
kriek
very
sour
complex
and
refreshing
taste
just
like
the
one
i
had
as
a
sample
at
the
brewery
in
brussels
about
3
years
ago
had
this
on
tap
along
with
rose
de
gambrinus
and
it
was
so
fantastic
i
had
to
review
it
again
thought
they
may
have
poured
me
the
wrong
beer
at
first
because
when
it
arrived
it
was
a
glowing
pinkraspberry
color
much
lighter
in
color
than
i
remember
hold
it
up
to
my
nose
and
woah
awesome
bright
cherry
flavor
on
top
of
lemon
and
proper
cobwebby
earthy
woody
dewwy
sunny
country
farm
hillside
just
fantastic
maybe
this
is
a
young
keg
because
the
fruit
flavors
are
so
bright
in
the
taste
and
the
nutty
pepperyspice
notes
are
more
round
than
i
am
used
to
in
the
bottle
nevertheless
the
taste
is
tart
acidic
fruit
up
front
cherry
is
obvious
but
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
have
believed
there
were
strawberries
and
red
raspberries
in
there
too
the
base
lambic
shows
its
face
just
a
little
in
the
middle
and
finish
with
the
lemon
wood
cellar
and
earth
notes
crazy
good
silky
medium
body
that
coats
the
palate
before
being
completely
cleaned
and
wiped
away
by
the
healthy
acidity
i
could
drink
this
whole
keg
myself
wow
do
not
pass
this
up
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
see
it
on
tap
overall
great
beer
with
a
nice
depth
of
flavors
its
not
just
a
cherry
bomb
refreshing
as
well
very
drinkable
i
think
i
ended
up
polishing
at
least
600
ml
of
this
bottle
to
myself
and
i
could
have
had
much
more
the
alcohol
is
not
really
even
there
and
i
definitely
felt
full
in
a
good
way
afterwards
d
pretty
good
love
this
beer
and
drinking
it
but
its
so
sour
you
have
to
take
it
slow
great
stuff
would
love
to
have
it
again
particularly
with
this
many
years
on
it
age
this
a
couple
years
but
this
is
well
worth
owning
drinking
and
cellaring
again
this
stuff
is
seriously
sour
ive
only
ever
had
one
brew
more
sour
than
this
it
was
a
novelty
extra
sour
lambic
the
name
of
which
escapes
me
served
at
alibi
room
in
gastown
vancouver
this
makes
my
rating
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilitly
extremely
difficult
on
one
hand
its
a
wonderful
drinking
experience
simply
for
the
taste
and
smell
of
it
but
actually
consuming
the
stuff
in
quantity
is
a
bit
of
a
chore
its
marketed
as
a
thirst
quencher
and
i
cant
really
get
on
board
with
that
i
wanted
to
rate
both
m
and
d
higher
but
personally
average
is
about
right
d
yes
i
would
like
a
kriek
drinking
fountain
refreshing
delicious
d
i
really
like
sours
and
could
probably
finish
off
the
750
myself
too
sour
for
perfect
drinkability
but
its
easy
to
finish
a
goblet
very
nice
one
o
the
best
good
aging
potential
as
well
d
this
one
scares
me
to
drink
alot
because
i
am
afraid
i
could
get
gut
rot
or
something
the
kriek
lambic
pours
a
rose
color
with
good
clarity
a
nice
pinkish
very
bubbly
head
that
quickly
fades
cherries
and
grapes
are
all
i
am
getting
out
of
the
nose
pretty
fresh
smelling
taste
is
fruity
up
front
with
a
nice
sour
finish
with
just
under
a
year
on
this
brew
it
is
drinking
really
well
mouthfeel
is
sour
and
tart
drinkability
is
high
for
this
lambic
loving
the
cherry
flavors
d
quite
sessionable
and
very
good
the
best
kriek
i
ever
tried
cantillon
kriek
is
one
of
the
best
krieks
on
the
market
tart
sour
mildly
fumky
and
dry
wish
i
had
some
brie
to
let
this
beer
play
off
of
d
at
5
abv
this
beer
is
extremely
sessionable
quite
refreshing
too
would
be
great
on
a
warm
summer
day
paired
great
with
mussels
in
white
winegarlic
and
oil
the
taste
is
intense
and
packed
with
cherry
flavor
which
is
both
tart
and
has
the
cherry
skin
tannin
with
cherry
flesh
sweetness
and
sour
flavor
from
the
yeast
with
smooth
juicy
lingering
taste
with
sweetness
in
back
and
linger
sour
flavor
in
the
dry
finish
overall
i
was
so
happy
to
have
one
of
the
best
lambics
available
in
belgium
but
not
as
readily
available
near
me
i
consider
this
a
treat
to
savor
world
class
in
every
way
with
acidity
of
fruit
and
wildness
of
yeast
that
was
nice
paired
with
quiche
and
salad
at
moeder
lambic
drinkability
very
enjoyable
lambic
that
i
am
stocking
up
on
any
bottles
i
can
find
nice
and
sour
drink
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
ill
give
this
a
fair
rating
on
how
i
liked
it
but
ill
have
to
try
more
of
the
style
to
see
if
i
can
find
a
good
one
superbly
refreshing
and
drinkable
seems
like
an
excellent
front
porch
sippin
summer
session
beer
cantillon
cant
do
anything
wrong
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
one
is
a
puckeringly
sour
kriek
pours
an
almost
artificial
redrose
color
with
little
head
nose
is
tart
a
bit
of
funk
and
cherries
lots
of
cherries
this
carries
through
in
the
flavor
with
a
big
sour
smack
up
front
a
wash
of
cherry
flavor
and
a
funky
finish
great
sour
here
though
im
beginning
to
think
that
i
like
regular
geuezes
or
nonfruit
lambics
more
than
fruit
sours
the
fruit
seems
to
dull
some
of
the
sourness
overall
great
beer
here
d
a
little
tasty
if
youre
into
the
extreme
sourness
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
i
dont
mind
sours
now
and
again
this
one
just
didnt
appeal
to
me
d
pretty
good
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
it
was
tart
but
still
very
complex
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
in
the
cellar
cant
wait
to
see
what
that
does
with
some
age
on
it
this
one
is
another
solid
brew
form
cantillon
you
get
what
youd
expect
its
a
pretty
good
kriek
admittedly
i
have
little
experience
with
sours
but
this
beer
honestly
tastes
much
like
the
a
couple
of
batches
of
homebrew
i
made
that
were
wildly
infected
of
course
this
beer
looks
much
better
than
my
murky
mess
and
the
addition
of
cherries
adds
a
nice
fruity
sweetness
to
the
wild
yeasty
tartness
still
the
basic
flavor
and
character
is
very
similar
to
my
botched
smoked
porter
as
a
result
i
have
to
come
to
one
of
two
conclusions
1
cantillon
kriek
tastes
only
a
little
better
than
bad
homebrew
or
2
i
am
capable
of
making
worldclass
sours
albeit
unintentionally
because
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
for
the
sake
of
my
ego
im
going
to
assume
it
is
the
latter
drinkability
awesome
drinkability
good
ive
been
eying
this
bottle
for
a
while
now
and
just
pulled
the
trigger
on
it
it
pours
a
clear
rosy
magenta
topped
by
a
fluffy
finger
of
pinkish
foam
the
nose
comprises
cherries
shocker
cobwebs
tart
berries
and
a
touch
of
wet
hay
the
taste
ups
the
ante
in
terms
of
both
tartness
and
sourness
those
cherries
have
been
eviscerated
by
brutal
sour
demons
unleashing
a
wave
of
vinegartasting
blood
and
offal
as
they
go
must
and
cobwebs
form
pretty
quickly
on
the
grisly
scene
yikes
the
body
of
the
beer
that
is
gotta
get
things
back
on
track
here
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
feel
and
finish
overall
as
my
first
true
sour
kriek
this
thing
really
kicked
my
tongue
outta
bed
and
sent
it
off
to
basic
i
may
not
be
completely
converted
as
yet
but
i
am
really
interested
in
trying
more
of
these
things
bring
it
on
a
very
refreshing
and
rewarding
kriek
not
the
sweet
lemonade
feeling
you
can
get
from
others
of
the
sours
ive
tried
the
flavors
are
a
little
less
sweet
which
i
almost
figured
would
have
been
reversed
its
not
a
bad
thing
but
maybe
a
bit
more
vinegary
than
other
beers
i
have
tried
probably
the
best
kriek
ive
ever
had
d
this
is
a
simply
wonderful
lambic
a
truly
classic
example
of
the
style
so
as
far
as
entry
level
real
lambics
go
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
at
the
same
pricepoint
as
hanssens
artisinal
oude
kriek
however
this
guy
just
doesnt
stand
up
or
even
hold
a
candle
in
any
category
bottle
2010
on
the
cork
pours
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
fluffy
high
carbonation
whitepink
head
that
quickly
falls
to
a
collar
around
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mixture
between
sweet
cherry
goodness
mild
barnyard
medicinal
and
sourtart
lemon
the
taste
is
so
nice
the
cherries
are
there
but
not
overly
sweet
but
rather
give
a
nice
flavor
to
the
otherwise
tartsourness
of
the
beer
some
oak
along
with
barnyard
the
medicinal
notes
in
the
nose
are
pretty
much
nonexistant
in
the
flavor
to
me
light
mouthfeel
that
finishes
dryly
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
with
a
pink
foam
strong
smell
of
cherries
on
the
nose
combined
with
the
classic
almost
stablelike
smell
that
good
lambics
have
some
grassy
notes
as
well
god
i
love
the
beers
from
cantillon
the
taste
is
predictably
dominated
by
the
cherries
but
the
strong
acidity
and
sourness
that
cantillon
is
famous
for
is
also
present
in
the
mouth
its
fuzzy
and
sparkling
and
very
dry
really
like
the
rush
of
saliva
that
follows
the
dryness
of
the
beer
quality
beer
from
the
arguably
best
maker
of
lambics
in
the
world
d
i
am
in
the
midst
of
finishing
off
a
750
and
i
am
having
no
problems
i
would
however
prefer
to
share
this
with
someone
as
a
huge
fan
cantillons
this
is
far
from
the
best
i
have
had
but
it
is
still
remarkably
better
than
most
of
the
fruit
sourwilds
out
on
the
market
an
acquired
taste
maybe
but
no
less
a
classic
both
style
and
take
if
you
find
it
too
much
let
the
first
sip
roll
around
in
the
mouth
for
awhile
until
you
get
accustomed
to
the
tartness
then
you
can
really
enjoy
what
this
fine
beer
has
to
offer
but
onto
my
review
sorry
i
guarantee
it
wont
be
as
funny
as
that
one
cork
says
bottled
in
2010
so
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
honestly
this
could
be
the
freshest
bottle
of
cantillon
ive
ever
had
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
in
almost
one
pour
this
beer
is
absolutely
beautiful
very
possibly
the
most
gorgeous
glass
of
beer
ive
ever
seen
this
beer
pours
a
dark
crimson
rose
with
a
massive
pink
head
that
leaves
just
little
lines
of
pink
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
really
is
a
pretty
beer
top
notch
id
say
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
different
funks
with
sour
pie
cherries
uric
acid
lends
remnants
of
litter
box
slight
horse
blanket
mixed
with
acetic
acid
hints
of
bright
grapefruit
and
granny
apple
skins
raw
oak
lends
a
splinter
to
the
flavor
profile
underneath
all
that
funk
is
just
a
subtle
mixture
of
fleshy
sweet
bing
cherries
and
extremely
sour
pie
cherries
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
bone
dry
but
not
thin
overall
not
the
best
cantillon
ive
ever
had
but
its
definitely
better
then
80
of
most
sours
ive
had
overall
completely
dissatisfied
with
this
lambic
after
hearing
all
the
great
things
about
it
it
was
worth
to
try
it
but
was
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
and
now
upset
i
spent
the
18
on
it
the
st
louis
frambouise
was
much
much
better
m
it
drank
decent
due
to
the
powerful
sour
punch
but
every
sip
is
so
delicious
i
can
never
get
enough
of
cantillon
beers
pours
a
hazy
roserust
color
16
inch
head
of
an
offpink
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
citrus
slight
tart
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
earthiness
and
a
hint
of
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
lambic
fruit
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carboantion
level
there
is
also
a
strong
associated
tartness
tastes
of
citrus
earthiness
tart
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
grain
overall
great
aroma
and
body
concluding
thoughts
a
bit
formidable
at
first
but
once
the
mouth
adjusts
this
hybridstyle
beer
should
satisfy
both
lambic
fans
and
flemish
red
fans
alike
just
be
prepared
to
pucker
up
an
instant
delicious
cure
for
drymouth
sip
and
savor
d
high
i
use
to
be
intolerant
to
wild
and
sour
beers
i
was
wrong
d
a
refreshing
alternative
to
your
average
beer
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
but
not
too
sweet
d
a
very
nice
lambic
that
i
could
drink
more
of
because
its
not
too
sweet
seems
to
be
well
balanced
and
refreshing
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
overall
the
only
previous
cantillon
kriek
i
have
had
was
an
07
in
2011
and
i
have
to
agree
with
jean
the
beer
is
best
within
a
year
of
bottling
this
is
a
fine
fruit
lambic
prefer
this
to
the
hanssens
oude
kriek
i
recently
had
very
sour
but
delicious
d
my
favourite
lambic
to
date
i
dont
drink
fruit
lambics
much
because
i
dont
like
the
sweetness
that
some
have
but
this
was
very
well
done
i
would
reccommend
it
this
is
the
beer
i
judge
all
other
krieks
from
95
points
dpretty
easy
drinking
for
a
sour
but
i
cant
discern
the
difference
between
this
beer
and
a
flanders
red
m
d
bubbly
and
awesome
tickles
my
tongue
and
makes
my
head
think
of
cherry
flavored
champagne
very
drink
about
d
low
abv
but
such
a
strong
flavored
beer
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
it
all
night
this
half
bottle
was
more
than
enough
for
me
as
it
was
quite
acidic
sour
opens
up
a
whole
new
world
to
the
beer
drinker
and
im
digging
what
it
has
to
offer
t
sourness
is
quite
low
its
just
enough
to
go
well
with
the
tart
cherries
there
is
a
little
bit
of
wet
hay
funk
but
also
not
too
much
of
that
either
as
soon
as
the
cork
is
popped
a
potent
palate
crippling
aroma
of
sour
and
funk
hits
the
nose
and
my
mouth
immediately
begins
to
involuntarily
pucker
color
is
a
bloody
orangegrapefruit
color
fairly
murky
yet
clear
against
light
head
is
a
light
pink
bubbly
and
light
that
quickly
fades
to
a
medium
thick
cap
with
a
splotchy
film
the
strong
aroma
is
dominated
by
earthy
and
musty
notes
no
room
for
artificial
sweetness
just
some
mild
tart
cherry
otherwise
barnyard
earth
funk
must
etc
consume
the
aroma
flavor
begins
with
a
touch
of
deceptive
tart
cherry
fruitiness
before
deceptively
and
monotonically
increasing
in
sour
funk
by
the
finish
turning
your
mouth
inside
out
and
leaving
you
salivating
from
the
dryness
mouthfeel
is
soft
lightly
carbonated
with
an
endlessly
lasting
sour
finish
ridiculously
sour
but
still
with
some
interesting
real
fruit
undertones
and
musty
funky
earthiness
not
a
beginners
lambic
or
one
to
tackle
a
750
alone
but
uniquely
hits
the
spot
when
you
want
to
abuse
your
palate
if
this
was
not
9
bills
a
glass
i
would
be
all
over
this
this
young
keg
is
much
more
drinkable
than
an
old
bottle
and
more
to
my
liking
d
i
am
in
awe
of
what
again
is
a
world
class
brew
from
a
world
class
brewery
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
its
about
the
buggiest
thing
out
there
id
drink
it
all
day
a
very
good
cherry
flavored
lambic
with
true
fruity
character
and
cleanly
controlled
beer
character
throghout
this
beer
makes
every
sip
more
and
more
inviting
highly
drinkable
aside
from
sour
intensity
my
first
cantillon
beer
ever
pours
a
beautiful
red
with
a
nice
pink
head
once
this
beer
was
corked
i
got
so
much
cherry
scent
i
love
cherries
and
i
got
a
ton
when
the
beer
was
held
up
to
my
nose
i
still
got
a
lot
of
sweetness
followed
by
tons
of
funk
and
sour
notes
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sour
cherry
the
cherry
is
so
obvious
followed
by
amazing
sour
flavors
the
mouthfeel
remains
tart
and
crisp
with
amazing
drinkability
fresh
v
aged
two
entirely
different
beers
the
2006
was
possibly
the
most
extreme
sour
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
feel
was
thick
and
syrupy
the
2010
is
light
and
lively
with
less
sour
and
more
fruit
in
the
taste
both
are
very
good
but
i
gotta
lean
to
the
fresh
version
at
least
for
now
to
drinkability
very
good
but
make
sure
to
have
plenty
of
dark
chocolate
on
hand
to
complement
the
sour
cherry
flavor
dvery
nice
complexity
not
a
very
evident
cherry
flavor
i
would
drink
this
again
drinkability
overall
this
ones
pretty
decent
the
fruit
has
almost
completely
disappeared
leaving
a
tart
complex
brew
i
was
expecting
something
over
the
top
sour
but
got
something
fairly
smooth
overall
nice
brew
d
while
the
flavor
is
good
i
am
finding
the
intense
sourness
making
this
a
bit
one
dimensional
d
while
i
do
enjoy
the
sourness
of
this
beer
it
is
not
something
i
would
tackle
a
whole
750
of
by
myself
that
said
its
a
cantillon
beer
so
ill
still
never
turn
it
down
as
for
drinkability
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
open
more
than
one
750ml
bottle
in
a
sitting
but
i
would
have
gladly
finished
the
entire
bottle
myself
had
i
not
been
sharing
it
with
my
wife
i
most
certainly
will
be
drinking
this
beer
again
d
a
very
nice
lambic
i
thought
it
smelled
great
and
had
some
nice
sour
cherry
to
the
taste
would
try
again
drinkabilitythis
beer
is
a
great
sour
beer
its
just
tart
and
sour
and
cherries
with
no
off
flavors
wow
this
beer
is
a
real
onslaught
to
the
senses
pours
a
murky
cherry
with
a
fluffy
pink
head
and
nominal
lacing
the
nose
here
is
incredible
lots
of
funk
huge
horse
blanket
and
barn
floor
qualities
the
big
cherry
and
tartness
qualities
come
through
but
the
funk
is
huge
the
cherries
play
a
much
larger
role
on
the
palate
with
the
tartness
coming
through
on
the
front
and
lingering
in
the
finish
the
funk
is
definitely
there
but
nowhere
near
as
pronounced
as
on
the
nose
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
which
is
probably
just
enough
the
first
glass
is
ridiculous
d
this
frankly
is
fantastic
beer
delicious
incredible
lactic
acid
and
funk
flavours
that
just
begs
another
sip
to
be
taken
i
went
through
this
so
fast
the
acidity
and
fruit
flavour
were
to
die
for
my
brother
opened
up
a
bottle
of
mersault
at
the
same
time
and
while
i
love
white
burgs
and
it
was
a
good
wine
the
difference
in
overall
complexity
between
the
two
was
striking
and
clear
in
the
cantillons
favour
for
something
that
was
half
the
price
a
must
try
if
its
available
about
as
perfect
as
a
fruit
lambic
gets
i
think
the
age
is
well
apparent
in
the
complexity
of
this
beer
as
high
a
quality
of
lambic
beer
that
this
is
i
have
to
say
i
really
didnt
understand
it
not
an
enjoyable
experience
whatsoever
this
was
just
oppressively
sour
and
was
a
chore
to
get
through
instead
of
sour
fresh
cherries
i
just
got
well
sour
well
made
but
definitely
not
my
thing
i
might
try
it
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
a
different
batch
works
for
me
but
as
for
now
ill
have
to
count
myself
among
those
who
just
dont
dig
authentic
lambics
d
this
is
a
rough
one
in
small
doses
this
is
an
interesting
and
pretty
tasty
beer
the
full
bottle
is
ending
up
being
a
bit
much
gotta
find
something
to
counteract
this
acidity
before
i
attempt
to
lay
down
for
bed
tonight
d
not
something
id
drink
regularly
but
it
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
d
i
was
expecting
to
like
this
not
love
it
i
was
wrong
so
delicious
fresh
i
am
psyched
to
go
home
and
see
how
a
bottle
with
some
time
on
it
is
doing
a
true
work
of
art
this
this
cheers
to
cantillon
drinkability
is
very
good
right
now
i
think
with
more
sourness
it
could
change
the
whole
landscape
of
this
beer
so
im
curious
to
find
an
older
bottle
and
compare
d
enjoyable
and
not
overly
acidic
but
the
sourness
really
builds
as
it
warms
d
about
as
good
as
a
sour
can
be
good
mouth
puckering
sour
but
not
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
good
beer
nonetheless
as
i
keep
falling
harder
and
harder
for
beers
of
this
style
not
to
mention
my
wallet
p
s
after
pounding
on
my
mouth
and
esophagus
for
a
while
it
went
to
work
on
my
stomach
and
gave
me
diarrhea
if
you
like
kriek
or
sour
beers
buy
this
one
and
revel
in
a
masterpiece
yes
im
gushing
but
this
beer
deserves
it
i
noticed
about
half
way
through
my
first
pour
that
jean
van
roy
says
to
let
it
breath
at
room
temp
for
12
hour
first
i
definitely
felt
the
second
pour
was
better
d
great
lambic
very
available
and
not
too
pricey
love
this
beer
overall
this
beer
is
insanity
bottled
but
oh
so
good
the
sourness
is
unrestrained
but
clean
and
still
retains
some
fruitiness
really
refreshing
beer
enjoyed
the
beer
and
think
its
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
drank
12
fl
oz
corked
and
capped
bottle
served
at
52
degrees
in
my
allagash
chalice
bottled
on
28
october
2008
indicated
on
the
back
label
poured
the
color
of
pomegranate
with
a
semihazy
clarity
a
half
inch
loose
offwhite
head
quickly
dissipated
into
a
skim
no
lacing
on
this
one
clusters
of
bubbles
adhered
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
sizzled
and
effervesced
in
solution
the
nose
screams
tart
cork
choke
cherries
a
musty
quality
and
a
hint
of
citric
acid
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
the
cherries
are
masked
by
the
citrus
acidity
and
expresses
itself
as
salty
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
while
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
bone
dry
finish
it
is
so
tart
that
it
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
along
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
while
its
in
the
mouth
and
keeps
going
after
the
swallow
ive
had
more
gueuzes
than
lambics
however
i
found
this
lambic
to
be
much
tarter
than
most
gueuzes
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
very
nice
and
quite
refreshing
and
enjoyable
pleasant
mouthfeel
very
well
carbonated
nothing
too
excessive
and
leaves
a
lasting
soury
freshness
in
your
mouth
very
easy
to
drink
some
people
might
find
the
sourness
to
be
a
problem
but
i
personally
love
great
beer
d
despite
the
powerful
sourness
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
its
almost
difficult
to
take
the
time
to
slowly
sip
and
savor
each
drop
though
given
my
anticipation
i
did
end
up
thinking
that
maybe
it
seemed
a
little
too
straightforward
the
tastes
are
painted
with
a
bold
brush
and
some
of
the
details
kind
of
seem
to
get
lost
as
a
result
its
also
quite
expensive
where
i
am
tokyo
nonetheless
a
nice
beer
and
a
great
change
from
oversweetened
fruit

pinkish
red
light
white

the
head
is
appropriartly
thin
i
smell
funk
oak
hourse
blanket
and
cheese
yup
cheese
cherry
is
a
more
apparent
flavor
the
more
this
lambic
warms
the
first
taste
that
hits
you
is
more
of
a
sensation
of
lactic
acid
followed
by
oak
and
then
very
very
tart
cherry
flavor
the
amount
of
wheat
in
the
grist
is
clear
when
you
drink
this
beer
obviously
not
too
much
hop
action
i
love
the
mouthfeel
of
a
lambic
or
geuze
for
that
matter
dry
prickly
and
super
squiky
this
lambic
would
get
a
higher
drinability
score
but
it
is
just
so
bracingly
sour
i
love
cantillon
this
lambic
would
benefit
from
a
long
sit
in
my
cellar
and
i
believe
thats
what
another
bottle
or
two
will
get
i
have
been
entirely
in
to
sours
lately
so
lets
visit
one
of
the
classics
cantillon
kriek
pours
out
an
awesome
reddish
pink
color
with
just
a
tiny
amount
of
lacing
for
head
the
nose
is
very
strong
on
the
cherry
presence
with
a
lot
of
funk
thrown
in
there
as
well
the
nose
is
certainly
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
giving
off
some
cherry
pie
like
aromas
once
we
hit
the
taste
the
sour
jumps
in
but
actually
leaves
quickly
with
the
cherry
pie
coming
back
for
another
appearance
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
juicy
yet
dry
and
really
very
complex
drinkability
is
stellar
on
this
lambic
some
have
classified
this
as
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
out
there
but
right
now
it
is
drinking
on
the
tame
side
regardless
this
is
an
absolutely
marvelous
brew
that
is
a
must
for
any
lambicwild
beer
fan
cheers
tasty
delicious
tart
dark
berry
fruits
on
the
tongue
soft
carbonation
slides
evenly
across
the
tongue
like
a
lubed
up
armadillidiidae
on
ice
with
tartness
to
boot
very
well
balanced
and
just
fun
to
drink
very
good
if
only
this
was
available
in
southern
california
and
if
only
it
wasnt
so
pricey
then
i
would
drink
it
very
often
as
one
of
my
goto
beers
varying
fresh
and
aged
bottles
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
pink
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
cherries
with
a
slight
hint
of
funk
the
flavor
is
regular
cherries
tart
cherries
oak
and
a
little
bit
of
wildnessfunk
still
the
fruit
is
the
main
attraction
of
the
beer
at
this
point
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
could
use
some
more
age
on
it
but
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
try
as
soon
after
bottling
as
possible
to
see
how
the
cherries
were
when
fresh
i
have
another
bottle
i
am
aging
a
couple
of
years
and
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
took
me
quite
awhile
to
finish
the
12oz
bottle
the
musty
tartness
was
a
bit
much
half
a
bottle
wouldve
been
great
definatly
an
acquired
taste
and
i
would
love
to
explore
some
more
of
what
cantillon
has
to
offer
i
think
any
avid
beer
enthusiast
should
try
this
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
lambic
of
lambics
and
is
just
truly
a
different
kind
of
beer
the
brewing
methods
are
also
very
interesting
to
me
color
red
cherry
nose
and
blood
even
if
it
is
not
really
pronounced
which
is
discernible
flavors
and
acid
woodland
in
the
mouth
it
is
sour
and
acid
without
being
in
abundance
as
are
the
cantillon
it
feels
as
cherries
with
pits
but
also
hints
of
fermentation
the
finish
displays
a
woody
dryness
without
being
in
abundance
which
emphasizes
the
presence
of
cherries
this
lambic
without
using
an
abundance
of
cherry
taste
or
acidity
of
the
drink
remains
extremely
refreshing
lovely
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
style
i
particularly
appreciate
that
said
this
was
a
definite
improvement
to
the
vigneronne
that
was
much
too
sour
for
my
taste
d
while
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
im
not
sure
if
i
would
want
to
drink
them
all
the
time
drinkability
a
top
notch
lambic
nice
flavor
with
plenty
of
soury
goodness
my
wife
originally
wanted
to
try
this
but
i
do
believe
im
enjoying
this
much
more
than
see
is
definitely
a
beer
i
would
love
to
have
again
only
maybe
with
a
bit
more
age
on
it
highly
recommend
we
sit
in
the
sun
one
week
until
the
great
day
a
hundred
bottles
will
be
opened
and
none
will
be
as
fine
as
this
one
this
day
this
sunlight
drinks
pretty
easy
but
due
to
the
tartness
id
be
hard
pressed
to
do
more
than
bottle
unless
i
paired
it
with
some
food
or
dessert
i
suspect
i
wouldve
liked
this
a
little
younger
glad
i
got
to
try
it
if
you
are
a
sour
beer
freak
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
more
than
i
did
overall
impression
very
complex
and
interesting
but
half
a
bottle
was
plenty
for
me
2010
more
lactic
sourness
than
09
but
still
a
very
balanced
kriek
outstanding
cherry
aroma
d
incredibly
drinkable
sessionable
veritably
quaffable
quite
possibly
the
best
kriek
lambic
i
have
ever
had
and
to
mikey711
and
arbitrator
for
the
04
and
the
08
d
this
was
delicious
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
tried
yet
this
is
another
one
that
makes
you
think
about
what
youre
drinking
i
would
definitely
pick
this
beer
up
again
m
crisp
highly
acidic
and
palatecleansing
each
sip
left
me
wanting
more
not
a
strong
beer
as
far
as
abv
is
concerned
d
overall
a
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
anytime
we
open
a
cantillon
is
a
good
time
my
first
lambic
spent
the
19
on
the
750ml
just
hoping
for
the
best
i
figured
anything
cantillon
is
a
good
way
to
start
bottle

now
for
the
taste
hits
me
right
off

with
a
sour
blast
the

is

it

if
you
threw

the

definitely
a
sipper
yet
refreshing
very
carbonated
but
the
extreme
sourness
takes
the
focus
off
that
alcohol
taste
is
a
joke
not
a
trace
of
it
you
start
to
think
youre
drinking
some
crazy
experimental
fruit
punch
instead
of
a
beer
opens
doors
in
my
mind
as
to
what
a
beer
can
actually
be
compare
this
to
a
budweiser
it
takes
a
bit
but
your
body
gets
used
to
the
sourness
this
is
still
a
mouth
destroying

a

different

something
i

my

feelings
for
this
beer
painfully
traditional
and
so
damn
good
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
hallelujah
the
finish
is
amazingly
long
and
quite
dry
it
just
goes
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
gently
echoing
the
acidic
fruit
for
what
seems
like
minutes
quite
a
ride
and
unlike
most
other
things
that
inhabit
the
world
of
beer
a
treasure
pours
a
dark
rasberrylike
colour
the
aroma
of
this
fruit
lambic
beer
is
dominant
by
rasberry
and
cherry
hints
there
was
cranberry
flavour
but
i
think
the
cherry
flavour
in
this
beer
is
dominant
decent
fruit
lambic
notes
racy
yet
simple
withdrawn
but
traditional
this
is
true
lambic
all
the
way
no
sweet
syrups
or
sugars
added

this
is
the
real
thing
i
have
had
samples
at
the
brewery
and
the
trip
that
the
bottles
have
made
produced
the
same
awesome
effect
without
a
flaw
more
samples
at
the
cantillon
brewery
brewer
told
us
the
fruit
from
this
years
batch
was
excellent
and
you
could
actually
taste
a
fresh
cherry
flavor
a
little
sweeter
than
the
gueze
from
the
fruit
and
little
less
acidic
read
one
of
the
reviews
before
mine
that
mentioned
that
it
smelled
off
kind
of
like
vinegar
with
some
barnyard
smells
but
thats
the
way
it
should
be
its
definitely
not
like
sweet
cherry
juice
like
the
lindemanns
extremely
off
smelling
aroma
dont
know
if
this
came
from
a
bad
keg
or
what
but
something
was
definitely
amiss
nose
was
warning
me
to
abort
before
the
first
sip
and
i
should
have
listened
cherry
flavor
was
there
but
overpowered
by
vinegary
tartness
to
the
point
of
puckering
brilliant
cranberry
color
tart
aroma
like
cranberry
mixed
with
sour
cherries
first
sip
is
not
as
sour
as
expected
not
at
all
dry
a
citric
flavor
is
active
more
cranberry
than
cherry
substantial
body
to
this
beer
little
moutpucker
in
finish
this
unsweetened
lambic
beer
does
have
some
residual
sweetness
deep
in
it
very
interesting
to
drink
stinky
barnyard
smell
quite
sour
and
acidic
not
too
much
fruit
characteristic
but
the
cherry
flavour
is
there
bone
dry
aswell
which
is
how
i
like
my
lambics
when
you
say
the
word
lambic
you
can
exchange
the
word
cantillon
because
cantillon
is
lambic
you
can
not
get
more
authentic
lambic
style
beer
from
anyone
this
kriek
is
dry
fruity
fizzy
sour
foxy
horse
blanket
and
earthy
lots
of
flavor
layers
and
not
for
the
lindemens
drinkers
comparing
lindemans
to
cantillon
is
like
comparing
bert
grants
imperial
stout
to
harvey
and
sons
imperial
it
may
say
they
are
the
same
style
but
they
are
two
very
different
beers
raspberry
and
cherry
nose
wet
compost
over
ripe
fruit
and
citrusy
tartness
this
looks
like
a
sparkling
rose
with
foam
and
combines
the
delicate
champagne
bubbles
with
the
beer
body
and
fluffy
rapicly
dissipating
pinkish
white
head
it
is
tart
lemony
fresh
funky
with
raspberry
and
cherry
flavors
very
refreshing
one
of
the
prettiest
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
the
ruby
red
color
really
is
pronounced
i
was
slightly
off
put
by
the
smell
with
hints
of
vinegar
but
the
taste
put
any
concerns
to
rest
amazing
raspberry
flavor
with
a
sharp
tart
finish
overall
its
cantillon
so
the
chances
of
this
one
being
a
duffer
were
always
going
to
be
pretty
low
bear
in
mind
though
that
this
is
not
your
typical
framboise
if
youre
after
something
sweet
andor
syrupy
then
youre
most
definitely
in
the
wrong
place
on
the
other
hand
if
youre
a
fan
of
gueuze
or
sour
beers
in
general
then
this
is
worth
the
asking
price
and
then
some
balanced
tart
complex

a

sweetness
quickly
swept
away
by
mouth
watering
and
tart
bite
lingering
amazing
not
too
sweet
an
epic
sour
mouthfeel
a
luxury
level
equal
to
champagne
full
luscious
and
almost
stinging
carbonation
that
arouses
the
sour
flavor
to
no
end
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
best
sour
hands
down
pours
an
absolutely
beautiful
red
raspberry
color
with
a
small
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
film
on
top
smell
has
an
interesting
dynamic
as
the
sweet
raspberries
intersect
with
that
distinct
cantillon
funk
a
little
odd
but
certainly
not
offputting
some
lemon
zest
and
oak
character
add
to
the
complexity
flavor
is
a
bunch
of
tart
raspberries
a
splendid
sourness
that
tickles
the
cheeks
oaky
dryness
on
the
finish
is
quite
splendid
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
with
some
lively
carbonation
im
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
sour
funk
fruit
all
bases
covered
here
an
outstanding
lambic
with
the
overwhelming
raspberry
taste
coming
over
massively
on
the
front
and
back
end
jammy
and
bright
bottle
pours
light
pink
with
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
light
tart
cherries
flavor
is
similar
with
a
light
tart
and
dry
cherry
finish
o
its
cantillon
and
it
is
amazing
i
hope
new
glarus
continues
to
narrow
the
gap
to
produce
beer
like
this
on
the
regular
a
good
rose
geuze
with
a
fruity
nose
possibly
my
least
fave
of
the
bunch
sadly
just
kinda
fails
to
deliver
not
a
bad
beer
but
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
less
fruity
and
displays
less
raspberry
quality
than
i
expected
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
there
are
much
better
raspberry
sours
in
the
us
that
being
said
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
still
very
complex
and
the
sour
combined
with
the
funkiness
on
the
back
end
of
the
drink
make
for
a
solid
overall
beer
very
sour
fruity
raspberry
gets
more
and
more
recognizable
after
the
first
impression
hints
of
yeast
go
well
with
the
fruit
and
dry
sourness
raspberry
is
present
from
the
beginning
till
the
end
in
a
very
pleasant
intense
way
refreshing
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
tart
acidic
character
fruit
stays
on
the
palate
for
a
long
time
very
unique
fruity
taste
in
a
pleasantly
balanced
beer
pleasant
tart
raspberry
flavor
not
overly
sour
an
outstanding
effort
purchased
at
the
brewery
during
quintessence
everything
you
would
hope
for
amazing
raspberry
character
o
everything
ive
ever
wanted
in
a
frambroise
perfect
intense
and
complex
one
thing
ive
noticed
with
cantillion
other
than
the
price
is
the
sublime
simplicity
of
taste
this
gives
a
full
raspberry
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
tart
and
sour
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
deliciously
simplistic
o
big
time
the
fruit
is
very
pronounced
lots
of
flavor
and
very
sour
not
sweet
or
syrupy
i
favor
this
over
the
kriek
or
lp
kriek
very
good
as
with
the
other
beers
from
this
wonderful
brewery
this
stands
atop
all
others
very
subtle
well
balanced
well
crafted
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
and
again
if
you
could
rate
the
label
it
would
get
a
6
0
there
are
boobs
on
the

bottle
side
by
side
with
kriek
at
brasserie
cambrinus
in
beuges
pours
bright
pinkish
red
with
a
very
small
pink
head
that
recedes
quickly
plenty
of
dry
tartness
on
the
aroma
with
light
raspberries
supplementing
lots
of
funky
acidic
gueuze
notes
flavor
follows
very
tart
and
funkymuch
more
so
than
kriekwith
a
beautiful
supplement
of
lightly
sweet
and
tart
raspberries
that
dont
overwhelm
light
bodied
very
dry
and
crisp
plus
carbonation
this
is
exactly
how
a
raspberry
lambic
should
be
note
since
this
review
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
it
on
tap
as
part
of
zwanze
day
2014
at
the
bier
station
in
kc
mo
amazing
on
tap
thanks
again
dan
the
aroma
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
lots
of
tart
under
ripe
raspberries
the
tastes
hits
that
note
the
same
way
tart
tart
tart
very
crisp
and
clean
in
the
finish
finding
this
bottle
was
a
hell
of
chore
an
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
the
flavor
is
excellent
with
raspberry
flavor
fresh
on
entry
with
light
acidic
taste
and
sour
candy
tinge
of
raspbery
with
lots
of
acidic
citrus
in
the
flavor
with
puckering
yet
bright
fruity
flavors
with
mild
hint
of
wood
and
a
nice
dry
yeast
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
perhaps
the
best
raspberry
flavored
lambic
i
have
hadi
prefer
the
way
the
taste
is
young
rather
than
some
aged
versions
i
tried
in
the
u
s
incredible
with
juicy
dimension
and
more
on
the
puckering
extreme
side
of
sourness
yet
the
dry
finish
which
is
crisp
from
the
intense
carbonation
is
refreshing
overall
im
stoked
to
be
having
this
brew
for
brunch
it
pairs
well
with
cheese
and
other
fruits
id
be
down
to
buy
it
again
as
the
bottle
looks
so
cool
and
the
tartness
inside
is
soo
tasty
o
pretty
simple
sour
not
overly
sour
just
nicely
tart
with
a
tasty
raspberry
component
clean
and
crisp
quite
tasty
when
you
pour
this
beer
its
a
deep
red
colour
with
a
large
pink
head
which
dissipates
quickly
until
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
is
left
on
the
nose
a
huge
wave
of
raspberries
a
little
bit
of
wheat
and
barley
and
some
sour
belgian
funk
notes
when
you
taste
this
beer
you
need
to
bear
in
mind
all
of
the
sugar
has
been
fermented
out
just
like
the
initial
taste
a
big
hit
of
sour
raspberries
followed
by
some
sour
and
tart
brett
belgian
funk
notes
finishing
with
some
wheat
and
malted
barley
and
bready
notes
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
quite
highly
carbonated
it
finishes
like
a
dry
white
wine
i
really
do
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
sours
are
your
thing
in
good
weather
theyre
most
definitely
a
treat
o
this
is
a
funky
fruity
fantastic
beer
o
a
great
beer
definitely
know
why
its
called
rose
not
as
fruity
as
i
wanted
but
still
good
overall
an
extremely
good
beer
only
complaint
is
that
the
taste
does
not
match
the
complexity
and
depth
of
the
scent
i
do
feel
like
this
year
is
more
cherry
and
less
sour
than
in
years
past
overall
a
really
great
beer
one
of
the
great
ones
could
be
a
little
more
tart
ooverall
a
great
lambic
first
one
in
a
long
time
thanks
to
mark
for
the
ip
trade
pours
a
reddish
pink
color
with
a
pretty
large
white
head
with
hues
of
pink
in
it
this
head
is
just
absolutely
refusing
to
go
down
the
smell
is
nice
you
can
pick
up
the
raspberry
but
its
not
overhelmingly
juicy
you
can
also
pick
up
the
sourness
lemon
white
grapes
and
some
slightly
funkiness
taste
is
sour
upfront
falls
back
to
a
raspberry
flavor
but
not
real
juicy
raspberry
skin
maybe
also
getting
some
green
apple
lemon
and
a
tiny
bit
of
funk
very
nice
tartness
at
the
end
medium
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
great
very
effervescent
this
is
very
good
a
lot
more
flavors
than
just
rasberries
i
recently
had
the
framboise
which
i
prefer
the
raspberry
was
so
huge
in
that
one
but
this
is
really
good
too
rose
de
gambrimus
thank
you
shroud0fdoom
my
first
cantillon
and
already
some
others
are
on
the
way
cant
wait
love
the
way
they
do
a
lambic
not
relying
on
the
fruit
but
working
on
the
great
lambic
part
of
their
beers
i
personally
like
the
fact
they
didnt
call
it
just
a
framboise
lambic

good
lambic
beer
from
a
brewery
that
is
always
mentioned
when
talking
about
benchmarks
for
the
style
super
light
and
refreshing
the
must
is
super
strong
as
stated
and
is
greater
on
the
drink
than
the
nose
however
i
found
this
must
to
be
a
little
intrusive
on
the
raspberries
so
i
had
to
take
a

this

and
easy

at
only
5
abv
if
you
can
handle
the
tartness
and
the
slight
touch
of
funk
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
very
nicely
done
brew
that
im
glad
i
can
get
locally
now
i
had
a
little
problem
drilling
into
the
cork
i
created
such
a
mess
that
i
felt
like
i
was
bp
luckily
for
me
none
of
the
cork
fell
into
my
beer
the
pour
of
this
beer
is
ridiculously
pretty
the
head
swelled
up
quickly
in
a
rush
of
red
juices
it
quickly
rose
to
a
climax
then
sadly
resided
ruining
the
moment
for
everyone
involved
a
thin
layer
of
head
stayed
around
my
glass
the
entire
time
but
there
wasnt
any
lacing
the
look
of
the
beer
itself
is
a
bright
gorgeous
rosemary
it
looks
very
wine
like
the
scent
is
rather
faint
but
once
you
really
stick
your
nose
in
it
you
get
this
flowery
raspberry
scent
thats
quite
lovely
i
also
get
some
sort
of
muskiness
in
the
scent
a
slightly
earthy
note
of
contrast
the
taste
is
good
but
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
more
considering
this
is
a
real
lambic
unlike
what
ive
previously
had
i
like
it
this
raspberry
citrusy
tart
flavor
but
for
the
ten
dollars
i
dunno
it
drinks
easily
however
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
so
im
drinking
it
in
gulps
i
appreciate
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
in
this
as
it
adds
another
flavor
to
accompany
the
raspberry
and
keep
it
from
being
overwhelming
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
for
ten
dollars
i
dont
know
if
id
pick
it
up
again
if
you
like
lambics
buy
it
drink
it
maybe
call
it
again
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
definitely
like
the
sourness
in
this
one
but
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
seems
to
be
lacking
some
of
the
complexity
that
other
cantillon
offerings
have
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
tasty
lambic
and
the
raspberries
are
front
and
center
i
think
i
might
pick
up
another
bottle
to
cellar
this
might
be
more
interesting
with
a
few
more
years
on
it
hv
taste
is
tart
dry
musty
like
being
in
an
abandoned
barn
during
a
rain
storm
true
story
if
you
could
taste
that
scent
raspberry
notes
blend
in
and
add
a
nice
balance
im
loving
this
beer
i
find
it
to
be
more
rounded
for
a
cantillon
beer
than
others
such
as
the
kriek
how
fortunate
i
am
to
live
so
close
to
such
a
great
brewery
going
to
crack
a
lindemanns
now
to
scoff
a
little
as
far
as
lambics
go
this
is
quite
clean
the
quality
is
certainly
present
still
not
a
favourite
style
of
mine
but
i
can
respect
it
for
what
it
is
definitely
have
to
try
more
of
these
guys
also
ive
got
to
give
some
extra
notice
to
the
bottle
i
dont
know
whats
going
on
in
this
picture
but
its
pretty
funny
d
one
is
enough
for
me

stockholm
drinkability
i
couldnt
necessarily
drink
a
large
quantity
of
this
but
if
you
gave
me
a
750
ml
bottle
i
could
spend
an
entire
evening
enjoying
it
to
the
last
drop
d
certainly
better
than
the
artificially
sweetened
framboise
on
the
market
but
not
quite
as
refined
and
delicious
as
the
lou
pepe
framboise
rose
de
gambrinus
expresses
great
i
think
near
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
rustic
barnyardiness
dances
with
sweet
raspberry
and
tart
raspberry
with
a
touch
of
earth
and
spice
in
the
nose
taste
is
acetic
at
first
which
seems
to
open
up
my
taste
buds
to
receive
the
essence
of
the
place
it
was
made
and
the
fruit
it
was
made
with
a
wonderfully
expressive
beer
with
a
medium
body
that
is
supremely
refreshing
the
balance
here
seems
to
be
natural
as
well
lambics
can
be
too
sweet
especially
when
they
are
targeted
at
the
american
market
and
sometimes
too
sour
this
is
a
gentle
and
elegant
example
of
one
of
the
most
intriguing
styles
of
beer
available
highly
recommended
d
not
my
favorite
cantillon
beer
but
i
blame
that
on
the
raspberries
still
one
of
the
classics
poured
a
pinkish
red
with
a
nic
thin
bubbly
head
that
left
a
little
sticky
lacing
big
acidic
sour
aromas
with
slight
vinegar
barrel
funk
and
citrus
accents
really
no
sign
of
the
raspberries
on
the
nose
very
nice
mouth
puckering
sour
flavors
which
consisted
of
acidic
citrus
slight
vinegar
oak
barrel
barnyard
funk
and
very
faint
raspberries
peep
through
the
sour
ingredients
the
beer
was
medium
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
great
sweet
but
very
sour
and
dry
finish
lovely
sour
cantillon
signature
beer
that
always
makes
me
happy
to
have
it
i
will
always
enjoy
the
rose
this
was
amazing
the
raspberry
had
faded
heavily
but
this
was
amazing
i
would
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
all
day
every
day
d
call
me
masochistic
but
i
love
the
strong
sour
notes
perhaps
not
cantillons
best
but
getting
through
a
750ml
is
no
trouble
and
i
would
have
no
objections
to
diving
into
another
d
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
lambic
nonetheless
they
captured
the
rosé
flavor
well
but
i
would
like
my
lambics
sweeter
please
d
so
good
just
simply
amazing
abv
is
easy
but
the
bugs
might
get
ya
drinks
well
id
say
its
refreshing
at
points
but
the
sheer
sourness
makes
it
pretty
hard
to
quaff
id
suggest
enjoying
it
over
the
course
of
about
an
hour
this
is
probably
the
2nd
best
raspberry
lambic
ive
had
now
if
i
had
a
pen
and
paper
when
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
hommage
youd
probably
see
it

raspberr
finishing
dry
its
toned
down
a
bit
for
cantillon
causing
a
lack
in
the
wow
department
it
would
be
a

beer
to
toast
or

with
in
the

a

love
the

what
really
sets
this

the

i
could
have
several

oh

that

raspberries
have
definately
dwindled
out
and
the
fruit
is
subtle
i
absolutely
adore
aged
lambic
and
this
is
a
perfect
reason
why
the
1000
different
flavors
just
reach
every
corner
of
my
mouth
and
the
sourness
is
like
a
bag
of
raspberry
sour
punch
kids
taking
over
one
of
the
best
aged
cantillons
ive
had
ive
had
this
in

collection
for
a

and
to
be
honest
totally
forgot
i
had
it
thought
id
give
it
a
goit
pours
a

see

has
a
very
up

aroma

raspberriescherries
and
sour
lolliesthe
taste
is
very
sour
indeed
and
more
sour
than
i
was
expecting
almost
like
sucking
on
a
sour
warhead
with
a
nice
light
spritzy
sessionable
mouthfeel
that
has
nice
tastes

gummi

and
a

yeasty
taste
right
at

endoverall
a

lambic
but
i
definately
couldnt
have
any
more
than
the
750ml
bottle
i
have
before
menice
though
in
terms
of
balance
this
seems
very
similar
to
the
kriek
with
a
more
dominant
fruit
aspect
than
youll
find
in
beers
like
lou
pepe
framboise
kriek
or
fou
foune
its
not
my
favourite
cantillon
but
holy
smokes
is
this
a
good
summer
beer
if
you
like
fruit
and
funk
this
is
for
you
cantillon
enough
said
right
this
is
the
benchmark
for
framboise
lambic
d
it
started
out
easy
but
was
hard
to
finish
due
to
the
tartness
overall
a
nice

brew
but
not

the

very
heavy
on
the
raspberries
with

are
some
oak

in
the
beer
but
this
is
definitely
a

the

tasted
that
night
this
was
the
least
enjoyable
by
far
this
lambic
pours
a
beautiful
rich
red
hue
with
the
typical
cantillon
smallish
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
walking
through
a
field
of
raspberry
bushes
fresh
raspberry
juice
tart
fruit
hay
and
a
general
smell
of
being
outside
on
a
farm
in
the
summertime
how
do
they
do
that
this
beer
tastes
fabulous
a
great
blend
of
sweet
raspberry
with
a
heavy
barnyard
funk
this
beer
like
all
cantillon
brews
is
much
more
sour
than
sweet
which
i
find
preferable
there
is
a
mild
acidity
present
in
the
finish
overall
a
terrific
beer
and
one
i
always
stock
in
my
cellar
j
d
this
is
a
sipper
for
those
new
to
the
style
but
it
goes
down
easy
great
taste
one
that
i
would
surely
get
again
overall
this
is
as
close
as
i
have
had
to
a
true
dessert
lambic
without
the
flavorings
that
lindemans
infuses
into
theirs
loveliness
pours
a
blood
red
color
with
minimal
head
scent
is
of
tart
raspberrys
lemon
herbal
and
mild
funkyness
and
earth
very
tart
raspberry
tasting
hints
of
earth
and
funk
some
herbalness
to
it
along
with
touches
of
sour
lemon
and
grape
tastes
straight
from
the
vine
light
bodied
adequate
carbonation
dry
and
tart
a
very
nice
beer
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
cantillon
offerings
but
very
nice
none
the
less
d
with
limitation
to
be
enjoyed
in
a
wine
fashion
im
very
interested
what
will
become
of
the
second
bottle
after
a
year
color
red
blood
good
woody
nose
on
the
palate
the
purity
and
naturalness
of
raspberry
tart
resort
in
control
when
it
also
detects
a
hint
of
vanilla
a
taste
of
cork
rather
impressive
on
the
back
when
you
feel
the
taste
buds
in
the
power
of
tannins
a
raspberry
lambic
well
controlled
that
offers
both
acidity
and
sweetness
of
the
raspberries
with
the
power
and
complexity
of
wood
tannins
d
at
only
5
abv
this
is
my
kind
of
session
brew
a
bit
pricey
but
i
just
love
this
style
d
very
complex
and
nice
an
excellent
brew
from
cantillon
thoroughly
enjoyed
2008
vintage
right
away
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
a
good
beer
ive
had
some
other
lambics
06
cantillon
kriek
that
were
far
too
sour
for
my
taste
but
this
brew
hits
the
mark
for
me
dark
pink
salmoncolored
brew
very
opaque
doesnt
have
much
head
at
first
before
it
explodes
with
a
billowy
light
pink
head
aroma
is
tart
and
full
of
raspberries
sour
taste
takes
over
at
first
before
a
carbonated
fruitiness
takes
over
from
the
raspberries
finishes
a
with
a
mouthpuckering
tart
sweetness
a
damn
sour
brew
but
its
not
so
overwhelming
that
it
makes
the
beer
a
chore
if
this
brew
were
any
older
it
would
probably
be
too
far
gone
for
me
yum
i
have
to
admit
i
was
expecting
something
more
aggressive
and
sour
but
expectations
aside
this
was
not
disappointing
if
anything
the
sweetness
hurts
the
drinkability
but
only
by
a
hair
and
likely
only
by
my
standards
this
is
a
musttry
lambic
interesting
to
compare
to
fresh
rose
de
gambrinus
which
they
were
also
pouring
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
not
enough
raspberry
flavor
for
me
to
consider
it
the
best
of
the
framboise
category
though
it
is
however
one
of
the
better
sour
lambics
i
have
had
this
one
almost
can
just
be
called
a
gueuze
rather
than
a
fruit
beer
id
share
this
friends
its
much
to
harsh
to
drink
an
entire
bottle
alone
3
champagne
flutes
were
more
then
enough
i
was
blessed
i
was
able
to
try
such
an
extreme
and
sour
beer
however
i
doubt
ill
be
paying
13
again
to
torture
my
throat
flavor
not
much
fruit
is
left
at
all
its
pretty
much
a
straight
tart
lemon
flavor
now
crisp
light
body
carbonated
tartness
is
very
close
to
lemon
but
even
at
this
vintage
it
hasnt
gone
down
hill
yet
i
would
guess
the
brett
has
just
about
eaten
most
of
what
sweetness
there
was
taste
is
a
nice
combination
of
funk
and
barnyard
mixed
with
raspberries
the
sour
is
at
a
level
at
which
i
can
appreciate
it
not
acidic
more
a
mild
citric
acidity
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
for
warm
weather
and
today
this
is
one
of
those
days
after
swallowing
the
beer
has
a
bit
sharpness
dtoo
sour
to
drink
a
ton
of
but
perfect
with
food
after
doing
the
first
part
of
the
review
i
had
a
chocolate
eclair
and
this
beer
cut
the
sweetness
perfectly
brilliant
beer
next
review
overall
another
solid
beer
from
cantillon
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
is
very
sour
i
can
imagine
aging
this
would
be
fine
as
well
very
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
d
ultimately
drinkable
stuff
i
would
give
it
a
5
if
not
for
the
1012oz
price
well
worth
it
to
indulge
in
occasionally
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
the
beer
changes
character
so
drastically
during
different
parts
of
the
swallow
that
it
makes
for
a
very
interesting
experience
whew
this
is
quite
the
eye
and
palate
opener
even
my
hips
seem
looser
after
this
i
must
inform
my
yogi
girlfriend
posthaste
like
having
those
sour
tart
candies
for
the
first
time
as
a
kid
that
said
i
liked
it
but
it
could
have
used
just
a
wee
bit
more
sweetness
to
offset
the
main
event
here
it
did
however
go
well
enough
natch
with
some
belgianstyle
frites
overall
a
quality
offering
from
cantillon
and
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
sometime
wild
artwork
too
refreshing
and
raw
long
live
traditional
lambics
feel
and
drinkability
body
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
but
it
comes
through
as
lightly
spritzy
the
longer
it
sits
in
the
glass
the
less
noticable
the
carbonation
becomes
still
its
champagne
like
as
far
as
feel
goes
which
is
perfect
for
the
style
as
aforementioned
this
beer
is
dry
in
the
finish
works
perfectly
with
the
feel
of
the
carbonation
feel
couldnt
possibly
get
any
better
this
is
right
this
one
is
a
good
drink
ill
not
have
a
problem
drinking
the
rest
of
the
bottle
however
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
lindemans
im
not
so
sure
that
this
is
the
one
for
you
it
is
extremely
different
this
is
one
that
ill
consider
buying
again
i
just
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
very
good
though
and
highly
recommended
pours
an
orangered
with
a
minimal
head
nose
of
funk
cherries
currants
and
something
very
pronounced
that
i
cant
pick
out
something
a
little
weird
going
on
flavor
is
vinous
blackberry
and
raspberry
cranberry
orange
nice
tart
finish
a
wet
feel
and
low
carbonation
first
off
drinkability
off
the
charts
here
this
beer
is
tart
and
then
sour
nice
carbonation
on
the
tongue
im
enjoying
the
combination
of
the
different
sour
flavors
much
more
than
i
did
with
the
kreik
this
is
a
great
great
beer
d
because
this
one
isnt
so
tart
or
sour
or
whatever
it
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
suck
down
i
was
hoping
this
thing
would
give
me
bitter
beer
face
but
it
did
not
maybe
thats
a
good
thing
not
sure
but
i
expected
to
be
cringing
with
every
delicious
sip
on
this
one
d
overall
an
excellent
frambroise
highly
drinkable
and
wont
destroy
the
palate
for
the
rest
of
the
night
serious
authentic
lambic
from
cantillon
perfect
choice
for
the
sour
beer
fans
but
just
for
them
d
good
fruit
lambic
quite
a
bit
of
sourness
slows
you
down
a
bit
but
is
pretty
refreshing
definitely
would
like
more
of
this
recommended
thick
color
of
raspberries
under
a
fleeting
foamy
white
head
funky
sour
raspberry
aroma
sharp
tart
sweetness
notes
of
vinegar
iron
hay
and
must
intensely
sour
flavor
of
berries
cherries
and
fresh
green
apple
some
dusty
funk
woodenness
prickly
acidity
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
lambic
highly
acidic
and
drying
winelike
in
some
ways
mmmmm
love
the
sour
stuff
honestly
a
little
disappointed
it
was
so
close
to
being
nearly
perfect
i
love
raspberries
and
the
sour
funkiness
but
its
not
quite
as
much
raspberry
as
id
hoped
im
now
on
the
hunt
for
framboise
because
i
know
this
can
be
the
perfect
combo
it
just
misses
here
d
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
stuff
but
i
found
it
to
be
better
in
a
bottle
i
like
it
off
the
tap
but
i
feel
its
lost
something
if
this
is
a
old
keg
than
perhaps
i
prefer
it
fresh
when
the
fruit
is
ripe
i
still
finished
my
glass
in
no
time
though
this
tasted
great
but
it
did
not
leave
me
with
a
big
enough
puckering
which
i
crave
will
revise
when
i
find
a
bottle
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
as
sour
and
tart
as
it
is
i
think
the
more
subdued
funk
helps
with
this
very
good
im
glad
i
tried
something
from
this
highlyregarded
brewery
but
this
type
of
beer
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
right
now
d
delicious
really
nice
sour
from
cantillion
the
best
ive
had
from
the
brewery
i
feel
bad
for
leaving
this
review
a
little
short
but
there
isnt
much
more
to
say
this
is
a
really
good
sour
that
is
equally
delicious
in
the
fruit
area
this
is
clearly
an
excellent
example
of
a
straightup
fruit
lambic
i
will
have
no
problem
at
all
reaching
for
this
when
i
want
a
sour
overall
another
excellent
creation
from
cantillon
pours
a
wonderful
red
like
cranberry
juice
a
nice
pink
head
formed
and
dissipated
quickly
this
beer
looks
so
amazing
in
the
glass
the
first
things
i
smell
are
the
funk
like
a
funky
swiss
then
comes
the
sour
lactic
notes
and
followed
up
by
raspberry
syrup
it
smells
amazing
like
all
cantillon
just
wonderful
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
first
the
sourness
comes
in
kicking
and
screaming
which
is
followed
by
this
funky
cheesiness
and
finishes
with
a
nice
raspberry
sweetness
the
finish
is
dry
and
with
a
little
bit
of
tannins
as
if
you
just
ate
a
fist
full
of
raspberries
and
chewed
on
the
seeds
the
mouthfeel
is
good
nicely
carbonated
very
dry
and
a
light
body
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
and
it
hit
the
spot
tonight
had
this
on
tap
at
the
happy
gnome
in
st
paul
bright
red
with
a
pink
head
that
left
some
decent
lacing
nice
tart
berry
and
cherry
aroma
with
solid
oak
and
vanilla
funk
really
comes
out
nicely
with
a
swirl
of
the
glass
and
warmth
flavor
is
nice
and
sour
tart
fruit
is
in
the
forefront
raspberry
and
cherry
are
predominate
with
light
vanilla
and
a
dry
vinegar
finish
this
is
excellent
and
one
of
the
best
fruit
lambics
ive
had
from
belgium
very
tasty
and
very
pricey
but
worth
it
cantillon
rarely
disappoints
this
is
another
good
un
d
simply
the
best
fruit
lambic
i
have
ever
tried
one
i
will
definitely
pay
the
price
for
again
im
just
hoping
i
can
get
more
got
in
a
small
argument
over
this
my
fiance
wonders
how
i
can
drink
this
but
not
the
wines
she
likes
drinkability
very
good
good
drinkability
in
moderation
im
not
sure
ill
seek
it
out
again
but
im
better
for
the
experience
slightly
puckering
sour
tart
flavor
with
a
lot
of
organic
raspberry
as
well
as
some
grape
and
other
dark
estery
fruits
pretty
carbonated
up
front
with
a
lot
of
earthy
sour
barnyard
funk
along
with
some
lactic
tart
notes
there
is
also
a
good
bit
of
earthy
oak
that
balances
out
the
sweetness
and
sharp
tar
funkiness
very
well
slightly
acidic
but
overall
pretty
drinkable
probably
my
least
favorite
cantillon
offering
ive
had
so
far
but
still
decent
cloudy
orangeamber
with
scant
head
aroma
of
raspberries
lemon
and
wet
horseblanket
but
in
a
good
way
potent
sourness
dusty
dryness
and
a
yeastyfinish
more
complex
more
sour
and
drier
than
a
younger
bottle
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
pinkishruby
tint
and
a
champagnelike
white
froth
the
nose
is
very
complex
and
interesting
but
one
that
i
just
couldnt
get
into
very
earthy
mushrooms
fresh
poop
some
will
say
funk
or
barnyard
but
thats
poop
white
pepper
herbs
cranberry
raspberry
oak
bacon
again
very
complex
but
not
really
a
prettyattractive
nose
this
brews
thankfully
tastes
a
lot
better
than
it
smelled
fresh
tart
with
ripe
raspberries
oak
herbs
pepper
vanilla
green
apple
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
definitely
should
go
with
food
pours
rose
in
color
with
a
fizzy
head
smells
of
raspberries
vinegar
and
funk
the
taste
is
acidic
with
rasberries
and
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbinated
and
tickles
the
taste
buds
drinkability
is
average
overall
this
is
not
one
of
cantillons
best
offerings
d
my
girlfriend
hated
this
and
left
me
to
finish
most
of
the
bottle
i
was
pretty
sick
of
it
by
the
end
because
of
the
mouthfeel
its
pretty
hard
to
drink
in
the
bottled
quantity
especially
alone
and
without
food
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
d
interesting
enough
to
split
the
bottle
with
someone
but
i
dont
think
id
want
something
this
size
all
to
myself
id
like
to
try
an
older
bottle
sometime
mine
was
pretty
fresh
a
bit
too
tart
for
my
liking
but
still
nice
none
the
less
drinkability
is
hard
to
judge
this
beer
is
only
5
yet
it
took
me
2
hours
to
drink
this
750
ml
bottle
that
tells
me
that
this
isnt
all
that
drinkable
i
will
say
that
this
beer
tastes
better
as
you
drink
more
of
it
i
would
judge
the
drinkability
as
average
to
slightly
better
than
average
d
the
aroma
is
front
and
center
in
this
beer
and
it
really
brings
a
lifelike
scent
of
fresh
raspberries
to
the
nose
the
flavor
is
also
very
pleasant
though
it
is
not
as
convincing
in
the
fruit
department
and
the
significant
sourness
is
the
primary
feature
this
brew
is
oddly
lacking
in
the
house
funk
that
i
have
come
to
associate
with
other
cantillon
beers
and
while
there
is
a
hint
of
it
in
the
nose
there
is
really
nothing
but
lactic
acid
in
the
flavor
overall
a
nice
fruit
beer
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
lou
pepe
framboise
even
if
it
is
cheaper
and
much
easier
to
find
once
again
an
extremely
robust
and
incredibly
niche
belgian
lambic
not
one
for
the
faint
of
heart
sharp
refreshing
and
confronting
all
in
one
package
drinkability
is
solid
this
is
a
very
mellow
sour
beer
with
a
wonderful
bouquet
of
fruit
funk
and
sourness
a
masterfully
composed
brew
by
cantillon
these
guys
never
cease
to
amaze
with
their
excellent
brews
cheers
d
easily
finished
the
bottle
myself
and
could
have
gone
for
a
bit
more
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
cantillon
offerings
its
just
as
tart
as
others
but
with
more
depth
and
complexity
definitely
recommended
di
could
have
one
or
two
of
these
but
after
that
my
face
might
remain
permanently
puckered
this
is
an
extremely
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
this
summer
weather
if
you
enjoy
a
tart
brew
this
one
is
right
up
your
alley
bottle
shared
with
milos
and

a
dusting
of

funky
yeasty

a

and

very
tart
funky

trying
to
come
through

just
a

very
dry
and
full
of
flavour
this
is
my
first
from
the
brewery
but
not
my
last
thanks
for
sharing
this
gem

d
we
snagged
this
bottle
at
a
nice
price
and
now
i
must
return
to
get
more
bottom
line
i
do
not
like
raspberries
yet
i
love
this
beer
when
all
the
american
breweries
are
calling
you
up
to
know
what
to
do
you
know
you
have
done
something
right
overall
very
satisfying
thanks

is

is

but
theres
some
funk
in
there
too
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
except
that
the
tart
and
sweet
raspberries
and
funk
are
all
pretty
balanced
with
no
one

overpowering
the

theres
also
a

thick
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
refreshing
and
its
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
good
example
of
what
a
fruit
lambic
should
be
reddish
pink
body
with
light
pink
head
thanks
to
the
raspberries
smells
of
raspberries
and
acidic
tartness
tastes
like
raspberries
very
tart
and
very
very
dry
slight
funk
character
but
its
subtle
and
blends
well
with
the
other
flavors
i
cant
discern
any
wood
flavors
in
here
mouthfeel

light

astringent
nice
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
overall
this
is
my
first
real
experience
with
a
lambic
before
this
ive
only
had
the
very
sweet
lindemans
lambics
which
i
enjoyed
but
this
is
an
entire
different
beast
a
great
new
experience
and
i
look
forward
to
having
more
in
the
future
notes
such
a
treat
to
have
this
beer
from
cantillon
i
can
finish
a
whole
bottle
and
i
believe
i
can
even
appreciate
it
still
not
something
id
look
for
again
d
unfortunately
i
think
this
bottle
had
some
years
on
it
and
the
raspberry
flavors
had
faded
a
bit
but
still
a
very
tasty
lambic
would
definitely
drink
it
again
drinkability
a
very
tasty
lambic
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
i
cant
imagine
trying
to
drink
a
whole
750ml
bottle
of
it
but
the
375ml
was
perfect
the
fruitiness
is
great
and
if
you
enjoy
an
extremely
tart
lambic
this
is
your
brew
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
it
was
a
nice
welcome
back
served
in
tap
in
a
brugse
zot
oversized
flute
the
beer
is
very
pretty
its
colored
with
an
odd
combination
of
pink
and
copper
there
is
a
slight
head
of
large
soapy
pink
bubbles
the
is
a
complex
aroma
to
this
beer
with
sweet
berries
and
some
tartness
present
the
taste
of
the
beer
also
has
a
mild
sour
tartness
with
is
very
nice
if
the
idea
of
a
sour
beer
sounds
unappealing
you
should
still
try
this
one
as
the
tartness
is
not
overpowering
there
is
a
lot
of
fruit
to
this
beer
i
think
it
tastes
like
raspberries
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
probably
helps
bring
out
the
bite
of
the
tartness
while
its
in
your
mouth
overall
a
very
wonderful
beer
pours
a
pinkblush
color
highly
carbonated
with
minimal
head
smell
is
faint
raspberry
sour
tart
funky
tartness
and
sourness
is
inyourface
with
slight
raspberry
flavors
in
the
finish
very
dry
but
tingly
on
the
mouth
light
body
drinkability
is
okay
but
you
have
to
really
love
the
style
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
overall
a
good
fruit
beer
because
the
raspberry
is
not
over
the
top
definitely
have
to
sip
this
lambic
unless
you
want
your
eyes
to
water
and
start
crying
and
give
yourself
heartburn
dont
chug
it
girlfriend
liked
this
brew
too
shes
a
big
fruit
lambic
fan
and
i
think
its
rubbing
off
on
me
a
good
lambic
the
fruit
characteristic
does
not
come
through
as
well
as
the
cherry
lambic
still
very
good
nice
and
tart
and
sour
the
way
lambics
should
be
d
if
lindemans
is
the
will
smith
of
lambics
pleasant
and
familyfriendly
with
any
rough
edges
smoothed
out
then
cantillon
is
like
nwaharsh
uncompromising
and
in
your
face
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
this
in
a
sitting
but
ill
definitely
turn
to
this
if
i
need
to
clear
my
sinuses
my
initial
thought
about
the
mouthfeel
is
that
its
sharp
mainly
due
to
the
blast
of
tartness
up
front
this
one
is
crisp
and
clean
and
its
actually
kind
of
refreshing
i
had
no
trouble
drinking
it
cantillon
does
it
like
no
other
and
after
12
years
this
one
is
quite
remarkable
md
the
level
of
acidity
is
even
higher
than
cantillons
flagship
gueuze
as
i
can
remember
while
the
carbonation
remains
refreshingly
light
to
pair
with
the
light
fruitiness
just
fine
consuming
this
bottle
6
months
past
the
suggested
bb
date
i
wonder
if
the
remaining
fruity
elements
in
the
beer
have
all
but
gone
hence
this
intensely
tart
and
unfruity
performance
overall
that
said
this
beer
does
slowly
grow
on
me
at
last
at
least
overall
this
is
a
nice
lambic
and
an
enjoyable
one
to
spend
a
few
hours
with
i
wouldnt
say
its
one
of
my
favorites
as
the
acidic
tartness
is
a
little
overpowering
and
i
prefer
a
more
balanced
sourness
since
this
was
a
recent
bottling
im
thinking
this
one
might
develop
and
balance
out
quite
nicely
with
some
more
age
on
it
ill
have
to
see
if
i
can
find
an
older
bottle
someday
d
its
a
sipper
but
each
sip
invites
another
thats
for
sure
ill
definitely
be
coming
back
to
this
one
but
for
now
im
going
to
work
on
finishing
this
bottle
it
may
take
a
little
while
pour
is
nice
with
a
decent
head
reddish
clear
with
an
off
pink
head
citrus
headline
with
a
very
musky
odor
of
old
straw
the
smell
of
stale
wood
accompanied
by
grassy
fruit
and
a
crispy
watery
fruit
quality
thanks
to
the
citrus
note
taste
is
goaty
with
a
citrus
fruit
raspberry
is
both
acidic
and
earthy
mellowing
out
the
finish
as
a
bit
less
aggressive
flowery
nature
is
there
lavender
and
water
locust
a
bit
of
pomegranate
tart
but
i
dont
think
that
was
an
option
fantastic
musky
fruit
not
as
flowery
as
a
gueze
for
example
but
still
quite
refreshing
its
almost
unfair
to
rate
these
beers
on
drinkability
once
you
get
used
to
them
theyre
endlessly
refreshing
but
375ml
is
easily
enough
and
takes
a
while
to
drink
i
might
be
able
to
drink
more
if
i
had
it
with
food
a
goat
cheese
omelette
might
be
just
the
thing
either
way
i
really
like
all
the
lambics
ive
tried
and
this
is
right
up
there
overall
an
excellent
lambic
subtle
balanced
and
easy
drinking
id
definitely
buy
it
again
if
i
can
find
it
again
pours
a
murky
orange
touched
brown
nose
is
like
dogshit
really
it
smells
like
animal
poo
yet
oddly
i
still
feel
compelled
to
drink
this
wildness
poured
into
my
cantillon
glass
flavor
is
quite
sour
and
tart
punch
in
the
mouth
sourness
and
tart
tones
hard
to
get
many
complexities
off
of
it
acidic
funky
minor
fruit
edges
barely
liquid
feel
is
thicker
and
slick
carbonation
is
minimal
as
youd
expect
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
this
is
a
rough
one
to
drink
this
was
the
first
lambic
i
ever
tried
and
i
am
rereviewing
it
for
the
heck
of
it
i
certainly
would
not
suggest
a
newbie
to
start
with
this
but
for
me
i
can
dig
it
at
this
point
in
my
beer
life
this
beer
is
one
ive
been
lusting
after
for
quite
some
time
the
color
when
poured
is
quite
striking
a
bit
darker
than
a
typical
rose
wine
but
still
pink
with
a
2
finger
pinkish
head
that
quickly
dissapates
leaving
only
a
ring
of
white
foam
aorund
the
glass
the
aroma
is
unquestionably
funky
suprisingly
not
sour
and
has
only
a
hint
of
raspberries
and
surprisingly
strawberries
describing
the
taste
is
difficult
the
raspberry
presense
is
quite
assertive
but
so
is
the
brett
funk
and
the
acidity
it
tastes
beautiful
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasent
fizzy
and
on
the
thin
side
tannic
on
the
sides
of
my
tounge
i
would
drink
a
whole
750
of
this
any
time
i
could
get
away
with
it
my
first
lambic
and
i
must
say
it
is
quite
enjoyable
not
a
new
favorite
style
or
anything
but
definitely
something
i
will
be
looking
for
excellent
stuff
here
d
cantillon
lambics
are
just
great
sources
not
as
sour
as
the
kriek
but
very
good
ill
probably
attempt
to
take
the
whole
bottle
down
god
this
is
awesome
it
pours
a
clear
pink
color
with
almost
no
head
whatsoever
the
smells
is
intensely
sour
and
tart
it
is
making
my
face
hot
and
my
mouth
pucker
cant
wait
to
taste
it
this
is
easily
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
had
to
date
it
is
more
intense
than
one
of
those
war
head
candies
you
can
pick
up
a
little
bit
if
raspberries
i
suppose
towards
the
end
once
the
tart
flavors
subside
you
get
an
apparent
barn
and
horse
flavor
which
is
nice
awesome
beer
and
addictingly
sour
notes
from
and
tasted
on
011605
d
if
you
ask
me
few
lambics
are
real
drinkable
if
i
were
to
consume
alot
of
one
this
may
just
be
it
taste
is
resplendently
sour
with
puckering
sour
raspberries
some
funk
though
the
funk
is
muted
by
the
fruit
flavors
and
a
razor
sharp
biting
acidic
vinegar
twang
this
is
a
very
very
sour
beer
lively
mouthfeel
im
forcing
myself
to
drink
slowly

bartender
said
this
one
moved
very
slow
on
the
tap
that
evidently
many
people
are
moved
away
by
the
price
or
by
the
sour
said
it
was
mostly
the
bar
staff
that
really
knew
the
treat
there
750ml
bottle
2006
vintage
nice
light
pinkorange
color
interesting
smells
slightly
funky
hay
subtle
the
flavor
is
more
fruity
lambic
sour
and
only
once
did
i
distinctly
taste
raspberry
but
it
was
like
i
bit
into
one
other
than
that
the
raspberries
were
muted
into
a
general
fruitiness
id
be
interested
in
getting
a
fresher
bottle
to
compare
but
i
was
not
disappointed
in
this
beer
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
my
first
cantillon
beer
not
the
most
sour
i
have
had
that
would
have
to
go
to
beatification
def
a
great
treat
the
taste
is
very
nicely
balanced
between
this
light
funkiness
and
rasperry
tartness
with
a
refreshing
minerality
throughout
not
as
sharply
sour
in
the
mouthfeel
as
you
might
think
in
fact
there
is
a
nice
almost
saltwater
tafffy
softness
after
the
initial
sourness
very
drinkable
and
even
better
than
i
remember
it
750
champagne
bottle
with
a
2007
cork
date
some
difficulty
in
getting
the
cork
out
without
actully
pushing
it
back
into
the
bottle
immediately
assaulted
by
scent
of
fresh
sweet
raspberry
overwhelmingly
pleasant
and
no
indicator
of
the
tart
monster
within
pour
is
a
light
copper
no
sediment
chunks
and
a
slight
quickly
dissipating
head
a
bit
cloudy
tart
no
getting
around
it
this
was
my
second
beer
from
this
brewery
either
my
taste
for
sours
has
grown
or
this
is
nowhere
near
the
sour
potency
of
their
straight
lambics
regardless
it
is
still
plenty
sour
to
the
point
of
obscuring
the
raspberry
which
continues
to
strongly
assert
itself
in
the
aroma
a
very
pleasant
combination
hard
to
describe
the
mouthfeel
as
the
sour
taste
is
quite
mouthwatering
little
carbonation
and
smooth
body
drinkability
not
super
high
but
not
a
fault
of
the
beer
and
certainly
good
for
the
style
it
is
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
i
had
no
difficulty
finishing
a
the
bottle
very
enjoyable
and
a
beer
i
will
definately
revisit
again
from
the
northcoast
coop
this
set
me
back
a
full
13
49
for
650
ml
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
red
with
small
offwhite
head
and
pink
tinges
on
the
bubbles
nose
is
sour
and
clearly
of
raspberries
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
and
favor
is
a
great
sour
note
with
raspberry
sweetness
backing
it
up
simply
sublime
very
good
not
sweet
as
expected
for
the
lambicfruit
denomination
this
is
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
great
contrast
to
lindemans
fruit
lambics
another
great
cantillon
d
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
very
many
of
these
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
but
its
interesting
a
true
lambic
a
little
on
the
funky
side
to
say
the
least
d
i
love
this
stuff
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
kreik
to
be
honest
i
could
drink
2
of
these
i
think
before
the
mouth
sores
would
come
d
this
was
my
first
fruited
lambic
and
i
liked
it
it
wasnt
as
sharply
sour
as
i
expected
overall
it
was
delicious
surprisingly
subdued
and
approachable
d
man
i
got
about
half
of
the
bottle
into
this
wine
glass
and
i
dont
even
know
if
ill
get
to
the
rest
of
the
bottle
this
is
some
intense
stuff
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
a
challenging
beer
to
say
the
least
cantillon
is
a
great
brewery
this
one
is
just
an
oddball
ild
have
to
try
it
again
because
i
dont
believe
that
they
actually
made
a
beer
that
i
thougt
was
just
ok
drinkability
even
though
i
have
had
guezes
and
lambics
before
this
one
still
takes
some
getting
used
to
even
after
a
few
sips
esp
the
1st
one
that
puckers
your
mouth
up
i
had
this
beer
last
at
my
trip
to
monks
cafe
i
great
way
to
end
the
day
d
given
a
bit
of
time
the
intense
tartness
of
the
beer
begins
to
wear
on
your
pallate
i
enjoy
sours
but
after
a
while
it
becomes
hard
to
work
your
way
though
an
entire
bottle
of
this
stuff
because
it
gives
your
tongue
such
an
ungodly
beating
still
a
pretty
damn
fine
beer
all
things
considered
pours
a
clear
pink
with
brown
highlights
the
head
is
medium
sized
and
offwhite
smell
is
of
hay
and
raspberries
taste
is
quite
tart
with
sour
raspberries
comprising
of
the
main
flavor
there
is
also
a
hint
of
earthiness
no
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
i
didnt
taste
any
barnyard
flavors
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
levels
high
an
interesting
tasty
treat
though
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
glass
or
two
of
this
in
one
sitting
because
the
tartness
does
get
to
you
after
awhile
of
the
various
lambics
and
guezes
i
have
tried
none
can
compete
with
the
sourness
and
acidity
found
in
this
example
although
this
beer
was
interesting
its
sharpness
was
a
bit
overpowering
presumably
masking
some
of
the
more
complex
oak
fruit
and
funk
flavors
hiding
beneath
the
surface
this
is
an
interesting
and
intense
example
of
the
style
but
probably
not
not
one
that
i
would
revisit
d
to
sum
it
up
well
made
but
too
tart
for
my
liking
a
beer
spot
on
for
the
style
but
a
bit
much
for
me
and
not
the
cheapest
option
on
the
shelves
im
surprised
as
hell
and
happy
that
while
my
impressions
on
this
beer
have
changed
a
lot
my
scores
havent
an
excellent
beer
i
cant
wait
to
get
to
the
2006
i
have
in
my
cellar
d
not
something
id
drink
all
that
often
but
its
still
a
great
beer
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
first
glassful
had
a
moderately
textured
feel
with
small
bubbles
more
noticable
than
the
final
two
servings
it
does
have
the
right
character
for
the
style
so
the
thinner
less
carbonated
feature
is
right
on
the
money
an
absolutely
stunning
example
from
the
granddaddy
of
lambic
producers
and
a
reminder
that
i
need
to
visit
this
a
lot
more
often
the
cork
was
dated
2007
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
orangerosecolored
liquid
produced
a
head
for
just
a
moment
low
clarity
smells
fantastic
mostly
of
raspberries
and
something
else
i
cant
tell
i
havent
had
many
lambics
but
this
one
is
quite
a
bit
different
not
sweet
at
all
singes
my
nasal
passages
for
a
moment
on
the
first
sip
very
tart
barely
tastes
like
raspberries
i
imagine
i
am
tasting
some
of
the
lambic
yeast
but
my
palate
and
experience
with
lambics
is
really
limiting
my
description
somewhat
spritzy
on
the
tongue
that
leaves
a
lingering
tartinduced
pucker
interesting
and
enjoyable
this
is
one
funky
smelling
beer
cheese
and
tart
fruit
the
color
makes
this
beer
look
syrupy
taste
is
very
sour
good
with
strawberries
rasberries
wood
and
grapefruit
very
dry
and
fizzy
i
prefer
rasberries
in
my
lambics
over
the
sour
cherries
although
both
are
very
good
i
really
need
to
try
that
blueberry
lambic
they
make
good
beer
i
would
like
to
try
another
one
in
the
near
future
to
compare
750ml
capped
and
corked
green
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
murky
bright
red
body
with
a
shortlived
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
acidic
fruity
raspberries
and
just
slightly
nutty
tastes
like
very
sour
raspberry
with
the
slightest
hint
of
sweetness
toward
the
finish
vegetal
and
tealike
at
times
in
the
aftertaste
light
to
medium
in
body
with
light
carbonation
brilliantly
sour
and
complex
just
as
i
expected
from
cantillon
a
very
solid
lambic
but
only
an
occasional
treat
considering
the
price
pours
a
hazy
apricot
looks
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
lamic
nominal
head
but
with
a
slight
soapy
white
lacing
nose
very
tart
with
strong
raspberr
and
some
mustiness
taste
very
acidic
and
woody
earthy
lemon
character
with
a
raspberry
kick
mouth
puckering
goodness
finishes
dry
with
some
fruit
sweetness
d
i
know
most
would
find
this
way
too
tart
but
i
love
it
i
find
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
its
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
how
much
volume
could
drink
d
exotic
flavor
and
low
alcohol
greatly
aid
the
drinkability
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
slowly
and
in
copious
quantities
d
interesting
and
surely
a
change
of
pace
from
what
youve
been
drinking
unfortunately
tartness
becomes
a
bit
cloying
over
time
alcohol
is
not
a
factor
certainly
worth
trying
especially
if
you
like
funky
and
sour
flavors
redish
beer
that
pours
out
kind
of
bubbly
looking
kind
of
like
champagne
and
the
head
quickly
dissipates
has
a
sweet
to
sour
smell
the
beer
is
quite
fruity
with
tons
of
esters
accumulating
in
a
sour
taste
that
makes
you
feel
like
puckering
moderate
body
d
a
slow
drinker
both
really
sour
and
highly
acidic
make
this
something
to
take
your
time
with
nice
a
pleasant
experience
for
sure
that
wont
over
excite
just
like
the
other
beers
i
have
had
from
cantillon
there
is
lots
of
tartness
on
the
palate
also
tastes
of
fruits
barnyard
funk
and
vinegar
i
took
some
points
off
for
drinkability
as
any
of
the
true
sour
lambics
i
have
ever
had
would
not
have
more
in
a
night
that
being
said
this
was
a
great
beer
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
23
2008
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
pinkish
red
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
musty
with
some
hints
of
raspberry
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
very
champagny
the
flavour
was
primarily
sour
raspberries
very
dry
and
delicious
very
expensive
yet
worth
it
d
compared
with
a
much
younger
version
ive
tried
this
has
mellowed
beautifully
in
only
a
few
years
and
become
even
more
drinkable
immense
d
although
imo
one
and
done
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
get
another
one
drinkability
tart
but
smooth
somehow
truely
a
gift
from
the
godly
brewers
of
cantillon
ill
have
it
again
and
again
every
chance
i
get
d
i
could
see
myself
drinking
at
least
1
full
pint
of
this
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
easily
another
winner
from
cantillon
i
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
anytime
i
see
it
i
just
thought
it
was
simply
wonderful
awesome
lambic
overall
there
are
very
few
brewers
who
can
equal
cantillon
in
this
realm
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
this
one
was
definitely
a
one
and
done
bottle
one
of
the
nicer
labels
though
as
i
had
the
naked
lady
version
d
this
is
pretty
damn
good
a
fine
tasting
brew
i
have
a
2003
vintage
and
i
can
pick
up
a
recent
vintage
easily
i
wonder
how
theyll
all
compare
i
recommend
this
one
for
a
try
though
its
damn
good
and
for
a
brew
thats
only
5
its
aged
very
nicely
pours
like
cranberry
juice
with
no
head
smell
is
funky
sourness
with
a
slight
bit
of
raspberries
but
not
intense
as
in
most
standard
fruit
beers
taste
is
quite
tart
with
light
dry
unsweetened
raspberries
still
wanting
more
malt
or
sweetness
to
balance
it
for
me
decent
but
not
my
speed
drinkability
not
something
that
i
have
the
taste
buds
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
i
respect
it
for
what
it
is
a
good
lambic
that
is
true
to
the
style
not
bad
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
probably
not
something
that
ill
be
seeking
out
anytime
soon
either
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
this
sour
ill
probably
just
seek
out
a
flanders
red
or
something
dont
drink
and
review
md
sour
but
not
mouth
puckering
which
is
kinda
upsetting
it
is
very
drinkable
though
if
it
had
a
more
sour
punch
i
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again
but
i
doubt
i
will
purchase
again
this
beer
was
incredibly
refreshing
as
are
all
cantillons
and
extremely
drinkable
whenever
i
see
a
story
about
lambics
inevitably
this
is
the
bottle
pictured
so
after
reading
wild
brews
i
thought
that
id
finally
give
it
a
try
uncapped
wierd
mildew
like
mold
under
the
cap
and
then
uncorked
it
with
a
pop
poured
mildly
fizzy
with
an
amber
body
and
pinkish
notes
short
head
not
really
any
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
very
tart
and
fruity
bitter
cherries
and
raspberries
first
sip
is
overwhelmingly
sour
with
a
tart
kick
of
raspberries
stale
hay
and
cherries
ensuing
sips
lose
the
supersour
quality
and
allow
the
tart
fruits
and
earthy
brett
flavors
to
come
through
more
more
raspberries
also
sweat
sour
malt
a
very
nice
and
complex
mix
medium
to
thin
bodied
a
fine
framboise
highly
drinkable
especially
with
a
meal
or
with
cheese
strong
carbonation
makes
a
refreshingly
tart
fruity
quaffer
cork
says
it
was
bottled
in
2
006
it
looked
fairly
flat
during
the
pour
but
a
thin
layer
of
fine
light
pink
bubbles
appeared
after
a
couple
of
seconds
large
soapy
bubbles
formed
a
ring
and
produced
some
spotty
lacing
the
beer
itself
was
quite
clear
and
a
brilliant
red
earthy
aroma
acidic
fruity
berries
light
on
the
funk
puckering
tartness
throughout
that
really
lingered
balanced
by
berry
sweetness
and
earthy
seeds
towards
the
finish
funk
and
vinegar
filled
the
rest
of
the
flavour
out
but
never
overpowered
things
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
texture
was
very
nice
quite
smooth
and
ending
dry
very
refreshing
the
acidity
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
fruit
character
highly
drinkable
better
than
the
gueuze
drank
before
this
but
did
not
hold
a
candle
to
red
poppy
drank
today
expected
a
more
purple
color
and
a
bigger
raspberry
syrup
flavor
still
pretty
good
and
recommended
even
though
i
think
it
is
pretty
expensive
d
honestly
had
i
not
paired
this
with
some
peking
duck
and
a
crumbly
blue
cheese
field
greens
salad
it
might
have
been
tough
to
drink
so
pair
food
wisely
overall
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
little
more
on
the
sweet
side
than
the
totally
sour
side
however
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
and
it
went
well
with
the
italian
dish
that
was
served
to
me
this
evening
a
tall
pour
produced
a
fizzing
ruby
colored
beer
with
a
tiny
pink
head
smells
tart
with
a
mix
of
lemon
flowers
and
berries
in
the
flavor
the
raspberries
go
toetotoe
with
the
biting
lemon
its
almost
to
the
point
of
making
your
mouth
pucker
and
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
the
raspberries
go
really
well
with
the
lambic
flavors
and
if
you
like
the
original
give
this
one
a
try
a
near
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
flavors
this
one
can
be
enjoyed
any
time
of
the
day
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
despite
its
tart
nature
it
is
not
a
bottle
that
i
would
open
and
drink
all
by
myself
but
it
is
great
to
share
with
people
who
can
appreciate
what
this
brewery
is
trying
to
achieve
i
love
this
brewery
and
i
cant
wait
to
open
my
other
bottles
cantillon
is
amazing
i
like
the
cantillon
brews
a
ton
so
i
am
a
little
biased
but
truth
be
told
this
is
not
their
best
one
in
my
less
than
experienced
opinion
i
liked
the
lou
pepe
framboise
a
little
better
than
this
offering
ive
sampled
a
couple
lambics
in
the
past
but
they
were
more
of
the
sweet
fruity
variety
this
is
far
from
that
but
also
enjoyable
and
a
fun
experience
i
have
always
been
told
that
this
beer
was
a
classic
i
guess
that
that
is
true
in
the
sense
that
classic
literature
are
the
books
that
no
one
reads
im
not
going
to
invest
in
another
bottle
until
i
have
acquired
a
palate
for
it
overall
great
beer
it
is
hard
to
drink
this
style
non
stop
but
i
apreciate
it
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
one
poured
with
a
hazy
pink
tinged
orange
has
light
head
a
a
bit
of
lace
very
aromatic
with
a
hint
of
raspberries
lots
of
yeast
spice
and
malt
flavor
is
really
tart
with
a
bare
suggestion
of
sweetness
and
some
raspberry
extremely
tangy
not
a
session
beer
sure
wish
i
would
have
gone
to
the
brewery
in
brussels
the
head
looked
promising
upon
pouring
but
unfortunately
it
immediately
fizzed
away
without
a
trace
left
for
the
remainder
of
the
beer
absolutely
beautiful
color
ruby
red
with
some
orange
and
peach
colors
almost
grapefruit
juice
colored
the
aroma
was
musty
and
full
of
raspberries
very
sour
taste
at
first
like
all
cantillons
but
nice
and
fruity
at
the
end
really
makes
you
pucker
but
i
love
it
not
as
drinkable
as
some
of
the
other
cantillon
lambics
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
and
unique
beer
12oz
2003
bottle
this
one
pours
a
slightly
red
tinged
amber
color
it
is
hazy
there
was
a
bit
of
a
head
on
it
when
it
was
poured
but
it
fizzed
away
quickly
the
aroma
is
sour
and
tart
a
hint
of
raspberries
to
it
the
taste
is
pretty
much
suckertart
a
touch
of
raspberries
in
there
i
like
the
tart
ones
but
this
is
a
bit
much
for
me
drinkability
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
im
happy
to
say
ive
tried
it
review
added
10252007
translated
from
french
1312008
definitely
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
acquiring
an
understanding
and
appreciation
for
lambic
like
this
is
going
to
take
a
while
i
definitely
picked
up
on
some
underlying
structure
complexity
as
it
warmed
but
i
am
sure
i
missed
a
bunch
as
well
oddly
i
found
myself
thinking
this
would
be
spectacular
with
a
oily
fish
like
salmon
etc
especially
if
done
with
some
citrus
i
still
debating
on
what
cheese
might
work
with
it
my
gut
is
a
really
gooey
soft
young
rind
cheese
with
some
crackers
or
bread
if
you
like
da
funk
definitely
check
this
out
one
of
my
favorite
lambic
brews
and
one
i
go
to
often
after
a
big
dinner
when
im
too
stuffed
for
a
ris
highly
recommended
this
is
a
tastepreference
thing
for
me
ive
had
some
sourish
ales
and
enjoyed
them
most
everything
ive
had
from
belgium
was
brilliant
but
this
is
just
too
much
for
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
acidic
tart
oaky
and
dry
i
have
to
give
this
a
bit
of
a
knock
here
its
just
so
puckering
and
sour
that
its
not
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
like
for
example
the
schaerbeekse
kriek
still
a
great
beer
and
another
triumph
by
cantillon
not
as
amazing
as
that
1999
cantillon
gueuze
i
had
last
month
but
still
very
amazing
d
this
is
maybe
the
best
lambic
on
the
market
perfect
balance
with
excellent
drinkability
superb

a
hazed
blood

glass
this
beer
displays
a
gorgeous

hue
i
think
its
glowing
very
bright
this
looks
like
an
extremely
wellcrafted
beer
not
like
juice
at
all
as
some
have
commented
did
not
pour
much
of
a
head
and
i
didnt
care
the
aroma
is
not
suffering
at
all
i
know
exactly
what
im
in
for
the
first
sip
will
be
extremely
tart
yep
puckered
me
up
to
the
point
that
i
felt
like
i
could
send
a
stream
of
gleak
a
good
20
feet
across
the
room
definitely
getting
the
raspberry
flavor
and
it
definitely
belongs
its
just
one
component
in
a
world
class
orchestra
of
sour
funkiness
like
i
said
there
is
nothing
fruitjuicy
about
this
it
is
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
cantillon
nothing
but
the
finest
i
can
only
imagine
all
the
hard
work
that
goes
into
crafting
such
a
great
beer
imo
it
is
well
worth
the
price
i
cant
stop
staring
at
the
color
of
it
its
literally
glowing
in
the
glass
this
beer
is
extremely
refreshing
i
found
myself
wondering
what
i
could
create
in
the
kitchen
with
some
of
this
the
possibilities
seem
endless
i
wish
i
had
a
few
cases
to
experiment
with
and
i
wish
there
were
more
beers
like
this
lining
the
beer
shelves
after
having
a
time
trying
to
uncork
this
and
having
the
cork
partially
break
with
each
attempt
i
finally
poured
it
into
my
new
belgium
bowl
looks
a
mildly
hazed
and
ruddied
rosé
wine
with
a
whipped
egg
white
head
that
quickly
diminishes
aroma
is
a
little
softer
than
i
would
imagine
from
cantillon
but
thats
not
to
say
this
is
some
lindemans
product
smells
acidic
and
dry
with
musty
mossy
attic
the
character
of
a
good
lambic
is
all
there
but
the
acidity
is
a
little
stageshy
which
works
to
allow
the
subtle
fruit
to
come
through
in
the
nose
i
taste
a
lot
of
acidity
at
first
but
it
is
not
very
longlasting
wheat
comes
out
a
lot
in
the
middle
with
lemon
rind
finishes
very
dry
but
not
completely
so
as
i
get
a
faraway
hint
of
sweet
that
accompanies
the
tart
raspberry
which
doesnt
fully
show
itself
until
now
although
i
know
neither
of
these
fruits
were
involved
in
this
beer
but
i
cant
help
thinking
i
taste
something
resembling
a
mix
of
strawberry
and
banana
mouthfeel
feels
slightly
heavier
than
most
lambics
ive
had
but
that
is
not
to
say
this
is
heavy
i
think
what
i
perceived
as
faint
sweet
in
the
flavor
is
what
is
giving
this
a
little
weight
in
the
body
carbonation
is
lively
and
effervescent
very
drinkable
not
a
cloying
sweet
pseudolambic
nor
is
it
absolutely
bonedry
very
interesting
flavor
d
very
nice
but
the
tartness
is
a
bit
overwhelming
even
for
the
style
im
not
one
for
super
fruity
beers
but
i
find
myself
wanting
more
raspberry
flavor
highly
recommended
this
really
tasted
a
lot
like

55there
is
so
much
depth
and
character
in
this
beer
that
after
each
sip
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
was
in
the
best
shape
with
horsey

nothing

it
goes

i
still
prefer
a
fruitier
cherry
which
wakes
up

nose
just
a

its
definitely
raspberry
the
taste
is
unabashedly
dry

drinking
this
is

the

holds
lots
of
different
flavors
and
experiences
i
love
the
funk
and
excitement
of
a
good
lambic
with
the
same
raspberry
flavors
this
is
another
nice
lambic
from
cantillon
even
with
the
nice
sourness
and
that
it
was
available
where
i
live
those
are
my
only
complaints

o
i
think
for
the
rotatings
i
would
go
saint
lamviggyfou
for
the
big
guns
this
beer
was
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
have
a
few
more
to
see
if
i
get
variance
i
acquired
a
750
from
a
craigslist
cellar
clearing
the
beer
corked
and
popped
with
little
to
no
carbonation
the
smell
of
funky
musty
grapes
and
oak
emanate
from
the
cork
pours
very
golden
yellow
with
some
funky
grape
peel
smells
coming
off
the
lightly
carbonated
body
go
in
for
the
taste
and
it
is
a
of
a
fine
oak
aged
grape
juices
very
wet
and
juicy
on
the
palate
funk
and
slight
tartness
nothing
too
sour
the
finish
is
dry
but
the
juiciness
of
the
grapes
is
present
in
the
2013
bottle
absolutely
a
beautiful
introduction
to
the
cantillon
brewery
i
had
the
esteemed
pleasure
of
having
this
on
tap
and
in
a
bottle
just
one
day
apart
which
is
not
only
a
rare
treat
but
something
to
almost
feel
guilty
about
beer
this
sought
after
and
all
but
i
am
thankful
and
will
remain
that
way
this
beer
for
carrying
so
much
hype
isnt
as
distinct
as
i
expected
it
to
be
and
in
fact
is
an
awful
lot
like
the
classic
gueuze
itself
i
think
the
grapes
are
a
little
more
vibrant
in
the
on
tap
version
but
the
properties
of
both
are
quite
similar
honestly
the
bottle
pours
hazy
golden
still
looking
but
with
a
short
white
head
as
per
cantillon
usual
there
is
as
much
funk
as
there
is
sour
here
tons
of
musty
oak
in
the
nose
and
i
get
the
lambic
part
of
it
long
before
i
get
any
fruit
the
fruit
is
a
little
more
dramatic
in
the
flavor
than
the
nose
and
has
a
sweetness
to
it
more
of
a
riesling
thing
to
me
than
a
muscat
one
although
i
dont
drink
a
ton
of
white
wine
i
get
that
vibe
from
it
the
oak
is
nice
on
it
really
robust
and
mellowing
and
the
sourness
too
is
tempered
by
it
tart
for
sure
especially
in
the
finish
mouth
watering
like
crazy
but
the
fruit
doesnt
add
as
much
to
it
as
either
of
the
berry
beers
they
do
and
certainly
not
as
interesting
as
the
elderflower
mamouche
i
had
earlier
in
the
week
its
hard
when
comparing
so
many
world
class
sour
beers
but
for
me
the
fruit
is
lost
a
little
in
this
one
not
as
radiant
and
memorable
as
others
they
make
i
love
the
complexity
and
the
ancient
feel
to
this
how
truly
high
quality
it
is
is
certainly
obvious
but
im
not
sure
the
grapes
make
it
any
more
special
than
the
lambic
is
in
isolation
nice
dry
but
mouth
watering
finish
good
acidity
and
maybe
a
touch
undercarbed

i

is
like
fresh
and
would
definitely
want
to
track
down
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
the
changes
this
monster
has
gone
through
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
i
had
a
little
stash
of
cantillon
that
i
forgot
about
a
ways
back
and
im
just
getting
to
them
now
with
4
years
on
this
bottle
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottling
for
comparisons
sake
overall
a
great
one
the
muscat
grapes
add
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
an
extra
layer
of
complexity
an
enjoyable
one
to
drink
i
came
into
this
one
not
expecting
too
much
out
of
this
cantillon
but
this
one
definitely
exceeded
expectations
so
clean
crisp
sour
funky
and
fruity
all
in
once
i
highly
recommend
this
one
o
i
have
yet
to
have

that
ive
had

with
always
delicious
always
satisfying
this
beer
is
no

owhat
a

the

i
had

balance
overall
this
is
great
nothing
like
what
i
expected
from
a
grape
lambic
flaws
i
cant
seem
to
find
any
other
than
if
this
was
a
notch
less
sour
it
would
be
undeniably
perfect
im
so
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
this
drinks
excellently
on
tap
but
id
imagine
it
would
be
a
little
drier
and
tart
from
the
bottle
quite
frankly
i
enjoy
its
offdry
musty
flavor
as
is
as
it
retains
a
funky
complexity
that
is
cut
by
the
semisweetness
from
the
grape
must
in
terms
of
being
drinkable
this
may
be
the
highest
one
ive
had
so
far
from
cantillon
absolutely
a
musthave
to
convert
those
to
sours
i
doubt
theres
any
brewery
that
can
top
this
level
of
quality
with
brewing
with
white
sweet
grapes
such
as
the
moscatel
varietal
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
of
this
in
the
future
o
highly
recommended
would
love
to
have
again
exceptional
sampled
from
a
750ml
bottle
at
moder
lambic
beautifully
presented
in
a
wicker
basket
and
carefully
poured
by
the
waiter
golden
and
clear
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
white
grapes
flavor
follows
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
firm
bite
that
doesnt
overpower
dry
but
with
the
perception
of
a
mild
sweetness
a
fine
feel
with
a
medium
yet
firm
carbonation
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
outstanding
wine
influences
this
was
my
second
cantillon
beer
and
i
have
to
say
that
it
also
lived
up
the
the
hype
the
puckering
tartness
works
perfectly
here
extremely
balanced
maybe
a
little
less
complex
than
other
sours
ive
tried
but
nonetheless
world
class
wow
this
is
amazeballs
how
can
you
get
this
much
sweet
grape
wineyness
and
sharp
acitidity
to
balance
with
the
delicate
brett
over
such
a
light
grain
bill
the
white
grapes
really
shine
this
might
be
my
favorite
cantillon
i
have
had
to
date
thanks
frank
o
very
good
not
over
the
top
with
sourness
or
tartness
but
it
has
enough
of
oak
and
white
grape
tartness
to
draw
you
back
in
the
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
great
another
real
enjoyable
brew
from
these
guys
o
currently
my
least
favorite
cantillon
so
still
better
than
a
lot
of
the
beer
ive
had
in
my
life
if
youre
around
cantillon
a
lot
give
this
one
a
try
eventually
but
if
youve
only
got
a
little
time
and
can
try
only
a
few
i
might
let
this
one
slide
and
stick
with
the
lou
pepes
st
lumnivous
fou
foune
etc
overall
a
very
nice
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
cantillons
othis
is
maybe
the
most
interesting
cantillon
i
tasted
at
the
brewery
but
not
my
favorite
the
musty
grape
flavor
just
did
not
jive
with
the
lambic
in
the
same
way
that
for
example
the
apricots
do
in
the
case
of
fou
foune
my
criticism
aside
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
and
better
than
most
other
fruit
beers
out
there
the
acidity
here
would
pair
well
with
a
white
fish
dish
or
salmon
d
great
complexity
and
balance
color
of
unfiltered
apple
juice
with
a
small
pure
white
head
smells
like
melted
rubber
in
a
wet
basement
tastes
incredibly
complexi
might
have
to
say
a
wine
snobs
beer
if
that
makes
senselots
of
layers
here
dark
fruit
red
wine
a
little
barnyard
funk
with
a
slight
hop
flavor
here
and
there
very
drinkable
strong
harmony
of
flavors
lingers
before
fading
off
the
tongue
like
an
orchestras
perfect
decrescendo
alright
enough
bullshit
this
was
just
a
great
beer
serving
type
bottle
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
lambic
i
think
1
5
years
in
the
bottle
has
done
it
well
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
the
muscat
grapes
definitely
give
this
one
some
delicious
flavors
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
overall
i
got
this
at
the
same
time
as
a
bottle
of
the
saint
lamvinus
i
had
very
high
expectations
for
the
st
lam
and
while
both
were
great
i
actually
ended
up
liking
this
a
bit
better
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
one
was
rather
enjoyable
perhaps
a
bit
more
acidic
than
the
other
cantillon
fruit
lambic
we
had
that
night
which
may
turn
some
people
off
i
found
it
quite
pleasant
and
would
glaldy
drink
this
one
again
thanks
again
farundrpar
not
unlike
wine
not
that
sour
either
a
clean
if
bracing
palate
cleanser
a
really
solid
fruit
lambic
there
is
an
earthy
note
added
by
the
grapes
that
is
really
nice
id
love
the
fruit
to
be
just
a
touch
more
prominent
but
im
clutching
at
straws
here
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
damn
cantillon
is
consistently
fantastic
this
is
no
exception
im
so
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
im
curious
what
a
couple
of
years
of
age
would
do
to
this
since
its
already
so
balanced
nice
soft
fruitiness
with
the
cantillon
funk
yet
another
beer
that
i
need
more
of
and
will
never
see
time
machines
are
coming
right
overall
i
didnt
think
id
like
this
more
than
st
lam
and
i
definitely
do
fantastic
beer
this
bottle
was
over
a
year
old
when
i
bought
it
but
that
only
seems
to
make
it
more
tart
and
almost
austere
at
times
i
love
a
good
lambic
since
it
shows
the
real
limit
of
beer
at
the
sour
end
this
is
a
5
abv
that
is
extreme
in
the
way
it
takes
funky
yeast
flavours
fino
sherry
flavours
and
at
times
a
taste
like
an
old
normandy
cider
combined
with
a
bracing
tartness
one
of
the
most
intense
lambics
i
have
ever
had
but
still
totally
drinkable
and
very
complex
for
the
style
o
this
tastes
great
st
lamvinus
is
more
complex
but
the
fruit
character
in
this
is
really
cool
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
low
carbonation
probably
a
bit
too
low
for
the
style
overall
though
another
nice
sour
from
cantillon
overall
not
my
favorite
of
the
cantillon
ive
tried
but
love
the
style
and
could
drink
this
all
the
time
oanother
great
fruit
lambic
from
cantillon
having
had
this
a
few
times
i
think
i
actually
prefer
it
aged
as
opposed
to
fresh
it
loses
some
of
the
gentle
grape
character
as
it
ages
but
it
becomes
incredibly
more
sour
o
another
fantastic
beer
from
cantillon
i
just
cant
get
enough
o
this
was
another
great
cantillon
however
i
cant
say
i
like
it
as
much
as
others
that
ive
had
although
like
other
cantillons
ive
had
it
was
almost
perfect
for
the
style
and
left
me
craving
for
more
even
the
guys
i
split
it
with
were
very
glad
i
introduced
them
to
cantillon
and
had
no
remorse
over
paying
the
fairly
high
price
tag
overall
very
good
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
dont
expect
anything
extremely
sour
or
over
the
top
funky
just
a
very
enjoyable
slightly
funky
muscat
grape
flavored
beer

d
among
the
most
drinkable
of
cantillons
ive
had
so
far
because
the
sourness
isnt
absurd
yet
the
flavor
is
still
inviting
drink
like
all
loons
they
are
good
some
just
arent
as
good
as
other
loons
o
sweet
and
subtle
tartness
cantillon
does
no
wrong
o
unbelievable
it
is
beers
such
as
this
that
give
cantillon
the
reputation
that
it
deserves
overall
this
is
a
super
offering
once
again
from
the
ever
impressive
cantillon
another
winner
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
traditional
darker
fruited
lambics
definitely
with
your
time
and
well
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
this
one
was
a
part
of
cmrillos
40
beers
40
birthday
bash
shared
by
cmrillo
at
his
own
party
served
from
bottle
into
a
cantillon
taster
flute
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
white
grape
wood
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sweet
fruit
grape
tart
and
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
grapes
really
took
the
headliner
of
this
show
as
they
were
very
well
pronounced
and
very
well
integrated
throughout
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
this
one
was
really
quite
easy
to
drink
as
there
wasnt
really
that
much
of
a
sour
or
tart
aspect
like
most
people
thing
when
they
have
a
brew
like
this
a
really
well
done
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
hope
to
try
many
from
them
in
the
future
and
i
hope
you
are
able
to
do
the
same
really
drinkable
really
tasty
one
of
the
best
cantillons
ive
ever
had
the
extra
acidity
and
grape
presence
is
great
will
definitely
seek
out
again
i
cant
believe
i
have
not
had
this
its
definately
something
im
keen
to
try

enjoyable
though
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
at
you
after
drinking
it
i
was
informed
it
was
aged
in
wine
barrels
makes
sense
just
not
my
favourite
cantillon
beer
aging
beer
was
once
described
to
me
as
being
much
like
wood
working
an
object
is
artfully
crafted
and
is
beautiful
to
start
out
with
and
aging
a
beer
is
like
sanding
that
piece
removing
all
the
rough
and
sharp
edges
sometimes
this
is
not
desirable
in
either
case
but
sometimes
it
takes
something
amazing
and
improves
on
it
this
is
much
more
like
the
latter
though
the
beer
is
much
more
sour
the
flavors
are
very
soft
and
full
and
smooth
lots
of
winelike
flavors
a
bit
of
vinegar
and
lots
of
lactic
acid
the
funk
is
hard
to
place
somewhere
between
sweaty
and
dusty
and
moldy
mouthfeel
was
dry
but
as
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
this
old
it
got
flat
pretty
quickly
moutstanding
beer
even
better
experience
o
i
think
its
actually
more
apricotlike
than
grapelike
delicious
either
way
note
that
if
you
get
an
older
bottle
and
you
probably
will
it
will
probably
have
a
lot
more
funk
and
at
least
a
bit
less
fruitiness
not
a
bad
drop
but
it
certainly
seems
harsher
and
less
refined
than
some
other
cantillon
beers
theres
a
rugged
unapologetic
nature
to
this
brew
which
makes
it
less
approachable
than
others
even
if
youre
forced
to
respect
it
o
a
delicious
lambic
cantillon
doesnt
disappoint
this
beer
poured

it

very

and

it
has
a
moderate
bite
from
the
carbonation
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
resonating
flavor
or
herbal
spice
which
i
really
appreciated
i
really
liked
this
one
it
was
different
than
i
expected
find
it
dont
overpay
for
it
and
drink
it
fantastic
this
was
so
good
i
ate
grilled
octopus
with
it
which
if
you
know
me
you
know
this
is
a
huge
feat
it
stepped
down
in
quality
from
the
iris
for
me
but
im
not
worried

overall
this
is
a
very

drinkable

incredible

that

poured

this

was

a

towards

a

delicate

capped

no
real

not

it
should
be
noticed
that
this
followed
a
russian
river
supplication
so
my
palate
might
have
been
biased
lightbodied
more
or
less
and
very
enjoyable
overall
o
a
really
nicedrinking
lambic
that
has
benefitted
from
the
age
imo
awesome
of
scotty
to
share
this
with
me
and
its
something
ill
be
chasing
to
get
a
hold
of
more
this
destroyed
the
08
st
lamvinus
that
we
opened
directly
after
excellent
stuff
o
i
think
this
may
be
the
mustiest
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
overpowers
most
of
the
other
flavors
and
made
the
beer
fairly
hard
to
finish
with
all
that
said
i
still
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
i
will
have
to
give
this
one
another
chance
in
the
future
overall
over
the
past
year
i
have
grown
to
truly
love
nearly
everything
cantillon
produces
and
this
is
no
exception
white
grape
is
not
my
true
favorite
fruit
for
which
i
adjusted
the
overall
score
down
half
a
point
that
has
to
due
with
my
preference
more
than
the
production
value
however
d
another
solid
offering
from
cantillon
i
really
liked
the
grapes
in
this
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
vinous
characteristic
however
it
was
more
of
a
soft
white
grape
flavor
which
pleasantly
surprised
me
good
stuff
this
is
really
good
the
only
one
of
the
standard
range
which
rivals
the
lou
pepes
i
feel
it
works
much
better
than
st
lamnivus
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modestly
light
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
pretty
much
completely
hidden
it
is
a
light
and
lively
brew
with
a
great
depth
of
flavor
and
aroma
to
take
in
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
making
me
fly
through
a
glass
and
reach
for
more
mouthfeel
just
perfect
with
the
grapes
and
perhaps
some
tannins

leaves
me
thirsting
for
more
this
beer
is
a
hazy
tan
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
fluffy
head
the
beer
smells
smokey
and
meaty
with
a
good
bit
of
funk
there
is
lots
of
tart
lemon
and
grapeskin
in
the
finish
a
little
horsey
with
dry
bitter
mineral
finish
the
beer
is
light
and
dances
on
your
tongue
it
tastes
like
youth
lighter
medium
body
well
carbonated
slightly
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
this
was
probably
the
only
beer
out
of
12
that
i
wasnt
really
into
at
the
event
although
i
dont
enjoy
muscato
in
the
first
place
o
a
good
food
beer
the
carbonation
makes
this
that
much
more
than
a
table
white
o
i
dont
remember
this
beer
being
dominated
by
vinegar
last
time
but
ive
only
had
this
fresh
not
as
acetic
as
other
beers
ive
had
but
definitely
not
put
together
well
quite
nice
though
for
being
rarer
was
not
noticeable
more
impressive
than
more
common
sours
bourgogne
de
flandres
o
really
good
not
in
your
face
sour
smooth
and
easy
wine
like
poured
into
a
tulip
it
was
a
light
orange
brown
with
a
very
nice
three
finger
head
of
lace
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
retention
only
gradually
let
the
head
fade
away
what
was
left
was
a
very
nice
set
of
concentric
side
glass
rings
of
lace
smell
was
very
sour
lots
of
grapes
and
other
fruits
a
bit
light
on
the
nose
before
the
sour
wrath
kicks
in
flavor
was
very
full
and
robust
nice
yeast
filled
flavor
wrecks
your
taste
buds
but
calms
down
considerably
on
the
finish
a
huge
rush
of
sour
fruit
than
kicks
into
overdrive
and
puckers
your
lips
through
the
finish
this
was
a
wonderfully
unique
brew
that
had
a
very
good
flavor
and
a
light
fruity
feel
that
really
made
it
shine
overall
less
grape
than
i
would
have
expected
but
still
very
good
tart
and
refreshing
i
would
definitely
have
more
although
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
definitely
consider
it
to
be
one
of
the
more
tame
offerings
in
the
cantillon
lineup
additionally
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
i
could
not
pick
up
any
muscat
grape
nuances
nevertheless
this
is
a
refreshing
treat
perfect
for
sipping
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinks
pretty
nicely
not
my
favorite
cantillon
but
quite
nice
and
enjoyable

fairly
sour
white
grape
spiraled
in
not
as
tight
of
a
fruit
integration
as
they
often
achieve
after
a
few
sips
its
evident
that
some
ridiculous
acidity
is
going
on
becomes
literally
painful
to
drink
in
a
way
i
havent
experienced
before
okay
not
great
one
of
their
weaker
fruit
lambics
aside
from
the
absolute
chore
it
was
to
drink
this
perhaps
a
younger
bottle
would
have
been
better
in
that
regard
o
a
great
offering
from
cantillon
i
would
love
to
have
the
chance
to
have
this
beer
on
tap
one
day
o
not
cantillons
finest
but
damn
good
anyway
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
this
beer
is
both
sippable
an
gulpable
however
i
highly
doubt
that
anyone
truly
enjoying
this
beer
would
not
wish
to
make
it
last
thanks
bbehr
o
another
damn
fine
offering
from
this
amazing
brewery
packs
a
great
punch
of
tartness
that
yoiu
would
enjoy
o
overall
another
great
beer
from
cantillon
ive
heard
this
one
ages
great
so
i
will
hold
onto
my
other
2
bottles
for
a
few
years
but
its
still
great
right
now
will
certainly
have
it
again
very
tasty
and
hugely
quaffable
this
one
wont
live
through
the
night
o
probably
one
of
the
more
under
the
radar
cantillon
offerings
that
provides
some
uniqueness
but
maintains
a
generally
mellow
flavor
profile
o
really
quite
nice
another
great
offering
from
cantillon
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
again
the
grapes
added
something
quite
nice
to
this
one
not
the
best
cantillon
ive
had
but
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
them
a
definitely
indulge
in
one
if
you
have
the
chance

a
murky

that
had
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
signature
cantillon
sour
acidic
oaky
barrel
funk
was
definitely
there
in
the
nose
with
some
pungent
muscat
grape
notes
and
slight
vinegar
notes
as
well
it
also
had
some
nice
mouthwatering
citrus
aromas
the
taste
had
more
of
the
lemon
citrusy
character
with
some
muscat
grapes
oaky
funky
and
barnyard
accents
but
it
did
have
slight
acidic
notes
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
but
lemon
citrusy
oaky
funky
vinous
dry
and
sour
puckering
finish
that
lingered
on
the
palate
it
drank
really
good
and
im
always
happy
to
try
different
cantillon
beers
anytime
good
lookin
out
drew
for
bringing
by
to
bobbys
crib
d
certainly
not
a
boring
beer
it
seems
to
get
better
with
every
sip
recommended
d
smooth
interesting
and
delicious
the
sausagelike
smell
puts
me
off
a
little
but
i
think
it
would
work
well
with
a
hearty
dinner
i
cant
get
over
how
mild
the
yeast
taste
ends
up
after
that
intense
smell
but
not
breathing
in
through
my
nose
transforms
it
from
intense
and
weird
to
delicious
and
fun
p
s
not
bad
read
amazing
wcream

wow
was
blown
away
by
this
one
have
had
it
on
tap
multiple
times
unknown
ages
and
really
enjoyed
it
but
this
one
year
old
bottle
really
outshines
the
times
i
have
had
it
on
tap
bottle
opens
with
a
nice
pop
and
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
one
off
the
bat
is
much
more
tart
and
lemon
zest
smelling
than
the
kriek
that
i
had
previously
opened
in
the
same
night
pours
a
yellow
hazed
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
collar
around
the
glass
as
said
the
aroma
is
very
tartsour
smelling
mixed
with
some
wine
aromas
and
barnyrad
funk
but
i
want
to
be
clear
for
me
the
dominant
aroma
is
the
lemon
tart
notes
the
first
sip
puckers
my
mouth
pretty
intensely
very
dry
with
a
light
mouthfeel
after
my
mouth
relaxs
a
bit
the
full
floavor
of
the
beer
is
evident
lemon
cider
apple
white
grape
notes
abound
pretty
enjoyable
but
otherwise
hard
for
me
to
really
pick
out
the
muscat
grape
flaovrs
mixed
with
everything
else
the
dryness
of
this
makes
it
somewhat
difficult
to
drink
lots
a
bottle
split
23
ways
is
probably
ideal
db
a
solid
lambic
again
but
not
so
fruitgrapeadded
forward
very
sour
but
still
enjoyable
this
was
one
funky
ass
lambic
definitely
pleasant
and
with
the
strong
lambicnotes
leather
etc
quite
attenuated
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
lambic
with
the
depth
and
character
that
permeates
cantillons
line
of
fine
beers
d
when
i
think
cantillon
cannot
surprise
me
any
more
than
they
already
have
they
somehow
continue
to
each
time
i
try
something
new
of
theirs
while
this
is
only
a
year
old
the
acidicsour
fruits
really
balance
well
with
the
funk
and
subtle
sweetness
this
could
age
for
decades
because
it
is
so
highly
acidic
but
the
fruits
really
are
tasty
in
this
now
d
the
bright
tartness
with
the
subtle
muscat
grape
flavor
and
cheese
rind
work
great
together
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
crisp
and
the
tartness
is
smooth
enough
for
another
glass
d
a
really
good
subtle
refined
lambic
yet
another
beer
from
cantillon
that
hits
the
mark
d
to
say
that
i
am
extremely
fond
of
cantillon
is
an
understatement
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
every
beer
that
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
and
anything
at
all
associated
with
cantillon
this
golden
fluid
the
2009
vintage
is
delivered
from
the
tap
at
moeder
lambic
fontainas
with
a
fleeting
head
it
offgasses
scents
of
nectarines
spiced
apricots
chardonnay
inexpertly
cleaned
white
peach
pits
and
tastes
austere
but
not
as
caustic
as
the
bottled
form
aided
no
doubt
by
the
keg
format
which
thickens
the
mouthfeel
and
focuses
on
the
fruit
the
funk
and
sourness
are
left
by
the
wayside
but
its
for
a
good
cause
bottled
122408
poured
into
a
malheur
chalice
light
lacing
and
little
head
with
no
retention
aroma
of
freshlike
green
apples
and
sour
grapes
taste
is
puckering
and
sour
without
funk
interesting
and
refreshing
paired
well
with
a
sharp
cheddar
cheese
nice
sour
although
two
glasses
was
my
limit
on
this
one
drinkability
one
of
the
better
cantillon
sours
i
have
had
the
initial
taste
is
very
mouth
puckering
the
apple
and
grape
tones
mix
well
with
the
sourness
i
would
drink
several
glasses
of
this
if
i
knew
my
body
could
handle
this
taste
is
sweet
funky
and
quite
grapey
its
very
tart
and
puckering
fairly
light
mouthfeel
but
nice
sharp
carbonation
quite
drinkable
for
a
sour
because
it
doesnt
really
have
that
horse
blanket
taste
to
it
d
overall
good
but
not
anywhere
near
my
favorite
cantillons
or
even
any
other
fruit
lambics
the
metalallic
taste
was
really
only
held
in
check
towards
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
as
the
dregs
sourness
cut
in
yes
this
one
did
give
me
gi
distress
within
a
few
hours
drinkabilitythis
cantillon
is
quite
drinkable
and
pleasant
my
palate
has
a
tough
time
with
sourtart
beers
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
nice
pucker
with
a
seemless
meshing
of
many
pleasant
characteristics
of
a
solid
fruit
lambic
wish
i
had
enjoyed
another
d
i
love
this
stuff
off
tap
its
just
amazing
woukd
love
to
age
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
decade
its
not
overly
sour
i
had
a
few
without
much
trouble
a
bit
acidic
its
nothing
short
of
amazing
d
very
tart
and
sour
with
bugs
galore
oaky
and
juicy
very
enjoyable
indeed
with
two
glasses
in
me
and
some
nice
cheese
life
is
good
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
every
sip
is
better
than
the
last
this
is
excellent
i
always
read
that
this
one
in
general
is
not
as
good
as
others
i
find
the
balance
to
be
pretty
spot
on
the
flavors
really
blend
well
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
few
bubbles
but
no
real
head
the
aroma
is
very
sour
with
some
oak
notes
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
very
tart
grapes
along
with
some
oak
there
are
some
vinegar
components
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
white
wine
the
beer
is
very
dry
very
low
carbonation
and
the
beer
has
a
thinmedium
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
starts
out
soft
but
finishes
crisp
as
youre
about
to
swallow
very
refreshing
as
far
as
sipping
beers
go
drinkability
good
the
feel
is
light
and
warm
it
starts
off
drinkable
then
fades
as
the
alcohol
finish
becomes
more
pronounced
im
drawing
a
reasonably
straight
parallel
to
the
white
wine
must
that
ive
got
fermenting
at
the
moment
yeasty
sweet
and
zingy
white
grape
juice
and
faint
alcohol
the
exaggerated
tartness
is
the
beers
domain
alone
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
sour
lambic
the
guest
muscat
grapes
doing
well
to
exhibit
their
own
wares
d
really
good
for
the
style
d
pretty
nice
brew
not
as
much
carbonation
as
most
sours
ive
had
which
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
the
taste
and
nose
are
excellent
seek
this
beer
out
d
this
beer
is
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
flavors
are
complex
and
very
pleasant
unique
like
many
of
cantillons
fine
lambics
this
is
another
shining
star
d
awesome
tasty
and
damn
drinkable
the
aroma
is
an
explosion
of
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
with
slight
buttery
notes
the
palette
has
one
of
the
best
deliveries
of
any
lambic
ive
ever
had
it
starts
with
nice
pineapple
and
cantalope
transitions
into
orange
and
grapefruit
with
a
sharp
acidic
finish
so
refreshing
but
the
grapes
are
not
obvious
this
is
the
least
apparent
fruit
from
any
fruit
lambic
ive
had
still
a
delight
the
mouthfeel
is
standard
good
for
a
lambic
the
drinkability
is
high
for
the
style
i
often
find
my
stomach
getting
blitzkrieged
by
the
acidity
after
only
6
or
7
oz
but
this
one
just
keeps
begging
me
to
drink
more
right
beer
right
place
right
time
this
beer
walks
a
fine
balance
between
wine
and
beer
perfect
for
the
white
wine
lover
funky
earthy
sourness
melds
with
a
ripe
juicy
yet
tart
white
grape
quality
bone
dry
finish
and
a
touch
of
oakiness
make
for
a
really
satisfying
experience
i
felt
the
carb
could
have
been
upped
a
bit
without
hurting
it
but
this
beer
is
hard
to
fault
great
on
its
own
as
an
appertif
or
with
just
about
any
meal
thanks
rob
thanks
to
phil
for
the
bottle
d
cantillon
is
one
of
those
breweries
that
just
cant
do
any
wrong
i
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
drinkability
doesnt
have
all
those
crazy
cantillon
funks
and
musts
that
are
in
some
others
but
its
just
that
this
beer
is
relatively
young
for
drinkability
sake
though
this
is
awesome
its
got
a
nice
tartness
medium
acid
and
is
still
relatively
fruity
enjoyed
the
shit
out
of
this
beer
should
probably
grab
another
for
a
couple
years
down
the
road
the
beer
is
grapey
for
sure
sweet
and
smooth
low
body
and
a
late
sour
with
a
tartness
that
gets
me
in
the
corners
of
my
mouth
there
isnt
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
this
beer
is
suppose
to
be
thin
and
the
sour
comes
from
acids
this
is
a
great
beer
the
more
cantillon
i
have
the
more
i
love
them
i
would
serious
recommend
it
i
need
to
find
a
bottle
so
i
can
compare
them
d
for
such
a
sour
lambic
it
is
really
a
drinkable
one
w
the
fruit
notes
very
fresh
and
vibrant
and
the
evolution
of
the
taste
profile
as
it
gets
warmer
is
great
the
temp
brings
out
more
asrtringency
and
also
light
sweetness
i
sipped
on
this
for
awhile
top
notch
the
flavors
on
the
palate
are
through
the
roof
theres
so
much
juicy
fruity
white
grape
character
that
its
incredible
like
a
dry
white
wine
the
fruit
character
is
explosive
but
the
lack
of
sweetness
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
beverage
the
sourness
is
quite
prominent
surprisingly
so
with
a
big
lemon
character
along
with
a
touch
of
funk
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
finishes
dry
and
pucking
palate
cleansingly
so
with
a
lingering
lemon
juice
and
white
grape
character
truly
phenomenal
overall
an
amazingly
unigue
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
been
able
to
try
thanks
to
polly
at
avenue
pub
for
bringing
this
one
in
not
one
of
cantillons
best
beers
but
still
a
good
one
at
9
for
10
oz
considering
the
rarity
of
this
beer
not
a
bad
price
either
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
in
a
goblet
as
part
of
the
lions
pride
belgian
beer
fest
the
beer
has
a
cloudy
opaque
peach
appearance
like
a
glass
of
juice
or
nectar
there
was
no
head
per
se
but
i
could
see
some
individual
bubbles
on
top
that
kind
of
looked
like
specs
floating
in
the
beer
it
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
slightly
it
has
an
aroma
that
is
both
musty
and
sour
i
can
smell
some
peach
as
well
the
taste
has
some
sourness
but
not
too
much
it
is
a
bit
ciderlike
it
tastes
aged
kind
of
like
an
old
oxidized
beer
but
not
quite
there
were
some
ripe
fruit
flavors
as
well
it
has
a
light
body
there
was
a
good
tingling
sensation
from
the
sourness
i
also
felt
a
slight
puckering
after
i
swallowed
it
was
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
go
through
an
entire
bottle
a
nice
refreshing
drink
great
for
an
aperatif

good

very
interesting
beer
with
a

unique
things
going

worked
well
as
a
substitute
for
white
wine
with
a
mediteranean
style
meal
d
nice
but
the
flavors
never
really
completely
fused
together
like
they
do
in
most
cantillon
beers
still
a
very
solid
offering
overall
another
very
good
offering
from
cantillon
however
i
would
say
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
their
lineup
for
sure
worth
a
shot
but
i
even
prefer
the
classic
amongst
others
perfect
carbonation
and
a
nice
body
this
one
was
a
great
alternative
for
my
fiancee
and
i
to
drink
while
our
friends
got
some
wine
i
must
say
there
are
one
or
two
cantillons
i
enjoy
more
but
this
was
really
awesome
one
of
the
most
drinkable
extremely
sour
beers
out
there
d
not
so
sour
as
to
destroy
the
palette
so
more
drinkable
than
say
a
100
kriek
nonetheless
i
think
cantillon
has
some
other
offerings
more
to
my
likings
a
solid
beer
from
cantillon
a
simple
tartness
is
the
dominate
flavor
still
an
enjoyable
beer
not
nearly
as
sour
and
acidic
as
other
beers
from
the
brewery
this
really
is
worth
a
try
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
brewery
though
overall
a
fantastic
beer
very
sour
but
i
really
like
it
my
glass
is
emptying
very
fast
i
highly
recommend
it
the
pour
is
yellow
gold
with
a
light
head
that
dissipates
into
a
ring
of
fluffy
white
around
the
edges
of
my
glass
a
vigilant
swirling
allows
a
very
minute
amount
of
lacing
to
form
smells
of
a
beautiful
sour
with
hints
of
sour
green
apples
and
mild
grapes
theres
a
gorgeous
lacto
sourness
on
the
tongue
that
is
smooth
as
silk
theres
mild
grapes
in
there
as
well
this
mouth
is
very
creamy
and
it
does
a
near
perfect
job
of
rounding
out
one
superb
beer
750
ml
bottle
enjoyed
after
thanksgiving
dinner
pours
a
cloudy
dark
gold
with
a
small
white
head
that
coats
the
edges
of
the
glass
a
few
grape
seeds
poured
out
into
my
glass
as
well
smells
of
belgian
funk
lightly
catty
with
a
light
grape
aroma
tastes
of
even
more
belgian
fonky
funk
with
a
sour
fruit
and
grape
note
on
the
midpalate
finishes
puckering
with
tannins
for
a
very
dry
finish
feels
light
with
moderate
bubbliness
not
quite
as
champagne
like
as
some
cantillons
but
good
overall
quite
a
tasty
brew
the
grapes
add
to
the
flavor
but
the
star
is
still
the
traditional
lambic
here
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
not
for
everyone
and
not
for
all
the
time
im
privileged
to
have
enjoyed
it
and
under
such
fine
circumstances
i
feel
doubly
so
thank
you
cantillon
for
another
sublime
product
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
vigneronne
you
would
think
the
moderate
alcohol
level
would
make
this
one
go
down
quite
easy
but
there
are
too
many
strong
tasty
flavors
here
to
savor
its
a
big
tart
beer
that
keeps
beating
around
the
palate
until
it
screams
uncle
abv
is
completely
hidden
behind
everything
else
that
is
going
on
here
honestly
we
have
another
winner
from
cantillon
definitely
recommended
bottle
poured
a
bright
golden
yellow
color
lambic
with
a
small
pure
with
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
horse
blanket
with
light
green
apple
acidity
and
light
tart
finish
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
between
some
tart
notes
with
light
oak
and
some
horse
blanket
and
soaked
leather
acidity
is
well
balanced
but
muscat
grapes
are
hard
to
noticed
but
could
have
dropped
the
acidity
level
since
i
seem
to
noticed
that
there
is
less
acidity
then
in
a
regular
cantillon
product
drinkability
is
excellent
a
tasty
mix
of
sour
and
funk
with
a
very
drinkable
aura
and
a
finish
that
cleanses
the
palate
a
bit
less
sour
than
the
classic
gueuze
but
just
as
drinkable
there
is
a
subtle
note
of
cherry
and
a
touch
of
pear
as
the
brew
warms
a
bit
giving
it
some
complexity
but
in
the
end
it
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
funk
cheers
highly
recommended
nice
tiny
bubbles
soft
cushy
carbonation
along
with
the
prickliness
of
the
acidity
like
the
two
sides
of
some
velcro
getting
freaky
with
each
other
quite
refreshing
and
the
more
i
drink
this
and
become
acclimated
to
the
acidity
the
more
refreshing
and
enjoyable
it
becomes
overall
enjoyable
and
interesting
and
certainly
worth
a
look
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
no
head
smells
typically
sour
but
not
overly
acetic
the
sweetness
of
the
grapes
nicely
balances
the
sharpness
of
the
sour
and
mellows
everything
out
considerably
both
in
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
there
is
almost
a
peachlike
richness
of
fruit
in
the
aroma
tangy
and
luscious
a
hint
of
creaminess
in
the
finish
very
smooth
not
too
sharp
and
wonderfully
sweet
and
sour
with
a
hint
of
tannins
from
the
oak
and
grape
skins
this
paired
wonderfully
with
a
sharp
cheddar
and
water
crackers
with
the
sweetsour
beer
acting
as
a
nice
foil
to
the
sharpness
and
richness
of
the
cheese
fairly
subtle
for
this
brewery
but
very
complex
notes
of
oak
sweet
grape
acetic
notes
a
touch
of
barnyard
and
a
subtle
creaminess
delicious
definitely
a
good
one
to
drink
on
a
hot
miami
night
i
could
have
downed
the
whole
750
had
i
not
offered
it
up
at
a
tasting
very
good
but
possibly
not
worth
the
high
price
possibly
that
said
i
just
might
get
another
as
it
is
very
tasty
notes
further
testing
will
be
required
for
this
interesting
beer
d
a
pleasure
to
drink
another
one
of
cantillons
lambic
experiments
gone
very
well
the
nose
and
the
taste
are
beautiful
and
dynamic
and
its
a
joy
to
witness
the
beer
develop
as
it
warms
i
just
wish
that
it
had
some
more
carbonation
i
can
only
imagine
how
long
the
finish
would
be
if
the
carbonation
would
make
the
beer
sparkle
on
the
palate
for
even
longer
a
musttry
for
lambic
lovers
d
a
very
good
beer
unfortunately
the
bottle
was
cellared
for
a
couple
of
so
the
taste
of
grapes
was
on
the
decline
but
still
very
good
d
good
drinkablity
this
effort
by
cantillon
is
still
very
young
i
dont
think
ive
had
anything
younger
than
about
3
years
from
them
before
this
is
just
a
year
old
the
flavour
is
very
good
but
other
aspects
of
the
beer
need
some
work
in
5
years
it
could
justify
its
19
99
pricetag
but
not
today
overall
really
glad
to
see
this
is
on
tap
havent
really
had
the
chance
to
have
many
cantillons
ontap
but
this
was
well
worth
it
overall
i
liked
it
but
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
again
given
the
price
of
cantillon
beers
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
750ml
bottled
122408
i
think
it
was
18
orange
still
not
many
bubbles
it
smells
pretty
great
funky
lambic
with
a
taste
that
follows
suit
and
adds
a
acidic
sourness
but
muted
it
has
a
kind
of
syrup
quality
to
the
feel
funky
this
was
an
interesting
lambic
but
im
not
sure
my
palate
was
up
to
the
challenge
as
i
really
didnt
taste
the
muscat
grapes
other
than
a
faint
hint
of
dietrite
white
grape
soda
so
wonderful
to
have
a
chance
to
drink
a
cantillon
brew
on
tap
pale
rosetinted
golden

no
head
to
speak

in
keeping

characteristic
cantillon

aromas
love
the
tart
flavor
from
the
first
sip
fairly
mild
when
compared
to
other
cantillon
offerings
very
drinkable
with
a
lightly
grapey
finish
excellent
aperitif
could
easily
drink
a
lot
more
with
a
meal
good
solid
but
there
are
others
i
would
revisit
before
this
this
beer
has
been
on
my
list
for
a
few
years
my
wife
picked
up
a
bottle
as
a
gift
for
me
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
the
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
almost
brownishstraw
color
the
liquid
is
really
turbid
and
the
head
is
fizzy
and
then
nonexistent
honestly
its
not
an
invitingly
attractive
brew
the
smell
however
is
very
nice
funky
musty
wetstraw
and
barnyard
grape
skins
pale
malt
wonderful
and
complex
aroma
the
taste
is
solid
mouthpuckeringly
sour
but
also
also
balanced
with
a
decent
sweetness
the
malt
and
grapeskin
quality
comes
out
a
little
more
in
the
taste
there
is
a
lot
of
fruitiness
just
underneath
the
tartness
fresh
and
vibrant
are
great
words
for
the
beer
very
drinkable
feels
warm
and
nice
its
a
very
good
lambic
but
knowing
what
lies
in
cantillon
cellars
this
one
is
not
the
top
of
tops
mediumlight
and
slightly
syrupy
upfront
with
a
light
dryness
in
the
end
not
like
any
other
cantillon
beer
ive
had
extremely
easy
to
drink
this
bottle
is
about
a
year
old
im
guessing
maybe
more
a
mellow
golden
straw
color
barely
cloudy
and
traces
of
the
slightest
carbonation
smells
of
lemon
hay
fields
and
wet
funk
sourness
is
there
but
very
subdued
and
mellow
allowing
lots
of
flavor
to
flood
the
senses
a
tart
apple
and
grapeskin
main
character
juicy
citrus
and
rind
and
a
load
of
barn
funk
real
nice
and
funky
wild
this
is
technically
a
fruit
lambic
and
the
white
grape
is
surely
there
but
this
is
an
awful
lot
like
a
nice
gueuze
just
mellower
the
mouthfeel
is
so
so
soft
not
bold
and
brash
at
all
like
some
cantillon
can
be
really
unique
in
that
way
i
would
love
to
see
what
a
bit
more
age
would
do
for
this
beer
a
real
standout
even
in
the
already
top
notch
line
of
beers
from
cantillon
pour
is
beautiful
lemon
tea
amber
light
but
consistent
bubbles
that
create
a
murky
darkness
of
bubbles
at
first
below
the
head
cloudier
than
most
catillons
nose
of
melon
subtle
sour
apple
not
at
all
forward
raspberry
and
white
grape
mineral
with
a
funk
of
grassiness
cantulope
and
candied
pineapple
all
carrying
over
into
the
palate
with
a
quality
of
sourness
that
blends
into
a
strawberry
citrus
woody
bitterness
grassy
floral
lavender
rosemary
and
black
currant
finish
a
light
sweetness
of
chardonnay
fantastic
a
pleasure
to
have
quite
the
lambic
right
here
soft
slightly
pillowy
carbonation
and
light
body

at
from
the
vine
in
columbus
it
was
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
film
from
the
first
whiff
you
know
this
will
be
sour
but
in
addition
this
has
a
lot
of
funky
barnyard
things
going
on
a
la
fantome
the
taste
is
delicious
but
tart
lemon
zest
and
pith
with
horse
blanket
but
most
of
all
bitingly
sour
i
like
it
a
lot
this
is
nearly
flawless
like
all
cantillon
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
yet
carbonated
and
effervescent
this
is
such
a
good
beer
i
think
its
best
summed
up
by
longbeachbum
in
terms
of
wine
this
is
cantillons
white
to
the
st
lamvinus
red
absolutely
recommended
visiting
the
cantillon
brewery
jean
van
roy
told
me
that
he
felt
the
vigneronne
to
be
even
more
complex
and
impressive
than
its
red
grape
brother
the
st
lamvinus
although
i
personally
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
i
do
feel
that
both
are
not
only
examples
of
worldclass
craftsmanship
and
timehoned
skill
but
also
artistic
works
of
beauty
the
smell
is
feint
sour
fruit
the
taste
is
sharp
and
tart
but
pleasant
the
dryness
of
the
italian
muscat
grapes
from
which
it
was
made
comes
through
but
with
the
tart
funkiness
typical
or
so
im
lead
to
believe
of
the
lambic
style
ive
dabbled
with
a
few
lambics
but
none
compares
to
this
superb
clean
tasting
with
a
sourness
and
tartness
that
do
not
offend
but
attract
the
drinker
to
imbibe
a
bit
more
and
a
bit
more
and
a
bit
more
when
one
thinks
of
a
sour
fruit
lemon
naturally
comes
to
mind
but
this
is
more
like
a
lemon
meringue
pie
with
a
tasty
deliciousness
that
is
easy
to
savour
yet
hard
to
imitate
yup
this
is
the
real
thing
and
until
youve
had
it
its
hard
to
describe
how
unique
it
is
and
deserving
of
its
reputation
thanks
jan
and
get
your
self
back
to
belgium
soon
i
dig
sharing
those
souvenirs
you
bring
back
md
clean
on
the
palate
the
soft
carbonation
serves
the
tart
profile
extremely
well
while
the
body
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
ive
tasted
for
any
geuzelambic
for
not
only
it
retains
the
integration
well
but
also
all
the
flavours
that
i
can
detect
evolve
just
neatly
and
seamlessly
within
this
agreed
boundary
its
more
acidic
on
the
flavour
than
on
the
nose
and
the
white
grapes
have
indeed
rendered
a
higher
level
of
sour
fruitiness
if
i
am
not
trying
too
hard
to
make
sense
of
the
influence
all
in
all
this
is
not
something
i
would
try
often
and
get
used

truly
incredible
beer
this
beer
is
crazy
good
2013
vintage
from
a
375ml
bottle
its
a
shame
that
this
beer
is
not
more
available
understand
why
but
this
would
be
such
a
great
beer
outings
accompanying
picnics
sipping
on
the
deck
and
sharing
with
friends
this
is
not
a
beer
to
limit
to
tastings
and
talk
what
more
needs
to
be
said
a
great
lambic
probably
the
best
blueberry
beer
of
any
style
by
far
i
have
ever
had
not
my
favorite
cantillon
but
does
this
get
any
better
no
unequivocally
not
even
close
simply
delicious
funky
sour
barn
smell
from
the
glass
but
it
drinks
so
smoothly
you
just
want
more
possibly
the
best
vintage
yet
overall
this
is
a
solid
fruited
lambic
for
sure
very
enjoyable
and
on
the
same
level
as
many
of
their
other
fruited
lambics
the
berries
are
rather
subdued
compared
to
some
of
the
other
examples
of
the
style
but
that
is
part
of
the
art
in
building
complexity
i
also
wouldnt
necessarily
describe
the
flavor
as
blue
or
blackberries
as
pomegranate
tastes
and
feels
much
more
accurate
here
nevertheless
this
was
enjoyable
and
i
was
very
happy
to
finally
drink
this
one
at
the
source
cheers
gents
o
not
that
impressed
and
thought
this
was
really
overrated
as
this
was
one
of
my
least
favorite
cantillon
to
date
really
a
funky
beer
but
not
much
tartness
or
fruit
flavor
to
it
only
had
about
3
oz
which
probably
biases
my
rating
downwards
as
this
seemed
uncharacteristically
subtle
and
restrained
for
cantillon
the
sort
of
beer
that
takes
a
bit
more
volume
to
deconstruct
this
is
not
a
let
down
and
totally
worth
it
perhaps
rating
a
bit
according
to
the
occasion
but
still
deserving
of
praise
this
old
bottle
poured
a
nice
murky
purpleish
color
with
the
gorgeous
pink
head
that
everyone
raves
about
it
actually
had
a
good
amount
of
head
considering
its
age
smell
was
predominantly
blueberries
and
old
musty
funk
its
awesome
that
the
blueberry
aroma
is
like
actual
berries
not
some
artificial
stuff
probably
my
favorite
thing
about
the
cantillon
lambics
is
that
the
realfruit
smells
and
flavors
come
through
even
with
age
on
them
the
taste
was
stunning
of
course
there
were
loads
of
blueberries
i
think
with
age
this
beer
has
probably
changed
substantially
but
everything
was
in
its
right
place
the
bretty
kind
of
funk
was
blended
in
nicely
with
the
fruit
and
a
good
lactic
sourness
tied
it
all
together
i
also
picked
up
an
interesting
cinnamon
note
which
i
have
noticed
previously
in
the
cherry
sours
mouth
feel
was
soft
and
lightly
carbed
this
beer
is
damn
near
perfect
and
my
review
doesnt
do
it
justice
looking
forward
to
trying
another
bottle
perhaps
a
fresh
one
down
the
road
drink
this
if
you
can
it
is
well
worth
the
hype

of

i
will
give
it
a

because
it
is
a

but
i
have
rated

this
is
clearly
way
overrated
because
it
is

actually

that
is

it
overall
this
was
indeed
amazing
lives
up

imo
a
very

none
ive
tasted
okay
so
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
beer
really
lives
up
to
the
hype
on
its
own
merits
because
that
blueberry
sweet
and
sourness
contributes
a
lot
to
this
beer
more
so
than
bordeaux
grapes
or
more
cherries
have
done
i
wish
cantillon
would
make
a
yearround
blueberry
lambic
so
that
we
could
get
this
one
more
easily
its
an
über
whale
because
of
its
several
hundred
bottlesayear
production
but
i
will
strongly
strongly
recommend
that
everyone
who
likes
sours
try
to
get
one
of
these
bottles
at
least
once
in
their
beer
lifetimes
overall
expectations
were
high
and
i
was
not
let
down
fantastic
stuff
wish
it
was
part
of
the
regular
line
up
again
huge
cheers
to
jeffo
for
this
bottle
of
blueberry
heaven
o
an
amazing
beer
going
in
i
had
high
hopes
which
were
tempered
from
others
who
have
had
the
beer
previously
i
will
agree
that
it
is
amazing
but
i
would
rather
drink
other
cantillon
beers
which
take
less
effortcost
to
get
ive
been
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
lambic
for
ages
now
and
cant
thank
alex
enough
for
sharing
a
bottle
hopefully
i
come
across
more
in
the
future

homerun
hit
by
the
incredibly

o
it
was
nice
to
try
this
but
it
didnt
live

the
hype
i
expected
id
just
as
much
prefer
to
drink
a
rose
st
lam
or
fou
as
i
would
this
ill
probably
try
and
seek
out
another
batch
just
to
compare
overall
i
hoped
the
fruit
character
would
be
incredible
but
its
very
green
foufoune
is
better
but
this
is
a
great
lambic
o
amazing
and
enjoyed
maybe
overhyped
try
it
and
decide
for
yourself
would
have
again
and
again
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
finishes
dry
very
inviting
and
easy
to
drink
well
worth
seeking
out
o
wonderful
beer
glad
i
got
too
try
it
overall
not
the
best
beer
that
i
have
had
but
the
most
beautifully
weird
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
i
understand
the
hype
overall
yeah
this
beer
is
wonderful
it
is
officially
my
new
favorite
cantillion
sour
i
gotta
say
that
its
awesome
to
finally
try
this
beer
that
i
have
been
after
for
a
while
now
this
beer
is
excellent
i
feel
super
lucky
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
cant
wait
to
get
my
own
bottles
o
a
delicious
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
given
the
hype
that
surrounds
it
but
the
blueberry
character
is
really
amazing
and
the
funkiness
of
this
beer
is
highly
complex
so
i
think
it
definitely
lived
up
to
its
reputation
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
cantillon
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
fruited
lambics
ive
ever
had
blabaer
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
cherry
red
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
lighter
minimal
pink
foam
tops
the
beer
and
does
manage
to
stick
around
for
a
while
the
nose
is
a
good
blend
of
an
earthy
slightly
musty
funk
and
a
slightly
tart
berry
fruitiness
flavor
wise
the
beers
not
quite
as
balanced
the
brett
character
isnt
as
potent
relegated
to
a
bit
of
damp
hay
lurking
in
the
background
the
blueberry
influence
is
a
bit
muted
as
well
just
a
faint
berry
flavor
is
appreciable
in
fairness
though
blueberry
is
a
pretty
subtle
fruit
in
general
when
it
goes
into
a
beer
the
acidity
is
what
really
stands
out
flashy
and
striking
while
not
being
overpoweringly
sour
i
want
to
guess
that
cantillon
uses
an
older
batch
of
lambic
as
the
base
here
the
body
is
nice
and
light
but
i
find
myself
wishing
the
carbonation
had
just
a
little
more
zip
to
it
blabaer
is
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
but
give
how
much
more
of
a
challenge
it
is
to
get
than
some
other
loons
i
dont
think
that
i
would
recommend
this
one
over
the
others
considering
i
was
dying
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
it
did
not
meet
my
expectations
there
are
other
cantillon
lambics
i
prefer

is

the
main

the

to
the

overall
blåbær
is
a
fantastic
fruit
lambic
however
i
am
not
sure
it
is
any
better
than
rose
de
gambrinus
and
probably
rides
on
its
rarity
to
some
extent
still
if
i
lived
in
denmark
i
would
certainly
get
my
limit
of
bottles
every
year
a
amazing
lambic
it
is
very
typical
cantillon
but
much
much
more
vibrant
it
is
a
dropdead
gorgeous
beer
the
taste
is
quite
similar
in
beauty
with
its
harmony
between
dry
earth
and
must
and
sweet
blueberry
its
exceptionally
balanced
and
it
takes
your
palate
on
quite
a
ride
its
an
unmissable
beer
that
is
undoubtedly
my
favorite
lambic
lighter
medium
body
well
carbonated
bubbly
and
lively
on
the
tongue
one
of
the
best
fruit
lambics
ive
ever
had
although
i
believe
fou
foune
is
still
my
favorite
now
ive
had
it
this
this
is
what
lambicswilds
should
be
like
the
sour
tartness
playing
off
other
aspects
of
the
beer
rather
than
being
an
exercise
in
facial
contortions
mindblowing
no
excellent
certainly
very
glad
to
try
it
o
a
quality
beer
for
sure
but
this
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
im
looking
forward
to
trying
another
vintage
of
this
to
see
how
it
compares
a
good
not
great
representation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
gotta
say
i
sure
as
hell
didnt
expect
this
guy
to
drop
in
my
lap
the
way
it
did
my
thanks
go
out
to
whomever
it
was
that
shared
the
bottle
with
me
it
pours
a
clear
deep
indigo
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
light
purpleish
foam
the
nose
comprises
funky
blueberries
light
tobacco
and
plenty
of
farmhousestyle
funk
a
hint
of
vinegar
seeps
in
the
back
door
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
that
vinegar
coming
in
stronger
though
not
strongly
enough
to
properly
usurp
the
tartness
is
a
lot
lower
than
i
expected
though
theres
definitely
some
tannic
qualities
to
be
found
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
sticky
finish
overall
while
this
was
a
generally
enjoyable
beer
it
came
nowhere
near
to
living
up
to
the
hype
surrounding
it
i
cant
for
the
life
of
me
fathom
why
so
many
would
stop
at
so
little
to
obtain
what
i
thought
to
be
something
just
pretty
good
to
each
their
own
i
suppose
the
pour
is
a
nice
light
purple
color
mixed
with
red
highlights
and
an
odd
colored
headpurplepink
almost
the
aroma
is
what
you
expect
from
classic
cantillon
not
a
ton
of
blueberry
aroma
i
would
say
but
a
definite
fruity
scent
does
arise
now
and
then
slight
funk
flavor
was
almost
delicate
tartness
is
more
restrained
than
in
most
of
their
beers
a
mix
of
light
berry
flavors
with
a
decent
smack
of
tartness
and
the
inevitable
funk
i
really
like
how
subdued
this
beer
is
and
think
it
is
wonderfully
crafted
good
funk
with
a
mild
blueberry
presence
among
oak
and
vinous
notes
overall
i
would
say
this
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
is
it
an
outstanding
beer
of
course
but
dont
trade
away
the
farm
try
it
if
you
have
the
opportunity
but
dont
lose
sleep
over
it
gfunk
o
this
was
compared
next
to
a
home
brew
both
smelled
strongly
of
vinegar
i
had
a
hard
time
telling
which
one
i
liked
better
and
both
saw
the
dump
glass
they
were
served
blind
but
it
was
let
known
that
one
of
them
was
blabaer
very
disappointing
ending
my
search
for
this
beer
now
its
a
nice
purplish
red
color
with
a
ring
of
pink
foam
smells
of
vinegar
and
blue
cheese
tastes
of
vinegar
and
a
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
its
quite
dry
and
acidic
this
is
not
good
i
hope
other
vintages
are
good
otherwise
this
beer
is
seriously
mediocre
and
yall
are
deceiving
thyselves
o
overally
what
a
great
lambic
perhaps
a
great
gateway
sour
as
it
isnt
really
sour
at
all
but
rather
fruity
not
overly
sweet
just
right
really
really
solid
i
cant
decide
if
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
as
the
hype
is
so
intense
on
this
beer
but
what
a
hell
of
a
beer
note
i
had
a
2012
vintage
the
following
day
and
found
the
blueberry
to
be
much
more
faint
in
the
12
i
assume
that
the
recipe
is
pretty
consistent
batch
to
batch
so
i
found
it
peculiar
that
i
found
the
blueberry
to
be
more
prominent
in
the
older
batch
than
the
new

dry
with

mouthfeel
is

this
one
was
a
little
heavier
on
the
funky
side
than
i
expected
quite
intriguing
o
wel
im
glad
nameless
asshole
brought
this
beer
for
me
to
taste
an
interestingly
rare
tick
though
i
dont
see
it
living
up
to
the
hype
verdict
this
is
fantastic
and
warrants
the
hype
this
is
definitely
a
celebration
of
fresh
and
natural
blueberry
overall
extremely
happy
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
and
even
more
happy
that
i
never
traded
for
one
so
far
of
all
the
cantillons
i
have
had
this
one
was
the
biggest
disappoint
i
would
half
heartedly
recommend
trying
this
one
just
because
of
its
current
high
regard
in
the
beer
community
o
a
very
complex
and
multilayered
drink
i
am
so
thankful
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
treat
pours

murky
dark

foamy

down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
blueberry
and
other
berry
aromas
along
with
a
distinct
plasticlike
smell
in
the
mix
taste
is
much
the
same
with
the
plastic
quality
coming
through
on
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
as
it
stands
but
the
plastic
quality
in
the
aroma
and
taste
is
not
something
too
desirable
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
great
fruit
lambic
but
i
dont
know
that
its
that
much
better
than
the
kriek
or
the
rose
i
would
have
this
again
but
not
at
the
current
price
but
honestly
im
pretty
sure
i
prefer
foufoune
overall
this
is
incredible
and
met
the
hype
for
me
really
complex
and
unlike
anything
id
normally
drink
in
a
good
way
a
quite
intriguing
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
my
other
vintages
overall
even
though
this
is
the
best
cantillon
it
really
does
not
justify
how
saught
after
this
beer
is
do
not
get
me
wrong
i
think
this
beer
is
the
best
cantillon
i
have
tried
but
do
not
be
led
astray
by
believeing
that
it
is
soooo
much
better
than
anything
else

a

a

skim

a
frothy

expresses
berry
fruit
citric

a

chemical
taste
follows

with
the
addition
of

closer
to
light
with
an
assertive
carbonation
and

that
lingers
between

overall
this
is
an
excellent
fruit
lambic
however
the
blueberry
flavor
is
definitely
dropping
off
nonetheless
im
very
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
have
tried
this
beer
call
it
delicious
and
end
it
at
that
ill
let
the
rest
of
the
community
dictate
its
delightfulness
if
i
ever
go
back
to
europe
i
think
im
planning
my
trip
around
the
release
of
this
beer
damn
so
good
mad
props
for
jh1982
opening
this
the
morning
of
um
i
dunno
was
it
fridays
games
at
march
madness
o
a
fantastic
effort
its
not
crazily
better
than
some
of
the
more
available
cantillon
efforts
but
this
is
good
stuff
o
overall
a
really
good
lambic
i
was
a
bit
let
down
with
how
minimal
the
blueberries
were
though
it
packs
a
bit
of
a
sour
punch
almost
like
a
sourpatch
kid
or
strawberry
jolly
rancher
but
with
a
fresh
blueberrystrawberry
quality
and
a
background
of
the
grass
and
leather
from
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
the
fruit
is
right
up
front
as
the
star
of
the
show
the
mouthfeel
is
much
as
the
appearance
akin
to
fresh
raspberry
juice
it
is
just
the
right
balance
of
alcohol
sugars
and
clean
juice
to
keep
the
body
in
check
from
becoming
too
heavy
or
too
thin
absolutely
wonderful
lambik
very
much
complexity
and
stable
presence
an
as
always
good
cantillion
the
2011
vintage
thx
to
bark
a
very
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
lambic
one
of
the
most
intriguing
beers
i
have
had
o
ok
i
will
have
to
admit
i
put
this
beer
on
a
pedestal
and
in
the
end
it
did
not
let
me
down
just
amazing
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
the
blueberries
come
out
beautifully
just
an
amazing
beer
this
was
good
not
mind
blowing
but
pretty
darn
good
while
this
was
certainly
well
crafted
it
just
lacked
that
wow
factor
to
it
that
would
have
really
put
this
over
the
top
for
me
it
seems
that
rarity
of
this
elevates
it
a
bit
thanks
for
the
opportunity
at
trying
this
though
adam
it
was
most
appreciated
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
simply
amazing
cantillon
truly
makes
phenomenal
beers
an
excellent
beer
it
is
supremely
sour
with
lots
of
tart
fruit
characters
immensely
enjoyable
but
not
the
best
beer
and
maybe
not
the
best
cantillon
ive
ever
had
o
an
excellent
beer
but
maybe
the
hype
is
a
little
too
much
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
sour
beer
but
i
just
dont
think
it
is
in
the
top
10
beers
in
the
world
a
great
beer
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
i
would
rate
other
cantillons
higher
than
this
one
also
note
that
there
was
some
sediment
at
the
end
which
was
a
good
surprise
you
could
definitely
see
the
tiny
remnants
of
the
blueberries
that
went
into
this
beer
overall
amazing
nuff
said
after
the
fact
consideration
while
glancing
over
other
reviews
i
dont
see
mention
of
some
of
the
unpleasant
character
i
picked
up
on
in
this
it
makes
me
wonder
just
how
variable
some
bottles
can
be
this
is
something
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
but
it
most
certainly
is
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
it
is
not
the
best
fruit
lambic
i
have
had
its
not
even
the
best
cantillon
offering
available
the
sheer
amount
of
blueberries
that
had
to
be
packed
in
this
to
discolor
the
brew
to
the
deep
purple
it
is
is
amazing
unfortunately
that
excitementimpression
doesnt
easily
transpire
to
the
same
degree
in
either
the
flavor
or
aroma
a
blueberry
taste
is
apparent
with
big
fruity
tart
taste
and
bit
phenolic
flavor
that
carries
over
where
the
aroma
leaves
off
there
is
a
lactic
type
of
flavor
with
mild
acidic
puckering
quality
the
taste
has
a
gentle
woody
tinge
with
mild
bitter
aspect
in
the
background
the
taste
has
more
of
an
earthy
accent
as
it
warms
with
the
funk
flavor
coming
out
to
meet
the
fruit
and
sour
taste
with
the
tart
pielike
berry
blueberry
tart
tatste
overall
i
was
overjoyed
with
the
experience
i
find
this
to
be
a
great
fruit
beer
with
a
nice
sourness
from
the
wild
yeast
without
becoming
too
overwhelming
the
perfect
blend
practically
of
berry
and
wild
yeast
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
there
is
very
little
to
find
fault
with
kudos
cantillon
o
this
beer
is
absolutely
awesome
i
now
have
to
seek
out
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
what
this
is
like
fresh
so
glad
i
got
to
finally
try
this
but
i
believe
there
are
much
better
cantillons
owow
great
fucking
beer
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
its
great
however
between
foufoune
and
blabaer
i
would
definitely
take
fou
overall
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
beer
it
was
everything
i
was
hoping
and
expecting
it
to
be
to
be
honest
i
recently
went
international
to
get
a
33cl
of
the
2011
that
said
i
will
admit
this
beer
was
not
insanely
better
than
other
cantillons
i
have
had
while
it
is
different
with
the
variation
of
berries
the
2003
lou
pepe
framboise
i
had
recently
was
more
mouth
puckering
and
sour
since
i
have
had
this
beer
fresh
i
will
now
age
the
bottle
i
own
still
a
fantastic
beer
2010
bottle
share
by
darkguardian
at
coffee
district
this
was
the
first
time
having
this
beer
and
im
glad
it
was
a
fresh
because
ive
had
some
aged
cantillons
which
were
awesome
but
the
fruit
taste
was
pretty
much
gone
it
was
hard
to
drink
this
beer
first
off
the
blueberry
and
sourness
in
the
nose
was
so
great
that
i
just
kept
smelling
the
beer
i
was
fearful
that
i
would
drink
it
in
one
shot
because
the
smell
was
that
good
the
taste
was
even
better
blueberries
were
present
but
not
overpowering
the
tartness
added
some
great
puckering
and
made
each
sip
better
and
better
i
never
pass
on
cantillon
and
its
because
of
beers
like
this
one
a
little
more
watered
down
dont
get
me
wrong
there
are
berries
and
funk
but
not
as
much
oak
or
depth
of
flavor
as
i
remember
with
previous
batches
this
was
a
375
and
i
will
rerate
a
750
batch

sometime
in
future
to
see
if
more
complexity
develops
slighty
underwhelmed

that
my

would
be
very
high
for

this

just
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
tartness
of
other
cantillon

more

would
put
this

its

the

was
ruby
red
with
barnyard
aromas
this
beer
was
smooth
and
not
overly
sour
with
tart
blueberries
and
sour
cherries
dominating
the
scene
just
amazing
twist
on
a
blueberry
sour
ale
taste
is
very
tart
and
fruity
its
very
crisp
blueberries
are
very
present
and
its
got
that
strong
cantillon
yeasty
flavor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
chewy
very
very
good
beer
this
was
undoubtedly
the
most
intense
and
complex
spontaneously
fermented
beer
i
have
ever
sampled
needless
to
say
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
am
very
grateful
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
rare
gem
this
did
not
disappoint
looked
like
dark
pink
shampagne
when
poured
into
the
glass
dry
tart
and
fruity
prickly
carbonation
that
washed
all
the
deliciousness
across
my
tongue
blueberries
must
be
an
aphrodisiac
cause
i
was
getting
laid
thanks
to
this

trading
for
a
few
more
bottles
right
now
poured

some

with
a
pinktinted
white
head
that
lasted
a
decent
while
wow
the
blueberry
is
really
coming
out
of
the
glass
nicely
tart
with
a
strong
blueberry
flavor
particularly
of
the
unripe
sour
blueberry
kind
theres
a
lot
more
to
this
slightest
hint
of
mustiness
grass
and
a
puckering
acidity
the
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
yet
very
boldly
flavored
sourness
is
intense
and
relentless
even
in
the
finish
which
is
dry
and
tart
berry
flavor
lingers
a
bit
before
giving
way
to
a
nice
bit
of
funk
the
beer
is
effervescent
and
dances
with
carbonation
but
not
too
much
so
crisp
and
velvety
at
the
same
time
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
it
all
i
know
is
that
this
beer
is
simply
outstanding
thanks

about
it
i
am
actually
tasting
the
beer
again
and
i
indeed
know
that
i
need
more
someone
help
me
out

no

any

taste
is
blueberry
skins
bitter

tannins
most
of
the
blueberry
comes
at
the
end
incredibly
sour
and

thanks
to
to
brewdan
for
this
one
750ml
2009
vintage
i
beleive
it
was
batch
1
poured
a
dark
purplishblue
with
a
pinkish
head
very
subtle
blueberry
aroma
with
amazing
cantillon
funk
a
little
more
musty
basement
smell
then
the
normal
barnyard
from
cantillon
on
the
palate
it
was
dry
and
light
it
seemed
to
be
more
tart
than
sour
mostly
berry
flavors
with
a
little
blueberry
coming
through
extremely
easy
drinking
for
a
cantillon
beer
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
again
im
scoring
batch
1
as
it
was
my
favorite
rather
than
averaging
all
of
them
together
dwhilst
it
is
very
dry
it
is
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
cantillon
beers
i
have
had
super
dry
and
crisp
with
just
enough
fruit
sourness
to
help
balance
things
out
an
utterly
delightful
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
and
savor
each
and
every
sip
smooth
body
with
great
carbonation
and
something
i
need
to
find
a
way
to
trade
for
thanks
again
brad
i
owe
you
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
pretty
high
the
sweet
tartness
will
limit
it
some
but
were
really
just
splitting
hairs
overall
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
and
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
night
big
thanks
to
dave
for
sharing
skal
as
far
as
it
goes
this
was
my
white
whale
this
beer
was
very
good
but
in
the
end
im
not
sure
it
lived
up
to
its
hype
or
my
expectations
the
cpj
drinkability
is
great
great
fruit
great
depth
restrained
sourness
pours
a
turbid
purplehued
burgundy
color
with
a
thin
lavender
head
that
hangs
around
the
collar
very
acetic
and
vinegary
on
the
nose
with
strong
tart
blueberry
and
cherry
notes
decent
amount
of
funk
leather
and
minerality
taste
is
also
quite
acetic
with
strong
tart
blueberry
and
cherry
flavors
along
with
lighter
earthy
funk
and
mineral
pours
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
have
more
blueberry
flavor
and
more
barnyard
funk
ample
carbonation
and
a
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
lightly
sweet
on
the
finish
relative
to
other
cantillon
lambics
pretty
drinkable
the
375
disappeared
way
too
fast
really
great
stuff
overall
overall
i
am
really
glad
that
i
got
to
taste
this
much
sought
after
whale
of
mine
i
would
love
to
get
more
this
is
one
of
a
kind
as
far
as
the
sours
that
i
have
had
i
would
love
to
open
a
new
batch
bottle
to
see
what
its
like
and
to
see
if
that
band
aid
smell
was
just
part
of
the
aging
on
the
one
i
had
the
drinkability
is
excellent
it
had
some
great
flavors
and
complexity
to
it
and
was
a
great
way
to
start
the
evening
it
paired
very
nicely
with
a
few
good
cheeses
we
had
as
well
excellent
beer
overall
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
fruit
based
sour
beers
ive
had
2009
bottle
pours
a
deep
opaque
blood
red
with
a
really
pretty
cotton
candy
rosy
head
that
settled
into
a
soapy
haze
so
pretty
tart
and
acidic
on
the
nose
has
a
soft
element
that
i
really
liken
to
3
fonteinen
hommage
at
about
1
year
soft
blueberries
and
raspberries
pretty
meaty
soft
and
quite
well
integrated
in
the
mouth
deep
blueberry
skins
and
stems
abound
a
little
foresty
pretty
wild
quite
rich
brett
isnt
huge
though
its
quite
sour
and
funky
oak
and
soft
acids
are
in
the
forefront
along
with
the
sour
wild
blueberries
really
enjoyable
d
overall
a
very
good
beer
with
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
not
one
that
i
feel
i
would
ever
need
to
seek
out
again
this
is
great
yes
but
there
are
plenty
of
easier
to
get
beers
that
are
just
as
good
dont
get
me
wrong
though
this
is
pretty
world
class
almost
didnt
enjoy
this
because
of
the
bandaid
off
flavor
but
then
it
went
away
after
taking
a
few
sips
thanks
to
the
acidity
leveling
my
tastebuds
flavor
was
shortlived
on
the
palate
very
enjoyable
but
i
liked
the
09
better
it
was
fruitier
which
is
something
i
was
hoping
for
in
a
fresh
batch
the
2009
cantillon
blåbær
was
the
weakest
link
of
the
evening
it
poured
a
cloudy
murky
mahogany
it
smelled
like
mulled
cider
mixed
with
berry
pie
it
tasted
a
little
apple
cidery
with
hint
of
cinnamon
sour
green
apple
and
cranberry
it
was
not
much
to
my
liking
but
it
actually
helped
when
it
was
paired
with
dessert
d
could
drink
it
all
the
time
ive
tried
so
hard
to
land
this
brew
and
now
that
ive
had
the
chance
to
try
it
i
can
die
a
happy
man
someday
i
dont
know
if
id
trade
half
my
cellar
for
a
bottle
but
worth
seeking
if
you
have
the
means
thanks
again
bill
for
the
chance
to
try
this
mfd
the
carbonation
and
tartness
pickles
the
tongue
but
is
certainly
something
i
will
attempt
to
try
again
i
wish
i
lived
in
belgium
i
am
eager
to
try
batch
2
of
this
beer
from
what
i
hear
that
is
a
real
treat
d
wow
what
an
amazing
beer
at
5
abv
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
and
still
want
more
im
not
just
marking
this
up
due
to
rarity
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
if
you
like
blueberries
as
i
do
youll
love
this
one
we
tried
various
sours
at
the
tasting
including
lebleu
and
crianza
helena
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
both
of
them
i
came
home
the
next
day
and
immediately
tried
to
trade
for
a
bottle
would
love
to
have
again
sometime
and
truely
worth
the
hype
i
could
drink
this
all
day
very
very
drinkable
i
would
love
to
pair
this
beer
with
a
nice
fruit
dessert
d
remarkable
this
is
truly
a
wow
beer
and
it
doesnt
get
much
better
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
will
always
remember
tasting
bottle
cork
says
bottled
in
2010
pours
a
really
nice
slightly
hazes
purple
color
with
a
pinkish
head
that
both
coasters
and
collars
around
the
glass
classic
cantillon
aroma
with
sourtart
notes
but
with
the
addition
of
subtle
blueberries
slight
barnyard
as
well
light
mouhfeel
with
good
carbonation
starts
sweet
upfront
with
subtle
blueberries
and
lemon
zest
not
mouth
puckering
but
for
sure
both
sour
and
tart
some
barn
type
flavors
as
well
no
real
alcohol
flavors
i
can
see
why
people
chase
this
beer
down
as
it
is
exceptionally
good
i
feel
bad
having
to
take
this
off
my
gots
as
this
is
my
only
one
i
almost
expected
a
letdown
on
this
brew
because
of
some
of
the
rarity
induced
hype
but
this
is
very
impressive
even
for
a
cantillon
and
among
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tried
hopefully
i
can
land
some
more
in
the
near
future
d
all
day
every
day
thats
the
only
real
way
to
describe
the
drinkability
on
this
one
ive
never
ever
had
a
beer
that
comes
close
to
as
good
as
this
one
perfection
in
almost
every
way
the
best
lambic
ive
had
to
date
by
a
mile
and
indeed
probably
the
best
beer
ive
come
across
to
this
point
bottle
poured
a
deep
murky
blueish
color
lambic
with
a
large
enough
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
funky
notes
with
well
balance
sourness
and
some
light
blueberry
notes
is
quiet
special
and
intriguing
taste
is
a
nice
enough
mix
between
some
light
sour
blueberries
with
some
well
balanced
barnyard
notes
with
good
sour
notes
all
elements
are
well
balanced
and
provided
great
enjoyment
body
was
quite
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
d
i
dont
think
it
could
get
any
better
simply
perfect

2010
375ml
bottle
on
9132010
in
a
snifter
opens
with
a
light
pop
same
resplendent
appearance
with
a
very
attractive
purple
pink
head
wet
leather
bursting
with
ripe
tart
and
slightly
sweet
blueberries
form
a
mental
picture
light
musty
quality
and
notes
of
damp
earth
and
barnyard
are
apparent
but
these
blueberries
are
what
set
blåbær
apart
from
other
lambics
holy
hell
the
flavor
is
amazing
tart
and
slightly
sweet
ripe
danish
blueberries
with
notes
of
oak
and
tannins
glorious
tannic
and
spritzy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
excellent
batch
after
batch
and
remains
my
favorite
lambic
more
phenols
in
the
taste
with
bandaids
galore
earthy
blueberry
rinds
and
vine
clippings
blåbær
slowly
numbs
the
tongue
as
if
it
were
a
lowdose
application
of
topical
anesthetic
slightly
distracting
but
the
underlying
sourness
and
tart
fruity
finish
is
where
it
should
be
carbonation
is
big
and
bubbly
rolling
around
the
tongue
with
a
delicate
effervescence
almost
too
much
for
me
although
this
lambic
does
calm
down
as
it
warms
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
but
blåbær
wasnt
quite
up
my
ally
thanks
again
michael
for
sharing
this
super
dry
and
tart
but
not
abrasive
this
is
uberdrinkable
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
overall
finally
got
taste
this
brew
and
was
not
disappointed
will
be
seeking
out
more
for
sure
overall
this
beer
is
all
that
its
hyped
to
be
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
would
work
with
any
fruit
but
the
choice
of
blueberries
puts
it
in
a
very
unique
subset
and
makes
it
well
worth
a
shot
d
insanely
good
this
beer
definitely
gets
a
1
on
the
how
easy
is
it
to
get
out
of
a
carpet
category
d
this
is
a
phenomenal
brew
its
very
complex
and
balanced
almost
perfectbut
not
quite
overall
a
great
sour
blueberry
lambic
and
a
brew
that
deserves
to
be
much
sought
after
dgreat
balance
fantastic
beer
excellent
fruit
appearance
with
perfect
acidity
and
tartness
light
barnyard
funk
adds
complexity
and
works
in
very
well
md
wonderful
the
balance
of
this
lambic
is
impressive
and
makes
for
a
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
could
drink
this
all
day
cheers
overall
its
not
worth
what
i
had
to
give
up
but
glad
i
tried
it
d
on
first
sip
i
was
a
little
bit
unimpressed
by
this
the
tart
and
sour
nature
were
overwhelming
and
masked
a
lot
of
the
subtleties
in
this
beer
as
it
warms
the
true
character
of
this
beer
really
stands
out
jammy
and
fresh
fruit
blueberry
character
becomes
very
prominent
in
a
very
good
way
would
love
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
again
but
i
wont
hold
my
breath
d
very
drinkable
fruit
lambic
really
enjoyed
the
blueberry
aroma
and
flavor
given
how
hard
this
is
to
get
and
the
cost
involved
i
would
probably
be
happy
with
multiple
bottles
of
supplication
or
temptation
the
blueberry
profile
makes
it
unique
i
am
just
not
sure
that
i
will
pony
up
to
purchase
this
one
again
given
the
cost
d
really
love
sours
and
this
beer
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
cantillion
for
sure
i
hope
i
get
a
chance
to
have
this
one
again
d
i
truly
wish
this
was
more
available
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
beer
is
thin
and
light
in
body
carbonation
in
the
mouth
props
the
body
up
a
bit
very
sour
and
tart
good
fruit
character
i
could
session
this
all
day
long
know
where
i
can
get
a
keg
of
this
stuff
if
i
had
to
criticize
it
i
would
say
it
finishes
too
quickly
due
to
the
low
body
i
know
lambics
are
suppose
to
attenuate
out
at
a
gravity
near
that
of
water
this
one
seemed
thinner
than
others
if
it
had
a
little
more
to
it
slightly
more
body
i
feel
the
fruit
would
have
popped
more
enough
complaining
though
this
was
the
best
lambic
ive
ever
had
and
would
drink
it
again
buy
it
again
trade
for
it
again
fly
to
europe
to
buy
a
bottle
d
exceptionally
drinkable
could
not
put
this
one
down
and
could
easily
drink
a
bottle
by
myself
d
sweet
and
unoffensive
so
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
a
session
beer
so
to
speak
but
an
easy
drinker
i
hate
to
give
a
beer
all
5s
but
this
is
easily
the
best
lambic
ive
ever
had
one
that
truely
lives
up
to
the
hype
consumed
512010
perfect
medium
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
all
mother
loving
day
this
beer
is
everything
i
was
led
to
believe
it
was
refreshing
gorgeous
mesmerizing
dare
i
say
its
a
gateway
sour
good
luck
finding
this
particular
gate
again
though
overall
one
of
the
better
fruited
lambics
by
cantillon
recommended
if
youre
a
fan
of
blueberries
mouthfeel
is
smooth
light
and
creamy
arid
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
as
the
acidity
is
not
as
overwhelming
as
most
cantillons
just
a
lovely
beer
and
worthy
of
the
high
praises
it
has
received
yum
not
worlds
apart
from
the
lou
pepe
series
but
the
danish
blueberries
are
what
im
partial
to
this
is
certainly
a
beautifull
beer
but
seems
to
be
on
its
way
down
the
cantillon
funk
is
slowly
starting
to
take
of
the
wonderfull
blueberry
flavors
like
any
fruit
lambic
this
is
most
likely
best
enjoyed
fresh
very
drinkable
i
kept
coming
back
for
another
sip
and
my
girlfriend
who
i
shared
this
with
had
to
get
me
to
slow
down
so
she
could
have
some
what
an
excellent
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
could
rank
it
over
some
of
the
lou
pepe
beers
with
age
on
them
but
then
again
this
beer
could
probably
be
pretty
damn
incredible
with
age
too
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
again
pours
solid
purple
with
beautiful
pink
bubbly
head
that
lingers
for
minutes
aroma
is
easily
dominated
by
blueberry
but
has
some
great
lemon
and
orange
along
with
earthy
funkhorse
blanket
taste
is
mild
honey
sweetness
then
great
tartness
a
little
vanilla
on
the
finish
but
then
a
lingering
blackberry
taste
on
the
tongue
great
tartness
well
balanced
and
good
carbonation
another
incredible
lambic
from
cantillon
d
great
i
could
drink
this
all
night
sourness
doesnt
slow
you
down
at
all
and
the
funk
is
heavy
and
nice
a
great
beer
wish
i
had
a
full
case
to
partake
during
summer
the
fruit
here
comes
the
way
i
like
it
as
a
contributing
flavor
as
opposed
to
a
dominating
one
obscuring
all
the
good
beer
notes
this
one
is
very
well
carbonated
for
the
style
not
too
much
or
too
little
but
just
right
the
beer
has
a
nice
dry
finish
and
the
flavors
are
really
great
making
this
one
highly
drinkable
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
have
had
that
exceeded
my
very
expectations
and
all
the
hype
d
very
very
nice
wish
this
had
been
a
750
as
opposed
to
a
375
exceptionally
thrilled
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
out
drinkability
im
probably
a
bigger
fan
of
blueberries
when
done
right
in
a
beer
than
most
so
take
my
words
with
a
grain
of
salt
incredible
drinkability
dark
purple
in
color
reminiscent
of
a
merlot
in
the
body
dense
head
is
pinkish
red
with
high
retention
despite
having
flecks
of
blueberry
in
it
delightful
in
appearance
aroma
of
finest
belgian
style
funk
cantillon
signature
with
added
presence
of
lilac
berries
and
cattiness
as
much
as
i
love
blueberries
they
are
not
the
most
aromatic
fruit
out
there
the
flavor
is
classically
funky
with
dark
fruits
cherry
currants
and
a
tart
berry
finish
medium
in
body
with
a
smooth
higher
level
of
carbonation
as
expected
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
indeed
though
i
still
prefer
fou
foune
or
lou
pepe
kriek
or
framboise
the
only
thing
truly
exceptional
about
this
beer
is
about
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
for
me
this
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
it
of
course
i
know
that
will
never
happen
given
the
scarcity
and
high
demand
for
these
bottles
edit
after
trying
a
fresh
2010
batch
shared
generously
by
kbutler1
i
have
come
to
realize
why
everyone
loves
this
beer
so
much
fresh
blueberries
dominate
the
nose
and
the
taste
on
this
batch
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
sour
and
funk
blend
it
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
drank
fresh
the
blueberries
show
much
more
and
makes
it
a
real
treat
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
fruit
forward
lambicswild
ales
ive
come
across
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
of
the
fruit
and
the
traditional
funk
and
sourness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
a
tiny
bit
of
carbonation
sting
and
a
very
dry
finish
this
beer
is
definitely
very
good
but
i
would
be
curious
to
see
how
other
batches
compare
this
one
was
tasty
but
not
a
standout
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
from
the
taste
im
guessing
its
batch
four
because
its
balanced
with
sweet
and
funk
a
lot
of
top
beers
dont
live
up
to
the
hype
but
this
one
certainly
does
this
farm
boy
is
practically
time
traveling
to
a
simpler
year
cliche
i
know
but
honestly
i
am
awash
with
feelings
and
memories
of
growing
up
on
the
farm
barefoot
through
the
grass
eating
handfuls
of
wild
fruits
running
with
the
horses
as
a
child
highly
recommended
to
any
country
folk
im
curious
if
this
brew
envokes
anything
similiar
for
the
city
dwellers
i
could
literally
smell
and
daydream
all
day
with
this
beer
in
hand

d
this
beer
is
immensely
drinkable
against
some
other
cantillon
varieties
that
are
intensely
acetic
or
dry
this
delivers
the
flavor
without
being
so
extreme
that
it
becomes
tough
to
finish
cleans
up
well
for
the
most
part
goes
down
too
easily
almost
slightly
tart
and
very
puckering
with
a
lot
of
musty
barnyard
funk
not
very
acidic
with
a
lot
of
earthy
oaky
tannis
lots
of
dark
fruit
notes
that
adds
to
the
sweet
vinous
vinegary
character
the
blueberries
really
come
through
as
well
as
some
grape
plum
and
fig
very
complex
and
well
balanced
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
how
complex
and
funky
it
is
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
again
highly
recommends
all
in
all
quite
a
satisfying
beer
and
a
real
treat
does
it
live
up
to
the
hype
welll
grain
of
salt
world
class
beer
just
not
sure
i
would
trade
my
little
sister
for
one
drinkability
so
this
beer
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
as
the
blueberries
are
fairly
light
and
the
beer
is
fairly
tame
i
know
itll
sour
up
more
as
time
goes
on
but
for
now
its
very
easy
drinking
too
bad
this
wasnt
such
a
bitch
to
get
or
id
grab
another
bottle
to
sit
on
for
a
year
or
so
thanks
much
randell
i
simply
cant
have
you
all
the
time
but
you
are
lovely
and
one
day
it
is
wonderful
it
truly
deserves
every
bit
of
its
reputation
and
i
am
the
luckiest
man
in
the
world
truly
amazing
beer
but
not
one
of
a
kind
i
could
and
probably
will
give
a
review
very
similar
to
this
one
to
vigneronne
classic
and
especially
st
lamvinous
its
not
miles
ahead
of
any
of
those
but
it
is
miles
ahead
of
the
competition
d
out
of
this
world
this
really
was
a
treat
to
cap
off
the
tasting
with
this
was
a
superb
decision
now
i
just
have
to
find
more
ammo
to
get
more
of
this
d
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
cantillon
beers
i
found
this
to
be
not
as
brash
as
some
of
the
others
ive
had
in
the
past
probably
due
to
the
addition
of
the
blueberries
while
this
was
still
quite
sour
it
also
had
a
slight
sweet
character
and
plenty
of
woody
notes
to
quell
the
intense
tartness
even
if
only
slightly
although
i
liked
the
beer
i
can
not
say
it
was
amazing
mostly
because
i
did
not
feel
those
blueberries
i
expected
neither
in
smell
neither
in
taste
if
they
were
there
it
was
certainly
too
subtle
lets
just
say
that
i
would
drink
copious
amounts
of
this
every
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
i
had
any
more
of
this
beer
man
oh
man
what
a
beer
the
body
and
drinkability
are
perfect
scores
as
well
im
just
gonna
go
ahead
and
give
all
5s
after
1140
or
so
reviews
its
becoming
rare
for
me
to
feel
a
beer
deserves
a
perfect
score
but
this
is
no
ordinary
beer
im
becoming
sad
but
sated
as
the
bottle
empties
like
a
glutton
i
drank
the
whole
thing
i
offered
some
to
my
wife
but
validating
that
the
sour
tartness
is
indeed
becoming
undetectable
to
me
in
these
beers

thanks
jeppe
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
deep
amber
almost
crimson
body
dense
vigorour
head
formed
vibrant
pint
color
that
receeded
quickly
and
left
a
full
ring
on
the
edge
the
nose
was
very
tart
earthy
and
a
bit
of
exotic
fruit
the
taste
tart
tart
tart
dont
get
me
wrong
the
taste
is
excellent
the
blueberry
notes
are
strong
fresh
and
wonderful
there
is
also
some
citrus
and
pepper
on
the
tongue
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
label
the
face
tells
you
the
story
of
this
beer
tart
yet
wonderful
well
worth
the
effort
to
get
it
perfect
mouthfeel
for
such
a
sour
beer
excellent
drinkability
sadly
though
it
is
over
all
too
soon
just
as
the
mountains
erode
into
pebbles
of
dirt
and
we
all
eventually
succumb
the
creeping
inevitability
of
death
so
too
did
i
guzzle
my
sole
bottle
of
blabaer
lambik
down
my
gullet
id
love
a
case
of
this
in
my
car
boot
nb
this
is
hands
down
the
best
lambic
i
have
ever
tasted
in
my
life
because
i
found
the
blueberries
to
be
a
bit
subdued
i
have
adjusted
the
smell
down
5
should
be
25
really
this
is
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
giving
all
fives
the
more
it
warms
the
more
i
cant
help
gulp
it
down
i
didnt
quite
like
it
when
i
first
poured
it
but
it
came
alive
after
about
10
minutes
great
stuff
d
so
easy
to
drink
i
already
want
another
all
to
myself
d
very
crushable
5
and
extremely
refreshing
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
theres
big
flavor
lots
of
sour
all
trailed
by
a
nice
berry
flavor
wow
batch
3
pours
hazy
ruby
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
looks
almost
pink
aroma
is
perfect
blueberry
some
funk
tart
acidic
character
and
a
touch
more
blueberry
i
could
just
smell
this
all
night
medium
light
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
flavor
had
blueberry
tart
acid
funk
and
had
a
nice
balance
between
the
fruit
and
the
funk
the
blueberry
flavor
was
a
little
subdued
on
the
taste
otherwise
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
thanks
brad
for
sharing
this
d
drinkability
is
terrific
i
wish
i
had
a
750ml
bottle
as
the
little
tasters
were
a
huge
tease
obviously
low
abv
and
lower
carbonation
and
amazing
taste
and
feel
conspire
for
an
amazingly
drinkable
brew
well
ive
certainly
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
it
didnt
disappoint
its
got
lots
of
funk
and
vinegar
but
its
much
more
balanced
for
me
than
some
of
the
other
cantillons
ive
had
wonderfully
balanced
and
deserving
of
the
praise
quite
a
pleasure
to
have
been
its
receptacle
p
hazy
red
pour
with
a
reddish
white
head
tart
blueberry
and
oak
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
very
similar
mildly
dusty
and
good
god
is
that
sour
very
tart
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
balances
it
out
this
was
batch
2
from
2007
d
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
simply
amazing
even
with
the
insane
rarity
this
is
still
a
5
d
i
hate
to
rate
hyped
beers
high
but
this
beer
demands
it
ive
never
been
disappointed
by
cantillon
but
this
exceeds
even
their
high
standards
truly
a
world
class
beer
if
ive
ever
tasted
one
d
very
good
for
the
style
i
usually
dont
find
cantillion
to
be
real
drinkable
this
one
is
a
very
slow
gusher
and
by
slow
i
mean
younger35
slow
pours
a
deep
purple
body
almost
black
with
a
quick
dark
pink
three
finger
head
that
falls
quickly
to
a
foamy
layer
of
goodness
which
lasts
throughout
minimal
lacing
but
still
a
beautiful
brew
with
amazing
colors
aroma
is
packed
with
dark
berries
blueberries
blackberries
and
some
red
grapes
as
well
underneath
the
berries
is
some
funky
hay
and
vinegar
but
not
overpowering
taste
starts
with
the
sweet
blueberries
again
but
is
quickly
followed
by
a
balancing
tartness
midway
the
horse
blanket
and
grassy
flavors
emerge
and
dry
up
the
mouth
aftertaste
consists
of
citrus
zest
elderberries
and
some
earthy
flavors
love
this
baby
has
a
lot
of
life
on
the
tongue
as
well
fluffy
bubbly
and
crisp
an
absolute
delight
too
easy
to
drink
total
beergasm
i
really
need
more
thanks
so
much
joey
a
stunner
in
cantillons
stable
of
world
class
beers
if
lambics
are
your
thing
then
you
must
try
to
search
this
one
out
the
best
fruit
lambic
i
have
tasted
750ml
bottle
shared
by
bobby91w
pours
a
murky
purple
with
a
nod
towards
red
the
nose
is
all
about
fresh
blueberries
the
flavor
is
they
typical
cantillon
lambic
character
turned
down
a
notch
or
two
oh
and
the
blueberries
are
rocking
there
too
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
thin
other
than
that
really
good
stuff
this
is
the
most
increadable
lambic
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
if
you
are
able
to
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
it
will
be
a
wonderful
experience
for
those
of
you
in
doubt
about
whether
this
is
worth
seeking
out
i
hope
i
can
be
of
some
assistance
you
have
to
you
owe
it
to
yourself
it
was
unlike
anything
else
i
have
ever
drank
this
being
the
3rd
or
4tth
batch
of
this
beer
from
what
i
have
heard
the
first
was
too
sweet
the
second
too
tart
i
think
the
problem
here
may
be
age
this
really
needs
to
be
consumed
fresh
the
flavor
is
soo
ripe
now
so
mind
blowing
perfect
it
is
hard
to
put
into
words
i
have
lost
myself
in
the
hobby
again
thanks
to
this
bottle
thank
you
cantillon
thank
you
one
of
the
best
sours
and
truly
one
of
the
great
cantillon
beers
out
there
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
several
bottles
75cl
37
5cl
of
this
fine
fruit
lambik
vintage
2007
batch
1
2
pours
a
light
to
medium
burgundy
with
slight
white
head
has
a
pleasant
tart
funky
barnyard
aroma
with
a
touch
of
blueberry
maybe
a
little
cranberry
in
the
background
gotta
love
this
soft
tart
blueberry
zest
just
enough
to
cause
the
lips
to
smack
with
delight
much
less
acidic
and
sour
than
some
other
cantillon
fruit
lambics
though
the
mouth
feel
was
pleasant
with
some
carbonation
along
with
a
perfect
balance
of
blueberry
tartnessacidity
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
fruit
lambics
on
the
market
today
thanks
jeppe
for
supplying
all
those
tasty
blueberries
to
create
such
a
great
brew
notes
i
had
a
chance
to
try
the
second
release
from
2007
75cl
bottles
gold
foil
and
that
batch
is
far
superior
the
funk
is
more
restrained
the
brightness
of
the
blueberries
is
incredible
and
the
palate
is
quite
to
die
for
id
give
that
version
scores
of
45555
but
since
i
got
only
2oz
of
that
thanks
carl
im
not
going
to
review
that
two
finger
head
on
top
of
a
purple
haze
colored
effervescent
body
hints
of
blueberry
and
a
silky
mouthfeel
perhaps
too
silky
for
the
style
little
to
no
hop
presence
typical
tartness
for
a
cantillon
and
a
blueberry
finish
make
a
wonderful
lambic
best
fruit
lambic
ive
had
to
date
enough
horseblanket
to
make
me
remember
it
ive
heard
the
2009
version
will
be
ready
shortly
buy
more
of
this
one
notes
from
and
tasted
on
10707
luscious
berry
flavor
a
very
savory
feel
with
a
moderate
level
of
sour
not
too
sharp
or
acidic
its
vinous
and
just
about
perfect
nice
level
of
carbonation
that
gives
it
lightness
without
any
distraction
just
a
fantastic
complex
lambic
that
really
showcases
the
blueberries
taste
mouthfeel
fruity
up
front
the
unmistakable
taste
of
blueberries
shining
through
above
even
the
puckering
sourness
theres
plenty
of
sourness
here
as
well
though
its
not
as
abrasive
as
some
cantillon
beers
theres
no
sweetness
no
malt
to
speak
of
its
tart
blueberries
from
start
to
finish
the
bugs
provide
lots
of
depth
to
the
flavor
but
theres
no
distinct
funkiness
as
the
fruit
really
does
overpower
almost
everything
else
the
finish
is
dry
but
not
overly
sour
or
acidic
making
this
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
lambics
ive
had
wow
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
less
tart
funky
of
the
two
vintages
i
cant
imagine
or
is
it
cant
wait
the
2005
vintage
i
have
waiting
for
me
being
more
sour
than
this
this
is
just
quite
funky
right
now
this
definitely
leans
towards
the
hard
side
i
wonder
how
much
of
this
has
developed
since
bottling
especially
since
i
see
this
as
being
less
tart
and
more
fruity
than
the
2005
this
is
fairly
fruity
but
certainly
not
in
a
dominant
fashion
even
by
authentic
lambic
standards
the
fruit
seems
to
more
contribute
to
the
tartness
and
tannic
qualities
of
this
beer
rather
than
the
ripe
berry
notes
one
might
expect
in
a
beer
described
as
fruity
after
having
said
all
that
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
as
someone
who
really
like
funky
sour
beers
and
my
fruit
to
be
a
supporting
player
well
this
just
hits
the
spot
quite
well
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
and
sour
a
well
made
beer
yummy
taste
carbonation
was
not
as
prickly
as
other
fruit
lambic
ive
tried
and
the
fruit
is
definately
in
the
forefront
here
and
its
all
blueberry
but
the
kind
that
just
a
bit
unripe
when
theyre
sort
of
greenish
blue
i
cant
tell
you
if
they
were
like
that
when
they
brewed
this
but
it
certainly
worked
out
extremely
well
the
acidity
seemed
somehow
separated
from
the
flavor
as
if
every
sip
came
with
two
acts
the
flavorful
rush
of
fruit
flavor
then
acidity
that
was
drying
and
refreshing
sounds
contradictory
but
it
isnt
but
was
at
a
very
sustained
level
not
as
massive
and
brutal
as
some
of
the
other
fruit
lambics
it
was
probably
one
of
the
most
balanced
lambics
ive
ever
sampled
lord
knows
people
have
tried
and
failed
to
make
good
blueberry
beers
but
this
style
seems
like
a
perfect
fit
it
went
down
insanely
well
and
was
an
absolute
orgasmic
match
with
trappistmade
chocolatedipped
blueberries
i
just
happened
to
have
its
the
season
here
in
quebec
this
one
is
a
masterpiece
the
flavor
is
absolutely
incredible
of
all
the
cantillon
beers
ive
tried
with
fruit
additions
cherries
raspberries
muscats
grapes
red
wine
grapes
apricots
cranberries
the
danish
blueberries
in
this
beer
is
absolutely
the
best
fruit
addition
after
the
midpalate
the
blueberries
become
dominant
the
fruit
tastes
lush
authentic
and
phenomenal
also
for
a
cantillon
its
not
intensely
sour
like
rose
de
gambrinus
or
fou
foune
but
instead
very
well
balanced
this
is
an
incredible
fruit
lambic
paid
100
to
consume
at
a
bar
my
first
cantillon
good
but
way
too
much
hype
built
into

i
cannot
make
any
construction
criticism
deep
red
in
color
bold
cherry
that
is
neither

this
is

the
best
lambics
there
is
so
good

i
think
the
brewers
at

wish
that
people
preferred
the
100
lambics
over
the
lou

versions
but
my
taste
buds
agree
with

aromas
tart
cherry
sour
raspberry
semiacidic
with
light
funk
and
oaky
notes
this
is
a
classic
lambic
kriek
it
pours
a
red
beer
smells
of
funky
yeasts
and
cherry
candy
taste
is
sour
yet
it
is
also
sweet
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
a
cherry
soda
since
this
beer
has
that
type
of
feel
not
much
foam
forms
at
the
head
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
i
wouldnt
say
you
can
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
at
least
half
easily
arguably
the
worst
if
thats
possible
of
the
three
lou
pepes
like
in
most
cases
with
cantillon
quite
amazing
ive
grown
a
soft
spot
for
krieks
over
the
years
and
this
proves
that
they
too
can
blow
me
away
i
am
usually
more
fond
of
framboise
so
now
is
the
time
to
crack
a
lpf
to
see
how
it
compares
to
this
kriek
if
you
have
any
2012

lou

kreik
its
drinking
amazing
right
now
unless
you
prefer
bracingly
sour
beer
it
probably
cant
get
better
than
this
at
this
point
or
who
knows
with
the
endless
possibilities
of
aged
cantillon
o
an
awesome
kriek
cantillon
always
owns
it
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
kriek
the
cherry
comes
through
so
nicely
and
is
just
the
right
amount
of
tart
this
combined
with
the
oakyness
and
funk
is
a
wonderful
combo
the
balance
is
great
and
this
is
an
easy
drinker
with
a
lot
of
flavor
this
is
absolutely
delicious
well
constructed
and
a
a
true
beauty
to
behold
2011
edition
thanks
to
drlovemd87
this
is
special
beer
and
while
not
as
tart
as
i
expected
it
to
be
at
this
age
it
has
a
lot
going
for
it
thats
for
sure
and
probably
worth
at
least
some
of
the
hype
it
gets
the
color
is
incredible
electric
dark
pink
hazy
with
an
oddly
white
head
for
how
tinted
the
brew
is
its
glowing
intimidating
exciting
and
about
as
colorful
a
beer
as
i
have
ever
seen
the
head
doesnt
go
anywhere
either
the
nose
on
this
is
wonderful
too
fruity
cherries
obviously
all
the
way
i
get
the
tart
pie
cherry
type
or
maybe
even
tarter
ground
cherry
but
its
certainly
not
the
tree
cherries
we
get
around
here
the
yeast
is
amazing
its
opened
right
up
here
super
summery
and
funky
as
they
get
timeless
in
some
way
not
dusty
but
rustic
and
classy
insofar
as
those
can
be
aromas
flavors
the
cherries
carry
through
the
whole
flavor
starting
just
a
little
sweet
but
finishing
with
a
nice
tartness
not
mouthwatering
or
particularly
sour
and
with
very
little
acidity
but
like
a
slightly
under
ripe
cherry
hard
and
yet
to
develop
its
sugars
completely
the
yeast
works
magically
with
this
cherry
complexion
floral
and
familiar
but
higher
end
than
anything
i
can
recall
the
beer
is
frustratingly
easy
drinking
given
that
these
are
so
rare
expensive
and
downright
special
but
this
is
in
many
ways
a
beer
for
massive
consumption
it
would
never
turn
the
stomach
its
not
that
sour
and
its
low
abv
keeps
it
easy
drinking
too
the
carbonation
is
splendid
all
kinds
of
fizz
to
this
but
never
abrasive
its
nowhere
near
as
sour
on
the
whole
as
anticipated
but
this
is
a
cream
of
the
crop
as
far
as
funky
beers
go
especially
fruited
ones
infinitely
superior
to
the
lou
pepe
gueuze
i
think
and
just
an
overall
sensational
and
memorable
beverage
a
touch
beer
to
dissect
really
because
the
unity
of
the
whole
thing
is
so
much
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
believe
they
call
that
synergy
and
this
beer
exemplifies
it
wow
bottle
from
tipples
awesome
score
here
and
had
to
leave
work
early
to
snag
it

dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
lots
of

tart
cherries
and
cherry
skins
flavor
is
sour
vinegar
up
front
and
then
lots
of
cherry
skins
and
tart
but
sweet
cherries
the
balance
here
is
outstanding
not
medicinal
at
all
cherry
is
highlighted
but
not
overpowering
like
the
new
glarus
cherry
brew
and
it
comes
together
beautifully
a
nice
vanilla
oak
in
the
backdrop
that
really
mellows
this
out
juicy
cherries
but
lightly
dry
finish
medium
light
mouthfeel
full
flavored
and
big
bubbly
carbonation
while
cherry
isnt
my
favorite
in
beer
this
balances
it
as
perfectly
as
possible
very
nice
o
very
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
o
this
is
a
beautiful
kriek
wonderful
smell
and
taste
this
maybe
my
favorite
cantillon
so
far
i
would
certainly
purchase
this
ale
again
certainly
recommended
this
beer
was
simply
fabulous
it
was
totally
worth
the
9
per
8oz
pour
simply
delightful
overall
after
finally
having
all
three
of
the
lp
series
cantillions
its
close
to
a
toss
up
which
of
the
lou
pepe
series
beer
that
i
like
better
i
think
the
gueuze
wins
by
a
small
margin
o
just
wonderful
at
this
young
age
it
is
nicely
acidic
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
and
still
highly
drinkable
overall
50
more
fruit
and
100
more
balance
and
flavour
i
really
loved
this
beer
the
cherries
really
bring
a
nice
complexity
to
this
compared
to
the
framboise
versions
that
are
made
here
o
tasty
and
it
seems
like
its
balanced
out
the
fruit
and
the
funk
at
this
point
delicious
need
more
o
very
tasty
overall
fantastic
cherry

best

this

reference
with

without
shondells
with
a
hint
of
light
apple
cider
in
the
back
for
good
measure
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
the
cherries
come
through
with
a
bit
of
tartness
though
with
a
clear
restraint
that
keeps
things
from
peeling
the
enamel
from
my
teeth
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
cherry
lambic
one
that
more
than
deserves
the
praise
it
receives
appearance
is
a
clear
magenta
with
a
short
pink
head
nose
is
full
of
tart
cherries
i
get
some
jammy
qualities
and
almost
a
bit
of
rhubarb
notes
vinegar
on
the
nose
with
slight
hints
of
oak
the
taste
is
delicious
plenty
of
puckering
tartness
up

with
delicious
cherry
forward
profile
not
a
whole
lot
of
other
adjectives
i
can
use
than
cherry
but
that
is
okay
because
this
is
delicious
mouthfeel
is
heavily
carbonated
and
tasty
overall
delicious
o
this
is
a
very
very
nice
beer
i
can
really
appreciate
the
restraint
shown
on
this
one
as
this
beers
balance
makes
it
quite
enjoyable
pretty
much
a
rick
rossbawse
kriek
the
beer
pours
a
relatively
clear
light
colored
reddishrusty
brown
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
tart
with
a
lot
of
funk
but
no
distinct
cherry
the
taste
is
definitely
pungent
with
a
whopping
fruity
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
acidic
and
dry
with
very
little
remaining
cherry
sweetness
this
beer
drinks
like
only
a
cantillon
would
after
10
years
a
serious
champ
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
worth
the
money
on
overall
a
really
fantastic
kriek
i
think
i
enjoy
this
more
than
3f
schaerbeekse
kriek
overall
on
of
my
all
time
favs
this
beer
was
great
i
really
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
another
on
and
let
it
sit
in
the
celler
for
a
few
year
to
see
how
it
changes
overall
this
is
a
delicious
kriek
very
tart
with
great
cherry
notes
and
some
good
chalky
yeast
notes
as
well
the
oak
also
adds
a
nice
earthy
dimension
very
nice
4

o
the
cherry
complements
the
beer
perfectly
tastes
real
and
in
good
balance
with
the
base
overall
just
really
nice
and
highly
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
t
huge
wave
of
unripe
cherry
right
off
the
bat
with
a
big
lactic
twang
some
oak
raspberry
and
lemon
peel
a
champagnelike
effervescent
mouthfeel
really
fantastic
stuff
o
fantastic
beer
so
glad
someone
shared
this
at
a
recent
tasting
if
i
find
myself
with
the
opportunity
to
buy
or
trade
for
another
i
certainly
will
medium
to
slightly
light
in
body
crisp
and
lively
carbonation
supremely
drinkable
full
of
subtleties
and
interesting
nuances
a
bottle
id
buy
again
in
a
heartbeat
even
at
thirty
bucks
a
pop
omy
third
favorite
of
the
regular
cantillons

lambics
behind
fou

lamnivus
great
color
nose
and

i
could
drink
this
by
the
gallon
and
subsequently
did
when
it
was
on
tap
at

day

o
another
amazing

is
just
so
awesome
soft

is
similar
a
play
off
raspberries
and
sour
cherries
with
such
a
soft

body
it
really
is
not
even
fair
this
is
definitely
the

o
great
kriek
im
pretty
new
to
the
lambic
style
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
ive
had
well
balanced
krieks
are
near
the
top
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
while
ive
been
lucky
to
enjoy
many
stellar
offerings
cantillons
lou
pepe
has
surpassed
them
all
world
class
this
poured
out
looking
like
a
carbonated
fruit
punch
the
color
was
very
bright
red
it
looks
beautiful
the
head
is
a
bit
on
the
fizzy
side
and
has
a
very
nice
looking
pink
color
there
isnt
any
retention
or
lacing
on
this
beer
the
smell
is
of
tart
cherries
and
some
minor
sweet
malts
in
there
too
the
taste
is
actually
a
lot
more
subtle
than
i
expected
it
is
definitely
tart
but
it
seems
to
be
nicely
balanced
as
well
between
the
tart
vs
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
crisp
it
feels
clean
and
doesnt
coat
your
mouth
with
any
syrupy
cherry
flavors
overall
i
enjoyed
this
actually
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
these
kind
of
beers
but
i
did
appreciate
having
this
one
a
dark
red
color
with
a
creamy
pink
head
that
rose
and
fell
quickly
some
stray
pink
bubbles
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
large
amounts
of
tartsour
cherries
greet
you
as
you
lean
in
for
a
whiff
some
clean
hay
and
acidic
notes
along
with
an
underlying
aroma
of
oak
on
the
palate
loads
of
fruit
cherries
and
raspberries
lead
the
charge
onto
the
palate
with
some
acidic
notes
quickly
in
tow
a
sugary
sweetness
lingers
with
a
moderate
acidic
tartness
the
finish
is
primarily
sour
with
a
touch
of
hay
funk
a
smooth
even
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
really
on
point
here
just
lush
and
smooth
as
it
rolls
around
in
the
mouth
this
is
an
excellent
kriek
great
fruit
flavor
with
a
solid
punch
of
sour
delicious
o
a
great
well
balanced
lambic
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
all
day
makes
me
sad
that
cantillon
is
so
hard
to
get
o
a
o
overall
this
beer
is
just
as
good
as
everyone
says
love
having
it
on
draft
works
wonderfully
with
the
raspberry
and
espresso
tarimisu
o
overall
rather
nice
sour
but
be
prepared
for
this
one
is
rather
sour
the
fruitiness
is
a
nice
touch
overall
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
really
good
kriek
cantillon
is
always
very
good

light
pink

that
disappeared
quickly
scent
was
quite
acidic
at
first
with
sour
cherries
and
other
red
berries
tons
of
oak
aromas
with
a
subdued
funky
aroma
not
one
of
the
funkiest
cantillons
ive
had
some
spiciness
with
barnyard
hay
and
some
more
berry
raspberry
taste
is
very
tart
cherry
at
first
but
casually
transform
to
sweet
and
juicy
slightly
acidic
with
some
lovely
oak
barrel
flavors
not
the
most
sour
cantillon
ive
had
but
very
complex
makes
me
wonder
what
this
tasted
like
fresh
probably
like
cantillon
kriek
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
beer
was
fantastic
not
the
best
cantillon
ive
had
but
theyre
all
so
good
and
all
so
different
even
when
its
the
same
beer
just
a
different
batch
this
one
was
great
though
o
i
remember
having
my
first
cantillon
kriek
last
year
and
wondering
if
lambics
just
werent
for
me
having
developed
my
palate
since
then
im
sure
i
would
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
next
time
stepping
up
and
over
to
the
lou
pepe
though
was
not
regretted
o
i
dont
drink
sours
too
often
ive
always
been
more
of
a
stout
and
dipa
person
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
i
started
off
the
night
with
this
beer
and
craved
the
taste
of
it
so
much
that
i
had
to
order
it
again
before
i
left
also
considering
i
knew
this
beer
is
fairly
rare
at
1310oz
serving
this
is
saying
something
i
very
rarely
order
13
drinks
never
mind
twice
in
a
night
i
thought
the
beer
was
great
in
almost
every
way
and
i
wish
i
could
order
it
more
often
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
is
considered
one
of
the
best
kriekssours
in
the
world
this
being
fairly
fresh
the
acidic
bite
i
got
from
a
recent
2004
vintage
is
absent
this
focuses
more
on
the
bright
red
cherry
and
fruits
along
with
the
funk
torn
between
which
i
like
more
though
i
can
safely
say
this
ages
extremely
well
a
very
awesome
brew
that
we
were
very
lucky
to
find
the
bottle
didnt
last
for
too
long
but
ill
be
thinking
about
this
one
for
a
while
a
real
treat
sharing
a
bottle
of
lou
pepe
kriek
with
friends
on
a
tuesday
afternoon

o
wow
this
is
fantastic
stuff
id
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
if
i
could
find
it
on
a
regular
basis
definitely
a
whale
worthy
of
its
fame
definitely
my
favorite
sour
yet

o
this
one
is
amazing
maybe
i
need
to
venture
out
and
try
more
lambics
i
havent
tried
too
many
varieties
but
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
out
of
the
ones
i
have
tried
perfect
on
a
sunny
day
like
today
cantillon
lou
pepe
kriek
pours
an
almost
intimidatingly
vibrant
ruby
red
the
two
fingers
of
dark
pink
foam
that
crown
the
beer
briefly
before
disappearing
without
a
trace
is
similarly
impressive
in
terms
of
vibrancy
the
nose
has
a
solid
ripe
cherry
presence
before
fading
into
aromas
familiar
to
anyone
whos
had
a
great
lambic
theres
a
little
bit
of
wood
barrels
cherry
pit
both
that
plays
well
with
some
of
the
more
earthy
brett
aromatics
meanwhile
theres
also
some
wet
hay
the
cherry
aspect
of
the
flavor
profile
has
just
a
hint
of
sourtartness
to
it
but
otherwise
it
forms
a
nice
opening
before
letting
all
those
woody
earthy
and
barnyard
notes
to
fill
out
the
beer
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
positively
champagnelike
carbonation
superb
mouthfeel
this
is
my
first
time
drinking
one
of
cantillons
lou
pepe
beers
and
im
not
sure
how
much
better
this
is
than
their
regular
kriek
but
its
definitely
a
fantastic
beer
overall
excellent
a
really
well
crafted
lambic
overall
im
really
enjoying
this
one
fantastic
tasting
cherries
and
just
enough
of
the
classic
lambic
characteristics
like
the
lp
framboise
id
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
find
it
and
afford
it
this
beer
is
an
ode
to
sour
cherries
puckering
and
sour
upfront
slightly
sweet
lingering
cherry
flavors
at
the
finish
not
as
dry
as
most
cantillons
intense
tartness
intense
cherry
flavors
but
somehow
incredible
drinkable
not
the
most
complex
fruit
lambic
on
the
planet
but
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
good
i
found
the
level
of
carbonation
to
be
very
good
overall
this
is
an
excellent
fruit
lambic
and
another
cantillon
home
run
this
was
served
with
a
melt
in
your
mouth
lamb
lollipop
thankfully
without
nuts
thanks
monks
the
cherry
gastrique
was
simply
perfect
to
pair
with
such
a
sweet
kriek
and
the
lamb
was
delicious
5
solid
tart
cherry
flavor
but
i
have
to
admit
i
am
a
tad
underwhelmed
with
this
i
was
expecting
loads
of
fruit
but
was
left
wanting
more
still
a
solid
beer
just
a
little
hyped
o
a
truly
fantastic
kriek
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
watery
due
to
the
acidity
that
forms
this
beers
backbone
and
the
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
kreik
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
not
medicinal
like
some
can
be
i
dig
this
one
poured
bright
red
a
little
cloudy
with
some
pinkwhite
bubbles
on
top
its
a
kriek
so
aroma
of
cherries
as
would
be
imagined
hints
of
acid
nice
tart
cherry
taste
balanced
with
maraschino
sweetness
mild
acidity
but
not
at
all
acetic
so
the
fruit
is
dominant
on
the
palate
medium
body
tingly
carbonation
no
alcohol
detected
at
all
very
nice
drinker
overall
but
nothing
to
go
ape
over
4
0
d
what
a
completely
different
experience
than
what
i
had
with
the
regular
kriek
this
one
is
not
only
palatable
but
also
mighty
tasty
im
not
too
crazy
about
the
price
of
this
though
regardless
i
really
love
cantillon
bring
me
more
overall
damn
fine
beer
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
overall
i
have
heard
this
beer
described
as
one
of
the
most
intense
fruit
beers
on
earth
and
i
wholeheartedly
agree
stunning
mixture
of
sweettart
cherries
and
funk
i
will
certainly
be
having
this
again
in
the
future
drink
chris
brought
his
a
game
on
saturday
and
i
cant
thank
him
enough
for
this
treat
it
was
very
well
balanced
fruity
and
tasted
great
i
am
very
glad
i
have
a
bottle
at
home
to
now
sit
on
and
savor
for
a
bit
pours
a
murky
cranberry
red
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
lots
of
sour
and
funky
cherry
aromas
along
with
some
woody
aromas
taste
is
the
same
and
has
a
great
but
very
sour
flavor
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
lambic
with
fantastic
aromas
and
flavors
i
am
very
happy
i
was
finally
able
to
try
this
one
o
high
drinkability
beautiful
beer
the
best
cantillon
ive
ever
had
o
lp
kriek
lives
up
to
the
pedestal
i
put
it
on
this
beer
tastes
very
mature
the
brewer
let
the
beer
come
into
its
own
without
trying
too
hard
simple
and
complex
at
the
same
time
sour
enough
to
appease
sour
fans
yet
down
to
earth
enough
for
most
newcomers
o
the
viscosity
was
much
thinner
than
i
had
expected
and
this
has
more
vinegar
and
funk
than
fruit
taste
as
compared
to
some
of
the
nonaged
cantillon
lambics
i
found
this
to
be
extremely
drinkable
once
my
palate
settled
down
o
another
great
beer
from
cantillon
really
wish
there
beers
were
easier
to
get
lou
pepe
kriek
is
a
damn
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
exhibiting
a
masterful
balance
and
blend
of
tart
sweet
flavors
hard
to
review
this
one
as
i
really
found
no
flaw
with
it
in
my
eyes
the
perfect
kriek
pours
a
hazy
grapefruit
pink
body
with
an
inch
of
pink
coral
head
smell
is
brilliant
fresh
tart
cherries
oak
slight
tannic
dryness
a
touch
of
musty
funk
tastes
flawless
too
starts
off
with
a
kick
of
fresh
cherries
very
tart
but
balanced
acidity
lots
of
oak
notes
and
a
little
barnyard
wildness
on
the
finish
also
picked
up
some
floral
almost
perfumelike
notes
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
less
thin
than
the
standard
kriek
and
perfectly
carbonated
even
with
the
age
overall
i
cant
see
a
kriek
exceeding
this
one
not
sure
if
the
age
made
the
difference
here
but
it
sure
didnt
hurt
seek
this
one
out
and
buy
it
if
a
recent
vintage
is
on
the
shelf
this
is
a
great
kriek
with
a
lot
of
depth
i
split
this
bottle
with
goblinmunkey7
at
the
ale
house
in
amesbury
ma
we
paid
30
was
the
bottle
worth
30
no
but
close
considering
the
bar
markup
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
if
cantillon
werent
so
expensive
and
impossible
to
find
2008
vintage
served
in
a
traditionallike
belgian
tumbler
deep
red
nearing
a
purple
shade
a
tight
dense
head
of
light
lavenderesque
pink
appears
and
disappears
just
as
fast
a
juicy
nose
filled
with
tart
cherry
wild
funk
damp
basement
faint
graham
cracker
crust
this
beer
opens
with
a
lactic
tart
cherry
hit
lots
and
lots
of
cherryberry
flavors
some
pie
crust
in
the
taste
and
brett
charecter
and
oak
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
like
a
perfect
sour
cherry
not
thin
clean
crisp
dry
this
is
one
of
my
top
cantillons
to
date
tons
of
flavor
well
crafted
balance
but
could
have
had
a
bit
more
sour
2009
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
bright
red
with
a
nice
red
tinted
head
that
was
big
and
frothy
but
left
the
scene
quickly
smelled
like
cherry
candy
wiht
some
sour
adn
slight
wood
tastes
quite
similar
with
a
boom
of
sour
to
begin
with
a
great
balance
of
cherry
candy
sweetness
a
tiny
bit
of
woody
dryness
at
the
end
overall
a
beautiful
beer
that
i
absolutely
loved
o
another
slam
dunk
from
cantillon
the
fruit
and
oak
is
more
pronounced
on
the
lou
pepe
than
on
the
normal
kriek
although
both
are
absolutely
delightful
beers
i
look
forward
to
finding
another
bottle
pours
a
nice
cherrydark
grape
hue
which
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
no
lacingthe
smell
is
sweet
cherriesa
touch
of
funk
and
the
mustiness
of
an
old
house
not
lived
in
for
a
whilethe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
bone
dry
and
has
tastes
of
cherries
and
lots
of
them
mixed
with
cranberry
juicea
touch
of
bitter
lemon
and
finished
with
a
funky
sour
dryness
and
overall
very
nice
and
not
many
can
top
cantillion
at
what
they
do
but
not
one
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
cherries
or
sour
lambics
but
me
id
drink
again
cheers
o
maybe
a
bit
of
a
let
down
just
due
to
my
own
hype
overall
very
nice
overall
not
a
weakness
in
the
cantillon
arsenal
o
a
great
lambic
very
glad
to
get
to
try
another
great
cantillon
i
wish
their
beer
was
still
distributed
to
mi
i
grabbed
another
pair
of
these
for
long
term
aging
and
im
curious
to
what
will
happen
pretty
easy
too
break
the
bank
on
this
stuff
but
i
just
had
too
try
it
o
a
delicious
beer
that
could
be
paired
with
many
light
and
fruity
dishes
update
i
had
a
couple
pours
of
an
06
lpk
in
summer
2013
so
7
years
later
the
beers
was
amazing
the
fruit
was
still
exploding
the
lambic
more
funky
and
acidic
than
fresh
age
this
one
d
cant
wait
to
see
what
age
does
to
this
one
im
feeling
blessed
to
have
sampled
this
one
with
an
identical
vintage
sitting
in
the
reserves
o
another
classic
delicious
beer
from
cantillon
not
as
good
for
my
palate
as
compared
to
the
regular
cantillon
kriek
much
more
acid
good
interplay
of
flavours
acid
and
fruit
this
is
wonderful
as
well
fans
of
the
fruit
will
adore
this
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
ah
this
is
the
way
fruit
beers
should
be
the
cherries
complement
the
base
beer
without
overpowering
or
oversweetening
theres
still
that
biting
citric
sour
character
but
with
a
gentle
layer
of
the
fruit
blending
in
with
the
funk
that
said
this
wasnt
a
lifechanging
lambic
worth
the
extra
cost
of
a
lou
pepe
but
a
fine
example
of
the
kriek
style
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
sharp
and
sour
with
a
very
enjoyable
earthy
cherry
flavor
that
doesnt
retain
any
residual
sweetness
there
is
seemingly
no
alcohol
impact
on
this
brew
it
carries
with
it
a
pretty
big
salivation
factor
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
surprisingly
for
being
the
same
vintage
as
what
i
had
on
tap
recently
the
experience
from
on
tap
verse
the
bottle
is
drastically
different
this
bottle
was
more
sour
like
the
normal
cantillon
offering
while
on
tap
it
was
much
more
fruited
and
sweet
tasting
certainly
worth
a
try
by
either
means
o
the
best
kriek
that
i
have
ever
tried
and
im
still
to
have
an
average
beer
from
cantillon
pours
a
bright
deep
red
with
a
light
pink
head
looks
like
a
raspberry
soda
if
there
were
such
a
thing
the
nose
is
lightly
vinegar
with
big
cherries
and
a
touch
of
funk
the
taste
is
big
cherry
and
a
mild
amount
of
sourness
or
funk
not
particularly
sweet
which
is
nice
it
actually
drinks
quite
easily
and
is
almost
surprisingly
quaffable
good
carbonation
not
too
excessive
like
some
sours
seem
to
get
overall
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
but
quite
enjoyed
what
was
delivered
overall
this
is
a
good
lambic
but
it
didnt
wow
me
like
i
expected
it
to
that
being
said
im
sure
ill
have
it
again
if
i
get
the
chance
2007
vintage
bottle
thanks
to
ksurkin
for
the
sample
pours
a
deep
red
body
with
a
light
red
on
the
outside
of
the
glass
it
smells
like
sour
cherries
all
the
way
you
can
tell
it
is
going
to
be
a
puckering
beer
as
soon
as
you
smell
it
the
taste
follows
the
nose
as
expected
and
is
balanced
by
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
keep
this
from
being
an
all
out
assault
on
your
palate
i
wish
i
could
have
this
beer
everyday
whenever
i
wanted
my
oh
my
what
a
wonderful
beer
o
i
would
drink
this
again
o
most
complex
and
best
kriek
ive
had
great
cinnamon
spice
and
almond
i
still
prefer
nonfruit
wilds
but
this
is
good
o
tasted
quite
fresh
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
going
forward
blissfully
good
beer
overall
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
vintage
and
although
i
really
appreciate
the
quality
of
the
beer
the
lack
of
intense
funkiness
or
puckering
sour
keeps
me
from
loving
it
i
was
definitely
in
the
minority
of
people
who
did
not
enjoy
this
as
the
favorite
of
the
day
overall
what
can
i
say
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
was
able
to
purchase
one
too
i
will
probably
never
consume
as
much
of
this
ever
again
as
i
did
yesterday
delicious
having
2008
both
draft
and
bottle
i
prefer
the
bottle
bottle
had
less
oak
and
more
cherry
cheers
overall
a
great
beer
especially
for
the
harmonious
and
balanced
taste
and
mouthfeel
would
have
a
slight
preference
for
the
framboise
over
this
but
its
always
a
delight
to
sip
and
contemplate
a
cantillon
overall
an
amazing
cantillon
as
usual
the
nose
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
amazing
great
stuff
from
cantillon
as
usual
overall
a
really
nice
and
complex
kriek
the
cherries
balance
the
line
between
sweet
and
sour
really
well
this
really
is
completely
different
from
the
regular
kriek
but
is
also
amazing
definitely
something
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
again
and
somethnig
i
would
love
to
try
with
more
age
on
it
d
the
tartness
could
wear
you
out
but
a
very
nice
beer
at
a
low
abv
got
this
beer
on
thursday
at
monks
after
the
outstanding
monday
event
they
held
poured
a
beautiful
red
hue
with
a
minimal
amount
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
nice
little
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
huge
tart
dark
dried
cherry
there
is
a
mild
funk
but
i
didnt
detect
it
here
nearly
as
much
as
some
of
the
other
cantillon
they
had
there
the
flavor
is
eerily
like
cherry
pie
cooked
cherries
with
a
tartness
and
a
little
too
much
sweetness
but
only
a
little
bit
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
with
lively
carbonation
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
outstanding
beer
by
cantillon
another
amazing
beer
by
cantillon
not
the
best
kriek
ive
had
but
really
delicious
interested
in
seeing
how
my
07
bottle
compares
when
i
open
it
in
a
few
weeks
poured
into
a
de
koninck
glass
the
definite
smell
of
cherries
after
taking
off
the
cork
the
appearance
is
a
light
ruby
red
with
little
head
and
bubbles
the
smell
of
cherries
and
oak
is
present
in
the
glass
the
taste
of
cherries
with
a
little
sour
backend
good
mouthfeel
not
overwhelming
overall
a
good
lambic
thats
not
strong
but
very
drinkable
i
find
lambics
to
be
very
different
from
what
i
drink
on
a
daily
basis
this
was
really
good
none
of
the
flavours
are
wrong
or
over
the
top
time
has
treated
this
beer
exceptionally
well
i
would
love
to
try
an
older
bottle
a
phenomenal
beer
worldclass
overall
i
struggle
to
think
of
a
kriek
that
stands
up
to
this
one
even
amongst
the
scharbeekse
cherry
krieks
great
depth
of
flavor
and
nicely
tuned
sourness
worldclass
for
certain
o
awesome
awesome
beer
this
is
why
cantillon
is
the
best
at
what
they
do
exceptionally
balanced
beer
and
one
that
i
am
going
to
seek
out
every
chance
i
get
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
and
one
that
id
like
to
have
regular
access
to
well
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
finishes
so
very

you

sour
christmas
in

pours
a
dull
deep
cloudy
as
hell
red
with
tones
of
deep
brown
too
compared
during
tasting
to
a
bottle
of
heinz
ketchup
that
was
sitting
on
our
table
smells
of
sour
cherry
tartness
with
notes
of
sweetness
peaking
through
first
sip
is
mouthwater
puckering
that
hits
both
the
front
and
back
of
the
mouth
cherries
and
wood
dominate
lightly
bodied
its
an
opaque
ruby
red
with
a
shocking
amount
of
carbonation
considering
the
complete
lack
of
head
cherry
funk
barnhouse
flowers
and
a
raw
boozy
citrus
that
seems
to
magically
dissipate
the
longer
it
stays
in
your
mouth
theres
no
really
great
way
to
describe
this
beer
its
pretty
much
sublime
so
go
out
and
grab
one
when
you
can
drie
fonteinens
schaerbeekse
kriek
is
still
fresh
in

mind
i
actually
wish
i
had
held
on
to
it
so
we
could
do
a
little
schaerbeek
lambic
tasting
but
to
compare
out
of
memory
ill
always
favor
3fs
crazy
funky
aromas
but
i
think
the
cantillon
tastes
better
this
really
is
one
of
the
better
krieks
out
there
but
im
not
certain
that
it
lives
up
to
the
hype

if
it
wasnt
for
this
tight
carbonation
i
probably
would
have
rated
this
much
higher
and
may
very
well
have
been
the
best
lambic
i
ever
had
this
an
exceptional
fruit
lambic
period
just
fantastic
the
palate
opens
with
a
brilliant
blend
of
bright
cherries
a
little
leather
and
a
dense
complex
parquet
of
cherries
and
lambic
i
cant
really
describe
it
better
than
saying
that
thats
what
i
want
a
kriek
to
taste
like
intensely
sour
but
never
wearing
on
the
palate
incredibly
fruity
but
never
girly
this
is
a
beer
for
sour
lovers

i
find
it
very
redundant
to
describe
the
flavors
of
almost
every
lambic
this
particular
one
had
a
much
more
pronounced
fruit
profile
than
the
standard
cantillon
kriek
but
it
lacked
assertion
but
this
beer
is
more
about
the
funk
and
tart
than
it
is
the
sweet
cherry
tones
are
juicy
enjoyed
with
oakes
tiggmtl
kimchee
and
martint
thanks
to
nexxus
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
bloody
red
with
a
shortlasting
pinkish
head
aroma
is
not
too
intense
for
a
lambic
although
some
of
the
characteristics
i
look
for
are
in
there
blood
orange
meets
cherries
strwaberries
blood
leaves
cinnamon
as
it
warms
up
theres
a
solvent
or
toothpaste
quality
emerging
and
it
seems
far
less
complex
like
a
minty
cranberry
juice
in
mouth
though
the
cherry
flavors
is
good
and
clean
its
quite
sour
cherry
flavored
lemon
juice
alike
but
the
acidity
is
clearly
mostly
lactic
orange
fruity
flavors
dry
finish
which
is
surprisingly
not
too
astringent
mediumfull
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
im
impressed
at
how
this
is
still
somehow
well
balanced
and
rather
thick
accessible
cantillon
but
the
best
i
think
not
got
this
at
monks
back
bar
it
poured
a
hazy
crimson
and
had
no
head
there
is
some
barnyard
and
cherrty
in
the
aroma
there
is
little
carbonation
in
the
beer
but
it
doent
really
detract
from
from
this
fine
beer
the
sour
cherry
is
up
front
and
then
the
funkiness
hits
it
finishes
with
some
vanilla
and
a
slight
woodiness
it
is
not
as
complex
as
the
botled
version
but
more
mellow
still
it
is
excellent
i
shared
a
bottle
of
this
which
was
bought
at
cantillon
after
we
toured
the
place
seeing
it
in
person
made
me
appreciate
cantillon
beers
so
much
more
anyway
this
lou
pepe
kriek
was
pretty
damn
good
im
pretty
sure
it
made
me
smile
it
poured
a
deep
but
not
dark
red
colour
with
a
light
pink
head
very
nice
to
look
at
it
had
that
funky
lambic
smell
to
it
in
the
background
along
with
cherries
and
spices
reminded
me
a
bit
of
quelque
chose
but
not
as
sweet
taste
was
again
full
of
cherries
and
spice
like
cherry
pie
kind
of
very
mellow
compared
to
other
cantillons
id
sampled
i
wonder
if
its
because
its
straight
from
the
brewery
so
its
so
fresh
dont
know
but
its
good
it
was
soft
in
my
mouth
not
syrupy
at
all
for
how
fruity
it
is
and
yeah
i
could
drink
lots
more
of
it
if
it
were
around
definitely
worth
trying
especially
if
you
can
get
it
from
mr
van
roy
himself
the
tasted
is
softly
acidic
for
a
lambic
and
it
is
accompanied
by
a
rich
body
there
is
a
definite
dry
tart
tannic
cherry
note
here
the
time
spent
on
the
cherries
seems
to
have
increased
the
body
quite
substantially
this
is
quite
good
and
quite
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
it
is
a
bit
softer
and
a
bit
better
integrated
than
the
standard
cantillon
beers
it
is
nicely
sour
with
notes
of
citrus
vinegar
the
finish
is
woody
and
reminds
me
of
cherry
skins
this
is
certainly
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
the
cherry
flavor
is
quite
good
in
this
beer
there
is
no
sticky
sweetness
like
that
found
in
the
more
commercial
versions
instead
there
are
these
intense
chewy
mouth
filling
cherry
skin
dry
tart
flavors
that
just
proclaims
that
there
are
cherries
in
this
lambic
i
really
like
this
and
it
certainly
has
grown
on
me
as
i
finish
the
bottle
in
the
end
highly
recommended
by
me
and
absolutely
amazing
fresh
it
may
be
30
here
in
the
states
but
it
is
still
worth
every
penny

refreshes
i
liked
it
but
this
is
sure
not
for
everyone
due
to
its
intensity
viscous
mouth
with
a
dry
tart
cherry
finish
crafted
and
blended
by
an
artist
an
experience
not
just
a
beer
and
not
one
you
could

with
a

smell
is

open

the

with

while
the
finish
is
dominated
by
cherries
and
an
acetonelike
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
compared
to
the
other
cantillons
ive
had
no
harsh
drying
astringency
in
the

just
a

road
to
the
next
sip

with

some

kriek
is

this
lambic
poured
a
hazy

color
with
no
foam
at
all
the
smell
was
a
modest
sour
cherry
aroma
nice
but
subdued
the
taste
was
tart
cherry
somewhat
sour
with
a
bit
of
horse
blanket
a
very
good
flavor
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
crisp
and
tart
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
the
slightly
sour
cherry
flavor
lingered
pleasantly
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
very
good
kriek
lambic
good
to
the
last
drop
i
had
two
of
these
and
could
have
kept
drinking
them

dark
cherry
color

poured
opaque
no

is

taste

a

tartness
i
actually
didnt
think
this
was
as
tart
as
the
regular
kriek
very
enjoyable
i
also
noticed
some
dry
mustiness
in
the
finish
dark
purpley
red
with
a
fluffy
pink
head
true
lambic
aroma
sour
horses
cherries
of
course
the
flavor
is
sour
so
sour
the
tongue
mistranslates
it
as
almost
salty
past
that
theres
a
lot
going
on
underneath
cherry
is
subtle
here
not
the
sweet
soda
beer
of
lindemans
which
i
do
admit
having
a
soft
spot
for
and
instead
a
true
lambic
with
the
flavor
of
the
fruit
a
very
good
brew
not
as
assertive
as
some
of
there
others
stuff

very

whole
other
level
the
fruit
and
sourness
mingle
perfectly
and
give
a
balanced
flavor
to
satisfy
cravings
both
flavor
components
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
how
well
the
fruit
stands
up
to
the
base
beer
and
displays
its
flavors
great
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
if
not
the
best
lots
of
funk
and
amazing
flavor
first
lambic
i
ever
had
very
enjoyable
had
out
of
the
bottle
at
the
brewery
so
happy
i
finally
had
a
full
pour
of
this
after
having
samples
at
numerous
tastings
over
the
years
i
gotta
say
much
better
fresh
goes
without
saying
this
is
an
excellent
brew
amazing
beer
got
alot
more
fruit
as
it
warmed
up
great
mix
of
sour
and
funk
i
wish
it
were
winter
so
we
could
freeze
it
into
ice
blocks
and
skate
on
it
and
melt
it
in
the
spring
time
and
drink
it
smells
like
cat
piss
but
tastes
like
heaven
wife
said
it
smelled
like
a
mix
of
a
gym
locker
and
dirty
socks
i
told
her
thats
an
exquisite
description
and
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
everything
about
this
beer
is
stellar
and
lives
up
to
the
hype
nearly
flawless
gym
sock
funk
and
all
overall
what
is
there
to
say
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
already
been
said
catholic
priests
fruity
refreshing
and
keep
away
from
children
2014
an
amazing
beer
in
every
sense
a
perfect
combination
of
funk
sour
and
fruit
had
side
by
side
with
dg
imp
apricot
bu
and
ccb
apricot
grove
i
realize
neither
are
lambic
but
fou
was
such
a
clear
winner
always
a
treat
overall
a
seriously
killer
beer
has
all
the
funk
you
could
want
while
remaining
not
only
drinkable
but
refreshing
as
well
amazing
fruit
and
sour
qualities
the
apricot
adds
a
richness
and
body
that
makes
this
lambic
one
of
my
favorites
from
cantillon
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
compared
to
some
of
offerings
meaning
i
could
drink
many
of
these
which
i
cannot
say
for
some
of
the
more
raw
and
sour
versions
a
true
beauty
from
a
legendary
brewery
fantastic

nice
smooth
easy
drinking

and
i
cant
wait
to
just
have
one
of
these
but
not
to

to
look
at
overall
very
good
beer
that
develops
in

and
takes
you
for
a
great
cantillon

o
the
best

ive
experienced
from
a
lambic
so
much
apricot
that
actually
gets
better
as
it

very
dangerous

too
darn
good

that
was
wonderful

i
can
try
again
someday
o
im
lucky
to
have
walked
up
on

luckier
still
to
get
to
try
a

this
terrific

try

again
i
did
a
side

with
batch

and
the
2014
batch
both
very
good
but
i
think
the
batch
1
was
the
winner
overall
this
has
been
my
favorite
cantillon
to
date
well
worth
the
hype
and
so
glad
i
didnt
have
to
give
up
any
beers
to
finally
tick
it
off
fresh
apricot
with
perfect
balance
of
sour
and
tartness
best
apricot
beer
and
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
to
date
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
ton
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
into
an
outer
lace
the
smell
is
full
of
apricots
perfectly
identifiable
and
sweet
there
is
also
a
faint
musky
funk
that
compliments
the
apricots
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
a
ton
of
sweet
apricots
followed
by
a
nice
funk
the
feel
is
light
but
full
bodied
heavy
carbonated
but
sweet
and
juicy
i
feel
like
i
am
taking
a
big
bite
of
an
apricot
when
i
drink
this
beer
very
solid
o
the
complex
classic
cantillon
lambic
flavors
combined
with
fresh
apricot
is
a
perfect
match
if
youre
fortunate
to
see
this
beer
buy
it
if
not
trade
for
it
even
better
travel
to
belgium
and
have
it
at
the
brasserie
like
i
did
nothing
beats
it
5
i
thought
this
was
a
little
over
hyped
had
an
8
taster
glass
so
that
hurt
i
preferred
iris
and
the
classic
gueze
my
favorite
sour
on
the
planet
what
i
really
have
to
wrote
here
os
that
i
am
a
sour
hater
is
was
at
the
borefts
beerfestival
two
weeks
ago
where
cantillon
was
with
some
brews
had
some
sips
of
a
glass
from
a
friend
not
my
thing
2013
vintage
very
sour
acidulated
and
apricot
taste
is
moderated
bitterness
is
short
this
is
a
typical
cantillon
brew
it
comes
a
little
yellow
and
a
little
murky
due
to
the
apricots
it
is
nicely
carbonated
the
aroma
and
taste
have
all
the
cantillon
goodness
though
as
usual
this
holds
not
true
for
every
palate
the
aroma
is
sublime
like
smelling
a
crate
of
ripe
apricots
later
also
the
typical
cantillon
lambic
aromas
kick
in
taste
is
a
little
more
tart
and
less
fruity
than
the
aroma
but
still
very
much
apricot
this
is
a
great
cantillon
with
sublime
fruitiness
if
you
can
get
this
fresh
o
it
is
no
surprise
to
me
why
this
is
the
consensus
favorite
from
temple
of
sours
the
flavors
are
very
subtle
but
perfectly
balanced
perfection
is
unattainable
imo
but
this
ale
gets
very
close
the
fruitsourfunk
aspects
meld
so
nicely
it
is
hard
not
to
give
this
a
perfect
score
this
is
my
favorite
cantillon
well
this
is
excellent
cantillon
does
not
make
beer
they
make
magic
consistently
find
and
drink
matches
the
hype
a
ton
of
oak
with
enough
fruit
and
tart
edges
to
balance
it
all
out
complex
and
tasty
to
the
point
of
absurdity
fresh
wins
here
overall
a
stellar
sour
i
usually
prefer
sours
with
a
noticeable
amount
of
balancing
sweetness
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
beer
this
sour
that
i
enjoyed
so
much
i
can
see
why
bas
seek
it
out
but
at
this
price
i
probably
wont
ever
buy
it
again
or
if
i
do
ill
trade
it
to
someone
whos
never
been
able
to
find
it
not
recommended
for
those
new
to
sours
if
youre
new
to
sours
and
you
happen
to
stumble
upon
a
bottle
of
this
do
yourself
a
favor
stash
it
somewhere
and
explore
several
other
sours
before
drinking
it
otherwise
you
may
not
enjoy
it
and
could
possibly
waste
your
money
and
the
beer
o
highly
drinkable
nice
subtle
flavors
and
good
complexity
though
its
tasty
i
dont
quite
understand
the
fascination
with
this
beer
id
prefer
st
lamvinus
or
lp
kriek
by
far
overall
im
very
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
on
tap
this
is
a
world
class
beer
but
i
am
surprised
at
how
closely
this
compares
to
other
american
sours
i
have
had
i
do
think
this
beer
is
slightly
overhyped
after
trying
it
there
are
many
american
wilds
that
rival
this
that
arent
in
the
top
50
imho
o
dry
complex
and
awesome
quality
drank
this
one
on
site
at
cantillon
was
an
awesome
experience
o
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
but
not
worth
vigilantly
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
im
with
the
bros
on
this
one
a
very
good
beer
but
not
mindblowing
by
any
means
imo
this
is
a
bit
of
an
overhyped
brew
but
its
still
very
nice
and
enjoyable
its
a
damn
fine
highly
drinkable
earthy
sour
just
a
bit
over
hyped
very
solid
i
just
dont
believe
its
tops
in
class
but
definitely
a
top
1015
brew
for
its
class
recommended
yes
even
30750ml
o
definitely
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
experienced
the
buzz
of
something
this
rare
showing
up
in
a
town
this
far
from
a
major
metropolitan
area
was
justified
very
happy
to
have
experienced
this
even
once
this
is
a
very
good
lambic
and
it
feels
almost
sour
like
but
top
12
in
the
world
absolutely
not
i
hyped
this
beer
up
pretty
highly
perhaps
too
much
so
while
its
a
very
clean
perfectly
sour
beer
i
expected
a
little
more
fruit
presence
the
fruit
comes
out
a
bit
more
as
it
warms
overall
once
again
im
knocked
back
to
reality
reality
being
that
belgian
lambics
are
still
king
of
the
sour
beer
world
you
get
caught
up
with
the
american
sour
beer
scene
that
you
almost
forget
the
superiority
of
cantillon
and
drie
fonteinen
when
it
comes
to
sours
i
have
been
waiting
forever
to
try
this
whale
as
it
was
my
1
want
for
over
a
year
fou
foune
is
everything
i
expected
and
more
the
fruity
apricot
balanced
with
the
perfect
acidity
make
for
a
near
perfect
lambic
seek
it
out
o
funky
moderately
tart
saison
flavours
with
minimal
fruit
presence
and
a
lot
of
blue
cheese
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
its
not
my
favorite
from
cantillon
but
it
could
grow
on
me
over
time
that
is
if
i
can
ever
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
it
too
bad
the
hype
has
sucked
out
the
facility
of
obtaining
what
is
a
marvelous
and
delicious
sour
such
as
this
one
but
its
definitely
delicious
and
incredibly
refreshing
no
matter
how
you
cut
it
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
some
day
highly
recommended
but
dont
pay
more
than
25
for
it
if
you
can
help
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
almost
milky
orange
hue
its
really
resembles
peaches
there
is
an
of
white
head
that
sits
around
a
half
finger
size
for
the
entire
drink
tart
acidic
funky
unripe
fruits
on
the
nose
you
can
tell
its
going
to
be
delicious
it
tastes
similar
to
the
nose
with
a
slightly
sharper
carbonation
than
im
used
to
with
other
cantillon
beers
you
could
close
your
eyes
and
take
a
sip
and
feel
like
someone
liquified
the
skin
of
a
peach
the
mouthfeel
is
nearly
perfect
i
would
like
it
just
a
tad
more
creamy
and
a
tad
less
sharp
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
deserve
the
hype
its
worth
it
oi
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
highly
sought
after
easily
one
of
the
top
three
lambics
i
have
tried
what
a
goddamn
treat
to
try
this
beer
an
beer
that
can
absolutely
change
the
way
anyone
views

of

for
our
first
anniversary
2
months
of
age
essentially
i
just
want
to
rereconfirm
that
fresh
fou
foune
is
delicious
and
this
years
fou
foune
is
not
lacking
in
apricots
the
best
advice
i
have
to
anyone
whos
opening
up
a
bottle
soon
is
to
serve
it
at
cellar
temperature
aerate
it
and
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
the
apricots
truly
come
out
as
clean
crisp
stone
fruits
in
the
nose
that
dance
along
your
palate
as
you
sip
it
great
mouthfeel
soft
velvety
but
with
a
nice
crisp
dry
and
thirstquenching
finish
there
is
no
defect
to
be
found
in
this
beer
it
is
still
my
favorite
beer
after
all
this
time
and
worthy
of
its
status
overall
a
beer
that
more
than
lives
up
to
the
hype
of
course
im
predisposed
to
like
it
given
my
penchant
for
beers
that
are
sour
and
the
use
of
apricots
in
beer
but
that
also
means
that
i
could
have
been
easily
disappointed
given
the
reputation
of
this
brew
and
my
high
expectations
mf
a
medium
light
body
with
a
dry
finish
4
25
lovely
radiant
yellow
like
liquid
sunshine
the
nose
is
sweet
astringent
and
a
touch
funky
the
apricots
give
it
a
huge
citrus
sweetness
that
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
pithy
bitterness
it
rounds
off
to
a
nice
pucker
which
makes
it
totally
refreshing
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
total
4850
i
am
not
a
fan
of
apricots
but
i
am
a
fan
of
sour
beers
and
this
is
one
that
does
not
dissapoint
the
tart
feeling
that
you
get
when
you
sip
it
and
then
the
tasty
fruity
flavor
that
envelops
your
mouth
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
my
only
downfall
with
this
is
that
i
cannot
get
this
all
the
time
it
is
a
special
treat
for
those
beer
lovers
that
know
and
appreciate
a
good
beer
when
they
taste
one
if
you
ever
see
this
beer
on
a
list
somewhere
it
is
definetly
worth
a
try
overall
incredible
this
beer
has
so
much
to
offer
but
so
easy
to
drink
its
an
intense
sensory
experience
but
has
many
subtleties
to
explore
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
extremely
expensive
to
order
at
a
restaurant
in
nyc
but
worth
every
penny
appearance
is
basically
the
same
aroma
is
much
fruitier
and
a
bit
more
funkymusty
and
just
overall
more
intense
than
the
2013
ditto
for
the
aroma
with
the
slight
herbal
quality
from
the
2013
not
being
present
in
this
one
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
just
as
incredible
as
last
year
overall
enjoyed
the
2014
quite
a
bit
more
though
to
be
fair
this
i
had
this
about
5
months
fresher

make
sure
not

mouth
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
apricot
and
funk
lingers
for
days
as
it
warms
you
get
a
few
more
flavors
some
green
apple
in
there
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
o
come
on
there
is
just
no
way
this
could
ever
have
lived
up
to
the
expectations
i
had
for
it
that
being
said
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
and
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
cantillon
the
smell
drives
this
beer
and
the
flavor
is
outstanding
ps
the
bloody
cork
shat
itself
into
the
beer
as
i
opened
the
bottle
but
that
kind
of
doesnt
go
with
the
rest
of
the
tale
does
it
hazed
orange
ring
of
white
head
with
some
lace
the
nose
here
is
just
insane
juicy
apricots
fruity
funky
and
acidic
musty
barnyard
notes
fruitylemon
as
well
but
the
apricot
on
this
is
just
out
of
this
world
top
3
if
not
the
best
smelling
beers
of
all
time
for
me
taste
is
good
but
a
step
down
from
the
nose
that
being
said
it
still
is
fantastic
big
puckering
sour
upfront
apricot
and
fruit
lemony
tart
all
the
way
through
acidity
is
fairly
restrained
but
the
fruity
funk
here
is
just
crazy
apricot
aftertaste
dry
puckering
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
and
body
this
blew
me
away
i
thought
it
would
be
good
but
this
was
near
perfect
drinking
the
whole
bottle
alone
was
a
pleasure
and
would
love
to
do
it
again
sometime
edit
i
had
a
2014
version
with
6
months
of
age
on
it
and
it
had
a
lot
more
apricot
and
a
fantastic
nose
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
with
a
little
less
age
on
it
this
is
the
best
and
most
balanced
sour
i
have
ever
had
it
is
just
unreal
this
is
what
a
sour
should
be
thanks
to
my
buddy
who
was
kind
enough
to
share
this
bottle
if
you
like
sours
you
will
fall
in
love
with
this
beer
i
would
pay
lots
of
money
for
a
full
case
of
this
stuff
just
a
very
special
beer
odelicious
but
a
bit
hyped
i
love
me
some
cantillon
but
i
dont
the
fruit
to
be
very
subtle
delicious
nonetheless
but
the
price
tag
is
rather
high
will
drink
again
d
off
the
charts
delicious
and
drinkable
rivaled
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
tasted
and
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
and
again
vintage
2013
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
little
off
white
head
huge
apricots
citrus
and
slight
funk
on
the
nose
tastes
of
peaches
apricots
citrus
with
a
nice
acidic
sour
funk
balance
through
out
and
leaves
a
pleasant
dry
tart
finish
each
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
one
of
my
top
5
beers
this
beer
really
stands
out
as
the
best
sour
ive
had
it
truly
has
fantastic
balance
its
so
delicious
drinking
with
the
fruit
being
the
all
star
in
this
beer
13
tastes
like
a
moldy
juicesoaked
carpet
but
12
and
14
are
on
point
dont
age
this
beer
your
enamel
will
thank
you
overall
a
very
impressive
fruit
sour
from
cantillon
however
since
it
was
nearly
a
year
old
i
was
not
able
to
enjoy
it
fresh
as
the
brewery
highly
recommends
im
betting
the
fruit
character
is
much
more
intense
and
vibrant
and
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
being
released
next
month
hopefully
i
get
another
bottle
after
which
i
will
update
or
add
on
this
review
to
reflect
that
it
has
been
6
or
more
months
since
ive
had
this
but
it
still
haunts
my
memories
of
what
great
cantillon
can
be
for
sure
this
is
not
one
to
age
ive
learned
ill
be
drinking
my
next
bottle
days
after
i
have
it
home
and
the
sediment
has
settled
if
you
can
buy
it
youre
damn
lucky
going
to
calculate
mainly
the
fresh
ones
give
it
around
a
4
8
o
overall
an
excellent
drinking
experience
this
is
only
the
second
cantillon
ive
had
to
date
the
first
being
st
lamvinus
if
i
had
to
choose
a
preference
id
probably
go
with
st
lamvinus
over
this
one
but
no
doubt
that
both
are
absolutely
excellent
highly
recommend
the
great
and
mighty
fou
foune
i
finally
found
one
at
a
hole
in
the
wall
called
novare
res
in
downtown
portland
maine
this
was
on
the
last
page
of
an
incredible
beer
list
i
ordered
one
and
was
told
they
were
out
i
threw
a
fit
like
a
baby
said
id
driven
600
hundred
miles
to
get
one
and
she
said
she
would
be
right
back
she
offered
me
a
2005
lou
pepe
instead
but
i
just
couldnt
switch
gears
that
quick
after
sitting
there
debating
what
to
do
for
a
few
minutes
the
manager
or
owner
emerged
with
a
bottle
of
fou
foune
for
me
all
dusty
and
looking
very
much
like
something
special
they
chilled
it
for
a
few
minutes
before
serving
it
up
in
a
very
cool
old
mail
bin
with
two
cantillon
wine
glass
type
containers
the
beer
pours
faded
orange
in
color
rustic
looking
cloudy
with
a
white
head
like
fine
champagne
rising
and
receding
to
about
an
inch
the
smell
is
just
mental
lots
and
lots
of
acid
here
a
fine
lambic
is
the
base
lacto
and
lemon
tart
and
funky
the
apricots
seem
to
add
a
floral
element
a
fruity
sweetness
to
balance
the
sour
but
i
dont
distinctly
get
apricots
just
by
smelling
it
it
has
the
interesting
effect
of
making
my
mouth
water
for
every
tasty
treat
ive
ever
had
all
at
once
im
watering
like
blue
razz
blowpops
sour
nerds
rope
lemon
shaved
ice
and
porterhouse
steak
all
at
once
this
sensation
alone
makes
this
beer
a
5
out
of
5
overall
nothing
in
the
beer
or
culinary
world
has
ever
had
this
effect
on
my
palate
and
ive
been
around
both
a
few
times
the
taste
is
very
impressive
again
a
mellow
but
distinct
lambic
as
its
base
i
start
to
taste
the
apricots
they
have
a
gentle
fuzzy
feel
and
flavor
like
licking
the
outside
of
one
there
is
a
sweetness
there
but
the
juicy
character
of
the
fruit
and
pulpy
morning
time
flavor
profile
are
not
dominant
what
is
dominant
is
the
yeast
the
best
of
lambic
tart
and
dry
as
any
beer
ive
consumed
its
acidic
and
the
lower
the
bottle
gets
and
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
this
is
pronounced
my
last
yeasty
sip
is
impossibly
sour
putting
hair
on
my
chest
to
say
the
least
its
dry
on
the
palate
after
an
insanely
effervescent
carbonation
experience
but
i
taste
the
beer
for
miles
and
miles
after
the
swallow
not
sure
ill
have
another
beer
again
for
awhile
yeah
right
this
is
a
one
of
a
kind
brew
an
art
form
really
and
worth
all
of
the
accolades
its
received
and
then
some
nothing
like
it
on
the
planet
and
easily
the
best
50
bucks
i
have
spent
in
awhile
not
sure
lambic
will
ever
be
the
same
dyan
shared
a
bottle
of
this
with
me
a
few
months
ago
and
it
absolutely
blew
my
mind
fou
foune
is
one
of
the
best
lambics
on
the
planet
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
at
the
moment
if
you
are
anywhere
near
this
beer
pick
it
up
more
than
one
would
be
ideal
thanks
for
the
bottles
lum
overall
easily
in
the
top
5
beers
ive
had
truly
outstanding
lives
up
to
its
hype
and
more
adding
fruit
to
lambic
likely
began
simply
as
a
means
of
not
wasting
precious
produce
in
the
days
before
refrigeration
anyone
whos
ever
tried
to
eat
local
knows
how
short
the
growing
season
is
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
find
use
for
a
whole
harvest
before
it
spoils
it
turns
out
that
in
the
case
of
fou
foune
anyhow
this
practice
happened
to
make
one
of
lifes
most
sublime
treats
i
couldwould
drink
this
all
day
long
overall
bam
this
baby
hits
the
spot
i
really
dont
know
what
is
better
the
smell
or
the
taste
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
sours
that
i
have
ever
had
very
satisfied
o
solid
apricot
peach
lambic
that
balances
the
light
sweetness
of
the
fruit
with
the
tartness
for
the
lambic
the
tarter
aspects
defintiely
dominate
compared
to
the
other
flavors
othis
is
close
to
my
favorite
cantillon
and
close
to
my
favorite
beer
the
apricot
integrates
so
well
with
the
standard
gueuzelambic
flavors
much
better
than
cherry
or
raspberry
in
my
opinion
the
result
is
balanced
complex
bracingly
tart
drinkable
and
delicious
o
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
absolutely
the
best
part
of
this
beer
which
is
nice
since
those
are
usually
the
two
biggest
factors
in
a
beer
for
me
this
one
definitely
looks
great
as
well
but
with
the
huge
apricot
aromas
and
the
complex
stone
fruit
flavors
bouncing
around
with
the
brett
funk
and
huge
acid
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
what
make
this
a
worldclass
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
down
a
whole
bottle
of
this
by
myself
instead
of
the
half
ounce
pour
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
at
a
tasting
earlier
this
year
d
fantastic
complexity
and
balance
the
apricots
are
fantastic
o
as
already
mentioned
a
straightforward
fruit
lambic
fresh
lively
amazingly
drinkable
for
the
style
though
maybe
not
as
complex
as
i
expected
apricot
lambic
is
a
good
idea
a
very
big
thanks
to
davehack
for
opening
this
gem
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
good
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the
smell
is
awesome
very
fresh
and
fruity
despite
the
souring
of
it
excellent
nose
on
this
beer
i
could
smell
it
forever
the
taste
is
tart
with
a
fruitiness
to
it
also
very
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
as
pungant
as
some
sours
overall
this
is
excellent
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
amazing
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
which
only
added
to
the
overall
experience
love
it
balanced
yet
nuanced
every
sip
presents
something
new
o
world
class
beer
it
might
be
the
best
apricot
sour
i
have
ever
had
however
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
more
inyourface
apricot
the
fruit
is
there
but
its
not
as
intense
as
i
would
have
imagined
still
im
grasping
at
straws
to
find
a
flaw
with
this
beer
wonderful
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
beer
with
a
few
years
in
it
to
really
make
the
sourness
intensify
o
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
great
depth
of
an
aged
lambic
really
shows
the
brett
character
along
with
the
nice
well
rounded
but
full
tartness
the
fruit
flavor
really
comes
through
and
can
hold
its
own
with
the
tartness
and
they
both
work
very
well
together
delicious
thanks
emerge
for
sharing
as
it
breathes
the
fruit
really
comes
out
and
it
becomes
a
much
brighter
beer
this
beer
is
amazingly
well
rounded
and
the
balance
is
incredible
juicy
apricots
are
contrasted
with
a
touch
of
leather
barnyard
and
funk
on
top
of
a
nice
integrated
and
gradual
sourness
the
fruit
is
what
shines
here
though
and
it
makes
for
an
incredible
lambic
o
this
is
a
very
well
done
fruit
lambic
thanks
mike
o
810
sourness
very
good
sour
night
peach
and
citrus
with
lots
of
tart
funk
and
sour
going
on
would
like
to
try
one
with
5
or
so
years
on
it
to
see
if
the
carbonation
and
acidity
mellows
o
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
one
was
definitely
a
treat
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
bottle
shared
with
damico
at
torst
pours
a
pale
orange
yellow
color
with
white
foam
head
aroma
of
peach
funk
and
slight
vinegar
has
a
sweet
tart
taste
with
gentle
notes
of
peaches
and
perfect
foamy
mouthfeel
great
body
for
the
style
a
big
thanks
to
damico
and
a
great
day
higky
recommend
my
expectations
for
fou
foune
were
high
and
they
were
surpassed
beyond
belief
this
is
such
a
masterful
beer
in
nearly
every
sense
of
the
word
most
definitely
the
best
sour
ive
had
to
date
and
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
period
fou
foune
is
a
masterpiece
a
work
of
art
and
a
oneofakind
benchmark
of
the
style
make
it
your
lifegoal
to
get
your
hands
on
fou
foune
if
you
havent
already
o
this
was
a
great
fruit
lambic
that
definitely
lives
up
to
cantillons
esteemed
reputation
in
the
beer
community
the
beer
is
definitely
typical
of
cantillon
and
carries
the
cantillon
musty
funkiness
that
is
so
unique
from
theyre
brewery
the
funkiness
balances
terrifically
with
a
nice
peach
presence
and
is
highly
drinkable
for
a
sour
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
and
i
wish
obtaining
bottles
was
a
little
bit
easier
overall
better
than
i
remembered
from
my
last
tasting
not
my
favorite
cantillon
but
certainly
a
well
done
and
very
traditional
fruit
lambic
overall
really
enjoyed
this
and
it
definitely
won
the
cantillon
fruit
lambic
showdown
at
the
kebab
and
cantillon
dinner
party
the
fruit
was
really
nice
and
in
enough
force
to
put
on
a
show
but
not
so
much
that
it
dominated
the
nose
or
flavor
profile
delicious
and
quite
complex
this
one
is
actually
worth
all
the
praise
it
gets
glad
to
finally
have
tried
this
while
paying
attention
cheers
guys
poured
a
pale
golden
orange
in
color
with
pale
yellow
highlights
and
a
nice
thin
bubbly
head
that
left
some
good
frothy
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
definitely
had
the
signature
cantillon
bretty
barnyard
funk
upfront
on
the
nose
with
fresh
peach
apricot
fruit
notes
good
citrusy
notes
with
oak
wood
and
nice
acidcy
for
sure
the
peachy
apricot
fruits
came
acroos
more
on
the
palate
alongside
great
sour
acidic
notes
with
oaky
wood
accents
which
brought
out
more
flavors
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
plenty
of
brett
barnyard
horse
blanket
character
to
go
around
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
fruity
semi
sweet
bretty
funky
woody
acidic
sour
and
dry
finish
i
definitely
dig
this
beer
all
around
but
i
thought
the
09
vintage
was
way
better
o
excellent
drinkability
excellent
fruit
beer
mandatory
to
cantillon
fans
independently
of
the
hype
around
it
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
hazy
lemon
colored
pour
small
white
head
tart
peach
aroma
flavor
is
sour
peach
grapes
tannins
citrus
lemons
wow
finishes
nice
and
sour
i
was
sipping
for
a
bit
this
is
great
appearance
is
cloudy
orange
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
heavy
with
fresh
peach
which
integrate
nicely
with
the
funky
base
notes
of
wheat
lemon
zest
and
tons
of
acidity
taste
is
just
like
the
nose
heavy
fruit
nice
fleshy
peach
character
followed
by
heavy
acidic
sourness
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
overall
delicious
brew
one
of
my
favorite
cantillons
with
full
bottle
pour
appearance
is
hazy
brown
with
golden
hues
at
the
edges
and
generous
white
head
nose
is
quite
assertive
with
tingly
candied
apricots
intermixed
with
light
barnyard
that
thankfully
stays
in
the
background
gorgeous
sourness
on
the
palate
with
the
fruit
in
there
at
the
same
time
and
it
glides
across
the
palate
beautifully
like
a
good
champagne
loads
of
pleasing
tartness
on
the
finish
incredibly
drinkable
worth
the
hype
maybe
super
solid
regardless
i
would
say
definitely
drink
it
within
a
year
like
the
bottle
says
if
not
sooner
the
apricot
is
too
good
had
a
14
month
old
bottle
and
i
could
easily
tell
the
difference
in
apricot
levels
although
the
older
one
had
a
heftier
sourness
to
it
o
ive
never
had
this
beer
so
fresh
and
its
quite
remarkable
to
see
how
much
fruit
aroma
and
flavor
it
packs
in
great
beer
o
a
fantastic
lambic
with
plenty
of
apricot
and
very
sour
pricey
but
worth
every
penny
i
cant
wait
until
i
get
to
try
this
again
could
be
more
complex
but
with
how
fruity
and
sour
this
is
it
work
overall
this
is
an
easy
review
two
words
sum
up
this
beer
wellcrafted
and
delicious
bottle
from
belgianbeershop
com
a
hazy
orange
golden
beer
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
filled
with
peach
and
apricots
and
a
clear
sourness
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
and
very
fruity
apricots
peach
a
touch
of
citrus
this
is
a
wonderful
lambic
near
to
perfection
and
a
must
drink
for
every
lambic
lover
o
most
excellent
lambic
so
happy
to
have
tried
this
finally
its
not
overwhelmingly
flavorful
but
delicious
and
balanced
for
my
tastes
o
the
fruit
is
spectacular
here
but
its
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
would
have
hoped
still
a
worthy
beer
but
i
think
its
ratings
have
gone
up
due
to
the
difficulty
in
obtaining
it
overall
i
think
this
just
might
be
my
favorite
cantillon
to
date
this
also
drinks
so
incredibly
easily
it
was
hard
to
nurse
this
i
wanted
to
finish
this
in
nothing
flat
its
so
delicious
and
have
more
o
the
apricot
flavor
here
is
fresh
and
assertive
and
works
well
with
the
base
lambic
o
just
superb
in
every
way
it
has
been
awhile
since
i
last
tasted
this
almost
2
years
and
it
is
great
to
try
it
at
a
fresher
stage
since
the
bottle
i
had
back
in
2010
was
an
05
so
vibrant
yet
so
sour
and
fresh
tasting
had
to
go
back
for
a
second
pour
oyes
definitely
a
cantillon
beer
and
no
doubt
fans
of
the
brewery
will
like
this
brew
but
for
my
money
i
think
either
the
standard
gueuze
or
a
rose
de
gambrinus
is
just
as
enjoyable
if
you
are
looking
for
eithe
a
straight
gueuze
or
a
fruit
lambic
and
dont
see
the
hype
associated
with
this
beer
other
than
it
is
hard
to
get
super
dry
and
effervescent
plenty
of
fruit
funk
and
sour
qualities
you
get
some
of
the
apricot
but
its
like
the
dry
intense
flavors
of
dried
fruit
very
enjoyable
again
with
this
style
its
so
complex
and
delicious
that
its
hard
to
describe
but
in
my
personal
opinion
not
as
great
as
i
was
hoping
for
and
i
think
zwanze
2012
was
much
better
terrific
one
of
the
most
delicious
and
most
unique
beers
in
the
world
i
really
cant
find
anything
to
fault
though
i
am
sorry
to
have
consumed
my
only
bottle
overall
this
beer
is
flawless
that
is
all
o
a
stunning
beer
750ml
of
heaven
pours
a
deep
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
but
remains
a
cap
on
the
top
the
aroma
is
quite
tart
with
lemons
and
sour
apricots
dominating
the
nose
a
solid
hit
of
funk
and
light
plastic
phenol
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
fruity
with
apricots
with
a
lemony
tartness
and
hints
of
sour
cherries
and
plums
a
solid
hit
of
horsey
funk
round
out
the
flavor
nicely
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
i
think
im
going
to
go
against
the
grain
on
this
one
a
little
bit
here
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
cant
see
what
all
the
hype
is
behind
this
one
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
just
delicious
and
crazy
drinkable
putting
down
a
750
of
this
is
no
problem
at
all
like
a
delicious
apricot
mimosa
drink
this
750ml
2011
bottle
the
fresher
this
beer
is
the
better
more
of
a
juicy
yellow
bus
style
peach
nose
with
fuzzy
skin
and
rich
juice
taste
is
not
quite
as
aggressive
really
nice
not
one
i
think
is
worth
to
hoard
but
rather
to
crack
open
immediately
bottle
shared
at
the

cloudy
orange
with
an
offwhite

aromas
of
juicy
fresh

vinous
grapey
chardonnay

tart

very
vivid

words

sooo
good
o
the
taste
and
smell
of
this

are
fantastic
thanks
to
rutager
for
sharing
this
whale
oim
hard
pressed
to
think
of
many
beers
that
surpass
fou
foune
in
quality
it
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
lambic
from
probably
the
best
brewery
in
the
world
i
need
like
70
more
bottles
of
this
cost
35
for
a
750
ml
bottle
bar
prices
o
gave
me
a
boner
verdict
fantastic
lambic
from
cantillon
probably
my
favorite
lambic
they
make
ive
had
older
vintages
which
are
very
special
but
something
about
the
fresh
fruit
is
just
so
perfect
o
a
good
sour
but
nothing
spectacular
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
just
so
light
and
delicate
to
almost
nonexistent
this
bottle
was
maybe
4
months
old
so
maybe
something
a
little
fresher
would
help
o
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
enjoyable
i
could
happily
have
a
couple
of
these
but
that
seems
unlikely
with
how
difficult
to
find
and
expensive
this
beer
is
not
overly
sour
but
quite
tart
o
for
a
sour
beer
this
is
quite
pleasant
and
very
easy
to
drink
because
the
fruity
flavors
of
the
apricots
help
to
balance
out
the
sourness
rating
98100
o
definitely
a
great
beer
but
it
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
for
me
i
thought
the
apricot
was
going
to
stand
out
a
lot
more
then
it
did
still
another
nice
offering
from
cantillon
and
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
my
frist
cantillon
and
it
sure
as
hell
will
not
be
the
last
overall
this
is
a
very
good
lambic
and
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
finally
try
it
since
i
have
passed
on
it
in
the
past
highly
recommended
and
would
drink
again
pours
a
slightly
murky
light
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
wood
and
apricot
aromas
taste
is
the
same
and
has
a
fantastic
apricot
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
great
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
somewhat
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
and
by
far
the
best
cantillon
i
have
tried
so
far
by
a
longshot
o
overall
this
beer
was
basically
every
bit
as
good
as
the
legend
tells
its
a
freaking
delicious
beer
however
as
far
as
apricot
goes
i
found
the
bruerys
filmishmish
to
deliver
more
looks
nice
cloudy
honeyorange
color
with
about
a
12
cap
of
delicate
white
bubbles
for
a
head
that
recedes
to
a
small
ringlet
leaving
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
distant
dry
aroma
citrus
zest
musty
touch
of
apricot
tartness
hits
you
up
front
on
the
palate
very
drying
more
citrus
pith
than
anything
lemon
juice
afterthoughts
of
candied
apricot
and
grassy
funk
dont
drink
this
if
you
have
chapped
lips
fairly
light
bodied
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
acidic
but
with
a
good
drying
balance
that
improves
the
drinkability
nice
but
nothing
really
special
going
on
here
but
if
youre
a
beer
scene
noob
youll
love
it
o
a
good
beer
overall
a
little
watery
and
not
terribly
complex
its
still
tasty
and
refreshing
m
medium
body
moderate
to
high
carbonation
this
is
medium
bodied
with
great
crisp
drinkability
this
is
an
absolute
gem
all
that
its
cracked
up
to
be
apricots
and
funk
on
the
nose
hints
of
acetic
acid
perhaps
behind
it
all
but
minimally
if
at
all
the
fruitiness
builds
with
time
and
the
temperature
of
the
beer
increasing
stellar
funky
nose
that
develops
over
time
i
need
to
spend
more
time
to
think
about
this
in
order
to
really
do
this
justice
but
i
dont
want
to
think
too
much
the
body
has
a
strong
effervescence
that
bites
the
tongue
giving
the
beer
a
body
that
i
think
it
would
otherwise
have
lacked
more
apricots
in
the
body
with
nice
barnyard
notes
that
pair
well
a
great
beer
i
am
glad
to
have
5
more
of
to
consume
over
time
and
consider
its
growth
lineup
for
me
but
i
am
loving
every
drop
of
this
and
will
look
forward
to
having
it
again
someday
overall
awesome
beer
glad
that
i
was
give
an
oppurtunity
to
try
such
a
hard
to
get
beer
i
probably
wont
see
another
bottle
of
this
beer
in
my
life
time
this
is
my
second
cantillion
i
have
tried
and
its
very
nice
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
yeah
right
loved
it
huge
thanks
to
egrace84
for
the
share
amazingly
drinkable
brew
perhaps
one
of
the
most
drinkable
cantillons
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
sample
the
soft
sweetness
of
the
apricots
cushions
the
palate
beautifully
lovely
beer
this
beer
is
alive
with
a
clean
and
zesty
texture
that
introduces
its
finish
as
soon
as
it
does
its
initial
taste
drinkable
palatable
digestible
sure
but
it
takes
a
lot
of
concentration
to
understand
the
quick
procession
that
this
beer
does
dancing
across
the
tongue
its
incredible
that
a
fruited
sour
ale
delivers
this
intense
of
a
dry
beer
without
exposing
any
flaws
in
taste
astringency
in
texture
or
wavering
of
body

d
my
favorite
cantillon
thus
far
next
to
st
lamvinus
the
fruit
has
faded
a
bit
in
the
drink
which
is
a
slight
disappointment
drink
the
2010
asap
but
the
nose
is
really
spectacular
drink
damn
tasty
beer
i
understand
now
why
so
hard
to
get
and
why
no
one
would
say
where
bottles
are
overall
this
is
world
class
no
bones
about
it
flavor
profile
is
exactly
how
you
would
want
a
fruited
lambic
to
be
balance
of
fruit
and
funk
is
second
to
none
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
anything
but
cantillon
from
juneaugust
if
i
could
readily
track
it
down
but
alas
that
will
never
happen
i
prefer
st
lamvinus
to
this
slightly
but
that
is
a
personal
preference
both
are
the
two
best
belgian
lambics
for
my
money
clear
gold
in
colour
with
a
white
head
and
light
lacing
a
dense
ring
of
retention
remains
nose
is

with
a
typical
cantillon
funk
light
oak
and
a
generally
piercing
acidity
all
around
apricots
are
a
bit
hidden
intially
but
begin
to
reveal
themselves
more
as
this
moves
closer
to
room
temp
taste
wasnt
as
sour
as
i
had
anticipated
7810
sourness
but
still
quite
acidic
in
its
own
right
more
white
balsamic
vinegar
cantillon
funk
only
a
sliver
of
oak
and
similar
to
the
aroma
warmth
aids
the
revealing
of
the
apricots
some
sweetness
in
there
as
well
lighter
medium
body
and
sourness
carries
well
into
the
finish
fairly
exquisite
and
had
my
nose
on
this
one
for
a
better
part
of
the
time
definitely
a
sipper
took
me
and
the
girlfriend
over
2
and
a
half
hours
to
get
through
this
750ml
hoped
for
a
bit
more
apricot
flavour
perhaps
a
fresher
bottle
wouldve
had
more
of
this
eagerly
awaiting
one
from
a
trading
partner
will
rereview
o
i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
amazing
brew
cantillon
doesnt
make
a
bad
offering
this
one
is
great
bottom
line
if
you
have
even
a
remote
interest
in
this
style
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
seek
this
out
even
if
you
dont
like
the
style
if
you
find
it
drink
it
odds
are
your
mind
will
be
changed
the
price
tag
was
hefty
but
zero
regrets
drinking
it
at
moeder
just
added
the
cherry
or
apricot
on
top
o
30
for
the
bottle
which
was
worth
it
if
you
can
swing
the
price
im
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
if
you
see
it
splurge
youll
thank
me
later
o
as
amazing
as
any
lambic
or
any
beer
soft
and
approachable
for
cantillon
masterpiece
o
a

class

i
am
so
excited

mild

with

one
of
the

really
nice

cantillon
fou

pours
a

with
about
two
fingers
of

the
head
retention
is
surprisingly
good
for
a
lambic
but
theres
not
a
speck
of
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
an
absolute
apricot
bomb
loads
of
fresh
fruit
jumping
out
of
the
glass
lurking
behind
it
is
some
wet
hay
brett
funk
and
a
light
lactic
sourness
its
a
beautiful
aroma
but
a
little
bit
more
balance
in
terms
of
more
funk
and
sour
to
compete
with
the
fruit
would
really
make
this
perfect
my
thoughts
on
the
flavor
profile
are
fairly
similar
the
big
blast
of
apricot
up
front
is
great
but
the
wild
aspects
of
the
beer
almost
seem
like
theyre
just
sneaking
into
the
picture
on
the
back
end
i
really
like
this
beer
now
but
i
think
with
another
6
months
on
it
it
would
be
absolutely
sublime
one
thing
that
doesnt
need
time
to
improve
though
is
the
mouthfeel
the
body
i
crisp
and
light
and
paired
with
a
wonderfully
bubbly
almost
champagnelike
carbonation
fou
foune
is
another
absolutely
killer
beer
from
cantillon
quite
possibly
my
favorite
that
ive
had
from
them
its
a
shame
its
relatively
hard
to
get
your
hands
on
because
id
love
to
see
what
a
little
age
does
to
this
beer
overall
impression
while
i
waited
for
a
month
and
stood
in
line
for
over
an
hour
to
get
my
glass
of
this
i
had
way
too
high
of
an
expectation
for
this
lambic
from
cantillon
it
was
still
very
nice
and
enjoyable
but
would
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
since
everyone
agreed
the
bottle
version
was
much
better
still
would
highly
recommend
enjoying
this
one
if
you
ever
find
it
but
didnt
find
it
to
be
one
of
my
top
beers
produced
by
cantillon
this
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
huge
3
finger
head
from
the
tap
had
to
let
it
settle
before
taking
first
drink
aromas
are
pretty
strong
with
plenty
of
funk
and
fruits
amazing
smells
taste
is
lots
of
funk
with
subtle
but
delicious
hints
of
apricot
nice
acidity
in
the
after
taste
somewhat
sour
but
fresh
mouthfeel
is
thin
bodied
and
good
carbonation
from
the
tap
overall
this
is
truly
amazing
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
will
look
to
drink
from
a
bottle
in
the
future
as
ive
heard
its
better
from
the
bottle
pretty
amazing
would
drink
over
and
over
wow
im
so
happy
i
finally
get
to
review
this
beer
bought
it
off
a
belgian
website
bottled
august
25th
2011fresh
baby
i
heard
fresh
is
the
best
way
to
go
with
this
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
straw
yelloworange
color
with
a
large
white
head
very
fizzy
scent
is
just
as
funky
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
quite
funky
sweet
apricots
in
the
aroma
with
some
grass
and
funky
cheese
definitely
some
sharp
cheese
aromas
lots
of
barnyard
funk
with
a
bit
of
stinky
gym
socks
considering
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
the
aroma
was
much
more
funky
than
i
was
expecting
which
is
great
taste
is
tart
at
first
not
sour
switches
to
sweet
apricots
funkystrong
cheese
flavors
with
a
ton
of
barnyard
flavor
then
the
apricots
come
back
in
but
more
sour
this
time
finishes
even
more
sour
than
it
started
great
finish
to
this
beer
scratch
that
the
best
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
puckering
notes
and
very
highly
carbonated
could
use
a
little
less
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
as
it
could
get
overall
another
amazing
beer
from
cantillon
now
that
ive
tried
this
gem
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
from
750
ml
bottle
into
in
de
verzekering
tegen
de
grotto
dorst
lambicgueuze
glass
low
white
head
atop
hazy
light
gold
body
aroma
of
green
apple
and
most
certainly
apricot
slight
sweetness
taste
citric
with
nice
apricot
tongue
smacking
mouth
puckering
greatness
awesome
i
can
see
why
this
is
highly
sought
after
i
am
happy
that
i
was
able
to
secure
one
with
the
recent
cantillon
distribution
in
ma
o
great
the
best
cantillion
so
far
this
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
yellow
in
color
with
a
great
apricot
aroma
and
noticeable
tartness
even
from
the
aroma
simply
amazing
theres
a
big
effervescence
to
this
that
lets
the
flavors
dance
across
the
tongue
the
apricot
floralfruitiness
is
subdued
but
its
present
and
tasty
its
tart
with
a
lingering
dry
finish
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
like
a
firework
going
off
half
a
pour
wasnt
enough
but
its
more
than
many
had
cant
wait
to
have
another
o
the
flavors
seemed
slightly
muted
overall
and
it
didnt
wow
me
like
i
thought
it
would
it
was
still
an
above
average
lambic
but
i
expected
more
fruity
flesh
and
a
little
more
tartness
on
tap
at
the
beer
revolution
anniversary
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
big
apricot
some
lemon
funkiness
lactic
along
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
tart
with
a
bit
of
initial
sweetness
lots
of
apricot
tart
lemon
signature
cantillon
funkiness
finish
is
tart
medium
body
low
carbonation
the
fruit
is
really
prominent
here
more
so
than
in
other
cantillon
lambics
it
also
has
a
bit
more
sweetness
than
other
cantillons
but
certainly
not
too
much
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
far
the
best
in
the
cantillon
line
for
me
the
balance
of
juicy
fragrant
fruit
and
expressive
lambic
in
this
beer
is
what
other
makers
of
fruited
wild
beers
should
strive
to
emulate
the
best
quality
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
lightish
body
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
this
really
is
a
fine
drinking
experience
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it

o
this
is
an
excellent
fruit
lambic
and
perhaps
one
of
the
best
beers
of
any
type
that
ive
ever
had
foufoune
is
an
experience
not
to
miss
i
cant
recommend
it
highly
enough
feel
is
very
light
bodied
and
nicely
carbed
up
a
nice
amount
of
sourness
hits
the
gullet
yet
not
extreme
while
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
could
not
get
another
glass
i
went
with
iris
instead
i
really
want
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
of
fou
foune
and
make
a
solid
decision
on
it
gfunk
oa
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
lambic
this
is
the
real
deal
one
if
the
best
sours
ive
had
i
could
drink
plenty
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
and
expensive
definitely
a
treat
overall
just
a
fantastic
beer
i
traded
one
of
these
away
earlier
this
summer
and
am
kicking
myself
for
it
now
one
of
the
better
cantillons
out
there
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fads
to
a
patchy
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
delicate
notes
of
citrus
peach
pineapple
sour
lactose
and
a
hint
of
funk
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
and
just
as
delicate
and
complex
there
is
more
citrus
then
i
was
expecting
in
the
flavor
lemon
being
the
prevailing
flavor
it
is
only
slightly
sour
which
allows
for
the
other
fruity
flavors
to
breath
the
body
is
medium
light
with
a
medium
carbonation
and
it
is
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
i
didnt
want
my
glass
to
end
but
alas
all
good
things
must
come
to
an
end
fou
foune
is
a
notable
fruit
lambic
but
it
is
far
from
being
one
of
my
favorite
cantillon
offerings
without
the
knowledge
that
this
beer
was
brewed
with
apricots
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
it
was
furthermore
the
beer
seemed
to
lack
some
overall
complexity
based
on
the
scores
that
this
receives
and
on
its
price
point
i
was
expecting
more
i
really
enjoy
the
unique
fruitiness
of
this
lambic
unlike
any
ive
had
so
far
o
it
wasnt
as
good
as
what
i
was
hoping
for
when
i
first
heard
apricot
lambic
but
still
a
pretty
solid
brew
maybe
its
different
out
of
the
bottle
if
i
could
find
a
bottle
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
cheers
whoa
23
for
a
bottle
definitely
worth
trying
once
i
have
another
bottle
to
let
sit
for
a
bit
but
dont
plan
on
opening
it
for
awhile
highly
recommended
although
some
people
may
get
an
upset
stomach
after
drinking
o
an
incredible
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
cantillon
but
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
them
very
refreshing
and
tasty
o
glad
to
have
tried
this
are
there
any
better
fruit
lambics
than
the
ones
cantillon
makes
not
really
45
o
the
best
lambic
that
i
have
tried
to
date
the
balance
between
fruit
and
sourness
is
a
masterful
display
of
brewing
that
leaves
you
just
wanting
a
whole
lot
more
this
beer
deserves
the
hype
o
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
i
kept
wanting
to
come
back
to
it
couldnt
let
it
sit
for
very
long
between
sips
if
the
bottled
version
is
even
better
then
id
love
to
get
some
i
think
its
at
its
peak
fantastic
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
loose
white
head
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
tangy
then
sweet
like
wood
sorrel
and
honey
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sour
notes
not
too
strong
with
some
round
floral
and
fruity
notes
in
the
middle
with
a
dry
finish
its
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
body
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
just
had
this
beer
2011
vintage
750ml
and
boy
was
i
impressed
with
this
one
now
i
know
why
people
are
always
looking
for
it
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
orangish
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
was
the
only
part
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
smell
is
huge
vibran
apricots
up
front
followed
by
a
tart
funky
slightly
barnyard
smell
the
flavor
is
again
huge
on
ripe
apricots
with
a
nice
sourness
and
funk
in
the
finish
not
to
acidic
just
right
on
the
acidity
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
juicy
with
the
apricot
flavors
well
carved
and
overall
an
amazing
lambic
just
outstanding
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
i
think
that
the
fact
that
this
was
a
fresh
bottle
really
helped
or
at
least
gave
me
what
i
was
looking
for
out
of
this
as
those
vibrant
apricot
flavors
just
made
this
this
is
an
fantastic
lambic
and
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
in
the
future
o
im
really
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
had
really
hoped
this
would
be
amazing
as
its
impossible
to
find
and
everyone
wants
to
try
it
really
it
reminds
me
of
their
gueuze
just
not
as
good
certainly
not
bad
and
id
try
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
jump
through
the
hoops
that
people
do
to
try
this
its
just
not
worth
it
b
to
b
range
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
no
beer
should
cost
30
o
this
has
become
a
religious
experience
i
can
see
why
people
hunt
for
this
my
hunt
starts
now
since
i
just
finished
this
bottle
do
not
pass
this
up
if
you
come
across
this
bottle
a
great
cantillon
love
the
aroma
and
apricot
flavor
mixed
with
that
classic
cantillon
bug
funk
a
true
treat
for
a
surprisingly
low
price
overall
not
quite
the
super
sour
bomb
that
i
was
expecting
but
surprises
are
always
good
especially
when
the
result
is
an
insanely
delicious
beer
like
fou
foune
highly
recommended
one
i
will
certainly
buy
every
year
from
now
on
o
for
me
my
favorite
cantillon
beer
that
i
have
had
including
blabaer
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
but
can
see
myself
making
the
plunge
for
more
o
awesome
citrus
poppy
goodness
throughout
this
one
worth
the
hype
and
the
hunt
although
with
the
right
people
it
might
just
fall
into
your
hands
rather
mild
for
the
usual
cantillons
that
im
used
to
but
still
delivers
that
sharp
acidic
twang
that
is
the
signature
of
the
style
also
a
rare
one
where
they
recommend
consuming
it
within
a
year
of
its
production
rather
than
aging
it
as
long
as
you
can
hold
out
i
feel
lucky
to
have
had
the
chance
to
sample
this
though
still
not
a
huge
fan
o
this
is
an
amazing
fruit
beer
and
one
that
incorporates
a
rather
mild
fruit
very
well
light
crisp
flavorful
and
aromatic
i
wish
i
could
get
this
more
readily
also
something
about
the
nose
and
taste
seemed
to
evoke
a
tripel
slightly
o
what
can
i
say
for
a
sour
theres
is
some
flavor
to
taste
great
you
guessed
it
this
stuff
is
not
made
for
me
o
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
having
it
ontap
at
brouwers
during
seattle
beer
week
in
may
was
awesome
but
in
the
bottle
it
holds
up
just
the
same
lambic
is
growing
on
me
but
this
is
done
so
perfectly
it
is
hard
to
find
anything
bad
about
it
crisp
clean
beautiful
delicious
the
list
could
go
on
o
this
is
the
best
fruit
lambic
i
have
ever
had
it
really
captures
the
apricots
and
i
cant
imagine
aging
this
any
longer
as
the
fruit
sweetness
is
perfect
however
its
not
as
mind
shattering
as
i
thought
it
would
be
is
it
worth
28
and
the
hunt
of
landing
a
bottle
probably
not
but
it
is
delicious
and
really
well
made
2012
vintage
addendum
the
2012
isnt
as
fruitforward
as
the
2011
was
but
is
a
lot
more
sour
it
still
maintains
the
apricot
flavor
but
its
more
mixed
in
with
the
other
flavors
than
out
front
as
it
was
with
the
2011
oi
know
i
stated
earlier
maybe
i
might
of
cracked
it
too
early
but
after
this
i
think
i
did
the
right
thing
as
the
flavours
just
hit
you
and
suprisingly
i
really
dont
like
apricots
off
the
tree
but
this
drop
even
though
the
apricots
are
there
they
just
become
a
nice
mix
of
the
lambic
itself
without
being
the
forefront
and
now
i
understand
the
hype
this
brew
deserves
cheers
drink
if
you
can
find
o
im
pretty
new
to
sours
and
this
is
honestly
an
awesome
experience
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
my
wife
even
liked
it
a
lot
as
it
seemed
more
champagnelike
than
what
one
thinks
of
as
a
typical
beer
very
complex
overall
2010
vintage
poured

heady
lots
of

come
thru
in

no

not

only
slightly
puckering
i
am
very
excited
to
have
tried
this
it
has
been
a
huge
want
for
me
and
it
makes
me
even
more
anxious
to
land
a
bottle
of
it
thanks
santa
still
not
converted
but
i
would
drink
this
again
when
offered
poured
a
corked
and
capped
750ml
into
a
cantillon
tumbler
this
beer
pours
a
ultra
hazy
orange
with
a
2
inch
cap
that
quickly
disappears
into
just
a
thin
line
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
just
a
hint
of
soapy
lacing
lazily
slides
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
funk
and
apricot
wet
grass
and
damp
earth
grapefruit
pith
layer
with
apricots
fantastic
stuff
the
flavor
is
spot
on

underneath
is

old

bone
dry
cantillon
really
knows
how
to
make
fantastic
beer
i
truly
wish
i
could
buy
this
year
round
o
awesome
lambic
the
apricot
is
delicious
and
blends
well
with
the
sour
notes
and
also
with
the
yeasty
funk
very
nice
4

this
one
was
very
different
from
the
other
cantillon
i
have
drank
this
is
very
fruit
forward
and
the
fresh
apricot
is
very
apparent
in
the
taste
right
now
the
funk
and
sour
taste
is
there
but
not
nearly
what
its
like
in
other
cantillon
i
look
forward
to
drinking
and
aging
a
number
of
these
i
just
cant
get
over
how
good
this
beer
smells
im
only
merely
impressed
by
the
other
aspects
solid
stuff
for
sure
and
im
not
mad
i
have
a
few
more
to
drink
but
im
scared
the
fruit
will
fade
if
i
age
it
i
may
have
spent
my
kids
collage
fund
on
this
stuff
but
this
works
well
for
me
because
as
far
as
i
know
i
dont
have
any
kids
yeah
me
1000
beers
in
and
still
no
children
woooo
hooo
o
great
sour
this
one
deserves
the
hype
that
is
has
i
hope
to
cross
paths
with
this
one
again
a
lovely
enjoyable
fruit
lambic
all
the
expected
talking
points
are
there
and
in
admirable
balance
no
palate
wreckage
today
mon
ami
fruit
malt
funk
and
brio
all
in
wellblended
moderation
this
bottle
is
certainly
going
down
faster
than
any
of
its
colleagues
who
have
gone
before
overall
a
worldclass
beer
one
of
my
favorites
this
bottle
is
dated
bottled
august
18
2011
its
the
youngest
ive
ever
seen
a
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dingy
tangerine
orange
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
turns
into
a
lacing
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
aromas
are
of
fresh
lightly
sweet
and
tart
juicy
mouthwatering
candied
apricots
witha
slight
acidic
sour
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
impressive
noses
of
any
lambic
the
flavor
features
tart
and
juicy
fresh
apricot
plenty
of
sharp
citric
acidity
light
oaking
must
and
light
funk
it
has
great
flavor
and
finishes
light
and
dry
which
makes
it
even
more
drinkable
overall
this
is
one
of
the
finest
lambics
ive
had
to
date
this
is
my
third
time
trying
it
and
i
appreciated
it
most
this
time
at
just
over
three
months
old
it
was
a
treat
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
not
any
better
than
any
other
cantillon
fruit
lambic
in
fact
i
prefer
st
lamvinus
and
vigneronne
to
this
beer
good
lambic
and
glad
i
go
to
try
it
but
not
at
all
worth
the
effort
to
pursue
again
o
one
of
the
best
out
there
one
of
the
best
cantillons
one
of
the
best
lambics
everyone
needs
a
bottle
of
this
nice
ruddy
light
orange
color
hazy
with
flashes
of
gold
upon
pouring
a
generous
offwhite
foam
rises
and
recedes
quickly
great
balance
of
apricot
and
funk
in
the
aroma
not
too
overbearing
sweet
apricot
notes
dance
around
the
bugs
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
both
fantastic
as
well
light
dry
and
incredibly
quenching
i
finished
it
in
just
a
few
gulps
haha
again
light
apricot
nice
progression
from
sweet
to
sour
to
tart
to
musty
to
tart
theres
a
giant
celestial
apricot
on
the
label
if
i
lived
on
the
moon
this
would
probably
be
my
goto
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
peach
color
with
a
fluffy
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
wonderful
lots
of
a
fresh
earthy
mushroom
lambic
funk
touch
of
leathery
brett
notes
of
dry
oak
strong
peach
and
appricot
sweetness
in
the
back
the
taste
is
great
very
funky
earthy
mushroom
funk
a
touch
sweaty
bright
peach
and
appricot
flavors
with
a
faint
sourness
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
rather
dry
finish
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
very
salivating
and
extremely
satisfying
across
the
board
there
is
no
alcohol
inclusion
readily
apparent
despite
the
brew
getting
warmer
than
ideal
during
the
session
i
could
absolutely
kill
this
beer
all
day
long
i
would
have
no
regrets
choosing
this
as
the
only
beer
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
a
beautiful
perfect
aroma
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
smelled
in
a
beer
i
strongly
consider
but
hesitate
giving
this
a
perfect
5
rating
if
a
4
99
rating
were
possible
thats
what
id
give
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
multiple
draft
pours
of
this
beer
5
months
ago
so
i
knew
what
i
was
in
for
opening
this
bottle
exceeded
all
expectations
o
like
much
of
what
cantillon
produces
fou
foune
is
a
world
class
beer
i
still
prefer
some
of
their
others
especially
when
you
factor
in
accessibility
but
fou
foune
is
a
treat
seek
it
out
if
you
can
skål
foufoune
has
a
totally
complex
amount
of
flavor
with
the
apricot
taste
mixing
sweet
fruit
with
a
tart
and
mild
floral
quality
while
at
the
same
time
mild
spice
and
a
woody
tinge
is
blended
in
with
slight
lactic
acidity
which
never
seems
to
outdo
the
fruit
just
augments
it
with
a
seriously
intense
amount
of
tropical
notes
the
apricot
skin
sour
flavor
comes
out
with
slight
lemony
lactic
tinges
and
hints
of
bitter
tannin
at
times
the
woody
toastiness
works
very
well
alongside
the
floral
and
mild
sweet
flavors
from
the
fruit
with
a
jammy
apricot
flavor
the
sour
and
complex
amount
of
sweet
tangy
fruit
notes
linger
until
the
last
sip
the
yeast
at
the
end
seems
to
give
a
more
oaky
quality
that
wasnt
as
evident
in
the
first
pour
but
even
that
is
seriously
tasty
in
its
own
way
the
expectations
for
this
beer
were
met
and
completely
exceeded
a
less
aggressive
sour
than
some
cantillon
beers
but
it
impressed
me
even
more
with
its
balance
i
am
totally
won
over
by
this
beer
and
the
drinkability
is
ultra
high
to
me
o
another
knockout
brew
from
cantillon
can
they
mess
anything
up
so
happy
to
have
another
one
of
these
to
try
in
another
year
or
so
this
is
my
favorite
cantillon
to
date
i
dont
see
how
it
gets
better
than
this
thanks
again
ian
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
and
glad
to
see
it
has
lived
up
to
what
i
hoped
it
would
be
the
nose
is
pretty
much
perfect
i
loved
how
much
the
apricots
came
through
in
it
something
i
will
certainly
try
and
get
more
bottles
of
and
would
be
itnerested
to
see
how
it
ages
because
i
thought
it
was
pretty
perfect
fresh
if
you
like
apricots
this
is
our
outstanding
sour
o
really
tasty
had
this
on
cask
at
moeder
lambic
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
hadtasted
exactly
like
strawberrybanana
yogurt
in
the
bottle
it
was
a
little
more
sour
and
a
little
sharper
but
the
flavors
were
the
same
smell
was
really
exceptional
o
glad
i
was
able
to
procure
so
many
bottles
of
this
online
its
amazing
and
i
dont
think
i
will
be
trading
any
of
these
away
my
favorite
lambic
fruit
fantastic
fresh
apricot
smell
with
a
little
earthiness
it
smells
like
country
the
taste
is
apricot
apricot
apricot
and
a
slight
lemony
sourness
no
toot
tart
well
blanced
it
so
easy
to
drink
so
refreshing
so
well
done
a
must
have
lambic
overall
cantillon
really
does
a
terrific
job
with
fruit
lambics
theyre
more
acidic
than
funky
which
allows
the
fruit
to
shine
in
this
case
the
fruit
flavor
is
perfect
and
manages
to
showcase
without
being
a
fruit
bomb
o
definitely
my
favorite
fruit
lambic
though
overall
i
still
prefer
iris
the
apricots
here
are
really
quite
sublime
and
the
entire
beer
is
amazingly
delicate
yet
rich
in
flavor
on
tap
at
beachwood
bbq
been
wanting
to
get
one
of
these
for
a
while
and
was
not
disappointed
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
overall
just
amazing
so
refreshing
i
was
really
bummed
i
couldnt
just
buy
a
whole
glass
loved
the
fruit
and
the
level
of
sourness
i
will
definitely
try
to
find
this
again
one
day
cloudy
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
from
the
pour
lacing
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
appear
to
have
sediment
reminiscent
of
fruit
pulp
smell
is
almost
entirely
of
apricot
with
very
little
funk
to
remark
on
taste
also
has
a
ton
of
apricot
along
with
some
sourness
taste
also
has
a
bit
of
a
woody
taste
as
well
its
fantastic
as
the
apricot
is
so
obvious
one
thing
to
love
about
cantillons
fruit
lambics
the
essence
of
the
fruit
is
not
lost
with
all
the
wild
critters
fermenting
it
and
this
one
is
no
exception
this
may
be
my
favorite
cantillon
overall
epic
certainly
one
of
the
best
sourslambics
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
ever
encountered
as
well
this
beer
deserves
its
reputation
track
it
down
pours
a
hazy
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
big
white
head
in
the
aroma
tart
and
fruity
in
the
taste
a
dry
tartness
and
note
of
peaches
very
similar
to
a
dry
white
wine
or
riesling
a
small
sour
bite
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
tart
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
nice
sour
fruitiness
especially
peaches
with
a
nice
dryness
m
soda
fizz
this
has
a
very
lengthy
finish
and
again
i
have
to
note
that
the
carbonation
is
most
impressive
i
figure
it
would
easily
be
fantastic
10
years
from
now
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
very
little
head
after
the
pour
smells
of
pure
funk
barnyard
aromas
musty
yet
inviting
a
little
bit
of
old
moldylike
wood
acetic
vinegar
aromas
permeate
throughout
tastes
sour
but
not
overly
puckering
hints
of
apricot
tastes
vinegarlike
and
inviting
great
tasting
if
this
is
a
prime
lambic
example
im
hooked
o
not
much
to
say
here
that
hasnt
been
said
this
is
obviously
an
excellent
beer
cantillon
does
amazing
things
and
continues
to
impress
me
with
every
beer
of
theirs
that
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
consume
i
was
very
happy
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
and
i
would
obviously
drink
it
again
though
im
curious
to
try
an
older
vintage
i
couldnt
imagine
enjoying
this
beer
without
the
fruitiness
a
phenomenal
expression
of
natural
sweetness
and
a
superb
lambic
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
my
only
problem
is
that
my
girlfriend
absolutely
loved
it
so
now
i
have
to
find
a
bottle
or
two
for
a
special
occasion
oh
well
cant
complain
o
another
fantastic
lambic
from
cantillon
not
a
traditional
fruit
but
it
certainly
works
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
some
time
and
it
did
not
disappoint
great
beer
the
cuvee
of
all
these
was
a
fuzzy
funky
refluxinducing
treat
the
dreg
blend
was
like
butter
so
thankful
for
this
onceinalifetime
experience
cheers
to
all
the
contributors
cheers
i
got
a
pretty
small
pour
of
this
and
it
was
gone
pretty
quickly
glad
to
have
tried
this
id
like
to
be
able
to
sit
down
with
a
bottle
sometime
overall
an
excellent
excellent
beer
i
hope
i
can
land
a
bottle
or
two
in
the
future
had
the
09
vintage
a
couple
of
days
ago
from
the
bottle
and
i
was
blown
away
this
beer
is
even
better
than
i
remembered
it
to
be
the
apricot
is
phenomonal
overall
i
love
sours
and
had
many
of
them
but
this
one
is
like
a
geuze
with
pure
lemon
juice
added
making
it
a
bit
unbalanced
imo
just
expected
more
of
this
one
although
would
never
turn
one
down
truly
a
world
class
beer
that
deserves
its
standing
among
the
elite
lambics
not
worth
mortgaging
your
house
over
but
undoubtedly
something
to
seek
out
and
try
if
you
should
ever
get
the
opportunity
2010
bottle
shared
with
my
beautiful
and
wonderful
girlfriend
i
have
had
older
bottles
of
this
but
never
one
nearly
so
fresh
as
this
the
brew
pours
a
turbid
orange
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
nice
albeit
shortlived
white
cap
of
froth
wow
it
smells
so
strongly
tart
fruity
and
funky
it
tastes
like
a
tart
gueuze
macerated
in
copious
amounts
of
the
juicy
and
tart
flesh
of
apricot
and
peach
first
and
foremost
but
it
also
suggests
hefty
doses
of
nectarine
alphonso
mango
mandarin
orange
supremes
papaya
and
loquat
very
very
tart
one
of
the
most
puckering
beers
ive
had
sip
after
sip
many
standard
nuances
of
a
cantillon
brew
ex
grassy
woodytannic
andor
bright
lemony
are
obfuscated
by
the
brutal
funkiness
of
this
heavily
fruitladen
lambic
strong
acidity
here
from
the
sharply
tart
malictartariccitric
acid
notes
akin
to
sour
candy
to
the
heavy
malt
vinegar
nuance
and
finally
rounded
out
by
the
pungent
overiperotten
orchard
fruit
notes
and
a
musky
haystrawbarn
funk
overall
this
beer
is
a
stunner
relatively
fresh
like
this
bottle
is
the
brew
is
as
intensely
fruity
as
any
youre
likely
to
encounter
give
it
5
years
or
so
such
as
the
bottle
urwithdave
shared
with
me
recently
and
the
brew
is
equally
stunning
but
radically
different
the
fruit
is
a
ghostly
nuance
after
5
years
and
all
of
the
elements
are
expressed
in
a
divinely
sublime
manner
as
opposed
to
the
shocking
intensity
of
the
fresh
brew
overall
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
try
while
i
have
been
venturing
into
sour
beer
the
08
version
of
this
beer
is
the
best
i
have
ever
had
and
confirmed
my
love
for
wild
yeast
outstanding
overall
it
is
a
cruel
joke
that
this
beer
is
so
hard
to
come
by
in
the
united
states
i
am
beginning
to
wonder
if
i
should
move
to
belgium
just
to
be
able
to
drink
cantillon
all
the
time
seriously
o
easily
one
of
the
best
sours
out
there
the
sourness
is
strong
but
if
you
can
get
by
it
you
are
in
for
a
treat
the
fruit
is
a
perfect
complement
to
all
that
funky
goodness
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
ontap
in
a
few
days
dwithout
question
one
of
the
finest
fruit
sours
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
i
honestly
can
find
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
if
this
could
be
my
summertime
lawn
mower
beer
it
would
a
refreshingly
tasty
tart
flavourful
and
satisfying
brew
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
it
was
6
years
old
and
it
was
a
sour
bomb
the
fruit
was
barely
kicking
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
i
would
have
to
say
i
prefer
the
fresh
bottles
for
the
great
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
my
favorite
fruit
lambic
to
date
flavor
is
delicioustart
and
fruity
with
hints
of
peach
sourness
hitting
the
sides
of
the
tongue
very
bright
and
fresh
and
the
tartness
doesnt
overpower
the
palate
the
apricot
gets
a
bit
lost
after
a
few
sips
but
thats
to
be
expected
excellently
carbonated
the
light
body
glazes
the
palate
with
ease
just
a
wellcrafted
beer
fou
foune
is
a
cantillon
sour
at
its
finest
o
i
was
really
glad
to
have
stumbled
upon
this
beer
and
was
happy
to
give
it
a
try
would
definitely
have
again
1010
theres
a
nearly
perfect
amount
of
effervescence
to
this
beer
the
active
carbonation
really
assists
with
the
acidity
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
ever
had
i
still
cant
believe
that
a
kc
beer
bar
got
in
at
least
a
halfcase
of
fou
foune
i
consider
myself
very
very
lucky
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
beer
its
one
of
the
rare
instances
in
the
beer
world
that
lives
up
to
every
bit
of
its
hype
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
o
what
can
i
say
my
introduction
to
cantillon
brews
was
a
success
i
use
to
think
in
my
younger
days
that
lindemans
was
the
essence
of
what
a
lambic
should
be
i
realized
later
that
beers
should
pull
their
greatness
from
natural
ingredients
and
not
added
sugar
cantillon
really
shows
that
natural
ingredients
can
come
together
to
make
a
beer
that
really
puts
the
fruit
it
was
aged
with
in
the
forefront
the
feel
is
good
nice
crisp
and
light
body
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
the
real
deal
its
easily
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
sours
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
peaches
apricot
and
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
peaches
apricot
and
a
slight
tart
note
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
is
nothing
short
of
excellent
everyone
at
the
tasting
including
myself
agreed
that
this
was
one
of
the
top
5
beers
out
of
45
that
we
tasted
during
the
night
the
aroma
was
quite
inviting
and
pleasant
on
the
nose
the
flavor
was
very
complex
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
making
this
one
really
easy
to
drink
this
one
even
looked
quite
nice
as
well
for
a
lambic
really
glad
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
sitting
in
my
cellar
to
see
how
it
develops
over
time
definitely
get
this
on
your
palate
if
you
have
not
before
it
is
definitely
worth
trading
for
without
a
doubt
d
great
taste
it
is
a
sipper
at
becomes
alot
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
overall
great
poured
clear
orange
golden
color
with
minimal
fizzy
white
head
that
diminished
slowly
with
fair
lacing
good
tart
apricot
yeasty
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
tingly
sticky
texture
and
soft
carbonation
moderate
to
heavy
funky
fruit
flavor
with
a
solid
tart
fruit
and
small
alcohol

of
moderate
to
long
duration
this
is
a
standout
lambic
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
after
swallowing
another
absolutely
wonderful
beer
from
cantillon
excellent

great
use

minimal
ring
of

scent
brings
a

aggressively
with
appricot
being
backed
by
peach
a
fresh
malted

profile
peeks
through
along
with
some
musty
earthyness
taste
is
quite
impressive
sour
and
tart
without
becoming
overly
puckering
strong
fruit
notes
without
being
too
sweet

supported
by
notes
of
peach
and
even
a
touch
of
berry
grains
are
musty
and
lightly
damp
but
freshly
dried
medium
bodied
great
carbonation
level
great
great
beer
from
cantillon
bold
fruit
notes
and
n
control
tartness
its
was
a
true
pleasure
to
finally
sample
the
iconic
fou
foune
from
cantillon
and
it
was
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
that
came
per
ounce
one
to
sip
and
savor
in
my
opinion
tried
on
bottle
and
tap
i
prefered
the
tap
version
as
the
apricots
were
so
intense
in
the
aroma
as
the
bottle
had
more
funk
and
barnyard
apricot
lemon
and
peach
flavors
moderate
acidity
for
a
cantillon
the
palate
could
be
drier
and
the
carbonation
more
lively
but
this
a
stellar
offering
by
cantillon
once
again
o
simply
put
this
is
the
best
blended
lambic
i
have
ever
had
this
will
be
a
tuff
one
to
beat
as
well
this
is
also
the
most
refreshing
sour
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
bravo
o
i
really
love
this
the
apricot
goes
along
perfectly
with
all
the
funky
earthy
flavors
and
sourness
of
the
lambic
absolutely
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
another
incredible
creation
from
cantillon
hazy
orange
pour
with
much
carbonation
the
aroma
is
out
of
control
floral
sour
and
funky
im
getting
peaches
more
than
apricots
but
the
idea
is
there
and
well
expressed
stone
fruits
shall
we
say
unbelievable
i
want
this
inside
me
and
so
i
do
the
sour
and
funk
are
so
complimentary
to
the
fruit
that
its
hard
to
discern
the
flavors
from
one
another
it
marries
so
well
as
to
make
them
indistinguishable
nearly
as
separate
flavors
damn
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
an
inspiration
for
these
clearly
darkening
times
overall
this
beer
was
very
good
but
the
hand
pumpcask
serving
seems
t
have
curtailed
the
sour
acetic
character
a
bit
the
result
s
a
well
balanced
softer
beer
but
i
prefer
the
more
tart
funky
bottle
and
regular
tap
version
o
ive
been
blown
away
by
this
beer
every
time
i
have
it
hands
down
the
best
brew
ive
ever
had
from
cantillon
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
i
cant
say
enough
about
how
amazing
this
brew
is
get
some
in
your
body
any
way
possible
all
of
these
things
that
i
speak
of
seem
to
work
in
harmony
with
each
other
and
not
overtake
one
another
very
light
and
delicate
and
very
refreshing
and
balanced
i
would
love
to
drink
one
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
shared
a
glass
with
my
brother
whose
beer
of
choice
is
bud
light
lime
and
he
loved
it
now
he
loves
lambics
and
sours
and
because
of
this
beer
he
went
and
bought
a
case
of
cuvee
rene
thanks
fou
foune
cause
you
may
have
turned
someone
from
the
dark
side
served
slightly
chilled
a
huge
head
appeared
on
a
fast
pour
decanted
into
one
glass
to
share
between
the
three
of
us
hard
to
tell
how
much
sediment
was
left
but
i
would
guess
12
ounces
color
was
a
light
yellow
with
a
gold
hue
up
to
the
light
with
a
couple
tiny
bits
of
sediment
swimming
around
smell
was
sharp
fruit
and
some
vinegar
described
by
ari
as
smelling
a
peach
pit
notes
of
peach
and
apricot
skin
were
very
evident
the
taste
was
an
intense
combination
of
resiny
sour
apricot
and
fruity
acidity
while
much
funk
was
almost
nowhere
to
be
found
unnoticeable
alcohol
on
the
palate
and
finish
but
a
slight
burn
from
the
acidity
was
present
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
im
sure
it
would
have
been
a
cinch
for
any
of
us
to
drink
over
a
liter
of
this
ive
had
foufoune
a
few
times
many
courtesy
of
weisguy
including
a
fresh
750
of
the
2010
bottling
but
this
bottle
stood
out
as
nearly
a
whole
nother
beer
than
what
i
tasted
before
much
more
fruit
on
the
nose
and
tongue
while
the
balanced
acidity
made
for
a
very
enjoyable
lambic
375ml
bottle
with
japanese
label
on
back
i
believe
it
was
09
thanks
kyle
for
this
one
this
was
not
my
first
time
having
this
beer
but
this
bottle
was
exceptionally
good
poured
a
nice
hazy
golden
orange
unbeleiveable
aromas
of
peaches
and
apricots
unlike
any
other
fruit
cantillon
i
have
had
before
great
acidity
definitely
a
little
cantillon
funk
but
very
mild
just
like
the
aromas
the
flavor
was
spot
on
apricots
and
other
stone
fruits
very
enjoyable
o
no
disappointment
here
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
while
cantillon
keeps
supplying
a
consistent
clean
and
funky
brew
that
leaves
no
doubt
nor
regrets
drinkability
and
overall
i
can
only
drink
one
glass
of
any
sour
beer
at
a
session
and
lambics
not
my
favorite
style
however
this
beer
is
complex
and
mixes
the
sweetness
of
apricots
and
the
sour
of
a
lambic
well
a
world
class
beer
notes
this
is
a
good
take
on
a
lambic
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
despite
the
complexity
of
the
apricot
sourness
imparted
by
the
wild
yeast
and
medicinal
notes
its
all
balanced
very
well
a
respectable
entry
by
cantillon
id
get
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
bracingly
sour
and
tightens
up
your
jaw
finish
of
apricot
jam
this
is
really
a
two
part
flavor
of
intensely
sour
unripe
apricots
and
then
bright
and
soft
ripe
apricots
oh
but
how
much
flavor
there
is
any
kind
of
funkiness
is
sort
of
drowned
out
overall
definitely
up
there
among
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
encountered
wonderfully
complex
fruity
and
refreshing
definitely
will
get
this
every
opportunity
i
get
the
feel
is
light
and
spritzy
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
is
a
favorite
as
it
is
so
enjoyable
in
every
aspect
another
example
of
cantillons
incredible
proficiency
in
fruit
lambic
production
o
well
what
else
can
you
say
another
world
class
beer
from
cantillon
light
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
draft
may
be
a
lot
less
carbonated
then
from
bottle
so
ill
have
to
track
down
a
bottle
for
comparison
refreshing
easy
to
drink
lambic
with
mild
but
present
tartness
sweet
fruits
and
earthy
funk
well
made
beer
as
much
as
i
liked
this
i
cant
justify
spending
the
extra
10
to
12
over
gueze
kriek
or
iris
its
really
not
better
than
them
and
imo
iris
is
still
the
best
one
out
there
with
pardonable
exaggeration
i
would
say
fou
foune
has
all
the
characteristics
of
the
perfect
beer
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
pretty
average
the
sourness
destroys
the
palate
so
it
makes
having
more
than
one
a
bit
of
a
chore
overall
a
very
good
brew
not
in
my
top
10
sours
but
very
solid
skal
serving
type
ontap
this
is
truly
a
balanced
and
highly
enjoyable
lambic
its
also
somewhat
rare
around
these
parts
drinkability
is
great
like
usual
nice
sourness
with
a
good
helping
of
fruit
and
funk
this
ontap
version
seemed
to
have
some
extra
grassy
bitterness
to
it
which
i
liked
quite
a
bit
it
helped
to
bring
out
some
of
the
earthier
and
more
floral
aspects
of
the
beer
anyways
i
hope
i
get
to
see
this
beer
ontap
again
some
day
excellent
stuff
this
is
my
first
review
on
ba
i
waited
quite
some
time
before
i
decided
to
start
reviewing
beer
i
waited
until
i
had
a
better
trained
pallet
and
understanding
of
beer
so
enough
about
me
lets
talk
about
this
wonderful
delight
known
as
fou
foune
i
shared
a
2010
with
shades
of
gray
who
so
graciously
opened
my
eyes
to
many
cantillons
first
the
look
of
this
beer
was
very
appetizing
its
an
burnt
orangeish
color
and
leaves
a
very
nice
head
full
of
lacing
smell
is
very
fruity
definitely
strong
apricot
notes
and
some
funk
taste
wow
im
blown
away
very
tart
as
to
be
expected
just
a
perfect
mesh
of
carbonation
tart
apricot
and
some
what
earthy
in
a
very
good
way
the
only
bad
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
it
left
me
wanting
more
extremely
quenching
to
the
taste
buds
again
big
thanks
to
shades
of
gray
notes
this
beer
got
better
and
more
fruity
as
it
warmed
so
i
would
recommend
drinking
it
at
cellar
temp
at
least
room
temp
might
be
even
more
beneficial
d
ive
experienced
one
or
two
offerings
in
my
time
so
far
that
have
redefined
what
i
thought
beer
could
be
and
how
incredible
it
could
taste
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
is
one
of
those
offerings
its
a
beer
that
im
almost
scared
to
finish
for
fear
of
not
know
when
itll
grace
my
lips
again
worth
all
the
accolades
it
receives
a
once
in
a
lifetime
drink
pours
a
golden
orange
honestly
it
is
the
color
of
an
apricot
the
beer
has
a
big
head
that
leaves
some
lace
the
aroma
is
lots
of
barnyardiness
but
with
a
lot
of
apricot
fruitiness
in
there
as
well
with
some
both
clean
and
dirty
laundry
the
flavor
smacks
you
in
the
face
right
away
with
apricot
fresh
delicious
apricots
the
beer
is
very
very
sour
its
also
really
dry
with
a
dryness
akin
to
say
a
brut
the
fruitiness
continues
with
some
lemon
rind
earthy
on
sour
notes
dominantly
this
beer
is
packed
with
sourness
and
apricot
flavor
the
palate
is
fizzy
but
remarkably
full
and
easy
to
drink
just
one
damn
fine
beer
d
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
fou
foune
even
though
im
not
an
apricot
fan
this
is
still
a
great
brew
apricot
flavors
are
pretty
mild
overall
which
makes
it
work
very
well
with
my
palate
the
more
it
warms
the
more
it
smooths
out
which
adds
another
appealing
dimension
to
this
fine
elixir
it
encompasses
all
the
great
lambic
qualities
ive
come
to
expect
form
the
folks
at
cantillon
b

2009
bottle
served
in
a
white
wine
glass
at
room
temp
pours
a
nice
slight
thick
orangegold
with
a
thin
ring
of
white
bubbles
persisting
beautiful
nose
full
of
peaches
apricots
slight
funky
brett
really
round
in
the
nose
like
most
cantillon
its
fairly
bracing
and
hard
in
the
mouth
really
big
peach
apricot
presence
full
and
round
vinous
and
white
wine
like
the
fruit
is
great
at
this
age
but
a
hard
slightly
metallic
age
tells
me
this
one
would
likely
get
better
with
some
years
on
it
very
enjoyable
kinda
like
a
slightly
more
acidic
duck
duck
gooze
cantillon
makes
incredible
beer
while
i
dont
believe
this
one
will
supplant
st
lamvinus
as
my
favorite
its
not
too
far
off
its
chock
full
of
flavor
and
is
very
deep
and
complex
it
will
challenge
even
the
most
sophisticated
palate
if
you
happen
to
run
across
one
of
these
jump
on
the
opportunity
its
worth
at
least
one
purchase
even
with
the
steep
price
tag
paired
exquisitely
well
with
triplecreme
cheeses
not
only
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
probably
the
best
beer
cheese
pairing
ive
ever
had
overall
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
a
bit
weak
of
aroma
but
what
is
there
is
nice
fairly
sweet
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
bottle
2008
vintage
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
awesome
with
definite
ntoes
of
apricot
along
with
some
acidity
and
funkiness
light
mouthfeel
with
some
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
really
nice
with
a
balance
of
fruit
notes
apricot
grapefruit
and
sour
acidity
this
one
does
leaves
you
puckering
a
bit
but
not
overly
so
overall
a
really
good
beer
and
one
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
very
puckering
in
the
mouth
i
get
small
hints
of
apricot
and
tons
of
acidity
enough
to
rip
away
the
enamel
on
your
teeth
as
the
beer
dries
a
cheese
aftertaste
is
left
with
the
puckering
sourness
i
was
puckering
a
lot
as
i
drank
more
and
more
of
fou
foune
but
i
still
liked
it
overall
d
love
this
but
its
not
like
you
can
session
it
without
burning
out
your
taste
buds
great
stuff
though
want
to
have
it
again
there
is
little
sweetness
to
the
flavor
but
a
lot
of
apricot
the
finish
is
dry
and
sour
the
coat
is
sweet
and
fruity
but
not
oppressive
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
fine
cantillon
product
i
wish
i
had
more
of
it
d
the
sourness
and
acidity
will
limit
the
drinkability
for
sure
however
i
had
a
full
bottle
between
us
and
i
didnt
have
any
problems
my
taste
buds
were
completely
destroyed
afterwards
but
man
did
i
ever
love
these
brews
the
05
was
better
due
to
the
intense
sourness
but
the
09
was
definitely
much
more
fruity
d
for
me
à
little
bit
to
sour
but
its
à
awesome
brew
a
tasty
lambic
but
this
is
hugely
sour
d
i
dont
know
how
much
more
than
one
glass
i
would
want
it
seems
to
be
the
perfect
amount
because
of
how
sour
it
is
i
can
confidently
say
this
is
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
ever
had
750ml
corked
and
capped
bottle
poured
a
translucent
straw
gold
with
a
bright
white
frothycreamy
head
nose
reveals
apricots
grapefruit
and
cork
taste
is
extremely
salty
some
apricot
peaks
out
in
the
flavor
profile
however
it
is
very
much
masked
by
the
saltiness
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
refreshing
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
acidity
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
this
is
delicious
extremely
tasty
and
really
quite
refreshing
this
is
one
lambic
i
could
drink
all
day
probably
my
favorite
cantillon
to
date
reminds
me
of
cascades
the
vine
to
some
degree
d
a
bit
of
rotgut
ensues
from
the
acidity
in
this
beer
great
brew
but
its
a
sipper
and
definitely
best
split
a
few
ways
id
say
thanks
again
adam
overall
i
want
to
find
cases
of
this
stuff
so
i
can
drink
it
constantly
thanks
adam
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
finally
try
this
one
now
i
want
more
d
this
beer
grows
on
me
more
each
time
i
have
it
a
little
past
its
prime
reviewed
on
04042010
d
extremely
drinkable
sour
definitely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
and
doesnt
disappoint
tons
of
complexity
here
with
new
flavors
being
discovered
throughout
the
bottle
matches
my
experience
with
other
cantillons
ive
had
very
good
coldcool
but
they
turn
into
simply
amazing
with
a
little
bit
of
warmth
too
hard
to
wait
for
them
to
warm
up
from
the
start
for
me
cant
wait
to
dig
in
but
definitely
worth
it
although
discovering
new
aspects
as
the
temperature
changes
has
something
to
say
for
it
too
d
fairly
high
prob
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
awesome
great
fruit
tartness
funk
an
awesome
wildsour
beer
with
tons
of
great
fruit
flavors
wish
i
could
drink
tons
of
this
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
and
hard
to
get
the
nose
is
pure
fucking
apricots
ridiculously
fresh
and
fruity
the
dried
apricot
character
is
excellent
not
as
oaky
and
tannic
as
the
2009
vintage
this
smells
great
fresh
again
a
great
clean
lemony
sourness
with
a
beautiful
fruit
character
this
is
a
nice
fruity
vintage
wow
taste
on
this
is
very
tart
and
sour
its
crazy
even
though
the
sour
is
so
mouth
puckering
its
really
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
each
sip
just
makes
you
want
more
and
more
of
it
super
dry
finish
the
09
had
the
most
fruit
flavor
as
youd
expect
and
the
01
was
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
it
was
crazy
no
way
you
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
yourself
but
amazing
for
a
tasting
as
i
admitted
to
my
bartender
when
i
ordered
it
i
have
no
idea
how
to
truly
properly
pronounce
this
beers
name
let
alone
attempt
to
define
it
i
was
just
excited
to
see
such
a
touted
lambic
on
draught
in
my
neck
o
the
woods
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
straw
with
a
tall
head
of
deeply
longevitous
yeah
i
said
it
now
if
only
more
people
would
use
it
white
froth
as
it
died
away
lingering
on
as
the
worst
people
tend
to
it
left
some
nebulous
lacing
behind
the
smell
wafting
to
me
is
of
banana
peach
funk
flowers
pretty
ones
i
do
believe
and
a
surprisingly
healthy
amount
of
vanilla
its
like
brewers
potpourri
the
taste
doesnt
bring
this
high
esteem
down
any
either
tart
berries
sour
peach
apple
and
grape
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
and
a
slight
hint
of
oak
or
some
kind
o
wood
anyway
round
out
the
puckering
flavor
profile
so
this
is
a
true
belgian
lambic
eh
im
impressed
the
body
is
on
the
lightest
end
of
the
medium
subspectrum
with
a
sharp
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
i
may
not
be
able
to
guzzle
this
tart
monster
but
i
sure
as
hell
want
to
get
some
750ml
bottle
2008
version
the
beer
pours
dark
peacy
with
a
much
darker
center
the
head
is
white
rises
about
a
finger
and
is
gone
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
on
the
lighter
side
light
tart
fruits
mixed
with
sourness
not
overpowering
in
either
regard
so
its
balanced
giving
some
of
what
you
look
for
in
a
fruit
lambic
holy
moses
thats
one
sour
beer
didnt
think
it
would
be
that
tart
from
the
aroma
its
got
a
huge
tart
bite
sour
not
a
mucky
horse
blanker
leather
like
a
lot
of
cantillons
here
you
get
a
lot
more
of
the
fruit
not
sweetness
but
the
actual
taste
of
apricots
on
the
finish
super
balanced
and
flavorful
the
feel
is
great
sticks
to
the
mouth
very
tannic
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
it
gives
me
everything
i
love
about
a
lambic
sourness
funk
but
balanced
enough
that
you
can
drink
this
all
day
while
at
the
same
time
not
being
such
a
fruit
beer
thats
its
super
sweet
or
dominated
by
the
apricot
overall
one
of
my
favorite
lambics
right
up
there
with
blabear
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
am
quite
sad
that
this
is
being
discontinued
a
one
time
pleasure
i
guess
thanks
to
luk13
for
the
bottle
in
a
trade
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
buttery
with
great
light
carbonation
this
is
a
sickeningly
sessionable
lambic
that
goes
down
way
too
easily
thanks
to
whoever
shared
this
at
the
first
sexual
chocolate
release
it
was
my
first
time
trying
this
fine
lambic
im
very
sad
to
know
that
this
one
will
soon
be
retired
hazy
bright
gold
pour
with
thin
fizzy
off
white
head
apricot
aroma
leather
horse
blanket
apricot
and
mango
very
tart
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
appearance
is
a
cloudy
hazy
pale
straw
gold
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
ill
be
smelling
this
beer
all
night
long
after
i
leave
here
extremely
sharp
acidic
and
funky
with
mild
apricot
fruit
sweetness
and
cheesy
funk
its
hard
to
stop
smelling
this
and
actually
taste
it
flavor
starts
initially
apricot
and
oak
sweet
before
becoming
overwhelmed
by
acidic
and
vinegary
sweetness
which
actually
finds
a
way
to
become
even
sharper
and
more
nasty
funky
in
the
finish
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
novice
to
the
style
and
maybe
not
the
best
bottle
to
represent
this
particular
beer
but
for
a
complex
fruity
and
sour
lambic
this
is
near
impeccable
j
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
since
i
cant
seem
to
find
it
in
bottles
in
my
area
since
the
apricots
are
so
subtle
overall
this
is
probably
best
described
as
a
slightly
sweeter
version
of
their
classic
gueuze
d
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
cantillon
or
otherwise
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
and
im
glad
to
have
another
bottle
wow
the
most
tart
beer
ive
ever
had
ive
had
a
lot
of
sours
krieks
gueuzes
lambics
etc
this
definitely
takes
the
cake
for
the
biggest
tart
factor
very
impressed
though
overall
with
the
flavor
besides
the
rediculous
amount
of
puckering
tart
theres
really
no
apricot
noticeable
anymore
not
that
it
hurts
the
flavor
one
bit
imo
the
huge
funkiness
comes
in
after
a
couple
seconds
and
has
a
long
lasting
aftertaste
leaves
a
sweet
and
enjoyable
flavor
on
the
lips
for
a
few
minutes
as
well
high
carbonation
tart
lemoncitrus
light
body
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
funkiness
really
comes
in
even
bigger
wow
what
an
extrordinary
off
the
wall
beer
d
extremely
i
can
easily
do
a
few
of
these
but
they
ran
out
shortly
after
5
0
razorbladelike
cutting
sour
notes
on
the
palate
dry
and
prickly
and
almost
needlelike
dusty
hay
funky
fruity
and
absolutely
delightful
try
it
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
slight
sulfur
tastes
kind
of
like
flowers
im
not
picking
up
on
the
fruit
so
much
its
pretty
sour
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
overall
drinkability
is
good
and
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
deliciously
mouth
puckering
great
sour
middle
and
finish
so
fruity
and
delicious
apricot
really
takes
the
lead
with
oak
later
on
good
acidity
levels
and
perfect
carbonation
not
nearly
as
thin
as
majority
of
sours
out
there
and
it
really
helps
that
out
but
hell
it
is
cantillon
little
heart
burn
kicking
in
from
the
acidity
and
funky
undertones
could
drink
this
for
hours
on
end
d
very
nice
drinkability
although
anything
over
10oz
or
so
might
get
to
be
a
little
much
overall
absolutely
fantastic
in
my
opinion
blew
saint
lamnivus
which
we
had
sidebyside
out
of
the
water
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
it
just
was
a
bit
too
much
on
the
fruit
for
me
still
very
glad
i
tried
it
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
although
its
not
quite
as
impressive
as
some
other
cantillon
offerings
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
this
is
definitely
more
of
a
summer
beer
not
the
most
impressive
beer
from
cantillon
but
still
very
tasty
a
little
more
expensive
than
id
like
but
a
nice
beer
glad
to
try
it
bottle
poured
a
pale
hazy
yellow
color
lambic
with
a
huge
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
great
retention
aroma
of
sour
and
tart
notes
are
dominant
and
somewhat
offset
by
some
light
fruity
apricot
taste
is
a
wonderful
mix
between
some
light
apricot
some
tart
and
sour
notes
with
some
well
balanced
acidity
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
very
well
made
with
a
great
balance
between
some
tart
notes
with
some
fruit
and
well
balanced
acidity
this
may
well
me
my
favourite
fruit
lambic
it
transports
me
to
a
different
place
and
whispers
softly
in
my
ear
a
treat
that
i
need
to
get
more
of
drinkability
high
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
cantillons
right
behind
blaeber
this
glass
is
disappearing
quickly
but
the
overall
palate
and
sense
destroying
nature
of
it
would
make
me
want
to
limit
my
intake
still
seriously
drinkable
for
the
style
d
really
enjoying
this
one
but
it
is
a
sipper
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
tart
making
one
salivate
but
easy
drinking
and
perhaps
even
refreshing
if
given
the
proper
setting
d
pretty
impressive
offering
from
cantillon
the
flavor
really
carries
the
day
despite
some
flaws
in
the
mouthfeel
department
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
an
excellent
pairing
with
monks
pomme
frites
odd
and
not
altogether
enjoyable
beer
i
would
run
back
to
the
rose
de
gambrinus
st
lamvinus
iris
or
blabaer
before
hitting
this
one
up
again
d
good
this
one
was
served
in
a
small
proper
cantillon
glass
i
could
easily
sit
back
and
enjoy
an
entire
bottle
though
one
of
my
favorite
sours
ill
definitely
be
buying
some
of
these
bottles
to
throw
in
the
basement
outstanding
d
a
great
beer
that
is
best
shared
with
others
but
i
will
enjoy
a
few
glasses
for
myself
a
few
more
years
on
this
beer
will
do
wonders
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
nice
dry
finish
that
makes
it
incredibly
drinkable
the
flavor
is
sharply
sour
but
the
finish
is
dry
and
compliments
the
flavors
well
this
was
another
wonderful
beer
from
cantillon
they
are
still
one
of
the
top
breweries
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
d
not
my
favorite
from
cantillon
but
i
do
like
this
to
change
it
up
every
now
and
then
looking
forward
to
trying
the
2009
release
here
soon
d
this
goes
down
too
quickly
and
should
be
savored
d
cantillon
makes
some
bad
ass
lambics
and
this
one
is
no
exception
this
is
what
a
real
fruit
lambic
tastes
like
worth
getting
your
hands
on
to
try
d
ive
had
this
beer
once
before
but
i
was
still
amazed
over
how
sour
it
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
tried
all
in
all
its
a
great
beer
wonderful
fruity
character
and
intense
rustic
flavors
drinkability
is
great
truly
sour
but
very
tasty
the
acidic
notes
are
balanced
by
a
healthy
dose
of
funk
all
under
a
light
fruit
banner
only
a
cantillon
brew
can
reach
the
level
of
something
this
complex
yet
so
drinkable
cheers
another
wonderful
lambic
from
cantillon
this
is
what
a
fruit
lambic
should
be
not
artificial
flavor
and
syrup
that
so
many
other
examples
are
highly
recommended
i
have
to
give
a
big
thanks
to
biggreen
for
sharing
this
with
armock
and
me
i
await
with
interest
what
they
are
going
to
try
next
d
glorious
torture
it
is
insane
how
your
throat
collapses
amazing
beer
cantillon
is
nothing
short
of
an
amazing
world
class
brewery
if
you
see
their
beer
you
buy
it
crisp
body
is
delicately
carbonated
with
a
nice
dry
finish
another
amazing
lambic
from
cantillon
overall
yup
after
this
i
am
loading
up
on
a
few
bottles
for
my
cellar
its
amazing
how
people
go
nuts
over
the
new
rarest
sours
yet
forget
about
cantillon
they
easily
make
the
best
and
most
consistent
sours
in
the
world
if
your
a
sourhead
and
have
been
following
all
the
hype
behind
american
sours
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
this
up

about

the

quality
of

is
divine
paired
with
the
apricots
in
this
a
joy
to
inahale
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
the
sourness
i
adore
from
cantillon
paired
with
a
complex
fruitiness
what
is
biting
into
a
fresh
lemon
at
one
moment
tastes
like
sour
apricots
the
next
moment
or
orange

if
i
dare
sayso
this
is
one
of
the
best
authentic
authentic
fruit
lambics
i
have
tasted
body
is
light
with
tight
medium
carbonatioon
that
leaves
me
puckered
as
sour
as
this
is
the
fruit
really
enhances
everything
from
aroma
to
drinkability
lasting
tart
apricot
finish
keeps
me
going
back
for
another
sip
exceptional
light
refreshing
and
has
a
great
sour
aftertaste
very
nice
beer
for
its
style
cantillon
makes
great
beer
feel
is
crisp
and
acidic
but
just
slightly
thin
carbonation
is
quite
mild
keep
in
mind
that
we
had
to
let
this
sit
for
nearly
ten
minutes
to
warm
up
d
acidic
and
sour
but
and
easy
drink
on
the
patio
on
a
hot
day
d
not
something
id
drink
heaps
of
but
something
id
want
to
have
on
hand
every
now
and
then
tap
at
toro
1st
annv
must
of
been
a
half
barrel
as
its
lasted
a
couple
days
very
excited
to
try
because
i
just
bought
a
bottle
and
wanted
to
see
how
long
to
age
it
id
say
23
years
in
bottle
will
be
perfect
had
next
to
beatification
batch
2
which
was
much
more
sour
and
it
was
great
to
go
back
and
forth
between
the
2
apricots
come
thru
but
only
when
it
warmed
up
and
on
the
super
long
finish
a
femenin
brew
but
personaly
i
enjoyed
this
cold
as
it
was
so
refreshing
too
bad
its
not
available
all
the
time
and
around
10
for
a
750
because
it
is
the
perfect
summer
brew
very
nice
and
again
a
pleasure
to
have
a
shot
at
this
on
draft
light
bodied
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
slightly
puckering
mouthfeel
bracing
sourness
at
first
that
gives
way
to
a
puckering
fruity
apricot
flavor
dry
finish
with
occasional
notes
of
musty
wet
barrel
slightly
tannic
with
succulent
apricot
pits
stems
and
fruit
after
getting
acclimated
to
the
fairly
intense
sourness
this
was
an
absolute
dream
excuse
me
while
i
polish
off
the
bottle
had
this
immediately
after
having
an
upland
blueberry
no
comparison
this
place
is
still
far
and
away
better
at
producing
any
kind
of
fruit
lambics
than
anything
here
in
the
states
plus
this
stuff
is
available
here
on
my
local
liquor
store
shelf
why
again
am
i
trading
rare
beers
for
sours
produced
here
when
this
stuff
is
readily
available
a
treasure
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
the
barest
head
glows
in
the
glass
smells
very
sour
and
acetic
with
some
savorysalty
notes
and
pure
zingy
apricot
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
awesome
sour
salty
and
with
absolutely
vibrant
apricot
flavors
tangy
and
sweet
notes
with
some
light
funkbarnyard
right
at
the
end
wonderfully
blanced
and
laser
like
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
juicy
clean
and
absolutely
knifelike
in
how
it
cuts
through
the
palate
delicious
as
always
i
think
this
is
one
of
their
better
lambics
the
apricot
really
lends
itself
to
the
style
solid
beer
get
if
you
can
drinkable
beer
a
little
less
biting
than
some
cantillons
such
as
the
kriek
d
if
you
didnt
take
another
sip
after
the
first
one
you
would
swear
this
is
undrinkable
as
i
said
earlier
as
it
warmed
up
it
really
came
into
its
own
i
find
it
really
hard
not
to
like
anything
from
cantillon
not
that
im
trying
to
hate
it
well
done
again
mr
van
roy
i
only
wish
i
had
another
bottle
for
a
beer
with
such
a
strong
fruit
component
its
just
too
dry
i
am
not
sure
why
but
its
a
bit
offputting
drinkability
is
astronomical
i
had
16
ounces
and
felt
like
i
hadnt
even
gotten
a
good
start
could
have
finished
an
entire
bottle
and
then
started
on
the
next
the
aroma
was
beautiful
rich
sour
funkiness
with
huge
touches
of
apricot
mixed
in
light
peppery
and
spice
notes
come
through
as
it
warms
but
the
sour
funk
was
so
hardcore
the
flavor
was
puckeringly
good
rich
apricot
and
apple
vinegar
sour
notes
are
all
over
this
one
as
it
warms
like
barrel
notes
lots
of
spice
and
a
long
drawn
out
and
very
dry
super
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
this
was
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
had
worth
the
wait
drinkability
after
having
a
few
ounces
of
this
the
sourness
became
less
shocking
and
more
pleasant
but
after
completing
the
glass
over
a
long
period
i
had
enough
for
the
session
for
a
lambic
and
its
funkiness
this
drinks
incredibly
well
i
will
most
likely
seek
this
out
whenever
possible
d
if
youre
craving
sour
this
does
the
trick
worth
every
one
of
the
25
it
costs
extremely
sour
but
easily
drinkable
for
someone
versed
in
lambics
would
buy
again

i
think
the
apricot
sweetness
would
disappear
completely
with
any
additional
age
put
on
this
one
but
the
sharpness
and
dryness
would
continue
to
develop
its
already
fairly
sharp
and
dry
so
who
knows
what
extremes
it
could
reach
definitely
not
a
low
class
sweet
fruit
lambic
this
is
a
winner
drinkability
this
about
pushed
my
limits
of
sourness
it
tore
up
my
stomach
as
well
only
for
the
people
who
can
tolerate
extreme
amounts
of
citric
acid
tasted
just
fine
but
hard
to
complete
an
entire
bottle
for
me
at
least
wow
this
is
a
seriously
funky
and
acidic
lambic
that
is
pretty
harsh
on
the
taste
buds
very
tasty
stuff
had
this
on
tap
at
zwanze
day
and
had
to
bump
up
the
taste
score
this
stuff
is
really
great
amazingly
drinkable
would
love
to
have
this
consistently
especially
in
the
summer
2011
fresh
this
one
is
less
fruity
and
slightly
more
sour
than
the
previous
two
vintages
not
as
interesting
to
me
as
the
09
and
10
batches
still
very
good
d
honestly
as
awesome
as
this
brew
is
one
and
done
poured
into
an
ebs
snifter
a
pale
yellow
with
some
slight
haze
and
a
thin
quickly
dissapating
head
aroma
is
definite
cantillon
tart
sour
fruit
with
some
definite
funk
in
there
flavor
is
of
the
tartest
apricots
i
could
ever
imagine
this
one
is
one
of
the
most
puckering
beers
i
have
ever
tried
very
dry
and
refreshing
though
one
is
an
experience
interesting
and
very
good
lambic
pours
a
nice
clean
yellowlight
orangey
color
with
a
slim
stark
white
head
nose
is
pure
cantillon
lambic
funk
with
some
slight
fruit
taste
follows
with
a
very
present
apricot
flavor
hidden
behind
a
wonderful
blanket
of
tart
barnyard
funk
really
impressed
with
the
noticeable
apricot
in
here
mouthfeel
is
uber
dry
and
super
tart
drinkability
is
very
fine
for
the
style
overall
this
is
defenitely
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
cantillon
a
very
good
offering
i
just
wish
the
goddamn
price
was
a
little
nicer
very
good
lambic
strongly
recommended
for
all
the
sour
heads
out
there
great
still
one
of
my
favorite
cantillon
beers
how
i
need
to
get
some
more
bottles
im
also
wavering
between
a
4
5
and
5
for
flavor
i
think
a
fresh
bottle
might
bump
the
taste
score
to
that
elusive
5
pucker
up
drinkablity
is
precious
if
youve
come
this
far
and
shelled
out
the
dough
30
in
my
town
then
youll
probably
wish
youd
be
able
to
drink
another
bottle
chances
are
you
cant
im
saving
the
dregs
for
homebrew
if
i
come
close
ill
drink
it
all
day
long
albeit
not
terribly
quickly
this
is
as
sour
as
it
gets
a
special
vintage
bottling
indeed
popped
the
cork
on
this
bottle
to
find
out
that
it
was
from
early
2006
poured
this
one
into
a
cantillon
glass
to
a
bright
golden
color
similar
to
what
you
would
get
in
a
pilsner
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
after
about
a
minute
to
just
cover
the
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
quite
exceptional
with
a
slight
funk
fading
into
a
great
apricot
sweetness
almost
exactly
what
i
expected
it
to
be
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
even
better
than
the
aroma
right
up
front
you
get
a
great
dryness
that
quickly
fades
into
a
mouth
puckering
sourness
this
eventually
turns
tart
and
the
after
taste
gives
you
the
apricot
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
considering
the
beers
color
with
lively
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
a
geuezelambic
that
would
please
connoisseurs
and
novices
alike
although
the
price
was
a
bit
high
this
was
well
worth
it
a
wonderful
fruit
lambic
with
some
of
the
most
intense
sour
flavors
ive
ever
had
in
a
beer
this
may
be
cantillons
sourest
dope
d
1
bomber
is
plenty
for
anyone
i
would
guess
really
extreme
flavor
and
smoothing
sourness
price
is
a
little
steep
to
justify
75
cl
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
cloudy
body
with
a
slight
head
on
the
first
pour
the
second
pour
gave
a
much
thicker
head
the
nose
was
fantastic
with
solid
earthy
funky
notes
the
taste
was
also
funky
and
earthy
but
nicely
sweet
with
a
touch
of
acid
on
the
backend
overall
a
fantastic
beer
another
one
from
cantillon
not
a
pedestrian
beer
full
flavored
and
what
one
would
expect
if
you
like
this
style
you
will
like
the
fou
foune
it
is
exceptional
i
generally
like
my
lambics
straightup
no
fruits
or
sugars
but
ill
make
an
exception
for
this
one
this
is
great
d
very
drinkable
d
a
wonderful
sipping
lambic
with
a
bold
tartness
in
aroma
and
flavor
and
longlasting
memorable
mouthfeel
a
little
like
a
quenching
puckerinducing
lemonade
ideal
for
a
summery
day
low
abv
at
5
but
this
isnt
really
a
style
youd
want
to
drink
much
of
expensive
6
for
this
pour
but
worth
it
and
one
id
love
to
have
again
recommended
sour
apricot
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
an
apricot
kinda
peachy
too
nice
head
ample
carbonation
sourness
mellows
as
it
warms
and
the
palate
becomes
used
to
it
spicy
aromatically
soupy
and
peppery
clean
nostrils
even
feel
the
funk
palte
burns
somewhat
lingeringly
sour
but
it
also
hits
the
front
lip
this
is
a
serious
beer
wonderful
served
on
tap
during
pucker
fest
at
belmont
station
in
portland
or
another
fantastic
cantillon
beer
it
needs
more
funk
and
depth
to
be
among
the
best
still
is
ethereal
stuff
d
complex
with
great
balance
apricot
really
comes
through
as
it
warms
teases
the
palate
leaving
you
wanting
more
on
the
palate
the
apricot
is
there
but
again
subtly
integrated
into
the
gorgeously
tart
and
crisp
lambic
backbone
bonedry
as
we
expect
from
the
real
lambic
makers
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
complements
food
wonderfully
some
of
the
best
brewing
art
on
the
planet
lowish
lambic
abvs
are
a
plus
for
drinakbility
in
my
book
stirring
some
yeast
into
the
final
pours
intensified
and
added
more
yeasty
notes
i
recommend
trying
it
if
any
beer
is
worth
more
than
20750ml
this
is
one
i
just
bought
more
i
want
to
move
to
brussels
overall
a
nice
balance
between
sourness
and
fruity
and
funky
flavors
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
poured
into
a
cantillon
glass
it
was
on
my
top
3
list
to
try
when
i
saw
their
draft
list
where
else
in
the
midwest
would
i
find
this
beer
on
tap
it
was
kind
of
light
yellow
colored
hazy
and
initially
had
a
huge
head
the
smell
was
sour
and
acidic
with
a
hint
of
citrucy
fruit
the
taste
was
sour
and
tart
with
a
very
mild
apricot
flavor
it
was
awesome
i
could
have
easily
had
more
but
there
were
other
beers
to
try
a
treat
to
experience
on
tap
spuyten
d
in
bklyn
as
part
of
their
yeast
fest
of
a
week
ago
pours
soft
cloudy
tangerine
with
a
minimal
off
white
head
with
minor
lacing
funky
fruity
nose
moderatly
sour
brew
with
a
slight
nod
in
the
flavor
profile
to
the
adertised
apricots
long
lasting
sourbret
notes
linger
and
linger
in
the
mouth
pleasantly
sour
and
soft
very
tasty
stuff
delicate
and
complex
on
tap
world
class
lambic
go
get
some
poured
into
a
flute
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
head
that
settles
down
to
a
film
smells
like
the
normal
lambic
brett
funk
taste
has
crisp
lambic
tartness
the
apricots
used
in
making
this
are
hardly
tasted
in
the
beginning
but
get
a
little
stronger
towards
the
end
very
good
effervescent
mouthfeel
another
very
drinkable
lambic
from
cantillon
i
drink
cantillon
products
all
the
time
and
have
never
had
anything
like
this
no
idea
if
it
is
a
temporary
gastrointestinal
problem
on
my
part
comment
42806
it
was
almost
certainly
a
beer
issue
but
there
are
no
other
indications
that
it
is
anything
but
the
beer
drinkability
this
beer
was
difficult
for
me
to
drink
at
times
and
hard
to
put
down
at
others
i
will
definately
give
this
one
another
try
later
apricot
colored
liquid
below
a
small
slowing
forming
head
initially
bright
and
vibrant
fruit
aroma
of
apricot
and
peach
which
becomes
less
apparent
as
the
bottle
nears
final
consumption
other
aromatic
cantillon
lambic
qualities
are
also
present
but
in
a
subtle
way
unbelievably
harsh
citric
acid
flavor
with
very
little
character
besides
an
extreme
amount
of
sourness
this
is
an
unbelievably
intense
lambic
probably
the
most
sour
lambic
ever
its
so
strange
because
i
adore
the
three
year
old
grand
cru
but
that
beer
has
so
much
more
depth
and
character
besides
the
sourness
this
is
just
cutting
with
very
little
fruit
character
the
flavor
is
awesome
fruit
flavors
of
oranges
peaches
and
apricots
then
the
dirt
the
dust
the
must
and
the
funk
this
is
amazing
the
mouthfeel
is
puckering
to
say
the
least
as
always
with
cantillon
lambics
drinkability
depends
on
whether
you
like
sour
beers
or
not
i
love
em
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
taste
if
it
were
any
more
acidic
than
this
it
would
puncture
your
stomach
but
the
fruit
shines
beautifully
once
again
showing
oranges
tangerines
peaches
and
a
little
passion
fruit
finish
is
sharp
and
dry
but
with
a
very
long
tongue
flipping
aftermath
the
drinkability
of
this
elixir
was
strongly
debated
amongst
those
who
were
kind
enough
to
share
it
with
me
and
as
usual
concensus
was
not
achieved
i
was
on
the
yes
side
because
i
already
dusted
off
a
750
by
myself
in
brussels
however
i
didnt
enjoy
the
bottle
i
had
at
delirium
café
as
much
as
this
one
but
i
agree
with
the
fact
that
this
isnt
for
everyone
im
not
saying
this
to
pass
off
as
a
snob
im
just
saying
that
there
isnt
enough
pepsid
ac
rolaids
or
tums
on
earth
to
cure
what
this
beer
would
do
to
anyone
with
ulsers
or
acid
reflux
thanks
once
again
to
stonecrusher
for
the
continued
education
drinkabilitynotes
like
blue
cheese
most
definately
an
acquired
taste
but
once
acquired
there
is
a
profound
attraction
a
beer
and
a
style
that
must
not
be
missed
a
friend
commented
that
is
very
much
like
a
brut
champagne
discarding
ones
preconcieved
notions
of
beer
is
the
best
way
to
experience
a
lambic
for
the
first
time
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
tint
of
orange
a
fizzy
head
and
a
negligible
haze
the
aroma
is
pretty
funky
apricot
is
notable
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
a
grassiness
horseblanket
musty
earth
wood
and
a
serious
vinousness
the
first
taste
is
a
powerful
mouthpckering
rollupyour
tongue
wrinkleyourface
sourness
lots
of
acid
this
lambic
sure
isnt
sweetened
after
the
first
few
sips
and
your
mouth
is
prepared
a
lot
of
funkly
fruity
flavors
come
out
the
apricot
hides
and
i
could
only
pick
it
out
as
a
faint
effect
of
the
finish
the
musty
horse
flavor
is
present
through
the
taste
this
is
an
extremely
dry
extremely
astringent
brew
theres
a
high
level
of
carbonation
pretty
much
no
hop
flavors
at
all
this
is
one
sour
but
subtle
beer
the
more
i
drank
the
more
it
grew
on
me
i
wouldnt
drink
it
on
its
own
againbut
i
think
it
would
be
fantastic
with
food
the
beer
would
go
great
with
some
intensely
rich
foods
i
kept
thinking
that
this
would
be
great
with
oysters
rockefeller
this
beer
came
a
hefelike
cloudy
orange
and
gold
with
a
thin
creamy
head
smelled
powerfully
of
apricots
and
a
crazy
wild
yeast
the
pungent
smell
reminded
me
of
black
earth
and
turned
milk
in
the
russian
river
supplication
sort
of
sense
im
guessing
there
are
a
lot
of
strange
bacteria
at
work
here
forming
this
beer
into
something
very
unique
tastes
of
powerfully
sour
nectarines
oranges
and
raspberries
the
flavor
is
so
intense
its
hard
to
identify
just
what
fruits
were
used
here
it
nearly
tastes
like
vinegar
its
so
tough
theres
also
a
sour
milk
flavor
here
as
well
fortunately
theres
a
creamy
apricot
in
the
finish
wow
when
the
waitress
said
its
very
sour
she
wasnt
kidding
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
the
sourness
really
puckers
the
mouth
quite
a
bit
however
if
you
drink
this
slowly
you
just
may
enjoy
it

not
much
head
due
to
hardly
any
carbonation
beer
is
deep
golden
and
very
hazy
nose
is
heavy
messed
in
with
dusty
barn
horsesweat
oaknotes
cheese
and
imo
overdone
and
litle
sewer
like
not
bad
but
for
me
just
too
much
as
is
taste
that
is
oversoured
edgy
and
unbalanced
some
oaknotes
in
the
back
and
dry
but
this
sourness
is
just
too
much
and
think
this
one
needs
many
years
to
get
for
me
to
an
acceptable
and
balanced
taste
who
knows
but
another
one
i
have
is
put
all
the
way
back
into
my
cellar
drinkable
but
very
rough
imo
d
this
was
surprisingly
easy
drinking
not
that
i
would
ever
want
to
drink
this
when
i
wanted
a
beer
it
was
an
ok
one
time
experience
drinkability
and
overall
this
beer
right
here
is
exactly
why
i
love
lambicsgueuzes
so
much
the
sourness
the
tart
flavor
is
almost
unbearable
but
not
quite
and
it
makes
this
beer
damn
near
perfect
one
of
the
best
fruit
lambics
ive
had
to
date
if
you
love
to
sour
funky
flavors
youll
love
this
to
death
this
may
be
for
some
but
it
certainly
was
not
for
me
or
the
three
others
that
helped
me
drink
this
bottle
none
of
us
were
impressed
in
the
least
at
28
a
bottle
this
isnt
something
i
wouold
go
for
everyday
but
this
is
one
of
those
beers
out
there
on
the
ledge
of
what
beer
can
be
beer
all
you
can
be
i
found
it
easy
to
drink
after
the
initial
blast
this
beer
is
one
to
drink
for
hours
the
smell
the
look
the
crazy
flavor
can
keep
you
talking
all
damn
day
this
certainly
is
not
for
everyone
in
any
way
shape
or
form
but
damn
i
gotta
give
props
to
cantillon
for
producing
something
so
amazingly
original
and
hard
to
really
describe
till
you
experience
this
beer
i
guess
that
is
the
point
after
all
you
need
to
experience
this
beer
if
you
like
non
fruity
lambics
i
personally
prefer
the
organic
geuze
just
for
sheer
drinkability
but
i
wouldnt
be
adverse
to
picking
this
up
again
sometime
down
the
road
just
to
be
reminded
of
how
amazingly
out
there
this
brew
is
wow
ive
had
this
more
than
a
few
times
at
monks
and
i
must
say
i
enjoy
it
each
and
every
time
although
the
kreik
is
more
robust
and
stands
to
lend
more
flavor
this
is
still
a
real
treat
the
beer
is
a
murky
yellow
tan
color
with
high
carbonation
and
no
head
the
smell
is
unmistakeably
cantillon
as
the
lambic
base
and
its
sharp
acidity
sting
the
nostrils
once
sipped
the
fresh
apricot
flavor
comes
through
but
when
paired
with
the
lambic
it
falls
a
bit
flat
and
really
cant
hold
its
own
i
like
the
weeds
the
musty
flavor
imparted
by
the
brett
even
the
way
in
which
the
fruit
lends
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
a
foil
to
the
uncompromising
sourness
make
no
mistake
this
aint
some
us
fruit
beer
this
is
unabashedly
raw
and
i
love
it
a
great
one
to
try
this
beer
poured

very
cloudyhazymilky
peach

color
and
formed
a
small
bubbly
snow
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
and
left
no

a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
in
the
murkiness
the
aroma
is
definate
lambic
with
barnyard
elements
and
grass
masking
a
suttle
peach
aspect
the
flavor
was
the
powerful
presence
of
lambic
sweetsour
brought
crashing
in
by
the
definate
astrigent
nature
of
the

is
rather
limited
in
mouth
its
tart
of
course
but
pretty
mellowed
out
i
assume
the
bottles
are
far
more
authentic
in
that
regard
here
the
mouthfeel
is
so
lightly
carbonated
that
it
feels
a
bit
lifeless
i
wish
i
had
an
explanation
for
the
name
though
foufoune
means
buns
in
the
sense
of
bottom
or
behind
taste
is
of
apricots
sour
tart
typical
cantillon
which
is
always
a
good
change
of
pace
not
acidic
in
regards
to
mouthfeel
this
could
use
more
carbonation
but
hey
you
get
what
you
get
with
spontaneity
if
you
know
what
i
mean
other
comments
holy
crap
this
ones
sour
of
course
cantillons
are
typically
sour
but
this
is
outrageous
can
give
you
heartburn
or
acid
reflux
if
you
drink
too
much
of
it
couldnt
get
through
the
entire
750ml
by
myself
so
im
going
to
use
part
of
it
to
make
dressing
dthis
is
one
hard
beer
to
drink
i
finished
my
whole
glass
but
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
pours
a
light
golden
peachy
color
with
a
slight
minimal
white
head
that
leaves
no
lace
initial
aromas
are
pungent
and
citric
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
fruit
and
some
of
those
classic
barnyard
aromas
for
flavor
this
brew
is
crisp
and
delightful
there
is
a
beautiful
balance
between
the
sourness
and
a
slight
sweet
fruity
like
flavor
that
can
best
be
described
as
a
citrusy
lemonade
following
there
is
a
nice
bite
of
tartness
to
the
brew
and
a
refreshing
carbonation
overall
this
brew
is
highly
drinkable
though
i
would
never
think
that
cantillon
would
use
apricots
in
a
beer
but
hell
it
works
picked
this
up
at
smokeless
joe
in
toronto
pours
a
lovely
hazy
peach
colour
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
smell
was
very
pungent
very
sour
yeasty
smell
but
similar
to
the
other
cantillon
i
tried
taste
was
a
tart
if
not
downright
sour
apricot
that
was
very
dry
it
was
a
very
mouthpuckering
mouthfeel
that
dries
out
the
mouth
all
these
comments
sound
rather
negative
but
i
really
liked
the
taste
it
makes
you
feel
alive
and
in
my
case
more
sober
for
the
long
walk
home
i
would
recommend
this
as
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
lambic
like
it
ot
hate
it
i
cant
rate
this
one
too
highly
it
just
wasnt
something
i
can
see
drinking
all
the
time
but
dont
let
that
discourage
you
you
might
enjoy
it
much
more
heck

it

really
a

of
those

that
have

like
peaches
apricots
and
kumquats
some
would
debate
but
only
domestic
belgian

are
only
used
in
this
brew
and
it
takes
on
aspects
of
all

it
has
a

to
it
not

really

the

once

predominant
taste
is
of
tannins
of
unripened

rather
acrid
yet
wholly
enjoyable
for

lovers
everywhere
just
make
sure
you
drink
within
its
window
of
oppurtunity

aroma

a

the

is

and
more
than

not
quite
as

puckering
as
some
of
the

selections
ive
had
though
this
one
is
held
in
check
somewhat
its
pretty
refreshing
the
horse
blanket
is
there
and
the
acidity
is
definitely
there
very
slight
apricot
grape
skin
and
unripe

nicely
put

somthing
keeps
begging
me
to
drink
more
of
it
thats
a
good
sign
a
slightly
cloudy
pinkorange
pour
with
a
typically
small
head
the
nose
was
big
on
tart
sour
fruitiness
huge
tang
up

and
tartness
that
hits
you
like
a
cold
bucket
of
water
lemony
notes
and
very
big
lime
bitterness
along
with
vinegar
notes
that
make
you
pucker
up
the
fruitiness
is
very
toned
down
a
pinch
of
apricot
but
burried
beneath
all
of
the
acidity
and
tartness
some
light
earthy
notes
and
fresh
grassy
layers
nice
acidity
although
not
to
the
degree
of
the
gueze
for
example
for
me
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
starter
or
even
a
night
cap
the
perfect
summer
beer
i
absolutely
loved
it
the
first
i
have
had
of
this
type
extremely
sour
like
vinegar
even
in
the
aroma
recent
arrival
at
smokeless
joes
bartender
insisted
this
was
it
not
on
way
to
the
skunk
good
i
split
it
with
a
friend
and
could
have
done
so
with
three
other
friends
after
first
acid
bite
on
mouth
which
i
still
feel
7
hours
later
it
grows
on
you
like
a
highly
acidic
apple
a
bit
of
apricot
aroma
but
we
tasted
nothing
sweet
or
fruity
yeast
but
overpowered
must
have
with
food
fou
foune
is
refreshing
in
the
way
that
cantillon
lambics
tend
to
be
a
fantastic
beer
that
ought
to
be
experienced
by
lambic
fans
this
lambic
comes
from
the
last
traditional
brewer
in
brussels
the
beer
is
aged
for
two
years
in
wooden
casks
and
apricots
are
added
which
produces
a
bright
orange
color
the
head
retention
is
high
from
the
use
of
wheat
that
helps
accent
its
color
the
aroma
gives
the
impression
that
this
beer
is
going
to
be
sour
which
is
the
case
for
lambics
especially
from
this
brewer
at
first
the
beer
almost
puckers
the
mouth
but
you
are
rewarded
for
continuing
the
apricot
flavor
is
soft
and
subtle
amid
the
complexity
of
a
wood
aged
lambic
it
is
almost
syrupy
and
coats
the
tongue
well
ng
jean
pierre
van
roy
is
simply
one
of
the
best
brewers
in
belgium
and
the
world
cheers
to
you
sir
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
soft
a
challenging
beer
and
not
recommended
for
the
novice
lambic
drinker
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
that
nose
ive
been
mesmerized
by
the
fou
foune
label
for
the
past
two
months
its
perhaps
the
most
dignified
and
artistic
label
ive
even
viewed
and
to
boot
its
a
little
bit
funky
just
like
this
beer
i
had
some
second
thoughts
calling
this
a
beer
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
orange
copper
and
looks
amazing
in
my
flute
a
thin
layer
of
foam
formed
across
the
top
it
smells
like
most
lambics
the
first
sip
begins
mellow
and
then
its
tartness
expands
to
its
full
potential
my
cheeks
puckered
a
little
before
the
fruity
apricot
aftertaste
filled
my
throat
man
the
aftertaste
is
refreshing
the
funk
is
sour
yet
not
overbearing
and
adds
some
zest
and
zing
every
step
of
the
way
hints
of
lemon
apricots
and
of
course
yeast
i
wonder
if
the
belgiums
enjoy
a
cube
of
sugar
is
this
fine
offering
anyway
this
was
a
new
experience
for
my
in
terms
of
lambics
and
highly
memorable
a
orangish
light
gold
color
to
this
beer
that
is
more
light
gold
than
anything
pours
with
a
lively
carbonation
i
cant
detect
any
apricot
in
the
aroma
though
there
is
a
slight
fruitiness
but
mostly
smell
sour
the
taste
is
of
course
quite
acidic
with
general
musty
character
as
well
if
i
did
not
know
this
beer
i
would
have
no
idea
that
it
was
made
with
apricots
the
lambic
beasties
have
completely
obliterated
all
signs
of
the
apricots
as
a
lambic
type
beer
this
is
quite
good
though
seems
a
bit
simplistic
compared
to
some
of
the
other
offerings
tastes
more
of
a
citrus
type
fruit
which
comes
from
the
acidity
i
am
a
bit
dissapointed
in
the
apricot
character
from
this
beer
but
it
is
still
quite
good
the
body
is
a
hazy
glowing
yellow
with
a
peach
cast
the
creamy
brightwhite
head
holds
well
at
first
and
slowly
drops
to
a
thin
collar
and
whispy
surface
foam
sweet
apricot
is
present
in
the
first
whiff
but
it
reveals
its
seductively
intense
and
complex
lambic
character
upon
closer
inspection
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
is
squelched
in
the
flavor
although
there
is
definite
apricot
character
the
sweetness
appears
right
at
the
start
but
immediately
vanishes
as
its
overtaken
by
a
sharp
drying
acidity
that
retains
control
until
the
swallow
where
lambic
character
lingers
in
the
finish
along
with
more
fruit
quite
exceptional
intense
complex
refreshing
this
is
cantillon

the
lambic
master
we
are
truly
not
worthy
very
good
hints
of
sweetness
due
to
the
apricot
well
balanced
with
a
sour
dry
acidic
finish
very
refreshing
brew
quite
complex
with
hints
of
apricots
oak
lemon
sour
yeast
just
another
great
brew
from
cantillon
my
first
cantillon
2013
vintage
had
a
strong
barnyardhay
nose
taste
was
extremely
funky
but
also
crisp
and
refreshing
tasted
amazing
smelled
like
i
was
working
a
cat
with
a
uti
horrible
but
awesome
at
the
same
time
taste
evolved
as
the
beer
warmed
over
several
hours
i
recommend
drinking
this
beer
closer
to
room
temperature
the
elderflower
takes
center
stage
of
this
lambic
and
showcases
as
green
herbal
medicinal
floral
and
peppery
its
quite
unlike
any
other
cantillon
or
for
that
matter
any
other
beer
i
have
tasted
the
green
pepper
flavor
is
off
putting
at
first
but
opens
up
into
something
that
is
quite
interesting
and
complex
wet
grass
pungent
fresh
cut
weeds
a
sweet
floral
aroma
and
a
peppery
floral
overtone
the
lambic
base
is
sour
funky
and
slightly
cheesy
a
nice
experience
for
sure
but
id
choose
a
classic
geuze
next
time
o
uniquely
flavored
lambic
like
cantillon
knows
best
im
not
very
familiar
with
elderflower
in
any
other
context
so
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
identify
the
exact
contribution
on
the
beer
but
the
floral
to
wet
leafs
nose
and
flavor
would
be
my
assumption
nice
beer
overall
voor

just

overall
4
serving
type
bottle
im
happy
to
try
it
but
not
the
same
world
class
experience
ive
gotten
from
cantillon
in
the
past
maybe
ill
like
it
more
in
a
decade
or
two
mamouche
has
been
a
whale
for
me
so
getting
a
full
pour
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
yesterday
was
a
delightful
treat
unexpected
and
fully
wonderful
and
up
to
the
hype
elderflower
can
be
so
soft
or
so
intense
and
using
it
right
in
anything
from
lotion
to
tea
can
be
a
balancing
act
which
is
why
i
am
so
impressed
with
the
beer
here
at
its
base
is
a
lambic
i
know
and
love
from
cantillon
perfectly
mixed
between
musty
woody
funk
and
lactic
sourness
with
a
fuller
bodied
wheat
base
and
only
as
much
carbonation
as
is
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
it
moving
the
difference
here
is
this
delicate
blooming
elderflower
presence
that
transports
me
to
distant
fields
in
nicer
weather
with
warm
breezes
blowing
endlessly
its
beautiful
not
the
least
bit
perfumy
but
absolutely
brightly
floral
in
the
smell
while
it
takes
on
a
bit
more
bitterness
in
the
flavor
but
not
a
hop
bitterness
that
comes
at
the
end
its
all
up
front
here
and
the
softness
of
the
floral
smell
is
never
lost
among
the
intensity
of
the
base
beer
which
is
a
wonderful
testament
to
the
artisan
skills
of
the
brewer
as
if
we
needed
another
from
cantillon
right
this
is
as
well
refined
as
anything
they
make
more
interesting
than
many
and
frankly
just
absolutely
delicious
sour
beer
the
elderflower
is
used
to
perfection
here
and
while
i
also
enjoyed
the
mikkeller
spontan
version
i
think
the
cantillon
adds
more
than
just
lactic
acidity
but
also
a
beautiful
oak
and
funk
profile
that
makes
this
a
much
more
layered
and
complex
drink
elite
stuff
worthy
of
trying
at
nearly
any
cost
well
i
gotta
give
this
one
credit
for
providing
flavours
that
were
on
the
whole
new
to
me
and
agreeable
enough
at
that
the
peppery
florals
go
a
long
way
in
ameliorating
the
harsh
acidity
still
present
it
is
cantillon
after
all
and
the
funk
keeps
mostly
to
itself
good
and
interesting
overall
but
i
cant
quite
say
that
the
stiff
shelf
tag
even
for
these
guys
would
be
really
worth
having
another
go
even
if
presented
the
opportunity
overall
i
wasnt
sure
that
i
would
enjoy
an
elderflower
sour
as
much
as
i
do
the
more
traditional
fruited
lambics
however
after
a
just
a
few
sips
i
am
convinced
mamouche
easily
ranks
as
one
of
my
favourite
cantillons
and
i
will
certainly
be
purchasing
it
again
o
interesting
but
not
particularly
tasty
due
to
some
of
the
weirder
elements
smells
amazing
though
m
very
dry

only

this
is
unique
to

the
least
o
good
stuff
overall
as
usual
for
this
brewery
it
was
solid
all
around
and
could
be
considered
a
staple
example
of
a
lambic
but
the
elderflowers
really
do
make
this
one
special
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
will
age
but
i
am
more
tempted
to
drink
this
fresh
while
i
can
i
have
to
say
this
beer
is
unique
i
think
im
enjoying
this
more
than
most
other
people
it
seems
to
be
less
appreciated
among
the
cantillon
lineup
i
personally
can
find
little
faults
in
it
if
youve
never
chewed
on
a
piece
of
prairie
grass
or
flower
while
out
on
a
hike
or
other
outdoor
activity
and
enjoyed
it
then
you
might
not
be
a
fan
of
this
beer
sometimes
you
want
to
feel
closer
to
mother
earth
and
if
you
want
to
do
that
while
enjoying
a
beer
in
your
living
room
seek
this
beer
out
to
do
it
overall
way
different
than
i
could
have
expected
the
flavor
is
very
plant
influenced
and
it
is
unlike
any
beverage
ive
consumed
definitely
not
my
favorite
cantillon
but
is
very
interesting
and
worth
a
try
oanother
solid
cantillon
lambic
found
the
floral
and
herbal
notes
of
the
elder
flowers
quite
enjoyable
o
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
one
id
pursue
regularly
as
every
other
beer
ive
had
from
cantillon
this
one
is
just
great
the
fact
that
its
a
little
different
than
the
other
varieties
ive
had
makes
it
that
much
more
special
and
the
fact
that
it
was
completely
outoftheblue
makes
it
just
unspeakably
awesome
the
only
drawback
is
that
i
now
have
one
more
fantastic
loon
beer
that
it
will
be
hard
to
resist
paying
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
anytime
i
see
it
randomly
appear
on
a
shelf
or
online
o
phenomenal
but
probably
my
least
favorite
cantillon
thus
far
the
green
pepper
tonasco
flavor
really
threw
me
off
overall
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
imparted
by
the
elderflowers
are
unique
and
unexpected
but
they
end
up
working
well
with
the
base
lambic
a
bit
less
drinkable
then
most
other
cantillons
but
still
a
great
beer
thats
worth
seeking
out
to
try
at
least
once
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlight
intensity
resulting
in
a
beer
that
is
foamy
25
and
otherwise
smooth
35
a
very
satisfying
full
and
gently
rolling
mouthfeel
thats
perfect
for
this
or
any
sour
beer
closes
surprisingly
semidry
with
light
to
moderate
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
a
good
cantillon
but
not
a
great
beer
the
floral
notes
overpower
a
little
this
is
a
very
nice
sour
perfect
for
warm
days
dont
pass
it
up
if
you
like
sours
i
love
this
beer
i
can
see
why
some
people
hate
it
but
i
absolutely
love
it
it
is
very
unique
and
masterfully
executed
it
made
the
cantillon
iris
next
to
it
seem
like
such
an
uninteresting
bitter
lambic
eduardo
can
you
please
send
me
another
bottle
overall
still
no
idea
what
an
elderflower
should
taste
or
smell
like
but
this
smells
and
tastes
like
green
peppers
i
had
no
expectations
for
this
one
but
for
me
the
elderflower
addition
gave
off
a
nice
herbal
and
floral
feel
that
combined
amazingly
with
the
cantillon
funk
might
be
my
favorite
of
their
beers
so
far
750
ml
capped
and
corked
bottle
bottled
on

june
2012
served
in
a
unibroue
tulip
the
beer
pours
goldenorange
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
didnt
stay
around
for
very
long
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
tart
the
brew
smells
like
tart
lemon
herbsflowers
which
i
assume
is
from
the
elderflowers
oak
and
some
funk
it
tastes
like
tart
citrus
elderflowers
herbalfloral
taste
green
pepper
funk
oak
and
some
apricot
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
well
carbonated
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
thought
this
was
a
good
brew
id
like
to
pick
up
another
bottle
at
some
point
bottle
from
etre
gourmet
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
with
intense
flavors
overall
very
good
despite
the
characteristic
cantillon
sourness
it
is
a
rather
delicate
beer
o
nice
muted
version
of
gueuze
with
light
floral
and
funk
presence
really
liked
this
and
could
sit
and
drink
for
awhile
reminded
me
of
classic
but
a
bit
softer
with
the
elderflower
presence
o
my
goodness
i
enjoyed
this
beer
immensely
i
dont
even
know
what
to
say
other
than
this
might
be
my
favorite
of
all
the
cantillons
i
have
tried
before
so
delicious
i
need
to
seek
out
more
of
this
for
future
consumption
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
musty
barnyard
funk
presence
that
lingers
over
light
fruit
notes
pale
maltsmusty
brett
and
toasted
oak
into
a
slightly
acetic
dry
finish
the
sourness
is
kind
of
tame
but
there
is
a
lot
of
farmhousebarnyard
character
and
lactic
funk
especially
creamy
cheesiness
in
the
back
end
flower
petals
are
also
really
prominent
adding
an
odd
lingering
bitterness
not
overly
complex
or
as
sour
as
i
like
from
cantillon
but
packs
plenty
of
funky
bitterness
and
unique
flavor
o
very
drinkable
a
unique
experience
one
of
the
best
cantillon
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
definitely
a
flower
dominant
lambic
the
floral
aroma
and
flavor
really
do
take
the
lead
here
which
unfortunately
quickly
became
quite
challenging
i
understand
that
many
people
quite
enjoy
this
one
but
for
me
at
this
point
at
least
i
found
this
difficult
and
didnt
go
back
for
a
second
pour
not
something
id
want
to
drink
again
for
the
next
little
while
at
least
at
least
not
this
fresh
perhaps
a
couple
years
in
the
bottle
would
make
a
big
difference
overall
the
most
interesting
beer
from
this
brewery
that
ive
tried
so
far
wasnt
expecting
the
herby
aspect
thanks
again
for
this
treat
from
across
the
pond
jeff
poured
a
light
pale
golden
orange
in
color
with
pale
yellow
highlights
and
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
leaves
nice
wisps
of
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
definitely
has
the
signature
cantillon
bretty
barnyard
funk
character
wtih
nice
citrus
good
acidic
in
the
nose
slight
pineapple
and
mango
fruit
and
oaky
wood
the
wood
oakiness
with
barnyard
bretty
funk
meld
very
well
with
citrusy
accents
mild
grapefruit
twang
pineapple
notes
and
a
touch
of
corky
flavor
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
funky
bretty
horseblanket
citrusy
oaky
sour
and
slight
dry
finish
finally
got
to
try
it
and
i
wasnt
dissapointed
at
all
fun
to
try
and
extremely
drinkable
the
vegetal
bell
pepper
of
this
took
me
by
surprise
bottled
june
8
2012
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
goes
down
quickly
scent
is
oh
my
weird
smells
like
dirt
probably
the
least
appealing
cantillon
aroma
ive
ever
smelled
once
i
give
it
another
whiff
i
get
more
than
just
dirt
there
is
definitely
the
earthy
dirt
notes
but
there
is
also
a
clean
freshcut
bell
pepper
aroma
bell
pepper
dirt
and
funky
sour
notes
mesh
for
quite
an
interesting
aroma
that
can
grow
on
you
after
a
few
whiffs
taste
is
very
vegetal
at
first
with
a
good
amount
of
sour
the
bell
pepper
and
vegetable
come
through
in
the
flavor
leaving
the
dirt
aroma
behind
in
the
nose
no
dirt
flavor
very
tasty
actually
refreshing
vegetable
and
sour
flavors
slight
acidity
but
not
much
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
almost
puckering
sour
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
the
most
bizarre
cantillon
i
have
ever
had
however
i
respect
them
for
creating
something
outside
the
norm
of
lambic
the
vegetable
notes
are
superb
on
this
beer
overall
this
beer
was
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
and
i
loved
it
probably
my
favorite
cantillon
to
date
othis
is
some
delicious
stuff
executed
wonderfully
not
my
favorite
type
of
sour
but
unique
and
well
above
average
enjoyed
this
one
while
pregaming
going
out
jazz
club
hopping
in
new
orleans
at
avenue
pub
served
from
tap
into
a
wine
glass
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
bell
pepper
sour
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
bell
pepper
floral
sour
and
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
when
i
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
back
at
zwanze
day
2011
i
experienced
a
bell
pepper
flavor
and
i
thought
that
it
might
have
been
a
figment
of
my
imagination
now
that
ive
got
to
have
it
on
tap
as
well
and
still
pick
up
on
the
bell
pepper
it
appears
to
be
pretty
solid
evidence
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
fact
at
all
though
as
it
actually
seemed
to
fit
in
quite
nicely
with
the
brew
and
add
a
nice
earthiness
to
it
a
well
done
brew
that
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
in
the
bottles
i
have
laid
down
in
the
cellar
pours
a
cloudy
golden
body
with
a
thick
white
head
that
faded
to
a
good
lasting
film
this
beer
smells
like
no
other
ive
had
but
thats
probably
because
ive
never
even
hear
of
an
elderflower
before
this
the
nose
is
very
peppery
like
that
of
a
red
bell
pepper
and
vegetal
that
characteristic
musty
cantillon
funk
is
right
in
there
next
to
the
strange
notes
of
bell
pepper
and
citrus
smells
like
a
musty
of
garden
the
taste
is
better
than
the
nose
in
my
opinion
as
a
little
bit
more
funk
and
lemony
citrus
mixes
with
the
pepper
and
vegetables
but
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
lambic
the
mouthfeel
is
very
airy
bubbly
and
fairly
dry
id
like
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
beer
in
a
few
years
when
its
had
at
least
half
a
decade
of
age
on
it
to
see
how
it
has
changed
definitely
an
interesting
brew
omight
be
my
least
favorite
cantillon
to
date
i
can
see
why
others
would
like
this
but
i
think
i
prefer
iris
in
comparison
to
this
mediumlight
body
medium
carbonation
crisp
easy
to
drink
average
acidity
and
sourness
doesnt
assault
the
mouth
and
gullet
this
definitely
wont
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
i
was
a
fan
overall
i
just
cant
get
behind
this
offering
as
we
discussed
at
the
table
you
either
love
it
or
you
hate
it
but
even
if
you
love
it
more
than
a
6
oz
offering
could
become
a
task
if
you
are
adverse
to
any
sort
of
herbalfloral
beers
avoid
this
for
sure
jean
van
roy
is
my
hero
but
i
truly
question
the
decision
to
blend
delicate
lambic
with
a
flavor
this
dominant
by
far
the
worst
lambic
cantillon
has
produced
imo
overall
interesting
for
sure
but
i
dont
care
for
it
as
much
as
the
sours
that
use
other
adjuncts
very
floral
and
herbal
aroma
with
those
elements
dominating
the
taste
as
well
the
sourness
in
this
beer
is
either
harsh
or
appears
so
i
cannot
tell
mouthfeel
is
excellent
but
this
beer
is
not
doing
it
for
me
even
though
i
find
myself
going
back
for
another
whiff
and
another
sip
i
am
glad
to
have
had
it
but
it
either
is
not
as
good
as
other
cantillons
or
challenges
my
palate
so
much
that
i
am
baffled
regardless
it
is
fairly
above
average
compared
to
some
other
swill
mariage
parfait
i
am
looking
at
you
as
far
as
unique
experiences
this
ranks
a
5
ive
never
had
a
beer
thats
really
been
remotely
close
to
this
however
if
you
line
up
cantillons
and
force
me
to
pick
one
this
would
be
near
the
bottom
of
the
list
not
sure
what
age
does
to
this
but
a
fairly
fresh
bottle
is
mostly
pepper
and
nothing
else
o
excellent
marriage
of
fruity
sweetness
botanical
pepperyness
and
lactic
acidity
bottle
shared
at
woodshop

at
beachwood
bbq
in
long
beach
light
peachy
color
with
a
small
white
head
strange
floral
scent
obviously
the
elderberry
flowers
plenty
of
acidity
but
rather
subdued
flavor
mainly
your
typical
funky
lemony
citrus
pith
notes
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
d
one
of
the
more
interesting
cantillon
offerings
i
have
tried
to
date
i
think
i
prefer
their
wine
barrel
and
fruit
lambics
over
this
venture
into
the
plant
world
although
its
harder
to
get
its
worth
a
shot
as
are
any
in
cantillons
line
up
o
great
peppery
gueuzelike
lambik
really
interesting
and
unlike
other
cantillons
i
have
had
mamouche
pours
an
opaque
light
orange
with
minimal
white
foam
capping
the
beer
the
nose
has
a
lot
of
funk
to
it
with
a
bit
of
acidity
present
as
well
theres
just
a
faint
hint
of
oak
and
a
subtle
spicyherbal
aroma
that
seems
to
build
in
intensity
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
has
much
more
pepperherbs
to
it
with
a
light
touch
of
fruitiness
shining
through
as
well
theres
some
wet
hay
barnyard
funk
but
definitely
not
as
much
as
in
the
nose
cant
really
say
the
beer
tastes
tart
or
sour
either
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
bubbly
but
the
body
is
noticeably
more
fullchewy
than
youd
normally
expect
for
the
style
mamouche
is
a
decent
wild
ale
but
definitely
not
up
to
the
usual
standards
of
what
i
expect
from
cantillon
i
know
this
is
kind
of
a
lovehate
cantillon
i
really
really
enjoy
it
this
is
delicious
the
aroma
really
hooked
me
nice
of
monks
to
have
this
one
on
tap
at
their
latest
cantillon
event
i
actually
had
not
had
this
before
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
poured
a
hazy
goldenyellow
color
with
a
small
cap
of
delicate
white
bubbles
that
faded
to
a
ringlet
streaking
the
glass
with
lacing
until
the
last
drop
champagnelike
bubbles
blipped
from
the
bottom
of
the
chalice
aroma
of
barnyard
funk
and
wildflowers
crisp
taste
more
of
the
characteristics
noted
in
the
nose
wet
grass
cardboard
very
floral
tart
but
not
overly
so
mid
to
endpalate
displays
heavy
flavors
of
green
peppers
pickle
brine
and
a
touch
of
white
wine
and
cheap
champagne
ps
all
champagne
tastes
like
cheap
champagne
to
me
light
body
prickly
and
quite
drying
as
expected
for
the
style
decent
overall
wow
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
from
cantillon
as
part
of
a
strong
range
of
exceptional
beers
its
a
lovely
twist
to
a
really
well
made

a

orange
with

to
a

on

of
the

no

is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
a
very
nice

from
the
elder

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
bitter
quality
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
lambic
with
a
nice
floral
presence
in
the
smell
and
taste
o
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
i
have
been
waiting
about
8
months
since
oktoberfest
to
open
one
of
these
in
the
spring
and
today
was
the
perfect
occasion
highly
recommend
doing
this
after
finishing
a
long
afternoon
of
yardwork
o
a
really
nice
beer
the
elder
flower
flavor
is
really
interesting
and
makes
for
a
complex
fascinating
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
lambics
i
really
liked
the
elderflower
smell
and
how
much
the
flavor
followed
i
mostly
find
fruit
lambics
have
the
sourness
overwhelm
the
extra
flavor
and
that
didnt
happen
here
very
nice
o
the
flavors
were
light
and
slightly
restrained
it
was
still
a
nice
beer
but
wasnt
all
that
tart
or
sour
d
definitely
my
favorite
cantillon
so
far
would
like
to
put
this
up
against
fresh
gambrinus
sidetoside
i
definitely
wouldnt
want
to
age
this
much
that
fresh
berry
is
just
so
damn
good
o
ahhh
i
love
cantillon
a
spring
time
wonder
3
5
d
this
was
good
and
i
loved
the
nose
but
its
too
bitter
for
my
preference
and
the
astringency
is
a
bit
distracting
im
not
sure
that
ill
buy
this
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
a
really
nice
different
lambic
the
flowery
character
really
works
well
balanced
elderflower
is
one
of
my
favorite
flavors
and
mamouche
is
a
nice
display
of
it
balanced
spicy
herbal
it
tastes
like
a
handful
of
spices
yeah
the
beer
was
sour
floral
and
all
that
but
i
thought
the
pepper
was
a
distraction
ultimately
this
one
kind
of
fits
the
bill
that
the
more
rare
cantillons
arent
worth
pursuing
i
have
a
bottle
so
ill
get
to
try
it
again
but
for
now
this
is
one
of
the
more
disappointing
cantillons
ive
had
even
if
it
is
a
decent
beer
it
doesnt
compare
to
their
more
accessible
beers
like
the
kriek
or
classic
gueuze
a
pretty
dry
beer
all
around
as
well
o
this
was
my
first
experience
drinking
a
cantillon
beer
and
i
think
i
am
hooked
thank
goodness
my
sister
in
law
lives
on
belgium
and
can
start
hunting
these
down
for
me
this
is
not
as
aggressively
flavored
with
elder
flowers
as
was
the
zwanze
version
but
it
still
forms
a
significant
portion
of
the
flavor
profile
it
does
work
though
but
it
may
take
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
the
peppery
somewhat
astringent
green
sap
like
flavors
that
the
elder
flowers
contribute
this
is
a
quite
interesting
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
it
is
a
cantillon
though
so
coming
from
me
that
should
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
kinda
thin
an
oily
feeling
very
awesome
this
was
a
pricey
hard
to
find
10oz
of
beer
but
worth
it
to
try
once
o
not
really
a
sour
person
per
say
as
my
reviews
are
of
ipa
dipa
and
is
but
this
is
very
approachable
probably
a
good
lambic
to
start
off
with
just
my
opinion
but
a
better
option
to
drink
fresh
than
age
the
color
on
this
is
an
indescribably
wonderful
golden
orange
the
head
starts
off
about
2
inches
high
in
a
snifter
and
over
the
next
two
or
three
minutes
gradually
settles
into
a
semithin
white
layer
with
visible
carbonation
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
starts
off
tart
if
a
little
musty
but
finishes
with
some
spice
plums
grapefruit
and
floral
aroma
this
one
is
incredibly
complex
upon
first
sip
starts
off
a
little
spicy
as
in
serrano
pepper
but
quickly
reveals
many
more
layers
the
elderflower
is
present
but
very
subtle
lending
some
floral
notes
and
grapefruit
along
with
the
lemony
tartness
that
is
evident
without
dominating
many
other
flavors
emerge
such
as
ripe
apples
the
mouthfeel
is
phenomenal
there
is
ample
carbonation
but
the
texture
is
creamy
and
culminates
in
superb
balance
the
low
abv
makes
this
easy
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
to
yourself
or
start
your
night
by
sharing
with
others
well
worth
the
hype
cantillon
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
zwanze
2009
pour
is
a
hazed
golden
amber
with
a
tight
bubly
head
the
nose
has
the
dusty
funk
found
in
so
many
cantillons
with
notes
of
lemon
and
a
huge
blast
of
flower
petals
there
is
a
hot
type
spice
and
its
a
little
seedy
the
taste
follows
the
nose
juicy
citrus
up
front
a
dusty
funk
takes
over
with
the
huge
flower
petal
that
takes
over
a
jalepeno
spice
has
an
interesting
presence
with
more
citrusy
flavors
and
some
light
bitterness
the
body
is
light
and
creamy
but
has
an
active
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
extremely
unique
beer
rare
flavors
i
havent
seen
before
o
very
nice
brew
near
the
top
for
me
as
far
as
cantillon
goes
in
my
limited
experience
very
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
charley
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
i
was
expecting
something
similar
to
iris
which
i
did
not
like
but
instead
it
was
more
like
a
slightly
floral
classic
gueuze
which
is
great
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
overall
delightful
beer
would
happily
drink
this
one
again
though
maybe
on
someone
elses
dime
o
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
it
exceeded
those
expectations
as
with
the
cantillon
beers
i
have
had
so
far
this
is
delicious
but
the
elder
flower
added
a
very
interesting
element
i
am
kicking
myself
for
not
purchasing
another
bottle
unlike
fou
foune
this
is
ready
to
go
out
of
the
gate
with
some
nice
funk
and
mouthfeel
happening
perhaps
i
just
prefer
this
style
of
fruit
lambic
in
the
first
place
very
very
good
and
can
be
compared
to
some
far
rarer
gueuzeslambics
ive
had
in
the
past
taste
is
earthy
and
floral
with
some
light
green
pepper
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
not
too
sour
but
lightly
tart
and
very
rich
overall
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
cantillon
again
jeanpierre
has
displayed
masterful
balance
in
this
brew
that
somehow
retains
the
classic
lambic
sourness
but
also
offers
up
some
interesting
flavours
recommended
this
one
pours
with
an
audible
crackle
of
the
co2
being
released
slightly
soapy
crystal
white
head
the
color
is
dusty
rudy
brownish
gold
the
aroma
is
pleasant
s
bit
of
classic
funk
some
old
dusty
barn
and
a
floral
perfume
the
nose
leads
me
to
believe
im
in
for
a
great
experiance
my
first
sip
leaves
me
perplexed
and
a
second
confirms
my
fears
mamouche
starts
with
a
delicate
soft
sourness
and
slight
lemony
funk
then
i
get
this
strange
vegitile
flavor
it
is
slightly
floral
but
reminds
me
more
of
tomatillos
while
i
like
some
of
the
aspects
of
this
beer
i
cant
get
past
the
vegitile
tomatillo
thing
otherwise
this
is
a
flawless
lambic
great
mouthfeel
its
fluffy
and
not
thin
in
the
end
the
pluses
of
this
beer
just
dont
outweigh
how
i
felt
about
the
flavor
but
i
can
at
least
respect
this
as
a
well
crafted
product
oanother
fine
example
of
what
lambics
should
taste
like
and
this
is
a
new
one
for
me
but
it
definately
will
not
be
the
last
as
the
elderflowers
add
a
beautiful
touch
to
this
to
make
it
totally
different
to
the
rest
of
their
range
and
another
one
of
their
brews
that
if
you
find
it
you
buy
it
and
looking
forwards
to
sampling
the
rest
of
my
cantillion
haul
cheers
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
very
cloudy
looking
nose
is
jalapeño
pickle
funk
and
floral
notes
amazing
nose
taste
profile
follows
suit
unique
but
very
tasty
beer
the
pickle
and
jalapeño
really
come
out
in
the
taste
feel
is
medium
with
excellent
carbonation
great
beer
overall
really
lucky
i
got
to
try
this
one
it
is
the
best
time
of
the
year
this
just
arrived
today
it
pours
a
light
to
medium
bodied
dirty
and
muddied
apricot
orange
in
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
aromas
consist
of
a
very
acidic
sour
with
a
boatload
of
grains
and
perfume
it
is
very
very
floral
with
a
lot
of
earthiness
i
get
a
lot
of
dandelion
and
tea
leaves
it
also
has
a
lemony
citrus
aspect
to
it
its
borderline
potpouri
thats
been
allowed
to
ferment
its
very
interesting
and
very
dry
it
drinks
relatively
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
its
a
very
different
lambic
and
better
than
iris
in
my
opinion
cantiloons
overall
this
beer
is
better
than
a
3
5
but
it
isnt
a
4
the
cumulative
score
represents
my
thoughts
on
this
one
overall
i
was
really
excited
to
get
to
try
this
but
it
didnt
really
live
up
to
my
expectations
the
smell
turned
me
off
i
dont
think
i
would
search
this
out
again
o
very
nice
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
but
it
was
still
very
good
none
the
less
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
pours
a
fairly
clear
orangish
with
a
nice
white
head
loots
pretty
typical
smells
hugely
of
chili
spice
peachy
fruit
some
floral
aromas
and
toasted
chilis
there
is
funkiness
underlying
but
the
chili
overpowers
was
not
expecting
that
tastes
sweet
and
lightly
fruity
and
before
bam
more
chili
hits
hard
well
carbonated
and
drinkable
but
the
chili
kills
it
for
me
i
really
dug
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
lambics
in
recent
memory
any
cantillon
that
sticks
at
5
i
always
enjoy
to
the
bone
while
the
ones
that
exceed
that
go
in
different
directions
for
me
i
gulped
some
glasses
down
pretty
quick
a
bottle
to
the
head
would
be
easy
massive
vegetal
herbal
and
floral
presnce
with
minimal
funk
on
the
nose
and
tongue
a
real
unique
but
strange
beer
glad
to
try
it
dont
think
illl
ever
seek
it
out
again
though
medium
body
higher
carbonation
refreshing
and
zesty
on
the
tongue
one
of
the
most
unusual
yet
delicious
beers
ive
ever
had
even
at
10
per
glass
i
went
back
for
more
its
almost
tough
to
explain
this
beer
without
actually
tasting
it
olike
the
spiciness
i
think
my
dad
would
like
this
interesting
although
at
the
same
time
the
elder
flower
really
comes
off
strong
an
herbalist
friend
advises
that
elderflowers
are
used
as
a
mild
skin
astringent
and
to
open
pores
and
promote
perspiring
diaphoretic
such
a
reaction
was
not
attributable
by
this
taster
although
it
was
a
rather
hot
evening
a
unique
offering
looking
forward
to
zwaanze
day
to
try
the
newest
one
8
010
the
palate
opens
spicy
again
with
a
blend
of
crushed
white
pepper
and
a
jalapenolike
vegetal
spiciness
moderately
pefumey
the
midpalate
brings
out
the
base
lambic
wonderfully
lemony
and
lactic
this
has
a
solid
lipsmacking
tartness
a
little
oaky
with
some
vanilla
and
tannins
this
beer
dries
out
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
lemon
and
pepper
light
in
body
with
absolutely
wonderful
carbonation
this
is
airy
creamy
and
the
combination
of
sourness
and
spiciness
on
the
finish
is
unique
excellent
stuff
though
i
feel
like
the
elderflower
character
is
just
a
little
overdone
m
light
crisp
feel
but
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
bit
exposive
overall
an
interesting
beer
im
having
a
little
trouble
summing
it
up
here
because
it
seems
so
unique
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
o
this
beer
is
excellent
complex
fun
and
intriguing
i
wish
there
was
some
to
buy
from
the
brewery
because
its
amazing
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
so
drinkable
less
acidity
that
many
of
cantillons
offerings
on
par
with
something
like
fou
foune
light
apple
tartness
biscuity
malt
elderflower
that
vacillates
between
a
sort
of
musty
weediness
and
a
more
floral
sweet
hay
light
and
buoyant
mouthfeel
lush
carbonation
complex
and
so
drinkable
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
wish
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
just
superb
wow
this
is
one
that
ive
had
on
my
wants
list
that
i
just
assume
ill
never
end
up
with
hell
of
a
beer
to
review
and
to
do
it
blind
is
just
way
too
exciting
big
thank
you
to
overall
a
great
beer
and
another
winner
from
a
brewery
that
can
do
no
wrong
it
seems
this
beer
poured
to
be
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
right
away
you
can
smell
a
strong
interesting
aroma
of
floral
essence
sour
smooth
great
beer
overall
ive
become
a
big
fan
of
cantillon
beers
cheers
mamouche
from
a
bottle
pours
a
lightly
hazy
orange
with
a
large
white
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
and
loudly
beautiful
look
nose
is
herbal
mintlike
softly
funky
a
touch
cheesy
flavor
is
very
heavy
on
the
elder
flowers
which
comes
across
with
a
heavily
herbal
quality
when
they
tend
toward
minty
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
as
it
breaths
it
balances
out
a
bit
its
actually
a
fun
beer
kind
of
singular
not
one
of
their
more
funky
or
sour
offerings
but
definitely
well
executed
and
pretty
tasty
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
bold
amount
of
carbonation
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
ive
had
in
awhile
its
funky
salivating
and
fizzy
on
the
tongue
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
again
kiel
i
enjoyed
the
taste
which
has
plenty
of
herbal
qualities
which
i
would
compare
to
fennel
and
perhaps
a
slight
tinge
of
very
mild
pepper
and
cooking
herbs
like
sage
w
a
pinch
of
anise
maybe
it
is
very
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
what
is
contributed
by
the
elderflower
since
i
never
had
it
before
and
i
am
sure
some
of
the
flavor
comes
from
the
yeast
and
other
bacteria
making
it
even
more
complex
i
think
you
really
have
to
have
an
open
mind
since
it
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
sweetness
it
is
very
earthy
and
compares
in
a
way
to
gruit
with
the
astringent
herbal
notes
overall
i
say
it
is
not
the
best
i
have
had
from
cantillon
but
it
is
definitely
unique
and
worth
trying
especially
if
you
enjoy
more
earthyherbal
flavored
beer
d
finally
found
a
cantillon
beer
i
didnt
like
normally
i
cant
get
enough
of
cantillons
but
i
did
not
want
any
more
of
this
one
i
wasnt
sure
what
elderflowers
would
smell
or
taste
like
but
apparently
its
peppers
most
people
at
the
tasting
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
but
to
me
it
was
too
spicey
and
dominated
by
peppers
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
pours
golden
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
some
good
lacing
as
it
went
down
the
nose
brought
forward
quite
a
bit
of
jalapeno
skin
and
green
peppers
very
odd
there
is
a
bit
of
light
floral
character
there
as
well
in
addition
to
some
mild
herbs
the
pepper
character
is
really
overwhelming
and
takes
the
flavor
even
more
really
odd
and
not
very
enjoyable
some
vegetable
character
there
as
well
coasts
the
mouth
really
very
strange
and
i
did
not
enjoy
this
one
o
unique
and
enjoyable
but
ultimately
not
one
of
cantillons
top
offerings
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
will
be
limited
due
to
the
floral
nature
of
the
brew
overall
i
thought
this
was
the
most
one
of
a
kind
brew
of
the
night
so
floral
and
sour
at
the
same
time
very
unique
and
for
that
i
give
it
props
skal
nicely
carbonated
flavors
are
very
floral
very
earthy
slightly
woody
citrus
notes
and
a
extremely
well
balanced
tartness
very
refreshing
something
i
could
drink
everyday
and
never
get
sick
of
notes
this
is
a
fine
lambic
i
will
say
that
the
appearance
and
the
nose
outdo
the
palate
recommended
for
a
drink
now
lambic
d
a
worthy
new
addition
to
the
cantillon
range
i
find
this
very
drinkable
my
memory
is
a
bit
hazy
after
the
brewery
tour
but
from
what
i
recall
i
bought
this
75cl
bottle
at
somewhere
between
5
and
7
euros
from
the
brewery
which
to
me
seems
very
reasonable
however
i
have
no
idea
what
the
imported
price
would
be
like
medium
bodied
nice
carbonation
as
previously
noted
far
from
my
favorite
from
cantillon
but
still
a
very
interesting
lambic
super
pungent
nose
like
you
stuck
your
nose
in
a
spice
mill
just
tons
of
pepper
overwhelming
at
first
with
some
floral
perfume
emanating
bretty
taste
perfumey
spice
throughout
with
a
musty
floral
earthiness
throughout
but
not
too
acidic
the
dominant
character
is
from
these
elderflowers
really
odd
tons
of
assertive
bretty
flavor
good
carb
but
not
spritzery
not
my
favorite
cantillon
but
nice
to
try
for
sure
ill
revisit
the
madouche
i
mean
mamouche
version
d
overall
a
decent
if
unremarkable
beer
glad
i
got
a
shot
at
it
d
not
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
cantillon
but
they
cant
all
be
winners
flavor
is
a
bit
weird
and
the
spiciness
just
doesnt
work
with
the
sour
flavor
this
beer
has
not
bad
by
any
means
and
id
love
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
im
just
not
as
eager
to
revisit
it
as
i
would
some
other
lambics
d
certainly
a
different
look
at
the
style
fun
and
engaging
for
sure
bottle
2009
zwanze
opens
with
a
very
minimal
pop
the
cork
was
completely
crappy
and
took
a
lot
of
work
to
get
out
slightly
hazed
yellow
straw
color
with
a
nice
head
the
aroma
is
floral
wih
a
then
strong
green
chili
notes
and
some
bread
like
qualities
the
taste
is
also
fairly
floral
with
the
chilis
making
their
presence
known
lingering
bitterness
some
citrus
zesty
lemon
notes
as
well
light
mouthfeel
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
has
a
very
unique
flavor
that
i
think
is
either
love
it
or
hate
it
the
body
and
carbonation
levels
are
appropriate
for
the
style
good
overall
i
felt
this
beer
was
extremely
unique
but
it
was
more
of
a
noteworthy
curiosity
rather
than
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
overall
i
like
it
better
than
the
mamouche
it
has
more
elderflowers
and
it
works
better
with
the
spices
somewhat
drinkable
wow
cantillon
never
dissapoints
loads
of
citrus
lemon
peel
oak
and
sharp
crisp
tartness
the
floral
aspect
isnt
over
the
top
rather
the
mild
funk
and
strong
tartness
are
in
the
forefront
finishes
slightly
dry
mild
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
and
of
course
like
all
cantillon
lambics
booze
isnt
noticeable
this
is
why
i
love
cantillon
beers
i
havent
had
one
yet
that
i
didnt
love
but
this
one
specifically
is
just
simply
wonderful
good
stuff
unique
for
sure
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
the
elderflowers
really
add
a
lot
of
character
to
the
beer
and
make
it
a
unique
addition
to
the
cantillon
line
up
not
my
favorite
cantillon
but
still
quite
good
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out

4
or
5
bottles
later
and
i
find
myself
loving
this
beer
very
unique
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
drinkable
stuff
more
funky
than
sour
and
acidic
really
nice
shared
a
bottle
with
sammy
at
beer
bistro
in
toronto
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
huge
white
fluffy
head
smell
is
quite
sour
with
some
herbs
and
berries
the
sour
flavour
is
pretty
big
for
me
though
i
havent
tried
too
many
sour
beers
yet
i
had
to
have
a
glass
of
water
part
way
in
to
cleanse
my
palate
a
bit
but
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
huge
carbonation
level
bomber
at
beerbistro
shared
with
ken
cloudy
yellow
with
orange
tinge
and
alcey
funky
aroma
but
pleasant
not
barnyard
with
some
herbs
lambic
some
sourness
that
is
hidden
behind
herbal
and
definate
elderberries
the
palate
feels
a
delayed
harshness
a
break
of
water
helped
to
get
through
it
and
i
imagine
food
would
certainly
drinkability
flowers
are
beautiful
i
think
this
is
a
beer
that
youre
either
going
want
a
lot
more
of
or
not
have
again
i
dont
care
a
ton
if
i
encounter
this
again
as
i
mentioned
this
is
one
of
the
more
accessible
cantillons
ive
come
across
unless
im
becoming
immune
its
hugely
drinkable
and
a
pleasure
to
consume
superwin
750
ml
bottle
into
my
narke
tulip
pour
is
nothing
to
discuss
as
this
beer
is
all
about
the
elder
flowers
going
in
i
had
no
idea
what
one
smelled
like
now
i
know
and
i
wont
be
searching
them
out
again
a
super
strong
acidic
chilipepperish
aroma
attacks
your
nose
from
the
start
almost
stinging
it
like
a
whiff
of
a
strong
medication
i
can
almost
visualize
waves
of
the
aroma
coming
off
it
like
its
some
cartoon
characterization
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
but
thankfully
its
toned
down
a
bit
and
not
nearly
as
harsh
the
astringency
is
much
weaker
especially
as
your
drink
it
i
guess
you
almost
get
used
it
to
its
certainly
a
unique
flavor
something
probably
worth
trying
but
one
that
is
just
not
for
me
despite
a
relatively
high
score
that
i
give
it
for
its
uniqueness
and
effort
d
i
personally
liked
this
one
and
enjoyed
the
floral
notes
i
would
def
drink
again
and
would
love
to
see
how
this
one
ages
as
well
d
this
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
had
a
significant
amount
of
this
one
i
get
the
feeling
that
the
elder
flower
flavor
is
pretty
polarizing
if
you
dont
like
it
you
probably
wont
enjoy
this
very
much
thankfully
im
in
the
like
it
camp
drinkability
interesting
and
not
something
i
would
pursue
again
a
few
ounces
would
have
been
plenty
it
does
taste
better
after
it
breaths
some
d
one
could
probably
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
im
not
sure
i
would
really
want
to
i
could
smell
it
all
day
though
d
profoundly
interesting
what
an
experience
this
is
a
great
beer
to
share
with
a
few
folks
i
am
thrilled
at
the
opportunity
to
try
this
rare
delicacy
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
slightly
more
body
than
other
cantillons
ive
had
recently
pretty
bitter
as
well
very
herbal
in
the
bitterness
still
im
getting
some
flowery
hoppy
characters
in
the
back
the
beer
is
almost
spicy
in
a
sense
still
pepper
character
in
there
beer
is
overall
balanced
and
unique
the
oddest
lambic
ive
had
from
cantillon
still
pretty
good
overall
a
very
unique
beer
but
as
states
above
the
elderflowers
really
need
to
be
toned
down
sour
perfume
is
the
result
an
interesting
if
two
dimensional
beer
bottle
poured
a
dirty
yellowish
color
lambic
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
very
good
lacing
as
well
aroma
is
absolutely
dominated
by
elder
flowers
and
is
somewhat
of
an
acquired
taste
taste
is
also
dominated
by
elder
flowers
and
provides
a
floral
and
somewhat
peppery
taste
to
this
beer
which
is
well
integrated
with
the
tart
and
oak
from
the
base
lambic
very
refreshing
overall
though
a
bit
too
much
flowers
for
my
taste
taste
is
quite
sourtart
caught
me
offguard
after
drinking
an
84
gueuze
that
was
more
sweet
than
sour
wonderful
sourness
in
this
beer
and
definitely
picking
up
some
of
the
spice
that
the
flowers
contribute
definitely
finished
dry
but
left
you
wanting
more
d
this
was
indeed
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
and
in
this
case
interesting
wasnt
a
polite
way
of
saying
not
very
good
i
enjoyed
this
experience
and
hope
to
have
other
years
of
the
zwanze
beers
the
beer
is
salty
and
earthy
with
notes
of
citrus
oak
dill
and
musty
cheese
the
elderflower
tastes
herbal
and
rather
strange
but
interesting
the
finish
is
dry
and
moderately
sour
with
a
lingering
floral
presence
this
is
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
though
not
particularly
drinkable
the
few
ounces
were
enough
for
me
d
not
the
most
drinkable
unique
and
one
of
a
kind
for
sure
drinkability
finished
the
750ml
by
myself
quite
easily
and
then
wondered
why
i
didnt
buy
another
bottle
or
two
but
id
opted
for
a
fresh
st
lamvinus
to
travel
back
with
and
the
luggage
was
getting
heavy
so
glad
i
got
to
taste
zwanze
2009
though
cantillons
2009
released
beers
are
amazing
even
for
their
high
standards
this
is
the
third
ive
tried
after
blabaer
and
fou
foune
that
have
been
just
wow
lots
of
carbonation
and
very
sessionable
d
well
considering
that
is
not
my
favorite
style
great
drink
exceptional
for
sure
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
if
possible
overall
i
only
like
this
style
of
beers
if
they
are
of
extremely
high
quality
about
the
zwanze
i
can
only
say
i
didnt
like
it
i
loved
it
a
unique
beer
with
a
unique
taste
a
great
experiment
from
the
cantillon
brewers
this
must
be
the
most
well
balanced
lambic
beer
i
ever
had
together
with
the
dirty
horse
from
de
struise
brewers
i
think
this
beer
might
become
even
better
over
time
i
think
it
is
still
a
bit
young
so
in
case
you
manage
to
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
now
be
patient
it
will
be
rewarded
for
sure
by
the
way
the
brewer
advised
me
to
open
my
bottle
at
least
30
minutes
before
drinking
overall
another
killer
sour
by
cantillon
the
amount
of
fruit
flavor
they
get
in
the
beers
is
amazing
also
the
funkiness
is
unlike
any
other
breweries
and
they
are
the
almost
at
the
level
of
refreshing
as
berliners
and
goses
st
lam
13
vintage
brought
direct
from
brussels
begins
with
prickly
unripe
grapes
among
earthy
leathery
malts
the
grapes
turn
sweeter
riper
as
the
malts
stand
out
against
the
tart
sourness
adding
stone
fruit
qualities
to
the
taste
at
the
same
time
carried
by
a
lively
carbonation
the
sourness
becomes
quite
intense
with
a
vinegar
note
evoked
by
the
fermented
grape
sourness
while
both
tastes
blend
well
together
wrapped
up
by
the
wooden
barrel
finishes
with
a
tongue
quenching
slightly
dry
sourness
along
with
lemon
zest
and
grape
pulp
the
beer
still
reminds
me
in
many
ways
of
a
young
wine
while
missing
its
typical
sweetness
replaced
by
the
typical
lambic
tartness
with
a
refreshing
high
carbonation
thanks
to
kyle
for
a
long
time
want
took
a
long
time
for
the
distinctive
diaper
smell
to
wane
grapes
are
not
overwhelming
but
the
big
fruit
tartness
really
hangs
on

the
opportunity
was

grape

very
nice
as
with

entries
i
find
this
immensely
simple
but
incredibly
flavorful
the
nose
is
sour
winish
earthy

and
purple

the
flavor
is
sour
tart
and
simple
people
grapes
and
cherry
so
simplistic

it

o
really
glad
i
have
a
2010
to
visit
soon
and
would
love
to
try
older
vintages
of
this
o
very
complex
and
well
balanced
with
the
funk
oak
and
grapes
in
this
beer
o
i
expected
great
things
and
i
got
great
things
in
its
complexity
its
a
very
well
balanced
funk
fruit
vinous
lambic
that
delivers
a
winner
for
sure
the
flavor
is
so
good
even
popped
a
bottle
with
some
spaghetti
bolo
in
belgium
cuz
why
not
the
grape
flavor
is
so
nice
vinous
merlot
grape
fruit
bomb
with
the
classic
cantillon
gueuze
feel
it
blends
together
well
and
creates
a
very
refreshing
hybrid

between

and

love

of
grape
and

taste
follows
the
nose
with
a

combo
that
is
so
smooth

you
get
big
merlot
flavors
with
a
subtle
barrel
oakiness
and
tang
not

sour
and
not

sweet
feel
is
crazy
impressive
with
a
aggressive

not
frothy

very

this
definitely
grew
on
me
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
bottle
not
knowing
quite
what
to
expect
i
was
perhaps
underwhelmed
or
just
unappreciative
at
first

as
i
drank
more
the
balanced

became
more

just

overall
not
my
favorite
offering
from
cantillon
i
anticipated
a
little
more
fruit
however
a
wonderful
lambic
nonetheless
st
lamvinus
was
awesome
but
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
less
of
this
cantillon
masterpiece
glad
i
got
to
try
it
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
one
in
my
cellar
in
a
couple
decades
overall
a
tasty
beer
the
acidity
is
sharp
and
like
vinegar
and
the
funk
really
increases
as
it
warms
crisp
acidic
fruity
brite
o
this
is
another
solid
lambic
from
cantillon
but
its
not
my
favorite
one
the
wine
is
there
and
add
some
nice
presence
but
it
is
a
bit
overdrawn
but
the
tartness
and
is
lacking
on
the
funk
all
of
that
said
it
is
still
great
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
oan
amazing
beer
balance
is
where
it
should
be
maybe
it
could
be
more
sour
but
you
can
still
taste
this
beer
a
day
after
having
o
really
enjoyed
it
not
as
sour
as
i
liked
but
still
a
very
very
enjoyable
beer
what
awesome
timing
having
a
grapeimbued
lambic
while
standing
next
to
a
wine
connoisseur
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
lightlyhazy
fuchsia
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
pinkish
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
blue
raspberry
light
sour
cherry
sour
grape
a
hint
of
grapefruit
zest
and
a
light
smattering
of
funk
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
everything
showing
off
some
powerful
sour
chops
this
is
kept
in
partial
check
though
by
the
funk
which
though
relatively
mild
in
its
individual
expression
also
blends
in
nicely
with
its
acidic
surroundings
the
grape
character
is
pronounced
but
not
overt
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
another
damn
fine
fruited
lambic
from
cantillon
one
of
the
highlights
of
a
night
that
included
quite
a
few
ridiculous
sours
of
various
styles
and
im
happy
to
say
that
the
aforementioned
wine
aficionado
was
also
impressed
by
this
offering
i
was
not
surprised
overall
this
is
the
probably
the
best
grape
sour
that
i
have
drank
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
o
yep
another
great
cantillon
difficult
to
write
about
these
similar
in
so
many
ways
and
i
know
the
bottle
states
serve
warmer
but
i
prefer
colder
overall
a
subtle
yeast
funk
character
and
chewy
texture
to
match
with
floating
funky
red
fruit
in
a
champagne
glass
but
its
beer
its
a
winner
and
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
cantillon
beers
ive
had
m
very
dry
medium
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
outstanding
a
beer
that
demands
thought
and
attention
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
wasnt
as
impressed
it
comes
off
as
maybe
a
bit
too
subtle
but
this
really
is
one
of
better
cantillons
ive
had
love
the
drinkability
and
the
fruitfunk
balance
cantillon
does
it
again
and
i
cant
say
that
im
surprised
these
are
the
beers
you
hear
about
when
you
first
start
getting
into
craft
beer
all
your
buds
talk
about
this
cantillon
place
like
its
some
kind
of
holy
grail
for
beer
and
eventually
months
and
months
go
by
and
you
finally
get
to
try
one
and
all
of
a
sudden
youre
talking
about
it
like
youre
some
kind
of
sour
expert
this
shit
is
excellent
why
does
it
have
to
be
so
far
from
me
thank
you
churchkey
made
my
d
c
experience
one
hell
of
a
beer
especially
if
you
moonlight
as
wine
snob
overall
this
was
alright
but
the
feel
kept
it
from
being
all
it
could
be
the
nose
was
enticing
and
there
were
good
flavors
in
there
as
well
but
a
creamier
and
smoother
feel
would
have
helped
this
be
top
class
still
an
enjoyale
fruit
lambic
worth
checking
out
for
sure
cheers
overall
this
is
as
good
as
it
got
for
my
experience
at
brasserie
cantillon
having
already
tried
the
regular
lineup
lpk
and
lpf
this
one
is
my
absolute
favorite
there
are
characteristics
of
a
tasty
red
wine
here
for
sure
yet
it
tastes
like
a
great
lambic
beer
with
the
carbonation
of
champagne
its
just
an
awesome
brew
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
with
the
opportunity
to
purchase
a
bottle
if
i
get
more
of
these
they
are
going
into
the
cellar
to
be
cracked
on
special
occasions
o
wow
what
a
brew
this
blend
is
absolutely
fantastic
especially
with
the
nearly
2
years
on
the
bottle
i
suppose
the
funkiness
has
developed
a
bit
this
one
really
opens
up
with
a
blast
of
funksourtart
and
the
oak
has
also
shown
up
more
quite
pricey
i
paid
30
for
a
750
ml
bottle
but
well
worth
the
investment
this
is
a
musttry
once
the
beer
gets
warmer
i
get
the
raisins
by
some
wines
typical
aroma
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
awesome
beer
this
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
with
pink
foaming
theres
a
tart
aroma
light
and
dry
which
gets
sweeter
as
it
warms
it
has
a
pleasing
rounded
tartness
i
keep
tasting
cherries
with
a
touch
of
a
funky
undertone
this
was
incredible
a
real
treat
to
try
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
one
as
far
as
cantillon
saint
lam
and
blabaer
now
are
past
fou
foune
for
me
saint
lam
is
artfully
crafted
even
more
than
blabaer
imo
the
balance
of
this
lambic
is
intense
opened
ddg
today
too
and
saint
lam
is
more
enjoyable
by
far
for
me
cant
wait
to
open
the
08
for
my
brothers
40th
d
fantastic
complexity
and
balance
cost
35
for
a
750

bottle
o
another
excellent
beer
i
have
through
the
roof
to
have
been
about
to
try
this
beer
i
hope
ill
have
another
chance
to
try
it
again
in
the
future

drinkable

this
beer
is
excellent
worth
seeking
out
fantastic
and
exceptionally
drinkable
overall
this
is
excellent
lambing
style
overall
this
is
a
delicious
drinking
lambic
beer
the
addition
of
merlot
grapes
crosses
into
wine
territory
and
thereby
invites
comparison
to
wine
as
it
gets
flat
in
the
glass
it
starts
to
look
like
a
rosé
wine
but
the
main
impression
i
get
is
the
strong
presence
of
brett
considered
an
infection
by
wine
makers
but
welcomed
by
lambic
makers
no
place
to
sort
all
that
out
here
but
this
is
an
excellent
complex
sour
beer
to
sip
while
pondering
the
commonalities
and
differences
between
lambic
beers
and
wine
o
exceedingly
drinkable
the
sourness
is
balanced
with
the
fruit
nicely
oak
and
merlot
grape
flavorsaromas
are
much
subtler
than
i
was
expecting
o
a
nice
beer
o
probably
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
a
balance
d
great
sourtart
flavor
with
fruit
grape
and
a
crisp
bubbly
really
drinkable
feel
i
understand
why
cantillon
is
number
one
overall
another
great
lambic
from
cantillon
not
mindblowing
but
definitely
worth
seeking
out
solid
classic
sour
oone
of
the
best
fruit
lambics
around
im
hard
pressed
to
name
many
i
would
take
over
this
really
wish
bottles
werent
so
hard
to
come
by
o
very
delicious
sour
funky
and
really
drinkable
magic
pours
raspberry
pinky
color
a
little
hazy
with
a
finger
or
more
of
tiny
white
bubbles
stacked
together
very
very
puckery
sour
nose
lambic
funky
plenty
of
yeast
mouth
watering
aromas
i
smell
grape
must
in
there
with
the
tart
lemon
acidity
the
flavor
is
true
to
the
nose
with
the
sourness
being
every
bit
as
intense
almost
hurts
the
jaw
its
so
sour
fruit
provides
more
flavor
than
sweetness
and
this
may
be
the
best
grape
or
wine
based
beer
out
there
its
dryish
in
the
finish
but
still
mouth
watering
at
the
same
time
brightly
carbonated
very
active
which
helps
to
cut
through
some
of
the
acidity
which
is
huge
the
body
is
very
light
but
i
dont
think
id
feel
good
if
i
drank
a
whole
750ml
bottle
of
this
on
my
own
the
acidity
and
sourness
would
turn
the
stomach
overall
though
this
is
awesome
stuff
from
cantillon
one
of
my
favorites
ive
had
from
them
the
legend
grows
for
me
very
good
lambic
great
vinous

a

one
to

while
both
are
absolutely
delicious
still
hard
to
believe
how
wildly
different
they
are
o
this
is
a
beautiful

very
tart

very

dont

reminds

of
the
kriek

the
rose

im
not
finding
a

of

here
but
its
very
good
great
beer
750ml

over
the
years
many
2007

2010
and

bottles
are
so
good
right
now
one
of
my
favorites
ruby
red
almost
plum
colored
body
with
a
thin
cap
full
of
tiny
bubbles
musty
red
wine
grapes
barnyard
soft
oak
lightly
aged
cheese
and
lactic
tartness
at
first
the
nose
seems
real
straightforward
but
as
you
keep
diving
in
more
layers
reveal
themselves
on
the
palate
sweet
yet
tart
red
grapes
up
front
with
a
mustiness
coming
out
midpalate
barnyard
notes
through
the
middle
with
some
oak
before
a
final
rush
of
cherries
and
grapes
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
a
long
lingering
tartness
in
the
finish
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
perfect
carbonation
this
lambic
is
a
great
bridge
beer
for
the
wine
drinker
loads
of
wine
grape
flavor
with
a
moderate
tartness
this
could
easily
win
over
some
wine
drinkers
i
found
this
to
be
delicious
the
flavors
are
bold
and
really
release
off
the
palate
quickly
to
reveal
this
lingering
tartness
that
satisfies
the
sour
cravings
note
i
was
a
little
concerned
as
when
i
received
this
from
the
shipping
trade
it
had
clearly
had
some
leakage
with
some
beer
seeping
out
and
coating
the
outside
of
the
bottle
even
with
the
cork
and
cap
when
i
opened
it
up
a
couple
weeks
later
there
was
some
fluid
in
between
the
cork
and
top
of
cap
and
the
cork
was
soaked
through
i
was
afraid
it
was
going
to
be
a
flat
mess
or
have
some
other
unappealing
character
as
a
result
luckily
it
did
not
so
just
a
heads
up
if
that
happens
to
anyone
else
dont
fret
your
nectar
of
the
gods
is
likely
just
fine
oreally
enjoyable
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
and
easily
my
favorite
of
the
style
so
far
o
this
beer
is
very
funky
and
sour
and
therefore
one
must
devote
ones
full
attention
to
the
grapes
to
see
what
theyre
doing
here
adding
depth
without
distracting
from
the
intense
character
of
the
base
beer
o
one
of
the
best
cantillons
ive
had
choosing
a
favorite
between
any
cantys
is
a
spoiled
choice
o
i
thought
id
like
this
one
but
its
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
my
mate
hated
it
as
well
awful
awful
beer
overall
an
amazing
treat
fantastically
delicious
i
hope
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
one
day
for
sure
o
nice
and
sour
yet
refreshing
this
beer
by
cantillon
is
a
treat
o
probably
my
fav
sour
to
date
i
love
this
stuff
overall
not
the
most
amazing
fruit
flavor
ive
had
in
a
lambic
but
it
certainly
doesnt
detract
from
the
beer
i
feel
as
though
the
cantillon
lambic
profile
calls
for
lighter
fruits
a
la
fou
foune
verdict
far
and
away
one
of
my
favorite
cantillons
we
drank
this
side
by
side
with
vigneronne
and
bruocsella
and
it
was
by
far
the
winner
this
might
be
bested
only
by
fou
foune
right
now
as
my
favorite
loon
definitely
one
to
seek
out
and
enjoy
with
friends
o
extremely
impressed
with
this
lambic
wasnt
sure
how
i
would
like
it
compared
to
others
i
have
had
but
st
lamvinus
is
outstanding
this
was
awesome
perhaps
one
of
my
favorite
cantillon
beers
to
date
the
grapes
and
red
fruit
flavor
were
a
perfect
match
for
the
sour
and
funk
that
is
all
things
cantillon
o
an
excellent
cantillon
id
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
a
very
good
lambic
excellent
beer
the
smell
is
the
weak
point
and
its
still
great
and
the
taste
is
just
wonderful
great
balance
of
sweetness
and
tartness
with
a
healthy
dose
of
funk
very
drinkable
great
with
friends
overall
very
good
not
the
best
cantillon
i
have
had
but
certainly
really
enjoyable
2010
vintage
this
one
pours
a
lighter
bodied
dark
cranberry
red
in
color
with
a
one
finger
slightly
pink
head
the
nose
is
dry
and
musty
with
a
nice
amount
of
funk
and
acidity
the
flavors
are
dry
and
tart
and
it
has
nice
acidity
as
a
wine
drinker
i
must
say
that
this
has
zero
characteristics
of
a
merlot
so
its
nice
to
see
the
difference
between
the
beer
and
wine
this
one
is
musty
as
hell
it
drinks
light
with
nice
acidity
but
i
cant
really
like
the
flavor
it
doesnt
have
enough
fruit
character
for
my
liking
this
is
the
best
vintage
ive
had
so
far
the
07
smells
like
puppy
farts
in
my
opinion
as
in
i
just
fed
my
dog
too
many
rawhides
puppy
farts
i
definitely
prefer
this
vintage
to
that
one
tart
easy
lambic
a
good
place
to
start
for
the
novice
not
deep
but
nice
o
a
delicious
beer
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
cantillon
complex
yet
highly
drinkable
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
take
for
granted
in
the
chase
for
all
the
rarer
cantillons
and
3f
its
fantastic
enough
fruit
to
balance
the
acidity
and
funk
big
fan
o
probably
the
best
sour
i
have
had
to
date
beautiful
soreness
with
some
grape
flavor
and
lots
of
funk
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
and
lively
from
the
carbonation
very
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
overall
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
quite
a
bit
glad
i
have
another
one
coming
my
way
so
i
can
really
let
it
age
and
see
how
sour
it
can
get
o
great
all
around
really
drinkable
and
refreshing
o
a
pretty
strange
lambic
maybe
the
ideal
bottle
age
is
1
year
the
one
i
have
now
seems
too
fresh
and
uninteresting
but
if
it
is
too
old
it
is
very
potent
and
sour
one
of
my
favorite
cantillon
and
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
to
convert
your
red
wine
loving
friends
over
to
our
side
very
enjoyable
and
curious
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
very
very
good
looking
pink
almost
purple
with
excellent
head
retention
a
bitter
sweet
and
tart
aroma
with
loads
of
funk
still
soft
and
hints
of
grain
once
in
a
while
tastes
slightly
sweet
very
tart
with
pronounced
grape
at
the
end
strong
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
yes
this
is
a
cantillon
and
yes
it
is
sour
but
not
really
sour
i
would
say
kinda
tart
this
beer
has
a
body
that
is
in
between
light
and
medium
with
some
low
cab
in
the
mix
i
think
5
years
in
the
bottle
may
bring
up
the
sour
but
will
for
sure
bring
out
the
funk
more
lamvinus
is
not
the
mouth
puckering
sour
bomb
that
you
may
expect
but
a
well
integrated
beer
resembling
wine
this
stuff
is
kick
ass
odefinitely
a
cantillon
a
very
approachable
beer
for
someone
who
is
overwhelmed
by
the
sourness
of
their
straight
guezue
d
nice
experience
with
an
a
long
aftertaste
drink
well
overall
its
an
awesome
beer
no
doubt
about
it
well
balanced
this
brew
seemingly
strips
all
te
moisture
from
the
mouth
it
is
excessively
drinkable
with
a
medium
body
and
modest
to
lighter
level
of
carbonation
throughout
the
experience
there
was
little
to
no
alcohol
impact
while
not
my
favorite
cantillon
offering
this
is
still
good
and
something
i
would
try
again
if
i
could
get
a
very
young
bottle
or
something
quite
old
for
comparison
purposes
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
lambic
i
have
ever
had
it
hits
right
in
my
wheelhouse
funky
sour
tart
fruity
tannic
but
none
are
over
the
top
or
out
of
balance
really
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
because
the
flavor
profile
is
so
straightforward
and
yet
so
complex
at
the
same
time
because
each
of
the
subtle
flavors
makes
an
appearance
as
you
sample
def
worth
trading
forseeking
out
and
laying
out
a
little
extra
if
need
be
to
obtain
o
delicous
od
a
solid
flavourful
beer
that
i
enjoyed
on
a
sunny
afternoon
very
tasty
thanks
mark
let
me
know
when
my
beers
arrive
and
lets
do
it
again
sometime
overall
this
is
a
great
sour
beer
the
fruit
and
tart
flavors
mix
well
with
lots
of
funk
12172011
o
nice
balance
between
sour
and
soft
o
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
the
aroma
was
amazing
and
i
was
expecting
the
taste
to
be
really
puckering
but
it
was
very
mellow
and
balanced
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
definite
gem
from
cantillon
d
im
a
big
fan
of
st
lamvinus
on
draft
and
may
even
prefer
it
to
its
bottled
counterpart
very
refreshing
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
my
favorite
cantillon
and
the
best
bottle
i
have
had
the
funk
elements
in
this
bottle
are
outstanding
and
more
refined
than
the
other
cantillons
that
i
have
had
thus
this
is
the
most
balanced
cantillon
i
have
ever
come
across
i
love
the
merlot
grapes
they
are
fantastic
the
tannins
really
add
some
awesome
elements
and
really
allow
this
beer
to
shine
and
develop
into
just
pure
awesomeness
this
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
looking
pinkish
red
color
with
a
fizzy
light
pink
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
very
minimal
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
plenty
of
merlot
grape
aromas
along
with
the
tart
aromas
of
the
wild
fermentation
this
brew
has
gone
through
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
tart
grape
flavor
up
front
with
a
dry
funky
aftertaste
that
would
probably
interest
most
wine
lovers
to
try
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
think
and
dry
not
overly
carbonated
at
all
overall
this
brew
was
pretty
good
im
not
sure
if
i
would
ever
buy
this
one
again
mainly
because
of
the
price
tag
on
it
i
enjoyed
having
it
though
and
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
highly
recommend
o
not
the
best
ive
had
especially
from
cantillon
but
still
good
reminds
me
of
mediterranean
food
like
tapenade
or
putanesca
sauce
smell
was
really
offputting
im
wondering
if
this
bottle
was
infected
o
everyone
should
have
the
opportunity
to
experience
this
wonderful
creation
this
is
what
other
lambics
want
to
taste
like
o
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
think
i
might
prefer
some
of
the
others
from
the
crew
there
in
brussels
to
this
one
d
this
beer
has
a
sense
of
mystique
to
me
i
know
that
i
didnt
pick
up
everything
in
that
glass
but
what
i
did
grab
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
found
this
to
be
as
unique
as
anything
ive
yet
encountered
great
stuff
would
actively
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
fantastic
treat
elegant
and
full
of
flavour
but
still
easy
to
drink
went
through
the
first
glass
way
to
quickly
luckily
im
drinking
this
alone
and
have
another
glass
left
who
says
drinking
alone
is
a
bad
thing
if
i
had
money
to
burn
i
would
drink
this
stuff
often
o
if
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
to
myself
i
could
see
myself
finishing
it
in
10
minutes
its
just
that
good
i
love
good
right
bank
bordeaux
so
adding
merlot
and
cab
franc
grapes
to
lambic
makes
sense
to
me
it
certainly
worked
here
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
a
touch
too
sour
there
are
some
nice
flavors
going
on
there
but
the
sour
aspect
overwhelms
everything
else
overall
this
beer
is
stellar
im
on
the
lookout
for
more
yum
tastes
like
you
think
it
would
gueuze
with
grapes
id
like
to
age
one
of
these
bring
out
the
sour
a
bit
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
was
only
slightly
overshadowed
by
the
2003
lou
pepe
framboise
tasted
almost
directly
after
quite
wine
like
and
nicely
balanced
curious
to
see
what
a
few
years
will
do
to
the
flavors
d
the
beer
was
drinking
amazing
and
a
great
sour
bite
very
glad
to
have
this
one
again
kudos
to
city
beer
and
a
great
bragging
rights
experience
however
not
a
brew
to
remember
o
overall
this
was
a
great
treat
i
was
amped
to
see
this
on
the
tap
list
at
10
for
a
7
oz
pour
it
was
a
bit
spendy
but
it
was
a
luxury
that
i
would
try
again
another
wonderful
expression
of
fruit
from
cantillon
very
well
balanced
despite
some
extreme
flavors
at
work
a
shame
this
is
so
difficult
to
find
these
days
overall
a
pretty
good
lambic
its
not
super
sour
or
extremely
funky
but
more
balanced
if
there
is
such
a
thing
when
it
comes
to
lambics
from
cantillon
this
would
make
a
good
intro
for
those
wanting
to
taste
a
more
serious
lambic
overy
good
beer
cant
wait
to
see
it
with
age
o
very
well
put
together
considering
how
nervous
i
was
after
smelling
it
i
have
not
jumped
into
this
style
very
often
however
this
beer
tickles
my
palate
to
explore
further
as
such
i
will
o
i
enjoyed
my
glass
of
this
one
sometimes
the
combination
of
funk
and
grapes
doesnt
always
work
but
it
really
does
here
yet
another
winner
from
cantillon
this
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
i
could
not
give
you
the
exact
shade
as
it
was
quite
late
and
deep
ellum
is
pretty
dark
inside
anyways
the
smell
is
acetic
and
sour
right
of
the
back
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
in
there
but
barely
noticeable
over
the
sour
smell
the
taste
is
sour
with
red
wine
notes
and
acidity
a
superb
balance
between
the
wine
grape
flavor
and
the
sour
lambic
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
mouth
wateringly
sour
overall
this
is
the
best
sour
beer
i
have
ever
had
overall
i
could
easily
see
myself
knocking
back
a
few
bottles
of
this
however
my
wallet
cant
see
that
overall
a
great
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
edit
got
to
try
some
on
tap
at
triple
rock
wow
this
beer
just
keeps
getting
better
every
time
i
drink
it
really
a
perfect
representation
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
fruit
lambics
that
cantillon
makes
in
my
opinion
only
rivaled
by
lou
pepe
kriek
in
cantillons
normal
line
snatch
this
one
up
if
you
can
amazing
fresh
and
gets
more
and
more
graceful
as
it
ages
o
good
overall
a
fantastic
beer
from
cantillon
and
maybe
the
best
lambic
ive
ever
tasted
absolutely
amazing
o
one
of
the
best
lambics
i
have
ever
tried
overall
this
is
impressive
i
could
sip
on
this
regularly
if
only
it
didnt
cost
40
per
bottle
out
this
way
o
overall
this
was
spectacular
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
on
tap
and
even
more
glad
that
i
have
a
bottle
tucked
away
in
my
cellar
minor
edit
the
nose
didnt
put
me
off
from
getting
2
pours
of
this
just
sayin
overall
awesome
just
friggen
awesome
drink
i
am
not
sad
to
say
but
more
happy
to
say
i
am
being
a
huge
fan
of
cantillon
and
want
a
whole
ton
more
of
it
this
was
simply
a
great

every
respect

on

lingers
for
an
extended
period
a
wonderful
fruit
lambic
from
cantillon
with
great
sour
character
but
still
enough
flavor
to
carry
the
aggressiveness
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
monks
at
their
cantillon
event
today
the
beer
poured
and
looked
much
like
a
red
wine
would
it
was
a
deep
purple
red
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
at
all
the
aroma
too
mirrored
a
red
wine
but
was
less
intense
and
had
a
bit
of
a
vinegary
thing
happening
along
with
a
bit
of
mild
funk
the
red
wine
thing
continues
in
the
flavor
this
beer
very
closely
mirrors
a
lighter
much
more
pleasant
and
enjoyable
for
me
anyway
version
of
a
merlot
very
good
beer
but
not
necessarily
one
that
blew

says

allowing
the
brett
to
do
its
thing
and
develop
more
wild
character
would
take
this
to
a
whole
new
level
i
liked
the
cuvee
de
champion
but
this
is
clearly
in
another
league
best
fruit
lambic
ive
had
probably
my
favorite
cantillon
to
date
but
i
still
have
a
hard
time
believe
its
worth
that
price
that
said
im
not
sure
i
could
pass
this
up
if
it
was
sitting
on
the
shelf
this
is
a
real
treat
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
o
good
heck
pretty
damn
good
maybe
great
too
pricey
though
and
cantillon
has
better
fruit
lambics
ill
be
passing
on
this
one

this
time
certainly
was
noteworthy
the

closed

pressing
the

refuse
closer
into
the
chamber
the
aluminum
walls
reeked
of

skins

notes

improvement
i
could

and
its
only
a
small

a
little

d

not
intestine
twisting
after
the
kriek
yesterday
i
had
a
few
rounds
of
the
quick
step
but
i
dont
imagine
there
will
be
an
encore
performance
tonight
solid
all
around
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
just
had
a
bit
too
much
sour
going
on
for
me
it
was
pleasant
in
the
aroma
but
really
dominated
the
flavor
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
balance
but
then
again
it
is
possible
that
the
age
had
mellowed
the
grapes
and
let
the
sour
shine
through
more
it
was
definitely
quite
the
experience
to
drink
this
beer
though
especially
in
good
company
overall
a
delightful

pours
a
luscious
bloodred
hue
although
it
is
fully
translucent
it
is
capped
with
a
thin
wisp

encircling
white
froth
the
nose
is
pure
cantillon
funk
delicious
and
complex
notes
of
bushy

berries
acidity
of
the
acetic
persuasion
more
than
lactic
tannic
oak
and
an
overall
unbelieveably
delectable
and
wellrounded
flavor
make
this
one
of
the
best
beers
on
earth
the
wine
and
grape
is
there
if
you
look
for
it
although
i
feel
like
the
fruitiness
could
just
as
easily
be
cherry
raspberry
blueberry
or
a
berry
melange
the
most
succinct
way
to
describe
the
flavor
of
st
lamvinus
this
is
what
i
thought
blabaer
was
going
to
taste
like
i
am
struck
by
the
fullness
of
the
fruit
flavor
it
is
not
mere
nuance
the
taste
is
big
and
jammy
and
unabashed
the
feel
is
full
and
creamy
for
a
cantillon
a
la
blabaer
and
has
a
wonderfully
dry
and
mouthwatering
finsh
overall
this
is
about
as
good
as
a
beer
or
any
libation
for
that
matter
can
be
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
pours
a
nice
reddish
pink
a
bit
of
nice

looks
very
pretty
smells
like
damp
dog
funky
and
sour
a
hint
of
grape
tastes
grape
heavy
very
tart
and
acidic
a
bit
harsh
and
abrasive
and
burns
on
the
throat
but
its
a
nice
flavour
profile
overall
highly
carbonated
but
very
nice
o
im
glad
ive
got
a
bottle
of
this
set
aside
as
i
imagine
there
was
something
off
with
the
glass
i
had
at
least
i
hope
thats
the
case
can
see
the
potential
for
this
one
to
be
amazing
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
but
perhaps
it
just
needed
some
more
aging
to
bring
out
the
lambic
qualities
i
was
looking
for
thanks
for
the
treat
don
saint
lamvinus
pours
a
deep
burgundy
i
could
mistake
it
for
red
wine
except
for
the
thin
layer
of
raspberry
head
that
crowns
the
beer
the
nose
consisty
of
dark
fruits
cherries
and
plums
acidity
and
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
the
red
wine
notes
should
be
the
base
that
everything
plays
off
of
but
they
are
just
a
bit
too
far
in
the
background
to
really
carry
things
though
the
funky
aspect
of
the
beer
comes
through
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
ive
heard
funk
sometimes
described
as
being
musty
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
personally
tasted
it
it
tastes
like
i
imagine
the
air
in
a
long
abandoned
room
would
its
a
bit
overpowering
blocking
out
the
more
tart
edge
and
fruity
notes
from
the
wine
grapes
its
amazing
to
contrast
the
mouthfeel
here
with
the
cuvee
des
champions
i
just
had
this
one
comes
across
as
bit
more
rich
and
full
though
that
may
be
more
a
function
of
a
much
lower
level
of
carbonation
than
any
increase
in
the
body
the
overall
effect
though
is
a
certain
dullness
to
the
beer
saint
lamvinus
smoothed
out
a
bit
as
it
warmed
but
it
remained
a
class
below
my
favorite
sourswild
ales
o
i
found
this
brew
simplyphenomenal
it
is
a
style
bender
that
shows
a
profound
depth
that
wines
can
only
dreams
about
cheers
pours
a
crazy
purple
color
similar
to
the
label
on
welchs
grape
jelly
immediately
it
makes
you
question
whether
its
beer
no
head
but
visible
carbonation
bubbles
line
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
is
quite
clean
hints
of
wild
yeast
but
in
no
way
as
powerful
as
most
lambics
and
particularly
weak
for
a
cantillon
the
taste
is
smooth
almost
like
a
perfect
blend
of
wine
and
lambic
grape
comes
through
as
well
as
the
wild
yeast
sour
but
not
the
typical
puckering
that
comes
from
the
top
lambics
very
light
bodied
wonderful
lambic
particularly
if
you
want
something
more
mellow
and
smooth
this
is
one
even
a
nonelambic
drinker
could
get
on
board
with
tremendous
o
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
it
doesnt
have
an
in
your
face
type
of
sourness
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
the
sexiest
beer
ive
seen
all
day
a
glorious
dark
red
low
carbonation
a
small
ring
of
head
but
that
doesnt
matter
this
beer
made
me
shriek
for
sheer
joy
upon
its
sight
good
goddamn
it
looks
amazing
smells
funky
a
little
grape
and
berry
action
the
taste
is
barnyard
a
touch
of
grape
tannic
woodsy
i
was
surprised
i
didnt
get
more
grape
out
of
it
merely
hinting
but
thats
not
a
terrible
thing
im
just
accustomed
to
grape
sours
tasting
more
vinous
this
had
a
bit
of
that
quality
but
was
definitely
more
lambic
than
grapebeer
good
stuff
full
bodied
with
a
tart
mouth
puckering
sourness
that
lingers
throughout
over
the
sweet
vinous
and
funky
barnyard
notes
into
a
sweet
slightly
dry
finish
bursting
with
vinous
dark
fruit
especially
the
grapes
a
perfect
marriage
of
wine
and
beer
slight
acidity
in
the
finish
with
a
lingering
acetic
vinegar
presence
that
leaves
me
drooling
for
more
this
beer
is
incredibly
quaffable
considering
how
funky
it
is
perfectly
balanced
o
this
is
an
excellent
lambic
and
on
cask
its
a
dream
glad
to
have
had
it
this
way
and
cant
wait
till
the
next
time
not
as
sour
as
some
but
very
complex
and
at
the
same
time
very
easy
to
enjoy
even
quaffable
o
another
great
lambic
from
cantillon
great
all
around
really
drinkable
and
refreshing
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
sours
overall
another
great
offering
from
cantillon
i
was
thrilled
to
try
the
lighter
red
wine
and
oak
notes
from
the
grapes
and
barrels
make
it
a
bit
more
balanced
and
subtle
but
still
just
as
complex
the
other
offerings
by
them
definitely
recommended
750ml
bottle
2008
vintage
pours
a
dark
deep
reddishpurple
with
a
thin
pink
head
aromas
of
grapes
berries
vinegar
oak
and
funk
flavors
of
tart
grape
skins
balsamic
vinegar
hints
of
citrus
oak
and
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
and
tart
finish
medium
carbonation
with
nice
cantillon
funk
and
lots
of
aging
potential
d
pretty
solid
fruit
lambic
from
cantillon
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
from
them
but
this
is
another
solid
beer
nonetheless
given
its
price
point
i
think
ill
go
from
something
else
by
these
guys
next
time
but
still
pretty
awesome
quite
delicious
lots
of
red
wine
and
grape
flavor
and
mild
sourness
just
make
this
so
drinkable
quite
different
from
the
aged
version
of
this
nice
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
regular
cantillion
offerings
ill
never
turn
this
one
away
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
keeps
a
nice
balance
while
still
having
a
strong
cantillon
tang
o
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
nothing
else
to
add
this
is
a
beer
that
has
been
finely
crafted
throughout
the
generations
although
it
might
not
be
my
favorite
i
can
objectively
say
this
is
the
best
crafted
beer
ive
ever
drank
cantillons
almost
worship
of
tradition
is
something
that
definitely
paid
off
in
the
end
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
cantillon
and
truly
an
expensive
treat
blood
red
color
but
not
as
red
grapes
low
foam
tannic
nose
with
cork
tip
the
mouth
is
acidic
woody
and
strong
enough
despite
what
you
may
think
the
taste
of
bordeaux
grapes
is
not
present
it
found
skin
grapes
thereof
in
the
strength
of
the
bitterness
of
this
lambic
the
finish
is
tannic
oaky
slightly
resembling
the
balsamic
vinegar
cantillon
lambic
good
but
do
not
let
the
red
grapes
to
express
their
full
potential
mouthfeel
is
spoton
for
the
style
as
it
is
light
and
moderately
carbed
thanks
go
out
to
the
good
doctor
for
sharing
this
gem
recommended
pours
a
slightly
cloudy

with
a

sip
brings
the
merlot

grapes
evolves
into
a
moderately
tart
sour
and
acidic
taste
but
the
strong
fruit
flavors
cut
through
lightly
funky
and
some
sweetness
medium
bodied
low
in
carbonation
bone
dry
and
slightly
puckering
quite
the
beer
glad
i
found
it
on
draft
as
opposed
to
shelling
out
the
local
45
per
bottle
price
light
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
very
mild
sourness
on
this
lambic
but
lots
of
flavors
to
enjoy
overall
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
now
and
it
did
not
disappoint
due
to
the
grapes
it
has
an
obvious
winelike
character
which
is
enjoyable
whether
it
is
worth
the
price
tag
however
is
debatable

2008
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
green
man
snifter
poured
blood
red
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
minimal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
very
slight
grapes
and
slight
acetic
acid
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
grapes
deep
dark
fruit
slight
acetic
acid
and
big
citrus
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
quite
excellent
i
had
this
one
sitting
in
the
cellar
since
2008
and
finally
got
tired
of
looking
at
it
and
decided
to
crack
it
really
glad
that
i
did
the
flavor
was
not
only
complex
but
quite
excellent
as
everything
seemed
to
blend
very
nicely
together
it
also
had
a
great
aroma
that
invited
me
in
for
more
i
found
myself
drinking
this
one
quite
quickly
good
thing
is
is
only
6
an
absolute
must
try
for
anyone
quite
sour
vinous
character
from
the
merlot
grapes
with
a
bit
raspberry
lemon
side
to
the
profile
the
grapes
lie
somewhere
in
between
ripe
red
grapes
and
underripe
green
grapes
i
generally
prefer
younger
fruit
lambic
and
at
about
2
years
old
the
level
of
fruit
presence
seems
ideal
has
a
very
rich
aspect
of
funk
to
it
thats
pretty
animal
like
sort
of
a
leathery
flavor
a
really
pleasing
balance
between
sour
and
funk
that
keeps
everything
in
check
maybe
couldve
used
a
little
more
carbonation
very
drinkable
taste
is
tart
and
tingly
all
over
very
sharp
and
funky
but
not
over
the
top
like
some
drei
fontinen
beers
there
is
a
light
grape
flavor
but
its
not
over
the
top
or
very
strong
and
its
well
balanced
by
the
oakiness
thats
equally
present
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonated
and
a
bit
champagnelike
finish
is
very
dry
and
sour
just
how
it
should
be
fantastic
beer
d
the
nose
hurts
drinkability
a
bit
however
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
really
make
up
for
it
i
could
definilty
do
a
whole
750
or
two
no
problem
really
really
drinkable
though
the
tannic
character
builds
as
time
goes
on
i
prefer
the
lp
series
to
this
but
not
by
much
a
winner
d
the
whole
750
would
have
been
too
much
so
im
happy
that
i
had
someone
to
share
it
with
intensely
sour
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
would
love
to
try
it
again
i
dont
think
im
in
any
rush
to
go
out
and
drop
another
40
on
it
though
cantillon
cant
disappoint
d
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
had
and
probably
my
favorite
lambic
to
date
even
over
blåbær
my
previous
favorite
thanks
again
mike
for
cracking
this
one
dry
finish
on
a
medium
fulfilling
body
what
a
classic
d
the
best
lambic
that
i
have
had
to
date
overall
an
awesome
beer
but
pretty
expensive
i
would
get
it
again
but
their
too
hard
to
come
by
and
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
effort
drinkability
every
sip
has
me
longing
for
more
but
it
is
mighty
dry
and
tart
so
1
bottle
split
between
2
people
is
plenty
for
one
sitting
this
beer
drinks
like
the
finest
wine
or
champagne
a
joy
to
behold
i
am
glad
i
made
it
part
of
my
new
years
eve
2010
celebration
pricey
yes
but
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
one
if
you
get
the
chance
still
this
is
a
finely
crafted
lambic
the
wine
barrels
nicely
integrated
so
as
to
showcase
both
the
barrels
and
the
base
beer
funky
and
sour
fine
bubble
carbonation
gladly
have
this
over
a
champagne
for
any
fine
occasion
from
my
rootin
tootin
down
home
malt
and
hops
beer
heart
this
is
more
wine
than
beer
so
far
my
exploratory
journey
through
gueze
and
lambic
land
has
been
interesting
not
sure
its
for
me
but
i
think
this
particular
blend
may
be
the
turning
point
d
fantastic
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
now
regret
not
buying
every
single
bottle
that
sat
on
the
shelf
of
my
local
bottle
shop
if
you
ever
have
a
chance
to
purchase
this
beer
yes
its
worth
it
im
no
lambic
expert
but
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
probably
the
most
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ive
had
from
cantillon
quite
a
treat
d
yet
another
winner
from
cantillon
a
great
seamless
balance
and
feel
to
it
a
nice
acidity
too
i
would
be
curious
what
age
will
do
to
this
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
just
everytime
i
have
this
it
seems
to
get
better
and
better
in
my
eyes
if
only
this
was
easier
to
get
my
hands
on
and
perhaps
a
bit
cheaper
would
this
be
near
perfect
5s
superb
both
fresh
and
with
some
time
on
it
this
one
was
bottled
a
year
ago
and
im
very
curious
how
the
flavors
change
over
time
but
i
doubt
ill
find
out
because
this
stuff
costs
big
bucks
great
stuff
though
if
you
like
sour
funk
the
body
is
medium
with
fizzy
active
carbonation
the
finish
is
sourness
that
lasts
and
lasts
it
is
pretty
dry
as
well
and
the
drysour
combo
makes
me
want
another
sip
quickly
but
with
this
intensity
it
just
cant
be
considered
excellent
in
terms
of
drinkability
for
the
price
35
a
bottle
this
is
not
worth
it
over
some
other
cantillon
offerings
imo
except
for
the
expert
quaffer
but
its
a
very
good
beer
and
probably
one
every
sour
beer
fan
should
try
at
one
point
or
another
save
it
for
a
special
occasion
reviewed
on
03272010
d
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
i
thought
it
taste
great
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
sour
the
light
body
and
low
abv
made
this
a
beer
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
and
id
love
to
again
sometime
overall
one
of
the
best
cantillons
out
there
a
tad
expensive
but
good
for
special
occasions
this
purple
beverage
the
2009
vintage
trickles
from
the
tap
at
moeder
lambic
fontainas
with
a
transient
head
it
exhales
an
aroma
of
blueberries
blackberries
black
and
red
grapes
some
pepper
and
tastes
like
draft
vigneronne
predominantly
of
fruit
with
little
of
the
funk
or
sourness
that
lurks
in
the
bottled
format
the
keg
imparts
a
thicker
mouthfeel
though
and
the
drinkability
is
unsurpassed
by
other
grape
lambics
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
high
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
and
depth
to
it
overall
was
a
very
good
choice
to
celebrate
with
the
evening
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
well
done
j
a
great
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
several
times
and
every
time
is
a
treat
because
of
the
vinous
character
this
is
something
that
could
appeal
to
wine
drinkers
as
well
one
of
those
beers
that
is
more
of
an
experience
than
anything
and
an
experience
i
am
glad
to
have
at
every
opportunity
i
cant
recommend
this
enough
dthis
beer
is
delicious
and
i
wish
this
was
constantly
around
the
balance
and
flavors
works
so
well
together
with
a
glorious
sweetness
melded
with
brett
perfection
and
an
awesome
semi
dry
finish
notes
bottled
18
sep
2008
very
vinous
beer
that
would
make
a
good
substitute
for
wine
slightly
puckering
and
sour
but
it
isnt
absurd
and
is
still
tasty
definitely
a
unique
tasting
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
hv
color
is
a
dark
clear
rose
red
with
a
wispy
pink
head
that
fades
quickly
to
thin
ring
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
dry
oaky
blend
of
red
grapes
and
nonacidic
funky
sourness
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
less
fruity
than
expected
dominated
by
a
subtle
dry
sour
with
merlot
undetones
body
is
very
full
and
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
long
lasting
pickering
sourness
ill
need
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
to
appreciate
the
intricacies
of
this
better
but
so
far
im
impressed
o
at
35
a
bottle
i
expected
much
more
from
this
selection
it
is
good
and
obviously
a
cut
above
your
typical
lambic
but
not
great
i
was
disappointed
d
cantillon
continues
to
impress
not
as
mouth
puckering
as
their
other
beers
that
ive
had
its
possible
that
the
age
had
taken
the
edges
off
prominent
aromas
flavours
and
carbonation
and
mellowed
this
into
a
absolute
beauty
incredible
easy
sipper
overall
one
of
cantillons
best
drinks
incredibly
easy
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
tick
this
one
without
buying
a
40
bottle
all
in
all
this
was
a
decent
brew
very
interesting
for
a
sour
it
seems
with
these
types
of
brews
that
you
need
to
have
a
very
strong
stomach
id
say
this
could
be
a
good
conversion
brew
into
the
sour
field
if
you
like
grapes
or
wine
d
too
expensive
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
i
would
like
to
have
more
of
this
gonna
have
to
grab
a
bottle
or
two
while
they
are
still
out
there
d
tartness
gets
to
you
but
still
easy
to
drink
despite
my
lack
of
ability
to
truly
expose
here
all
the
nuances
of
this
beer
believe
me
it
is
a
great
one
something
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
over
and
over
again
flavor
is
fantastic
lots
of
grape
a
good
amount
of
tart
carbonation
is
middle
of
the
road
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
the
opening
flavor
is
lemon
like
but
quickly
reduces
to
a
sweeter
yet
tart
grape
a
very
good
lambic
from
cantillon
d
i
think
this
was
a
big
miss
for
me
this
is
the
second
worst
cantillon
i
have
had
and
i
love
everything
they
put
out
for
the
price
though
it
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
i
dont
think
the
grapes
really
worked
well
in
this
one
maybe
after
10
years
this
beer
would
be
something
different
my
previous
exposure
to
beer
blended
with
red
wine
from
japan
at
that
did
not
leave
me
expecting
too
much
from
this
sacre
bleu
it
sure
is
nice
to
be
surprised
this
is
a
revelation
a
lovely
fruity
and
tangy
beer
analogue
for
the
claret
set
as
a
fan
of
contrasts
in
flavour
this
works
oh
so
well
and
im
suddenly
craving
some
chocolate
cake
as
an
accompaniment
and
pondering
the
pinot
noir
version
of
this
bottled
11182008
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrownamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
tart
with
some
oaked
notes
the
flavor
is
tart
grapes
with
some
oak
the
tartness
is
very
intense
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
great
sour
ale
that
was
worthy
of
being
beer
number
1500
cantillon
has
done
it
again
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
beer
meant
to
be
savoured
and
every
aspect
of
it
supports
that
this
could
easily
become
my
special
occasion
beer
d
tasty
but
not
cantillons
best
offering
i
definitely
enjoy
it
though
im
not
a
fan
of
tartness
but
ive
been
itching
to
try
this
for
a
while
thanks
bobsy
d
its
pretty
drinkable
for
how
insanely
funky
it
is
at
5
its
easily
drinkable
in
that
regard
youve
really
gotta
like
funky
brett
beers
to
enjoy
this
one
overall
a
solid
beer
very
nice
sour
from
cantillon
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
unfortunately
it
is
too
expensive
no
vinegar
flavors
or
that
medicine
flavors
that
i
get
out
of
some
lambics
here
very
drinkable
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
giving
it
an
even
airier
feel
crisp
and
so
delicious
way
too
easy
to
drink
md
very
light
and
thin
mouthfeel
i
think
i
have
read
other
reviews
of
it
being
better
bottled
than
kegged
and
i
wonder
how
this
would
change
my
thoughts
of
it
as
of
now
its
not
that
highly
rated
for
me
the
only
reason
ive
never
had
this
before
is
the
price
tag
i
now
completely
understand
why
its
priced
the
way
it
is
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
i
will
definitely
be
buying
in
the
future
thanks
kevin
d
get
this
beer
cantillons
finest
and
may
be
belgiums
finest
as
well
price
is
no
option
go
out
and
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
can
find
it
very
drinkable
and
unique
this
bottle
was
kindly
sent
to
me
by
pierluc
thanks
for
the
great
hookup
on
the
cantillon
make
sure
this
is
consumed
at
cellar
temp
you
dont
want
to
miss
a
single
aspect
of
this
phenomenal
brew
drinkability
a
fascinating
beer
although
this
beer
retails
for
upwards
of
35
a
bottle
it
is
worth
every
penny
the
wine
comparisons
are
obvious
however
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
no
35
bottle
of
wine
displays
the
complexity
or
the
elegance
of
saint
lamvinus
every
beer
aficionado
should
have
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
at
least
once
in
their
lifetime
this
is
a
great
brew
i
loved
it
but
i
do
think
it
takes
time
to
appreciate
a
sour
and
the
age
of
the
bottle
greatly
changed
the
flavors
from
the
glass
that
i
had
fresh
also
at
35
00
a
bottle
its
not
cheep
it
was
a
great
experience
and
one
i
will
love
to
have
again
but
not
something
i
expect
every
day
another
hint
is
you
have
to
split
this
bottle
with
someone
who
will
appreciate
it
there
is
no
way
i
could
drink
one
bottle
myself
one
glass
was
enough
at
a
sitting
at
long
last
st
lamvinus
due
to
the
ongoing
cantillon
shortage
i
actually
had
never
had
this
until
recently
pours
a
dark
purple
with
a
slight
cloudiness
no
residual
head
but
lovely
color
from
those
grapes
undoubtedly
aroma
is
nicely
funky
and
uniquely
cantillon
and
brussels
in
that
respect
fairly
dry
floral
character
with
some
fruitgrape
sweetness
the
taste
has
that
wonderful
cantillon
funk
to
it
plus
grape
skins
and
floral
notes
and
a
dry
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
full
carbonation
dry
yet
refreshing
this
is
a
real
tasty
brew
while
american
brewers
are
putting
out
amazing
things
they
will
never
quite
be
able
to
do
a
beer
like
this
quite
the
lambic
poured
into
small
sample
glasses
with
only
a
bit
of
off
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
copper
amber
aroma
is
musky
malty
yeasty
oak
hint
of
the
grape
and
acid
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
grape
coming
out
in
the
finish
great
body
and
carbonation
finsh
is
like
flavor
and
medium
in
length
clean
finish
but
not
really
a
session
this
is
a
beer
for
the
true
lambic
afficianado
minus
the
fu
fu
the
low
abv
5
lends
itself
to
easydrinking
the
acidity
level
though
would
probably
lend
itself
to
heartburn
its
very
tasty
and
to
those
who
like
sours
in
general
its
delicious
and
very
consumable
minimal
front
flavor
beer
is
light
in
body
drinkability
high
the
tartness
gets
you
its
grapey
and
slightly
sweet
but
in
a
sour
and
sweet
sort
of
way
the
flavors
develop
better
on
the
back
palate
than
the
front
its
a
great
beer
there
is
not
a
lot
of
body
to
it
and
there
is
nearly
no
carbonation
in
the
mouth
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
palate
quite
vinous
with
the
grapes
lending
a
lot
of
flavor
and
depth
the
sourness
is
immediately
apparent
with
the
acidity
working
really
well
with
the
grape
the
funk
character
is
rather
low
just
mildly
musty
though
i
suspect
that
the
fruit
is
obfuscating
just
how
much
funk
is
present
drying
and
mildly
tannic
on
the
finish
with
a
clean
sourness
and
lingering
vinous
character
this
is
exceptional
stuff
overall
this
is
a
great
sour
i
really
like
the
merlot
grapes
both
for
the
beautiful
color
and
the
flavor
nothing
really
stands
out
but
everything
is
very
well
done
id
love
to
have
a
bottle
of
this
to
sip
on
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
cantillon
overall
an
exceptional
lambic
possibly
the
best
cantillon
i
have
had
to
date
though
i
do
really
enjoy
rose
de
gambrinus
as
well
try
this
if
you
can
get
it
as
it
is
a
unique
experience
d
possibly
the
best
cantillon
beer
ive
had
to
date
yes
even
better
than
blabaer
and
crianza
id
pick
up
another
one
of
these
any
day
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
every
day
sadly
it
is
very
expensive
so
i
will
have
to
stick
with
ipa
and
pils
reviewed
from
my
notes
review
based
upon
two
4
ounce
pours
i
had
each
served
in
a
tiny
wine
glass
at
novare
res
valentines
day
beer
and
chocolate
pairing
the
beer
has
an
opaque
plumcranberry
hue
there
is
no
head
or
visible
carbonation
it
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
it
has
a
great
fruity
funky
aroma
it
is
slightly
champagnelike
a
mildly
sweet
fruit
flavor
is
the
first
thing
i
taste
tartness
kicks
in
as
i
swallow
and
lingers
briefly
i
am
definitely
tasting
winelike
flavors
red
grapes
mostly
but
all
in
a
great
funk
wrapper
its
delicious
it
has
a
crisp
dry
light
body
the
tingly
funk
feeling
is
a
great
substitute
for
the
carbonation
bubbles
you
can
usually
feel
in
beers
there
is
a
slight
mouth
coat
for
a
sour
beer
this
is
amazingly
drinkable
it
really
isnt
all
that
sour
i
wish
i
had
a
bigger
pour
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
extremely
enjoyable
personally
i
cant
see
myself
ever
getting
tired
of
this
beer
it
is
near
perfect
overall
kind
of
onedimensional
wgrapes
and
tartness
being
only
flavors
that
shine
through
but
still
works
kind
of
like
a
ng
beer
but
wgrapes
d
easy
drinking
somewhat
harsh
on
the
stomach
due
to
all
of
the
sourfunk
i
want
more
i
loved
this
one
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
enjoyed
much
more
than
the
fou
foune
less
fruit
but
more
tartness
and
funk
less
sweet
a
very
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
with
a
thin
pink
head
aromas
of
cherries
currants
and
grapes
on
the
nose
with
a
perfectly
balanced
funkiness
flavor
is
vinous
with
more
fruit
and
even
cranberry
with
a
sharp
but
refreshingly
acidic
finish
complemented
by
hint
of
cloves
or
anise
this
is
a
perfect
fruit
lambic
o
very
drinkable
beer
delicious
cantillon
is
pleonasm
drinkability
is
solid
for
the
style
i
know
the
price
on
this
is
prohibitively
expensive
for
some
but
if
you
are
a
fan
of
lambics
or
fruit
beers
at
all
then
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
at
least
once
d
not
something
for
everyday
consumption
but
certainly
something
id
drink
again
shared

tasting
hazy
pink
pour
with
nice

wheaty
barnyard

with
some
nice

the

wine
and

with

nicely
balanced
cantillon
sour
finish
dry
medium
body
with
moderate

bottle
squishy
cork
and
intense
funk
escaping
the
bottle
got
to
me
i
let
it
air
out
about
an
hour
before
pouring
beautiful
redpurple
pour
with
a
pinkish
white
head
after
the
first
big
whiffs
of
the
classic
lambic
sweat
and
barnyard
aromas
i
pickup
some
distinctly
winey
aromas
lots
of
grapes
dried
cranberries
and
a
bit
of
oak
taste
is
still
very
lambic
like
with
some
earth
and
a
grapewine
finale
absolutely
fantastic
palate
this
beer
demands
to
be
drunk
as
i
drink
the
strong
sour
aromas
and
taste
fade
out
and
make
way
for
all
the
fruitiness
this
beer
possesses
overall
ive
been
wary
of
the
price
tag
of
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
while
and
im
glad
i
finally
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
ontap
very
well
worth
the
shot
it
truly
is
an
experience
to
drink
this
it
is
a
sad
moment
when
the
last
drop
is
gone
this
was
a
great
beer
but
i
wouldnt
suggest
opening
one
alonedont
know
why
you
would
want
to
it
could
become
a
little
overwhelming
one
glass
will
suffice
st
lamvinus
has
a
relatively
low
carbonation
and
is
impressively
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
intensity
i
would
consume
it
far
more
regularly
if
it
were
less
expensive
d
nice
but
doesnt
live
up
to
past
experiences
with
bottled
saint
lamvinous
where
the
flavors
were
truly
sublime
not
sure
if
it
can
be
chalked
up
to
tap
v
bottle
or
whether
the
difference
is
due
to
the
vintage
d
very
highevery
sip
reveals
greater
complexity
and
no
amount
would
seem
to
be
enough
overall
a
solid
offering
from
cantillon
and
a
neat
one
to
have
tried
on
tap
the
taste
is
interesting
to
boot
but
interesting
in
a
very
good
way
the
beer
continued
to
get
better
with
each
sip
not
nearly
as
much
funk
in
the
taste
as
there
was
in
the
nose
tart
cherries
subtle
funk
great
balance
somewhat
soft
not
overpowering
tartness
was
a
decent
level
and
nothing
to
scoff
at
would
be
interested
to
try
a
more
recent
version
to
compare
and
out
of
the
bottle
as
well
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
drink
this
one
i
had
this
ontap
today
at
capones
it
was
a
2006
vintage
the
beer
was
a
pretty
purple
red
hybid
with
a
thin
little
head
the
nose
was
sour
almost
like
a
cherry
vinegar
there
was
a
depth
to
the
flavorss
cherry
oak
and
vinous
flavors
combined
with
an
almost
vinegary
sourness
a
very
dry
beer
that
took
me
a
while
to
finish
in
the
end
this
was
a
bit
too
sour
for
my
palate
there
is
no
shortage
of
flavor
levels
here
yet
their
combination
is
incredibly
nuanced
a
masterpiece
from
cantiillon
saint
lamvinus
is
one
of
those
beers
that
achieved
legendary
status
and
it
certainly
deserves
it
im
always
somewhat
skeptical
approaching
lambics
but
this
one
delivers
in
a
big
big
way
ill
never
have
a
shred
of
doubt
about
a
cantillon
beer
ever
again
this
ones
damn
near
divine
the
flavor
is
so
complex
and
delicious
it
truly
is
a
special
beer
if
you
dont
have
this
beer
available
in
your
locale
its
well
worth
seeking
out
in
a
trade
find
a
bottle
thanks
a
ton
andrew
cantillon
usually
doesnt
fail
to
disappoint
and
this
is
no
exception
if
youre
into
vinous
winelike
beers
this
is
well
worth
the
occasional
indulgence
highpriced
but
this
is
a
timeandspaceintensive
brew
so
its
understandable
overall
i
am
very
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
and
would
not
mind
trying
it
again
thanks
again
mike
overall
a
great
sour
but
unfortunately
not
the
best
ive
had
a
must
try
cheers
still
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
sour
ale
it
just
lacks
a
little
something
to
me
the
fact
that
i
cant
pick
what
is
in
it
implies
that
the
fruit
characters
are
what
is
absent
not
bad
very
drinkable
overall
like
a
good
young
wine
bit
of
an
acidic
linger
but
otherwise
pretty
decent
oak
berries
and
some
barnyard
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
you
get
more
funk
and
some
leather
the
body
is
light
and
playful
like
champagne
very
soft
acidity
with
strawberry
notes
and
definitive
tartness
i
was
expecting
more
tannins
but
none
were
present
dry
and
clean
with
a
slight
puckering
finish
d
awesome
beer
here
really
great
beer
but
the
price
tag
wasnt
right
for
me
d
so
easy
to
drink
and
so
damn
good
i
really
dig
the
funk
grapes
and
oak
mixed
together
a
perfect
combination
worthy
of
its
top
100
rating
mouthfeel
is
lively
with
a
little
stickiness
its
not
as
refreshing
as
other
cantillons
imo
not
as
bracing
up
front
and
a
bit
too
much
residual
sweetness
in
the
finish
it
hurts
the
drinkability
just
a
bit
still
i
havent
had
a
cantillon
i
dont
love
and
this
isnt
about
to
change
that
i
wish
this
was
on
the
wine
list
at
my
favourite
italian
restaurant
splitting
a
bottle
over
dinner
would
be
the
way
to
go
this
beer
pours
a
pink
grape
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
produces
a
one
finger
bubblingfast
vanishing
head
with
average
lacingthe
aroma
is
barnyard
sour
funkred
grapes
and
vinegari
can
see
why
this
beer
is
classed
as
a
good
balance
between
the
beer
culture
and
wine
culture
as
the
first
taste
is
sour
merlot
grapes
then
its
followed
by
a
nice
funky
sour
lambic
after
taste
but
not
overly
mouthpuckering
and
finishes
very
nicedry
and
crisp
and
for
me
a
very
drinkable
lambic
with
a
nice
easy
light
mouthfeel
almost
wine
like
at
some
stages
on
the
palettei
definately
enjoy
my
lambics
and
would
highly
recommend
this
to
any
who
hasnt
tried
it
and
likes
a
good
lambic
there
is
an
ok
mouthfeel
nothing
special
and
its
drinkable
for
a
lambic
just
becuase
of
its
lack
of
s
strong
sourness
d
high
for
a
beer
this
tart
really
solid
lambic
overall
thanks
to
juicestam
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
great
stuff
drinks
pretty
nice
i
am
very
up
down
on
sours
but
this
one
is
living
up
to
its
world
class
tartness
which
today
i
likelove
the
sourness
is
done
right
i
dont
think
im
drinking
salad
dressing
unlike
some
others
ive
had
sour
freaks
must
try
this
im
a
malthead
i
still
liked
this
a
bunch
many
may
hesitate
at
the
price
but
got
a
deal
at
25
a
bottle
only
one
there
not
an
every
day
beer
for
me
but
if
your
want
to
get
your
lambic
freak
on
this
is
your
huckleberry
d
if
i
could
afford
it
id
drink
this
all
the
time
only
knock
is
that
well
i
cant
afford
it
d
i
enjoy
drinking
this
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
shared
again
i
just
havent
really
picked
up
a
love
for
cantillon
and
have
no
strong
desire
to
seek
it
out
yet
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
i
had
never
heard
of
cantillon
until
i
saw
this
on
tap
and
asked
about
it
now
i
check
it
out
on
ba
and
come
to
realize
its
in
the
top
100
what
a
treat
light
brownishred
in
color
a
vinegarish
sweetsour
smell
slightly
ciderlike
not
overly
sour
but
a
nice
mix
of
tangy
fruit
flavors
hints
of
several
fruits
especially
apples
and
pears
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
essentially
no
alcohol
presence
whatsoever
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
traditional
lambic
d
a
good
flavor
experience
for
me
so
lush
and
highly
drinkable
the
hybrid
of
lambic
and
wine
grapes
and
the
very
light
feel
for
the
6
the
kind
of
flavor
you
want
to
sip
it
has
so
much
going
on
that
it
refreshes
as
you
savor
it
palate
is
not
overwhelmingly
sour
up
front
but
has
good
notes
of
wine
grapes
and
ripe
white
peach
the
tartness
takes
over
after
the
swallow
with
a
sour
fairly
boozy
finish
that
has
a
touch
of
astringency
body
is
just
about
perfect
to
convey
the
flavors
here
more
creamy
than
bubbly
it
provides
a
substantial
base
that
allows
the
fruit
flavors
to
linger
but
never
overpower
the
sour
this
is
a
more
approachable
offering
than
the
gueuze
or
other
cantillon
beers
but
is
still
deliciously
complex
welldone
drinking
this
beer
in
the
brewery
from
the
brewer
himself
is
one
of
the
great
beer
experiences
of
my
life
mr
van
roy
was
friendly
intelligent
and
very
passionate
and
confident
about
his
beers
i
hope
that
this
brewery
stays
in
business
for
centuries
to
come
will
be
going
to
europe
this
weekend
and
will
definitely
try
and
check
it
out
when
i
go
notes
what
a
treat
to
have
this
beer
at
the
brewery
picked
up
a
bottle
at
abes
cold
beer
for
25
honestly
this
was
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
cantillon
it
poured
a
grapejuice
colored
purplered
with
a
short
head
the
beer
drinks
like
a
very
dry
red
wine
and
isnt
quite
as
sour
as
a
lambic
or
gueze
but
it
still
certainly
on
par
with
the
good
fruit
lambics
i
think
the
grapes
here
have
overpowered
a
lot
of
the
funkier
elements
making
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
their
framboise
id
say
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
if
you
can
afford
it
drinkability
give
me
this
over
wine
any
day
delicious
i
really
appreciated
the
6
as
well
aroma
and
flavors
are
actually
not
as
complex
as
the
bottle
but
the
carbonation
here
seems
to
be
more
delicate
the
unique
snifter
glass
really
helps
with
the
presentation
as
well
d
a
fantastic
lambic
a
real
work
of
art
the
character
of
a
sparkling
wine
this
one
showcases
is
fantastic
highly
recommended
a
birthday
bottle
for
my
wife
that
i
chose
on
a
whim
a
bit
pricey
but
the
occasion
warranted
it
i
figured
that
she
loves
lambics
wine
so
the
bottle
poured
a
brighter
than
expected
purple
with
pink
edges
to
a
light
pink
head
that
dissipated
quickly
left
a
wee
amount
of
lace
afterwards
the
aroma
had
a
sour
vinegar
and
winesoaked
cloth
quality
the
flavor
definitely
evokes
the
merlot
but
is
more
complex
as
it
shifts
in
even
one
sip
from
a
tart
sweet
cherry
to
vinegar
sour
and
then
changes
to
a
flat
but
bright
crisp
wine
the
body
is
light
bubbly
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
interesting
beer
but
definitely
worth
it
md
light
and
crisp
with
excellent
carbonation
a
touch
dry
and
leaves
the
mouth
somewhat
puckered
easy
drinking
an
excellent
beer
and
certianly
worth
the
30
at
least
once
this
is
one
of
the
better
sour
beers
ive
ever
enjoyed
another
solid
offering
from
our
friends
at
cantillon
this
thing
went
down
really
fast
sure
i
only
had
an
8oz
pour
but
even
considering
that
this
lacks
the
sour
punch
that
other
cantillons
have
and
this
is
one
i
think
could
spend
some
time
in
the
cellar
overall
a
fascinating
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
i
will
ever
pay
40
bucks
for
a
bottle
of
it
md
the
texture
is
quite
stimulating
low
abv
the
beer
falls
a
bit
too
far
on
the
wine
side
of
things
for
me
i
appreciate
the
clean
corked

capped

in

overall
one

or
whatever
you
want

call
it
this
series
is
awesome
so
far
o
one
of
the
better
american
wilds
i
have
tried
this
is
really
something
special
the
funk
is
just
right
for
being
nearly
20
months
old
and
the
huge
wall
of
tart
cherries
against

pretty

good
none

has

bottled
1232012
picked
the
bottle
up
at
the
brewery
on
6813
poured
in
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
rosetinged
pink
coloring
almost
like
a
dark
grapefruit
juice
with
no
head
huge
pop
when
the
cork
popped
on
this
one
and
tart
cherry
aromas
came
out
in
abundance
on
the
pour
aromas
of
subtle
cherry
sweet
and
rich
on
a
tart
and
slightly
citrusy
backbone
some
funky
sour
highlights
in
the
nose
also
flavors
are
very
rich
with
an
almost
floral
backbone
that
deliver
a
dark
roasted
quality
at
the
end
of
the
palate
with
woody
and
earthy
tones
in
between
there
is
a
rich
dark
cherry
sweetness
that
starts
in
a
bold
blast
that
slowly
subsides
as
it
washes
over
the
palate
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
rollercoaster
for
the
taste
buds
tart
cherry
and
slightly
acidic
characteristics
slowly
build
as
you
drink
the
aftertaste
is
tangy
and
tart
with
a
sweet
undertone
dry
slightly
effervescent
and
sour
finish
very
tasty
not
a
whole
lot
of
depth
here
but
a
very
tasty
and
light
feeling
sour
id
drink
anytime
overall
my
first
experience
with
a
lambic
is
a
very
favorable
one
allagash
really
has
a
great
coolship
series
the
huge
cherry
flavors
and
the
tartness
make
this
very
enjoyable
and
i
almost
forget
that
im
actually
drinking
a
beer
while
i
gave
this
brew
a
high
score
im
not
sure
id
want
to
drive
the
3
hours
to
the
brewery
and
pay
15
bucks
for
another
bottle
of
this
if
i
found
this
in
a
local
shop
then
i
most
likely
would
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
excited
to
venture
even
further
into
the
world
of
sours
one
of
the
most
wellrounded
sours
ive
ever
had
blew
my
mind
overall
damn
good
cherry
wild
yet
another
great
allagash
wild
served
in
an
allagash
coolship
tumbler
nose
is
less
cherry
heavy
than
the
balaton
more
funk
and
acidity
funky
earth
in
the
background
super
dry
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
of
the
coolship
series
though
was
by
no
means
my
favorite
the
background
funk
was
a
nice
addition
to
the
cherry
light
in
body
airy
on
the
palate
nice
fruitiness
to
the
whole
thing
interesting
beer
overall
id
have
it
again
the
finish
is
tart
and
dry
a
nice
combination
the
beer
is
light
pink
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
offers
sweet
cherries
with
a
touch
of
yeast
and
oak
the
flavor
is
cherries
cherry
pie
crust
a
touch
of
lemon
and
vinegar
in
the
finish
mild
tartness
and
acidity
in
the
finish
subtle
lactic
presence
fairly
thin
and
light
in
body
with
alcohol
presence
well
disguised
a
decent
fruit
sour
ale
but
again
not
in
the
same
echelon
as
the
belgian
greats
of
this
ilk
the
base
beer
is
exceptional
with
a
very
clean
acid
and
just
enough
funk
to
keep
things
interesting
the
cherry
component
is
seriously
lacking
though
overall
solid
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
anytime
soon
medium
bodied
with
a
tart
lactic
funk
that
isnt
acetic
or
harsh
decently
sour
but
not
too
much
do
more
funky
than
anything
else
with
a
slight
acetic
quality
just
a
touch
of
vinegar
in
the
finish
but
not
solent
like
not
very
sweet
with
the
cherries
again
being
slightly
integrated
subtle
vinous
character
with
some
fruit
skin
and
cherry
pit
finishes
dry
with
some
lingering
acidity
pours
a
nice
pink
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
cherries
certainly
come
through
a
bit
of
a
cherry
pie
type
aroma
along
with
oak
and
grass
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
flavor
does
have
a
significant
cherry
component
but
its
also
a
bit
watery
lightly
sweet
with
a
mild
lemon
tartness
not
much
in
the
way
of
depth
or
complexity
but
easy
to
drink
where
the
cherry
flavor
isnt
as
integrated
as
i
would
have
wished
nor
does
it
display
the
aged
and
dried
cherry
taste
that
more
traditional
krieks
do
the
pedioforward
aged
character
stands
alone
and
doesnt
embrace
the
fruit
at
least
not
yet
i
would
love
to
see
this
beer
after
a
year
or
two
of
melding
inside
the
bottle
d
easy
to
drink
difficult
to
acquire
and
pretty
underwhelming
compared
to
its
belgian
brethren
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
coolships
im
also
puzzled
by
the
unusually
high
alcohol
content
particularly
compared
to
other
lambic
and
even
other
allagash
offerings
this
is
decent
but
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
that
balaton
does
o
a
solid
american
wild
but
this
didnt
really
blow
me
out
of
the
water
for
the
low
bottle
count
and
how
hard
these
are
to
obtain
i
would
just
go
for
something
else
in
the
style
category
decent
pretty
consistent
flavor
from
the
aroma
light
cherry
lactic
sourness
not
too
strong
bitter
funk
bite
on
the
finish
and
more
cherries
definitely
not
as
good
as
the
balaton
version
overall
weird
and
funky
but
nice
good
funk
and
tart
chery
blend
o
overall
unique
and
different
not
something
i
need
again
and
my
clear
least
favorite
of
the
three
the
cherry
flavoring
is
really
overshadowed
by
the
cherry
flavor
of
the
balaton
which
is
more
to
my
liking
taste
dry
semitart
oaky
sour
cherries
lemon
vinous
herbal
hay
medicinal
d
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
a
great
spontaneous
beer
o
allagash
has
done
something
special
its
not
quite
perfect
but
its
close
i
love
the
bottle
and
the
little
card
you
can
get
that
describes
the
coolship
process
keep
it
up
i
like
this
one
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
if
not
for
the
higher
abv
id
say
this
is
very
much
like
a
belgian
version
allagash
is
on
the
verge
of
something
truly
special
on
this
side
of
the
pond
and
im
for
one
excited
o
overall
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
weekend
ton
of
sour
fruit
in
the
nose
and
sour
fruit
and
funky
brett
in
the
taste
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
sometime
the
taste
is
very
nice
sour
but
not
puckering
reminds
me
of
zwanze
11
with
cherries
instead
of
pinot
the
carbonation
is
very
pleasant
tickles
the
tongue
and
releases
the
tart
flavors
which
leaves
a
earthy
flavor
nice
drinkability
is
great
good
depth
love
the
spiced
cherry
character
nice
restrained
funk
great
while
i
took
the
strong
band
aid
note
to
be
a
sign
of
a
flaw
in
the
brewing
process
i
must
say
that
it
didnt
completely
take
away
from
the
brew
which
was
still
fairly
enjoyable
mouth
puckeringly
sour
and
delicious
the
raspberries
add
a
wonderful
sweet
fruity
aspect
to
an
already
amazing
beer
sour
gets
you
in
the
corner
of
your
jaws
real
nice
raspberry
flavor
shines
through
especially
in
the
finish
outstanding
taste
reveals
a
lot
more
raspberries
backed
up
by
lemon
zest
bretts
crisp
mouthfeel
acidity
is
decent
at
first
but
results
in
a
long
fizzy
sour
aftertaste
light
to
medium
body
very
convincing
taste
bit
too
sour
for
me
killer
overall
its
delicious
but
i
think
its
too
sour
its
allagash
and
its
a
coolship
release
its
fruity
and
crazy
sour
its
worth
any
and
all
drives
to
maine
seriously
though
this
is
a
gem
intensely
sour
with
some
great
tart
raspberry
flavors
and
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
i
can
only
imagine
what
is
going
to
happen
with
this
in
a
few
years
this
is
definitely
worth
driving
up
to
maine
to
get
as
well
as
anything
they
create
with
their
coolship
thanks
wildcats10
for
the
opportunity
o
beautiful
looking
wild
ale
with
a
nice
raspberry
character
that
translates
very
well
to
the
beers
character
without
being
too
unbalanced
pours
bright
red
super
bubbly
great
looking
smell
of
crazy
sour
raspberries
taste
is
very
sour
raspberry
and
lemon
flavors
not
really
any
funk
very
acidic
mouthfeel
is
very
effervescent
it
doesnt
seem
too
complex
but
the
raspberries
are
balanced
out
nicely
with
the
sourness
upland
lambics
are
crazy
sour
and
this
is
a
notch
below
those
and
i
prefer
this
one
had
this
in
tap
at
the
allagash
tap
takeover
at
novare
res
on
april
5
2014
the
color
was
most
amazing
it
looked
like
koolaid
after
trying
this
i
feel
like
ive
never
before
had
a
real
lambic
this
changed
my
outlook
on
lambics
forever
after
being
bowled
over
by
the
appearance
the
taste
smell
and
mouthfeel
each
provided
pleasant
support
to
the
initial
wow
once
this
was
placed
in
front
of
me
o
amazing
nose
and
flavors
with
a
nice
tartness
and
funk
amazing
brew
here
as
authentic
a
lambic
as
i
have
gotten
from
the
united
states
its
sour
dry
funky
and
unlike
even
some
of
the
best
belgian
ones
it
is
beautifully
carbonated
the
use
of
raspberries
here
is
lovely
as
well
not
as
intense
as
say
an
atrial
rubicite
but
used
more
elegantly
and
refined
in
a
special
way
the
bright
pink
color
of
this
is
gorgeous
while
the
white
head
on
it
is
fluffy
and
permanent
with
a
certain
enticing
character
it
smells
as
good
as
any
raspberry
beer
out
there
tart
from
the
fruit
but
also
very
sour
from
the
wild
yeasts
and
critters
which
manifest
themselves
in
an
acidic
and
lactic
mouthwatering
aroma
the
flavor
is
sour
beer
first
raspberry
next
but
the
fruit
stays
all
the
way
through
the
finish
and
slings
to
the
edges
of
my
mouth
as
the
rest
of
it
is
dried
out
completely
such
a
clean
finish
for
a
beer
this
flavorful
the
yeast
profile
is
amazing
as
good
as
any
thats
the
point
of
this
coolship
project
from
what
i
understand
to
make
very
authentic
and
delicious
wild
yeast
ales
this
is
so
punchy
and
juicy
and
sour
and
awesome
i
wish
they
would
distribute
to
colorado
what
a
gem
this
beer
is
nearly
flawless
on
the
overall
i
cant
think
of
a
single
thing
i
would
change
did
a
2314
tour
of
the
allagash
brewery
and
was
treated
to
a
coolship
red
at
the
end
split
a
bottle
3
ways
and
was
delighted
with
it
my
first
observation
was
the
overall
appearance
limited
head
but
a
beautiful
clear
ruby
red
color
smell
was
distinctly
fresh
raspberries
taste
was
great
not
too
sour
or
tarty
just
enough
funk
to
taste
mouthfeel
was
what
was
expected
light
to
medium
my
overall
opinion
is
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
for
anytime
winter
summer
beach
mountains
etc
its
not
over
the
top
in
any
direction
which
is
what
makes
it
right
hope
they
bottle
this
one
for
broader
distribution
as
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
in
fact
they
should
create
a
mixed
4
pack
with
one
of
each
variation
raspberry
cherry
resurgam
etc
thank
you
allagash
for
this
popped
this
complex
but
inviting
brew
along
with
the
curieux
and
confluence
among
a
few
other
rarities
and
local
elites
which
begs
the
question
can
you
avail
yourself
of
too
much
good
beer
in
one
evening
the
answer
my
friends
isnt
floating
in
the
wind
its
swishing
in
the
snifter
and
its
a
resounding
hell
no
gimme
gimme
gimme
some
more
o
overall
this
is
my
favorite
coolship
to
date
just
delicious
and
well
crafted
allagash
truly
is
dialing
in
their
coolship
definitely
a
sipper
different
flavors
come
through
on
each
sip
complex
and
drinkable
but
maybe
not
for
the
sour
beer
newbie
full
bodied
with
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
countered
by
barnyard
and
lactic
funk
and
a
strong
juicy
raspberry
flavor
lots
of
oak
and
funky
bugs
along
with
some
cobweb
and
subtle
lactic
cheesiness
dry
toasted
oak
musty
funk
and
subtle
lactic
presence
followed
by
jammy
raspberry
sweetness
fruit
still
dominant
but
not
overly
sweet
lots
of
raspberry
flavor
countering
the
tart
funk
and
dry
oak
sour
and
tart
but
not
harsh
or
acidic
at
all
really
well
balanced
and
incredibly
drinkable
very
authentic
without
harsh
acidity
or
acetic
vinegar
drops
off
a
bit
in
the
finish
which
is
slightly
mineraly
surprised
about
the
strong
funk
and
oak
character
but
they
elevate
this
beer
to
another
level
the
best
coolship
beer
ive
had
yet
overall
this
is
the
2nd
coolship
sour
from
allagash
that
i
have
gotten
to
try
i
think
that
this
is
slightly
better
than
the
coolship
cerise
i
really
dig
the
coolship
series
by
allagash
they
brewing
some
wonderful
domestic
sour
beers
they
are
just
as
good
as
most
of
the
belgian
fruit
lambics
that
i
have
had
from
the
likes
of
cantillion
and
drie
fontenein
not
bad
a
little
onenoted
and
quite
tart
but
nice
fruit
flavor
and
fairly
drinkable
odhappy
to
try
this
one
it
was
awesome
raspberry
lambics
are
my
favorite
sour
beer
and
this
one
was
great
i
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
overall
need
to
get
my
hands
on
another
one
of
these
cant
ask
for
much
more
this
beer
is
my
favorite
american
wild
ale
it
combines
the
complexity
of
a
lambicstyle
sour
with
a
fruited
sour
the
beer
pours
a
perfect
deep
pink
hue
in
the
glass
with
a
bit
of
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
quite
tart
with
a
bit
of
funk
you
can
smell
fields
but
you
cant
distinctly
pick
up
the
raspberry
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
harmonious
with
a
smooth
pucking
tartness
that
is
well
rounded
it
tastes
like
a
not
quite
ripe
fresh
picked
raspberry
its
a
beautiful
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
and
properly
carbed
that
it
really
elevates
the
base
this
one
and
rr
beatification
are
at
another
level
for
american
wild
ales
to
me
verdict
one
of
the
best
domestic
sour
beers
ive
ever
tried
especially
one
that
is
fruited
the
funk
is
perfect
and
the
raspberry
is
so
fresh
and
delicious
this
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
high
end
belgian
lambic
kudos
to
allagash
for
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
their
coolship
bottle
pours
raspberrypink
with
fluffy
pinkish
head
aroma
is
of
raspberries
funky
yeast
sweet
malt
and
vinegar
body
is
full
tart
and
tangy
taste
is
tart
sour
funky
raspberries
woody
finish
is
long
tart
and
sour
not
as
complex
as
belgian
sours
but
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
brew
a
very
good
lambic
and
worth
buying
if
you
see
one
this
one
is
very
different
than
most
other
lambics
that
you
find
on
the
market
overall
soooo
good
way
better
than
cerise
this
beer
has
it
all
o
a
really
nice
lambic
type
tart
light
fruit
a
bit
of
funk
cant
ask
for
too
much
more
not
to
mention
it
is
something
really
nice
to
get
my
hands
on
the
beer
pours
a
pale
pink
color
and
is
full
of
fizzy
bubbles
that
form
a
light
head
of
sodalike
large
bubbles
that
fizzle
away
quickly
it
looks
very
carbonated
with
tons
of
little
soda
bubbles
that
slowly
fade
away
the
beer
sits
in
the
glass
somewhere
between
deep
pink
and
ruby
red
with
a
hazy
body
that
is
a
bit
dark
and
impenetrable
to
the
eye
as
it
settles
the
beer
starts
to
look
a
lot
like
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
deep
funk
and
cherry
fruit
leather
with
a
touch
of
fresh
raspberry
and
fruitrollup
the
funk
is
the
most
prevalent
of
the
smells
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
of
fresh
and
funky
acidity
that
leads
into
a
sour
pucker
with
a
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
and
an
oddly
strong
lingering
bitterness
that
mixes
in
with
the
acidity
the
flavor
begins
as
tart
puckering
fruit
that
sits
between
raspberry
and
cherry
flavors
and
then
moves
quickly
into
a
deep
and
grassy
funk
with
touches
of
bitter
grass
the
finish
returns
to
a
lovely
syrupy
raspberry
flavor
and
a
touch
of
bitter
tannin
from
the
raspberry
skins
the
aftertaste
is
of
bitter
grass
and
with
faints
hints
of
raspberry
fruit
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
fiercely
prickly
with
carbonation
and
a
medium
and
slightly
slick
body
overall
im
not
quite
sure
what
i
think
of
this
the
grassy
bitterness
is
a
little
offputting
and
not
quite
what
im
looking
for
in
a
framboise
but
then
again
this
is
a
maine
version
of
a
farmboise
and
it
has
some
signature
american
bitterness
personally
i
want
the
raspberry
flavor
a
little
more
forward
on
the
tongue
but
as
is
in
this
beer
it
is
light
and
nuanced
the
funk
is
great
in
the
beer
and
the
grassy
bitters
are
actually
interesting
theyre
just
not
what
i
normally
look
for
in
the
style
this
is
a
good
beer
but
is
not
my
favorite
my
girlfriend
liked
in
more
than
i
did
though
so
perhaps
you
will
too
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
was
a
little
strong
in
the
bitterness
category
for
my
liking
o
great
balanced
taste
though
id
prefer
itd
be
more
acidic
carbonation
was
a
little
flat
a
great
beer
but
not
perfect
pours
a
deep
cloudy
garnet
red
with
a
smallish
pink
tinged
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
top
i
can
smell
the
tart
as
soon
as
i
wrangle
the
cork
out
of
the
bottle
lots
of
tart
raspberries
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
aroma
lactic
acid
and
funk
provide
support
the
flavor
is
filled
with
lactic
and
citric
acid
lots
of
tart
berries
and
lemons
with
just
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
light
bits
of
funk
come
and
go
in
the
taste
cycle
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
piercing
light
sugary
tart
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
sour
i
quite
enjoyed
this
o
cant
really
find
any
major
flaws
with
this
one
the
fruit
character
in
this
batch
is
great
as
is
the
balance
of
acidity
and
funk
very
promising
for
allagashs
spontaneous
program
o
with
ease
that
seems
to
come
almost
naturally
allagashs
coolship
red
rivals
some
of
the
classic
belgian
lambics
in
straight
up
barrel
aged
funk
and
full
unadulterated
fruit
flavor
this
is
by
far
the
best
americanmade
lambic
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
sours
out
there
period
the
body
is
light
with
soft
carbonation
lingering
woody
flavors
here
overall
this
one
is
great
nice
to
have
some
rockin
local
sours
o
good
overall
i
think
this
was
one
of
the
pilot
coolship
series
beers
and
it
bodes
well
for
the
program
pours
a
murky
light
red
with
a
foamy
whitered
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
berry
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
and
slightly
woody
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
overall
a
really
nice
wild
ale
and
another
winning
sour
from
allagash
while
i
preferred
resurgam
and
wasnt
nearly
as
funky
this
had
a
lot
of
nice
sour
dark
fruit
to
it
would
love
to
have
it
again
feel
is
less
than
medium
with
a
nice
sour
twang
when
the
liquid
reaches
the
gullet
wowsas
a
sipper
no
need
to
take
this
down
quick
savor
it
enjoy
it
i
probably
wont
ever
see
it
again
except
for
when
it
shows
up
at
monks
cafe
in
bottle
or
draft
form
when
volume
increases
red
and
a
few
coolships
already
seem
to
be
registered
in
the
state
of
pa
cant
wait
for
more
o
a
very
flavorful
and
fruity
sour
oak
is
drying
and
greasy
a
wonderful
brew
thanks

and
roundfull
the
subtle
cherry
flesh
flavors
arent
stacking
up
in
turn
it
is
quite
sweet
and
refreshing
at
4
abv
but
at
the
cost
of
9
a
12
7oz
bottle
id
say
tick
it
off
cannot
get
past
the
niquil
taste
may
be
better
with
a
few
years
on
it
but
drinking
the
2012
in
late
2014
proved
pretty
disappointing
to
me
by
a
different
one
for
a
few
bucks
more
would
be
my
advice
all
in
all
i
like
it
and
it
was
definitely
a
good
bargain
i
could
drink
a
beer
like
this
year
round
this
is
still
really
well
made
cherry
beer
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
that
they
do
its
still
seemingly
immature
sweet
from
the
fruit
rather
than
puckery
from
the
lambic
but
the
freshness
and
authenticity
of
the
fruit
make
it
a
worthy
drink
for
me
and
there
still
is
a
sturdy
hit
if
funk
mid
palate
even
though
the
sourness
of
the
lambics
we
love
the
most
doesnt
really
even
show
up
the
cherries
are
ripe
and
juicy
not
medicinal
at
all
although
they
crowd
out
any
malt
flavor
for
most
o
the
drink
carbonation
is
fair
but
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
makes
this
a
beer
i
only
need
a
little
of
more
of
a
cordial
at
this
level
than
a
beer
but
you
cant
help
but
be
impressed
by
the
vibrancy
of
the
cherries
and
with
the
texture
of
the
beer
overall
its
obviously
a
quality
brew
but
i
think
more
time
less
fruit
more
lacto
character
and
a
little
more
carbonation
would
really
make
this
special
still
anytime
you
get
good
belgian
kriek
you
dont
complain
d
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
but
not
acidic
or
tart
either
straightforward
cherry
flavors
o
its
a
fruit
beer
its
very
much
flavorful
but
brings
a
slow
plodding
counterweight
to
the
meager
brightness
it
reveals
cancelled
out
the
semidry
earthy
tones
of
the
manchego
i
started
eating
towards
the
end
so
dont
bother
with
that
fared
a
little
better
with
the
kale
gouda
thats
all
the
cheese
i
got
right
now
serving
type
bottle
deep
ruby
red
pour
with
a
dark
pink
onefinger
head
strong
aroma
of
fermented
cherries
great
dark
cherry
flavor
upfront
with
a
slightly
tart
edge
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
can
also
taste
a
hint
raspberry
and
a
little
oak
flavor
but
the
cherry
really
stands
out
finish
with
a
really
nice
lingering
dark
cherry
tartness
o
pretty
clean
version
of
the
style
a
bit
boring
and
one
dimensional
also
i
think
its
too
sweet
more
like
cherrysoda
then
a
beer
o
pretty
tasty
balanced
well
fairly
basic
in
flavors
and
complexity
would
drink
again
o
for
the
price
this
good
will
buy
it
again
when
in
the
mood
recommended
pours
crimson
with
good
clarity
and
a
seductive
pink
undertone
the
head
is
loose
cherry
tinted
foam
that
fell
fast
the
nose
is
ripe
black
cherries
a
hint
of
woody
oak
and
a
brief
whiff
of
barnyard
taste
is
sweet
and
ripe
fruit
that
has
a
modicum
of
tartness
on
it
in
and
of
itself
the
barnyard
is
not
very
prominent
on
the
palate
the
wood
is
airy
and
light
the
carbonation
is
almost
right
but
could
stand
a
few
more
bubbles
the
malt
is
a
but
a
touch
of
crisp
wheat
and
a
hint
of
weight
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
dry
what
it
isnt
is
sour
or
acidic
it
lacks
that
boldness
and
it
is
sorely
missed
while
the
fruit
is
lovely
it
just
does
not
engage
the
palate
fully
without
that
aspect
it
drinks
easily
and
a
bit
too
easily
this
is
a
drinkable
lambic
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
i
would
prefer
more
sweetness
more
tartness
and
more
evidence
of
wild
yeast
pours
a
deep
reddish
purple
color
with
a
small
bubbly
pink
tinged
head
that
dissipates
slowly
aromas
of
sweet
and
tart
cherries
dominate
the
aroma
hints
of
tart
lemon
balsamic
brown
sugar
and
earth
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
quite
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
was
anticipating
dark
sugary
sweet
with
plenty
of
tart
and
sweet
cherry
flavor
but
seriously
lacking
in
much
lactic
tartness
to
offset
the
sweetness
hints
of
almond
flavor
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
round
out
the
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
super
easy
to
drink
more
tart
than
a
lindemans
but
less
than
i
was
expecting
o
not
a
bad
lambic
certainly
not
my
favourite
as
i
lean
towards
the
unsweetened
verson
love
the
scent
taste
is
okay
and
mouthfeel
not
bad
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
although
its
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
lambic
a
very
decent
kriek
o
fail
sad
but
really
not
as
good
as
their
gueuze
at
all
just
too
sweet
and
such
a
lightweight
taste
for
dollar
overall
disgusting
example
of
a
kriek
you
can
do
way
way
better
than
this
with
other
shelf
krieks
even
lindeman
makes
a
better
one
look
for
the
likes
of
hannsens
or
oude
beersel
o
its
an
easy
one
to
enjoy
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lambic
tasted
to
me
like
a
cherry
halls
not
bad
at
all
but
still
sweet
and
not
that
complex
o
more
of
a
fruit
beer
than
a
lambic
homeless
mans
version
of
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
o
while
this
beer
does
have
its
rough
spots
its
still
worth
a
shot
not
the
most
spectacular
lambic
out
there
but
tasty
nonetheless
overall
4
0
excellent
kriek
and
a
great
way
to
kick
off
kiek
week
this
is
a
nuanced
and
subtle
kriek
certainly
not
what
you
might
expect
if
your
only
exposure
to
the
style
was
the
lindemans
kriek
which
is
nonetheless
excellent
this
beer
would
be
good
with
food
and
certainly
is
sessionable
i
would
love
to
have
the
opportunity
to
plow
through
a
few
gallons
of
this
beer
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
little
touches
of
tartness
and
sharpness
from
the
carbonation
fairly
light
bodied
big
sweet
cherry
pie
flavor
little
bit
of
mustiness
and
some
metallic
notes
that
dissipated
after
letting
the
beer
breathe
it
had
a
nice
smooth
sourtart
taste
to
it
cherries
were
long
gone
smooth
body
not
much
carbonation
after
30
years
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
like
i
said
it
was
more
about
the
experience
of
drinking
a
30yearold
lambic
which
i
doubt
ill
ever
have
again
could
also
use
more
carbonation
dark
pink
spotaneous
fermentation
very
cherry
aroma
the
real
deal
a
little
too
sweet
soft
carbonation
a
little
tart
very
drinkable
a
touch
of
spice
i
would
like
more
tartness
and
more
spice
stephens
bottle
perhaps
not
the
bang
on
but
a
worthy
try
o
definitely
not
a
beer
ill
revisit
in
the
future
its
basically
like
drinking
a
bottle
of
cranberrycherry
juice
overall
quite
a
simple
tasting
yet
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
this
pours
a
maroon
reddish
color
with
only
a
slight
head
the
scent
is
very
rich
with
cherries
giving
the
aroma
more
of
a
cherry
wine
rather
than
a
cherry
beer
its
very
sweet
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
refreshing
there
is
not
presence
of
alcohol
at
all
in
the
taste
texture
is
flat
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
as
it
finishes
at
5
abv
wow
this
is
something
you
could
give
to
a
kid
and
they
would
think
its
cherry
juice
not
bad
different
but
could
use
a
little
improvement
to
become
a
great
lambic
o
this
beer
has
been
made
to
sell
it
is
not
made
for
beer
reviews
very
intelligent
brew
o
overall
an
average
lambic
at
best
overall
solid
lambic
for
the
price
obviously
no
cantillon
or
fontenien
but
i
would
choose
a
lindemanns
over
this
specific
boon
oa
cherry
forward
lambic
big
fans
of
sourness
and
funk
present
in
some
of
the
other
krieks
probably
wont
love
this
one
but
is
really
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
which
is
a
big
plus
in
my
book
lacks
complexity
d
this
is
a
good
kriek
not
as
sour
or
funky
as
others
i
have
had
but
it
is
still
delicious
in
its
own
right
especially
if
you
like
cherries
overall
its
not
a
lambic
you
have
to
grow
into
its
not
a
sour
bomb
or
a
funk
bomb
or
a
beer
nuanced
by
years
of
wood
aging
its
sweet
its
flavorful
its
not
the
most
complex
wild
brew
but
putting
snobbery
aside
you
cant
tell
me
its
not
delicious
just
keep
that
in
mind
if
you
are
put
off
by
the
score
cheers
this
is
a
really
nice
lambic
it
lost
points
for
me
because
of
the
creamy
diacetylic
notes
that
i
got
in
the
finish
otherwise
this
lambic
is
flawless
and
definitely
worthy
of
your
time
and
attention

by
the
way
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
easydrinking
refreshing
beer
but
i
find
the
flavor
to
be
a
bit
light
for
my
palate
i
also
thought
it
was
a
bit
undercarbonated
and
lacked
the
sparkle
of
a
really
good
lambic
o
nice
cherry
flavor
but
not
nearly
tart
enough
sere
in
tap
at
local
option
appearance
is
bright
red
with
moderate
haines
the
nose
is
full
of
ripe
cherries
oak
and
waves
of
tartness
paired
with
mild
funk
taste
is
all
fruit
with
big
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
mild
tartness
mouthfeel
is
under
carbonated
with
light
body
overall
this
kriek
sits
somewhere
between
sweet
and
tart
the
result
is
somewhat
boring
in
the
world
of
fruited
lambics
i
wish
it
swaye
one
way
or
the
other
my
first
kriek
so
forgive
some
ignorance
here
but
comes
off
as
slightly
alcoholic
cherry
soda
with
a
bit
less
fizz
sticky
coating
mouthfeel
is
the
biggest
detractor
for
me
and
sweeter
than
i
anticipated
not
really
my
style
but
trying
to
be
objective
in
the
scoring
as
i
have
a
good
feeling
that
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
d
a
rather
poor
representation
of
the
kriek
style
but
a
decent
and
respectable
brew
overall
while
i
can
definitely
see
myself
trying
this
again
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
there
are
just
bigger
and
better
things
in
the
lambic
style
for
me
to
try
opretty
good
lambic
not
overly
sweet
would
buy
it
again
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
lambic
to
drink
for
a
while
o
overall
this
beer
was
good
but
nothing
great
i
havent
had
many
krieks
so
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
i
think
it
eventually
becomes
overkill
i
let
my
gf
finish
the
other
glass
o
an
alright
beer
though
too
sweet
and
candylike
for
my
tastes
boon
kriek
is
pretty
bloody
red
red
as
stoner
eyes
with
trace
amount
of
small
bubbles
that
are
off
white
looking
and
foamy
off
the
tap
smell
is
cherry
up
front
with
some
artificial
like
scent
some
plastic
and
a
small
malt
build
taste
is
terribly
sweet
cherry
some
vanilla
extract
mild
funk
this
one
is
on
the
sweet
side
feel
is
a
bit
sour
yet
sweet
overpowers
that
feel
is
a
bit
up
from
light
with
a
syrupy
feel
on
the
way
down
minimal
carb
5ozs
was
plenty
and
perhaps
too
much
they
also
make
a
framboise
and
geuze
that
we
get
here
in
the
states
but
i
think
their
kriek
is
the
shining
star
of
the
lineup
overall
drinkability
interesting
but
i
think
i
like
framboise
better
as
a
flavor
for
a
fruit
lambic
when
first
poured
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
beer
i
would
have
guessed
i
was
served
carbonated
black
tart
cherry
juice
as
it
warmed
up
and
rested
a
bit
i
could
tell
some
other
flavors
were
trying
to
get
out
from
under
the
cherry
like
the
bitterness
at
the
end
which
i
thought
was
a
hint
of
a
spicyearthy
hop
but
it
was
so
hard
to
pull
out
im
thinking
it
was
my
imagination
great
appearance
good
aroma
but
just
okay
in
everything
else
as
for
drinkability
when
paired
with
food
its
a
nice
drink
went
well
with
chocolate
pudding
i
suspect
it
would
be
even
better
with
chocolate
cake
but
by
itself
its
just
okay
as
a
sipper
overall
a
pleasant
fruit
lambic
would
pair
excellent
with
port
wine
cheeses
and
spreads
or
with
waffles
and
fruit
for
breakfast
hazy
red
pour
with
about
a
finger
of
light
pink
head
hardly
any
lacing
but
otherwise
a
pretty
beer
the
aroma
is
like
smelling
cherry
juice
with
only
hints
of
tartness
really
nothing
other
than
the
fruit
apparent
from
the
aroma
the
taste
continues
this
cloyingly
sweet
cherries
without
much
else
the
sweetness
doesnt
really
get
to
me
so
i
think
the
drinkability
is
high
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
kriek
keep
looking
you
havent
found
it
yet
overall
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
had
anticipated
the
cherry
sourness
plays
very
well
with
the
lactic
lambic
tartness
great
gateway
beer
very
pleasing
tart
cherry
flavor
compliments
a
very
wellbalanced
maltiness
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
lambic
kriek
that
is
widely
available
in
many
markets
its
not
too
tart
yet
carries
enough
pleasing
fruit
flavor
to
make
it
worthwhile
seeking
out
o
nice
kriek
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
and
im
happy
with
it
could
be
a
little
funkier
and
more
sour
for
me
but
the
nice
cherry
flavor
i
will
probably
buy
again
and
put
it
down
for
a
long
time
o
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
read
on
this
site
that
the
sweetness
is
from
the
fruit
not
from
artificial
sweetners
i
am
not
so
sure
about
this
though
this
amount
of
apparent
sugar
seems
unlikely
to
survive
the
prolonged
warm
storage
this
bottle
was
undoubtedly
subjected
to
unless
it
was
pasteurized
i
like
the
slight
tartness
and
do
enjoy
the
cherry
flavors
they
are
just
a
little
pronounced
for
my
liking
more
like
a
shout
in
your
face
than
the
more
subtle
flavors
i
like
in
a
complex
balanced
beer
o
a
really
nice
tart
kriek
at
a
great
price
point
and
high
availability
a
total
easy
drinkier
my
bottle
was
listed
at
4
not
the
5
ba
lists
here
o
not
the
most
complex
kriek
but
good
for
what
it
is
nice
but
lacking
in
depth
im
guessing
this
is
a
more
commercial
kriek
with
added
sweeteners
plenty
of
cherry
flavour
but
its
too
sweet
and
doesnt
have
enough
funky
lambic
character
easy
drinking
and
goes
down
well
but
forgettable
this
basically
tastes
like
cherry
candy
not
cloying
but
not
far
from
it
either
going
in
i
thought
this
was
one
of
their
unsweetened
offerings
but
i
should
have
asked
before
ordering
overall
a
tasty
beer
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
real
lambics
for
a
beginner
very
easy
to
drink
more
sweet
than
funkysour
on
the
whole
a
pleasing
example
of
the
style
well
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
and
certainly
a
genial
way
of
introducing
a
friend
to
the
admittedly
much
broader
world
of
sour
beer
mlight
and
bubbly
beer
flavor
was
just
not
my
thing
do
very
drinkable
but
this
is
a
baseline
kriek
fine
for
the
price
point
and
a
great
basic
lambic
had
no
problem
downing
the
bottle
dark
blood
red
with
a
modest
pink
head
sweet
and
artificial
cherry
nose
just
a
touch
of
sourness
the
flavors
are
pretty
much
cherry
cough
syrup
and
artificial
cherry
flavoring
sweet
with
barely
a
hint
of
sour
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
nowhere
near
what
i
want
in
a
kriek
overall
its
a
decent
kriek
that
is
unfortunately
obviously
improveable
theres
just
too
much
that
could
be
done
to
make
it
better
which
detracts
from
the
positive
characters
that
are
there
o
dissapointed
no
to
have
any
funk
in
this
beer
and
it
smacks
of
extract
rather
than
genuine
fruit
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
cherry
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
cherry
red
head
the
smell
is
like
cherry
cough
syrup
with
not
even
the
slightest
hint
of
sour
or
funky
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
cough
syrup
or
cough
drop
cherry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
decent
for
the
fact
that
this
beer
tastes
so
disappointing
overall
would
not
buy
again
or
recommend
anyone
to
buy
this
sad
because
boon
oude
kriek
is
fantastic
and
boon
is
more
than
capable
of
producing
exceptional
traditional
kriek
lambic
this
beer
sadly
represents
catering
to
the
belgian
market
for
sweets
and
crap
alcopops
not
real
good
to
much
cherry
not
enough
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
this
burgundy
colored
lambic
produced
a
tight
head
which
quickly
fell
the
smell
of
tart
cherries
was
welcoming
however
the
flavor
was
a
bit
one
dimensional
for
me
sweet
on
the
front
and
dry
on
the
finish
i
did
use
this
lambic
in
my
cherry
brownie
recipe
and
the
brownies
were
amazing
disclaimer
i
rate
backsweetened
lambics
to
the
style
of
sparkling
fruit
juice
not
actual
lambics
not
real
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
the
juicy
mouthfeel
really
makes
it
drinkable
and
a
nice
dessert
beer
but
it
really
lacks
depth
even
a
stronger
flavor
like
sweetersourer
cherries
or
even
some
of
that
belgian
sour
funk
would
have
made
it
much
more
appealing
overall
enjoyable
but
clearly
not
an
overly
complex
example
of
the
style
the
2011
bachelor
party
extravaganzas
winding
down
a
bit
moving
to
some
dessertstyle
beers
this
one
pours
a
clear
bleached
ruby
topped
by
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
lightpinkish
foam
the
nose
is
nothing
but
sweet
cherries
aching
to
be
set
ablaze
in
a
fit
of
jubilee
the
taste
keeps
this
pattern
fresh
at
the
start
with
those
sweet
cherries
really
popping
on
the
tongue
then
near
the
finish
a
very
light
but
still
noticeable
tartness
creeps
in
for
a
brief
appearance
bringing
in
a
small
currant
flavor
the
body
straddles
the
line
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
though
still
mildly
effervescent
feel
overall
a
nice
lambic
something
not
too
sour
and
not
too
sweet
o
overall
not
one
of
the
best
krieks
i
have
had
but
does
suit
the
style
very
well
pours
a
bright
red
color
somewhat
dark
though
still
bright
light
pink
head
starts
out
at
a
single
finger
and
some
pretty
good
retention
the
nose
carries
some
fragrant
cherries
though
theres
only
a
mild
tartness
and
no
funk
the
flavor
is
all
cherry
and
tastes
too
sweet
nothing
there
to
balance
it
out
and
no
real
indication
that
this
is
a
lambic
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
fairly
sweet
mildly
tart
decent
enough
on
a
hot
day
but
nowhere
near
what
a
lambic
should
be
tm
has
a
upfront
sweetness
of
cherries
and
a
red
wine
bitterness
refreshing
light
tart
and
a
smooth
watery
mouthfeel
put
this
down
as
a
after
dinner
beer
o
really
not
impressive
it
is
not
much
better
than
lindemans
weak
offerings
sweet
without
much
funk
or
sourness
though
at
least
these
characteristics
are
hinted
at
beer
is
thin
and
has
this
mild
sweetness
to
it
the
finish
is
mildly
tart
from
the
fruit
mild
lactic
acid
creaminess
to
the
whole
thing
d
a
very
sweet
and
rich
interpretation
very
straightforward
here
with
not
a
whole
lot
that
makes
what
great
lambics
are
great
a
funk
and
sourness
this
has
neither
boons
oude
kriek
is
on
a
whole
other
level
than
this
one
overall
this
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
and
really
nicely
done
i
think
my
favorite
style
may
be
changing
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
kriek
but
find
the
watery
middle
and
mild
tartness
to
be
a
little
confusing
on
the
tastebuds
this
beer
is
neither
sweet
nor
tart
both
characteristics
are
there
but
fail
to
be
fully
announce
their
presence
the
apple
core
bitterness
that
i
am
picking
up
is
also
a
little
offputting
within
the
overall
flavor
profile
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
within
the
juicy
cherries
that
appear
up
front
but
loses
some
steam
in
the
finish
the
fruit
is
still
there
but
not
to
the
same
extent
approachable
and
enjoyable
pours
out
bright
red
with
a
pinkishwhite
head
obvious
cherry
aroma
fairly
light
tasting
all
cherry
and
no
beer
and
not
extraordinarily
flavorful
at
that
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
though
and
a
fair
enough
afterdinner
beer
though
definitely
not
the
best
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
red
fluffy
and
dense
pink
head
nice
lacing
and
strong
retention
pretty
nose
has
some
marschine
cherry
mild
medicinal
notes
some
lactic
presence
a
general
yogurt
feel
to
it
taste
has
more
cherry
sweetness
mild
lactic
notes
and
this
mysterious
yogurt
comes
through
again
mouthfeel
has
some
slight
tartness
good
feel
with
some
good
cherry
flavour
tastes
way
better
than
the
nose
would
indicate
a
middleground
for
true
kriek
lovers
and
those
who
prefer
fruit
drinks
overboard
on
the
sweeteners
but
still
does
the
trick
on
a
sunny
day
dthis
is
a
poor
attempt
at
a
beer
flabby
flat
and
watery
too
malty
and
artificial
with
way
too
much
sugar
and
not
enough
anything
good
very
much
a
lambic
with
training
wheels
lacking
the
sourness
brett
character
dryness
or
complexity
of
a
great
kreik
the
beer
tastes
like
it
was
pasturized
with
cherry
flavoring
added
after
it
would
probably
be
great
over
ice
cream
or
to
cook
with
one
of
my
favourite
more
standard
lambics
this
one
as
its
easily
enjoyed
with
a
touch
of
funkiness
to
keep
you
interested
a
great
choice
for
someone
just
starting
out
a
pleasant
wellbalanced
fruit
beer
the
tartness
is
definitely
on
the
low
side
especially
considering
the
particular
guest
component
compared
to
some
of
its
compatriots
unfortunately
the
onesided
fruitiness
kind
of
limits
this
to
dessert
fodder
but
at
8
bucks
a
pop
around
these
parts
methinks
it
was
good
to
try
just
the
one
time
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
because
the
cherries
are
well
incorporated
into
the
taste
d
a
tasty
beer
but
overall
not
one
of
the
stronger
fruit
lambics
out
there
d
good
but
not
great
would
be
a
great
beer
for
someone
getting
into
the
style
really
great
with
chocolate
a
rather
normal
kriek
good
as
aperitif
or
digestif
d
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
the
boon
framboise
but
its
not
the
best
kriek
out
there
either
stick
with
cantillon
or
drie
fonteinen
to
clarify
when
we
talk
about
this
beer
being
sweetened
it
is
not
to
be
confused
with
other
nontraditional
beers
that
use
artificial
sweeteners
fruit
is
used
to
sweeten
this
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
is
pretty
easy
drinking
it
goes
down
quickly
and
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
that
stays
for
a
short
while
more
cherry
massivity
light
body
and
mostly
lacking
in
recognizable
malt
characteristics
and
yeast
contribution
a
touch
of
lactic
acid
d
incredibly
drinkable
i
could
easily
pass
this
off
as
cherry
soda
and
at
4
abv
could
drink
it
all
day
perhaps
not
as
tart
and
funky
as
other
offerings
but
this
would
be
a
superb
choice
for
getting
your
feet
wet
in
the
lambic
world
this
beer
is
light
in
body
with
a
lightly
sparkling
carbonation
there
is
not
a
lot
of
depth
or
complexity
but
its
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
db
the
flavors
here
are
all
good
but
sweetness
devours
it
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
a
lambic
with
sugar
outweighing
tartness
strange
but
not
bad
the
appearance
carries
the
score
pretty
solid
mouthfeelcarbonation
but
i
guess
ive
been
spoiled
on
lambics
for
cantillon
i
was
hoping
for
gutwrenching
sourness
with
a
huge
cherry
taste
easily
drinkable
and
more
or
less
enjoyable
but
i
cant
see
myself
ever
getting
this
for
the
price
d
goes
down
easy
very
refreshing
this
is
quite
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
remember
it
being
still
a
tasty
lambic
glad
to
have
scored
three
really
dusty
bottles
recently
d
its
not
for
me
it
tastes
like
a
girly
wine
spritzer
will
not
buy
again
now
if
youll
excuse
me
im
off
to
buy
a
cantillon
and
hope
for
the
best
also
this
beer
is
spontaneously
fermented
so
it
sounds
as
though
it
would
be
very
inconsistent
potentially
it
could
be
a
different
beer
next
around
boon
might
not
be
at
the
top
tier
of
lambic
and
geueze
producers
but
this
kriek
is
nonetheless
very
tasty
the
beer
presented
in
a
corked
and
caged
750
ml
bottle
and
poured
into
a
white
wine
glass
all
i
had
around
while
on
vacation
the
kriek
was
a
clear
garnet
in
color
with
a
fine
pink
cap
that
lasted
but
left
little
lacing
the
beer
smelled
and
tasted
very
bright
from
sour
cherries
the
beer
was
not
too
sweet
but
nicely
balanced
with
enough
tartness
overall
the
expression
of
the
wild
character
was
limited
the
amount
of
fruit
flavor
had
that
effect
on
the
beer
and
it
appeared
that
the
beer
was
not
bottled
conditioned
which
can
definitely
help
the
bugs
do
more
work
this
is
a
good
beginner
beer
but
for
the
more
advanced
beer
drinker
this
might
be
disappointing
spritzy
and
light
just
what
i
was
hoping
for
when
i
picked
this
one
out
but
it
falls
a
bit
short
as
the
sweet
is
so
much
more
prominent
than
the
sour
and
the
funky
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
as
it
is
readily
available
and
not
too
expensive
however
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
in
terms
of
a
great
lambic
d
in
the
end
this
is
one
sweet
cherry
bomb
i
think
some
people
might
appreciate
the
sweetness
more
than
i
do
in
the
end
i
just
think
this
lacks
the
refinement
and
subtlety
that
makes
good
krieks
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
deep
thick
looking
cherry
red
pour
with
thick
poof
of
prickly
pinkish
hued
head
scent
is
of
strong
tart
and
sweet
cherry
almost
like
pre
packaged
pie
filling
while
its
not
what
i
want
out
of
a
beer
necessarily
i
think
it
smells
fantastic
taste
is
very
syrupy
and
almost
medicinal
strong
musty
cherrys
cola
cranberry
and
touches
of
grahmn
cracker
medium
bodies
syrupy
and
coating
the
scent
is
the
beers
best
quality
and
thats
about
all
i
enjoyed
nice
cherry
red
with
a
soapy
pink
head
with
food
retention
this
is
decent
the
nose
has
a
big
cherry
character
quite
fruity
like
a
cocktail
cherry
rather
sweet
artificially
so
this
is
simple
and
lacking
in
funk
mildly
medicinal
too
the
palate
opens
with
a
cough
syruplike
character
with
berry
sweetness
low
sourness
and
low
funk
medium
light
in
body
highly
carbonated
this
is
way
too
sweet
and
rather
disappointing
d
great
overall
leaves
me
wanting
one
more
to
split
heres
hoping
my
200th
will
be
a
bit
more
impressive
d
though
it
is
not
tremendously
sweet
there
is
no
real
tartness
to
balance
and
so
it
is
somewhat
cloying
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
the
cherry
flavour
came
to
the
front
in
this
lambic
as
i
figured
that
it
might
be
a
much
more
austere
beer
with
the
lambic
notes
dominating
the
cherry
taste
was
deep
and
delicious
with
just
right
amount
of
sweetness
i
never
got
sick
of
this
beer
and
realized
just
how
great
a
blender
boon
is
with
his
lambics
d
because
this
is
not
overly
sweet
and
because
it
is
so
light
and
refreshing
this
has
great
drinkability
if
you
can
enjoy
the
fruit
flavor
and
lack
of
traditional
lambic
tartness
d
nice
enough
kriek
but
stick
to
the
bottled
oude
kriek
if
you
dont
like
the
sweet
stuff
d
eh
too
juicelike
needs
moar
sour
on
tap
at
camping
in
beersel
pours
a
bright
red
like
a
jar
of
bar
cherries
topped
with
a
frothy
deep
pink
head
aroma
of
tart
cherries
pounds
the
nose
from
a
foot
away
and
is
followed
by
touches
of
sweet
brown
sugar
and
hints
of
the
mild
lambic
sourness
that
is
to
come
as
expected
cherry
dominates
the
palate
as
well
there
are
hints
of
vinousness
and
a
general
red
fruitiness
but
this
isnt
particularly
depthful
still
the
sweettart
character
of
the
cherries
mixed
with
the
sourness
of
the
lambic
which
also
dries
the
beer
a
little
makes
this
a
very
balanced
and
pleasant
beer
as
cherry
beers
go
especially
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
on
this
and
other
occasions
d
easy
to
finish
very
juice
like
and
unlambic
like
disappointing
i
wont
be
buying
this
again

for

just
a

not
a

beer
and
worth
atleast
a
try

overall
it
is
what
it
is
if
this
helps
people
get
into
real

slightly

dissapointingly
not
sour
great
on
a
hot
day
like
today
this
would
be
good
poored
over
some
good
vanilla
ice
cream
while
id
rather
have
a
cantillion
kriek
anyday
this
is
a
pleasant
drink
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
silky
smooth
but
overall
this
was
slightly
dissappointing
i
thought
it
might
be
more
challenging
good
beer
though
picked
up
a
75ml
for
about
4
euro
in
ghent
bottled
in
2007
reminds
me
of
cherry
sugar
candy
and
theres
a
mild
vanilla
edge
in
the
aroma
very
juicy
but
not
too
thick
like
lindemans
the
beer
finishes
on
a
fresh
dry
cherry
note
quite
nice
if
you
like
sweet
fruit
lambics
d
dont
like
it
d
very
drinkable
it
was
quite
ok
very
drinkable
but
slightly
too
sweet
d
a
good
beer
though
i
would
have
liked
some
more
complexity
cant
argue
that
much
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beverage
wont
have
again
d
highly
clean
and
refreshing
in
the
finish
i
dont
think
i
would
get
tired
of
drinking
this
one
id
say
this
particular
kriek
is
closer
to
a
lindemans
in
taste
although
not
quite
as
sweet
this
one
exceeded
my
expectations
but
still
isnt
my
favorite
style
or
even
flavor
within
the
style
still
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
lower
for
me
this
is
just
another
candy
beer
with
really
no
semblance
of
the
base
lambic
more
like
a
wine
cooler
not
worth
the
price
even
though
i
got
it
on
sale
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
funky
with
a
slight
cherry
tinge
instead
it
tastes
like
cherry
slurpee
syrup
again
in
oak
barrels
i
now
realize
i
was
thinking
of
the
oude
kriek
whoops
i
couldnt
finish
this
to
sweet
and
syrupy
md
with
the
mildly
sprizty
mouthfeel
echoing
the
refreshing
fruity
flavour
profile
this
superlightbodied
kriek
lambiek
proves
to
be
a
very
easydrinking
beer
in
the
summer
the
lack
of
complexity
is
a
minor
disappointment
but
not
so
much
as
to
decrease
the
overall
drinkability
pours
a
like
shirley
temple
smells
of
light
cherry
syrup
and
candy
taste
is
very
refreshing
pretty
sweet
with
a
whole
bunch
of
cherries
but
not
too
sweet
nice
dry
finish
good
lambic
would
definitely
drink
again
light
and
refreshing
but
i
cannot
have
more
than
one
nicely
done
but
i
prefer
a
more
pungent
taste
very
thick
and
creamy
a
fizzy
high
carbonated
feel
light
to
medium
bodied
as
with
most
fruit
beers
i
can
only
drink
one
every
once
in
a
while
this
one
is
not
the
best
and
for
the
price
i
expected
much
more
quite
good
representation
of
a
lambic
not
as
bold
as
some
but
that
is
made
up
for
in
its
smoothness
overall
very
good
exceptional
for
the
style
very
drinkable
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
still
very
good
after
5
years
probably
helped
mellow
it
out
i
would
love
to
cook
with
this
beer
as
well
as
to
try
it
along
side
a
dish
containing
dried
fruits
or
fruit
juice
reductions
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
particularly
enjoyable
the
acidity
and
fruit
character
are
weak
and
the
complex
funkiness
of
a
fruit
lambic
is
completely
lacking
leaving
this
beer
as
a
dull
example
of
the
style
the
taste
and
fell
though
are
weak
it
has
only
very
mild
cherry
flavour
and
mild
earthy
yeastiness
its
a
bit
sour
but
not
much
only
faint
tartness
and
mostly
just
dry
watery
and
bland
it
lacks
the
souryeasty
lambic
taste
of
even
the
supposedly
too
fruity
lindemans
and
doesnt
compare
to
the
melbourn
bros
both
being
more
fruity
and
more
lambicyeasty
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
hints
of
cherries
and
it
has
a
bit
of
tartness
the
beer
has
a
subtle
sweetness
to
it
with
a
combination
of
hints
of
tartness
the
sourness
is
very
late
in
the
beer
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
sourness
but
this
is
quite
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
and
carbonation
i
could
probably
drink
only
a
few
of
these
solid
beer
though
d
this
is
a
decent
aperitif
but
i
can
think
of
much
better
i
couldnt
finish
either
of
the
lindemans
fruit
lambics
i
previously
reviewed
so
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
extremely
approachable
yet
it
is
not
an
offensive
syrupy
mess
there
is
a
hint
of
wild
character
i
doubt
a
newbie
would
even
pick
it
out
not
something
ill
chase
down
again
but
certainly
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
an
intro
to
fruit
lambic
a
deep
cherry
color
quite
clear
with
a
nice
pink
head
not
super
carbonated
though
smells
of
cherry
and
also
slightly
tart
with
a
woodiness
to
it
as
well
almost
cherry
candy
type
aromas
not
very
sour
tasting
at
all
though
not
that
sweet
either
a
little
bit
of
a
tannic
edge
finishes
the
beer
off
quite
mellow
for
a
lambic
overall
this
has
a
nice
cherry
flavor
backed
by
a
pleasing
light
acidity
this
would
be
a
good
first
lambic
beer
for
those
who
have
not
had
the
style
but
in
the
end
it
just
does
not
hold
up
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
for
the
level
of
sweetness
lots
of
prickly
effervescence
extremely
drinkable
great
dessert
beer
d
my
favorite
kriek
so
far
wouldnt
drink
it
too
often
though
especially
when
its
about
15aus
rarely
available
dark
strawberry
jam
color
with
a
fizzy
grape
juice
looking
head
aroma
of
cherry
lollipop
with
a
hint
of
acidity
and
cool
cement
straight
up
cherry
lifesaver
flavor
with
tartness
tingling
the
sides
of
the
tongue
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
much
lambic
character
to
distinguish
behind
the
sweet
cherry
flavors
pity
im
afraid
i
cant
even
take
this
beer
seriously
double
pity
however
on
a
few
sips
the
late
finish
reveals
some
funky
tartness
not
explained
by
the
cherry
it
must
be
the
lambic
poking
through
after
all
but
its
only
on
random
infrequent
sips
triple
pity
my
final
revelation
is
the
taste
of
cherry
soda
mingled
with
the
smoke
of
fireworks
too
bad
i
couldnt
have
gotten
buzzed
off
this
as
a
kid
on
the
fourth
of
july
while
lighting
bottlerockets
quadruple
pity
this
i
beleive
to
be
the
best
sweet
cherry
lambic
on
the
market
brewed
in
lambeek
this
pours
a
cloudy
cherry
red
with
good
head
the
nose
reeks
of
cherries
and
leads
you
to
beleive
it
will
be
harshly
sour
like
cantillon
kriek
the
taste
is
shockingly
smooth
those
of
you
looking
for
the
sour
face
puckering
taste
of
a
geuze
or
cantillon
type
brew
do
not
buy
this
this
is
full
of
cherry
flavor
and
goes
down
like
fruit
juice
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
helps
sharp
cherry
flavor
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
perfect
could
drink
this
for
a
week
straight
i
wouldnt
recommend
doing
that
though
as
it
would
probably
cause
on
wicked
hangover
from
the
sugar
that
would
be
the
fructose
that
sticks
to
your
lips
great
brew
usually
i
only
enjoy
framboise
or
cassis
lambics
when
they
are
sweet
like
this
and
should
really
be
classified
as
fruit
beers
but
this
is
the
exception
the
only
disadvantage
is
the
outrageous
price
for
a
little
corked
bottle
worth
the
buy
but
only
for
a
special
occasion
feels
balanced
delicious
and
what
i
expect
in
a
lambic
not
like
lindemans
which
is
also
excellent
but
not
quite
as
polished
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
has
a
strong
syrup
taste
of
cherries
and
blackberries
the
wood
come
through
a
little
the
sourness
is
almost
invisible
but
shines
through
every
now
and
then
a
nicely
balanced
beer
with
sweetener
that
has
a
very
good
drinkability

d
a
great
light
kreik
nothing
really
overpowering
very
smooth
and
delicious
a
great
introductory
beer
to
sour
ales
too
because
its
present
but
not
very
strong
and
is
perfectly
matched
with
the
cherry
flavor
a
finish
of
cherry
sweetness
extends
well
past
finish
and
revisits
a
memory
of
the
fruit
going
into
the
next
sip
this
is
a
richer
kriek
that
focuses
too
heavily
on
cherry
flavor
and
sweetness
if
only
the
flavor
and
body
held
true
to
the
complex
aroma
mix
this
beer
would
have
fared
much
better
nice
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
tall
pink
head
that
has
nice
retention
quite
cloudy
as
well
smells
like
cherry
candy
slightly
tart
but
not
overly
lots
of
cherry
aroma
the
flavor
is
like
candy
as
well
sweet
thick
and
only
a
hint
of
tartness
lots
of
thick
cherry
flavor
very
nice
not
nearly
as
sour
as
most
lambics
but
extremely
tasty
beer
id
have
this
one
any
day
the
body
is
thick
and
the
drinkability
is
great
i
liked
it
the
flavour
is
lovely
and
aroma
fantastic
a
good
product
from
a
wonderful
brewer
albeit
this
is
far
from
the
best
of
krieks
but
it
was
certainly
worth
far
more
than
the
150
euro
i
payed
for
it
bottle
poured
a
deep
reddish
color
lambic
with
a
super
huge
pink
foamy
head
with
perfect
retention
aroma
of
sweet
cherries
with
some
tart
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
sweet
cherries
with
tart
notes
not
as
sour
as
some
other
example
of
the
style
cantillon
drie
fonteinen
but
i
dont
believe
any
sugar
was
added
maybe
just
cherries
with
a
sweeter
taste
profile
but
i
might
be
wrong
body
is
full
with
some
low
filtration
and
some
great
carbonation
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
for
summertime
totally
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
dessert
beer
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
and
quite
tasty
all
that
being
said
this
beer
is
very
plain
and
that
becomes
noticeable
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
it
is
still
a
fine
beer
but
i
will
get
the
cantillon
next
time
dvery
tasty
but
the
drinkability
is
limited
due
to
the
profound
tartness
a
decent
lambic
but
doesnt
have
the
tartness
or
complexity
of
a
true
lambic
its
kind
of
one
dimensional
with
the
cherry
however
it
tastes
good
but
this
is
a
lambic
damnit
i
want
some
tartness
and
sourness
this
doesnt
realy
ive
me
that
the
head
was
decent
for
a
lambic
and
there
was
a
tiny
bit
left
over
throughout
a
decent
beer
but
nowhere
near
worth
the
8
99
i
paid
for
it
overall
this
is
a
fine
fruit
lambic
and
a
good
one
to
get
to
know
the
style
on
since
its
not
as
sour
as
others
tasty
but
overly
sweet
imo
i
couldnt
too
much
of
this
and
although
its
nice
it
lacks
complexity
ive
tasted
in
other
fruit
lambics
i
expected
more
out
of
boon
kriek
than
i
got
first
and
foremost
i
expected
more
explosive
cherry
flavor
its
an
enjoyable
little
fruity
sipper
but
theres
no
way
ill
buy
it
again
if
i
have
to
pay
the
same
5
99
that
i
paid
for
this
bottle
an
okay
cherry
lambic
for
what
it
is
nothing
earthshattering
or
mindblowing
would
make
a
decent
dessert
beer
i
do
like
cherries
but
this
does
become
rather
onedimensional
and
old
hat
after
half
a
glass
so
be
it
d
alright
cherry
lambics
are
pretty
common
and
generally
better
than
this
one
i
wont
have
it
again
but
if
your
idea
of
the
perfect
lambic
is
a
sour
cherry
soda
than
hunt
this
down
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
got
through
it
with
ease
d
not
exactly
my
pint
of
beer
but
was
very
easy
and
light
to
drink
its
not
too
sour
so
may
be
a
good
beer
to
start
someone
on
lambics
a
bit
disappointing
but
still
a
solid
kriek
ive
come
to
expect
alot
from
boon
however
this
isnt
a
big
bold
sour
lambic
like
cantillon
kriek
or
kriek
de
ranke
but
it
is
pretty
solid
pours
a
deep
burgundy
with
a
stable
head
strong
tart
cherry
aroma
flavor
is
very
tart
and
a
bit
sour
up
front
with
fruit
some
carbonation
in
the
middle
and
lingering
tanginess
some
bubblegum
light
mouthfeel
and
definitely
not
cloying
might
rereview
later
because
this
is
my
first
nonlindemans
lambic
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
not
all
that
great
ive
had
better
lambics
but
ive
also
had
worse
middle
of
the
road
and
at
least
worth
a
try
if
youve
had
many
of
the
others
drinkable
i
could
see
this
served
with
a
fresh
fruit
tart
some
zabayone
or
perhaps
a
flan
this
beer
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
its
not
horrible
but
there
are
better
fruit
flavored
beers
out
there
im
very
picky
about
fruit
lambics
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
krieks
d
really
not
bad
easy
5
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
depends
how
you
feel
about
cherry
flavours
with
this
one
it
isnt
bad
but
i
really
wouldnt
look
for
it
again
it
just
hasnt
excited
me
overall
i
was
hoping
for
more
sour
and
earthy
aromas
and
flavors
as
is
this
is
a
pretty
good
sweet
lambic
d
easy
count
this
as
a
session
beer
at
5
many
could
go
down
try
it
with
your
girlfriend
ruby
red
with
no
head
real
sour
cherry
smell
black
cherries
smells
like
the
fruit
really
smellstastes
not
like
that
weird
cherry
flavor
you
run
into
so
much
tastes
very
light
again
like
real
fruit
very
small
taste
compared
to
the
smell
but
it
grows
tart
sour
cherries
with
the
lambic
sourness
too
not
too
sweet
again
like
real
fruit
very
dry
finish
very
pleasant
all
in
all
a
good
drinking
lambic
maybe
a
touch
sweet
but
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
a
nice
kriek
though
on
the
sweet
side
compared
to
cantillon
drier
and
more
complex
than
a
typical
lindemans
sweet
massive
carbonation
makes
a
virtual
slushy
in
my
mouth
dry
wood
stacks
up
on
the
sides
of
the
palate
as
the
foam
melts
mainly
tastes
like
cherry
hard
candy
and
cherry
taffy
im
going
to
let
it
sit
for
a
bit
to
deflate
this
is
a
foam
munster
theres
a
twinge
of
sourness
the
grapeskin
sourness
is
like
an
after
thought
of
wild
fermentation
drinking
this
makes
me
feel
like
i
sucked
some
nitrous
it
roughed
up
my
throat
i
suggest
drinking
it
colder

this
is
clearly
one
of
the
more
complex
and
delicious
krieks
that
i
have
drunk
really
nice
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
to
medium
in
the
mouth
with
a
soft
carbonation
if
it
werent
for
the
complexity
in
the
taste
this
would
sure
be
a
lot
easier
to
put
down
easy
drinking
but
very
savory
this
is
one
to
enjoy
after
the
partys
over
when
your
tastebuds
crave
to
retire
with
something
unique
to
remember
overall
a
very
good
kriek
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
maybe
ever
so
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
though
well
i
like
this
style
as
an
indulgence
but
was
actually
a
bit
surprised
by
how
sweet
this
one
was
muddy
henna
red
when
poured
theres
some
pink
strawberry
colored
foam
on
top
which
has
lasted
aromawise
while
i
can
pick
up
the
kriek
i
can
pick
up
the
sugar
as
well
tastewise
it
should
be
figured
out
by
now
that
i
think
the
sugar
overpowers
the
kriek
more
than
it
should
the
cherry
is
evident
just
not
as
to
the
fore
as
would
be
nice
some
tartness
there
but
you
have
to
look
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
pours
a
dull
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
head
sour
cherry
smell
there
are
some
lambic
smells
but
they
seem
to
be
covered
up
by
the
cherries
the
flavor
is
real
cherries
but
not
a
lot
else
from
the
aroma
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
very
sour
but
the
sour
flavor
never
came
the
fizzyness
and
the
cherry
flavor
together
make
this
feel
like
a
soft
drink
theres
nothing
terrible
about
this
beer
i
just
think
it
could
have
been
so
much
better
the
cork
explodes
so
watch
out
the
beer
pours
a
nice
light
red
with
a
foamy
pink
head
the
smell
was
of
cherries
but
the
complexity
was
lacking
the
same
with
the
flavor
the
cherry
taste
is
alright
but
the
complexity
is
not
there
its
a
simple
fizzy
cherry
alcoholic
beverage
without
really
being
anything
special
one
of
the
more
dissapointing
lambics
ive
had
but
still
tasty
dark
magenta
with
inty
bubbles
sticking
all
around
the
edge
even
smells
sour
smells
of
fruits
hard
to
pick
out
the
cherry
notes
also
smell
woody
characteristics
every
sip
seems
so
different
from
the
last
some
over
poweringly
sour
and
bitte
while
others
seem
much
more
mellow
i
wouldnt
even
say
that
it
tastes
that
much
like
cherries
i
think
i
taste
it
cause
i
a
supposed
to
so
ahrd
to
describe
the
flavors
but
i
get
a
pleasent
wet
carboard
kind
of
taste
mixed
with
the
sourness
and
a
pop
of
fruit
at
the
end
much
crisper
when
cold
much
more
sour
as
it
warms
you
canr
eally
taste
it
waround
the
outside
of
your
tounge
i
dont
know
what
taht
means
just
an
observation
i
have
never
noticed
before
surprisingly
heavy
as
it
sits
in
the
old
gut
for
awhile
might
just
be
the
acidity
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
fluffy
bubbly
carbonation
runs
over
my
tongue
easily
drinkable
brew
and
quite
a
tasty
treat
not
your
everyday
beer
but
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
lambics
and
seeing
where
the
style
takes
me
i
felt
the
lindemans
was
a
better
brew
a
nice
kriek
but
definitely
not
my
favourite
still
a
decent
brew
though
the
smell
of
sour
cherries
was
very
strong
that
was
the
high
lite
of
this
kriek
the
taste
fell
quite
a
bit
short
compare
to
the
aroma
the
ale
gave
out
the
flavor
of
a
sour
substance
was
evident
but
not
much
on
the
cherry
side
although
pleasant
it
came
up
short
for
a
good
kriek

more
of

cherries
rather
than
a
proper
kriek
in
my
humble
opinion

damn
good
nonetheless

one

sour

are
endless
this
makes
an
excellent

and
is
an
excellent
lambic
in
the
most
traditional
sense
definitely
worth
a
try
the
appearance
pretty
much
tells
you
what
this

is
going

be

this
is
going
to
be
a
very

beer
with
some
sweetness
this
is
definately
a
beer
for
cherry
lovers
nothing
but
cherries
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
it
might
turn
some
beer
lovers
off
but
the
sourness
of
cherries
are
in
my
opinion
an
excellent
choice
for
an
addition
of
the
lambic
style
heres
a
tip
give
this
beer
to
a

who
thinks

only

the

a

with
a
fine

rich

with
hints

and
eversoslightly

also
has
a
rather
vinous
character
to
the
smell
tart
cherry
flavor
but
not
overpowering
like
other
fruit
lambics
ive
tried
nice
mouthfeel
of
rough
carbonation
and
the
thickness
of
the
beer
itself
very
dry
finish
pretty
straight
forward
and
a
good
cherry
lambic
nice
looking
scarlet
red
hue
a
slight
collar
is
all
this
beer
offers
for
a
head
wafts
of
brown
sugar
and
sour
cherry
hits
the
nose
immediately
the
oak
and
wood
characteristics
really
add
a
nice
dimension
to
this
beer
tart
acidic
qualities
dominate
the
taste
profile
otherwise
but
not
in
an
obnoxious
way
very
slight
candied
flavors
are
present
if
you
look
hard
enough
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
beckons
another
sip
from
you
even
though
it
is
fairly
tart
enjoyable
an
easy
drinking
kriek
that
is
somewhat
dry
and
cherry
flavor
is
not
overpowering
its
not
assweet
as
lindemans
but
is
somewhat
sweet
and
not
too
tart
but
has
enough
tartness
to
make
you
pucker
a
little
i
think
it
could
be
bit
drier
and
have
a
little
more
tartness
to
help
balance
the
sweet
side
i
would
like
to
try
the
marriage
parfait
if
i
could
find
it
normally
i
find
kriek
to
be
better
than
framboise
with
most
of
the
lambic
produces
but
with
boon
i
found
the
opposite
thats
not
to
say
this
isnt
bad
this
has
lots
of
fruit
but
lacks
a
bit
of
tartness
and
tends
to
be
a
bit
sweet
still
very
refreshing
ruby
in
color
and
a
bit
hazy
topped
by
a
thin
but
persistent
head
that
manages
to
leave
a
lace
the
expected
sweet
cherry
aroma
is
followed
by
a
more
complex
tartness
and
slight
hint
of
wet
horse
like
brettanomyces
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
overall
but
has
more
complexity
when
compared
to
the
ubiquitous
and
cloyingly
sweet
lindemans
lambics
the
cherry
flavor
is
prominent
but
subtle
green
apple
acetaldehyde
and
welcome
contributions
from
lactic
acid
bacteria
add
a
pleasant
tartness
the
taste
grows
on
me
as
i
begin
to
discern
the
understated
complexities
of
the
overall
tartness
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
pleasant
crisp
and
dry
finish
w
lingering
cherry
flavors
this
is
certainly
a
tasty
lambic
the
flavor
is
skewed
towards
sweetness
but
theres
enough
overall
complexity
and
lightness
to
make
it
quite
drinkable
boon
kriek
is
unique
and
definitely
worth
trying
but
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
showstopper
decent
framboise
nice
juicy
raspberry
aroma
but
the
fruit
is
a
bit
less
present
in
the
flavor
mildly
sour
soft
lambic
flavors
ok
beer
not
as
good
as
lindemans
by
along
shot
o
this
needs
to
pick
a
direction
and
go
with
it
either
fruity
or
sour
instead
the
lack
of
direction
leaves
it
rather
average
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
enjoyable
considering
the
abv
its
a
very
good
lambic
that
is
open
to
all
crowds
in
the
lambic
field
its
not
too
adventurous
and
yet
its
drinkable
beyond
repair
i
guess
what
people
are
looking
for
nowadays
is
acidity
that
will
burn
both
your
tastes
buds
and
enamel
off
your
teeth
all
in
all
this
brew
is
worthy
an
odd
beast
for
a
raspberry
lambic
with
notes
of
apple
and
rhubarb
throughout
in
addition
to
tinned
raspberries
but
really
let
down
by
lack
of
carbonation
and
a
very
thin
and
watery
body
which
applies
to
taste
and
feel
not
real
sour
either
drinkable
and
balanced
but
theres
something
unimpressive
and
weak
about
it
all
pours
a
slightly
murky
reddish
brown
color
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
heads
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
aromas
of
raspberry
jam
a
hint
of
molasses
and
a
bit
of
earthy
funk
the
flavor
is
lightly
tart
from
the
fruit
with
lots
of
berry
flavor
hints
of
dark
caramelized
sugars
with
a
touch
of
citric
tartness
and
earthy
funk
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
enough
brew
but
i
felt
it
could
have
had
more
of
a
pucker
factor

a
b
boon
framboise
makes
for
a
nice
summer
treat
occupying
a
comfortable
middle
ground
between
sweet
fruity
flavoured
lambics
and
the
funky
sour
ones
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
while
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
pleasant
tart
vinous
flavour
its
not
exactly
wowing
me
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
planned
to
buy
it
again
any
time
soon
mostly
because
its
a
little
pricy
in
this
market
but
given
the
lack
of
good
lambics
around
here
its
still
worth
a
pickup
or
two
od
sweeter
than
some
takes
on
the
style
but
good
liked
it
but
the
tartness
could
have
been
amped
up
i
liken
this
to
a
summer
spritzer
as
opposed
to
a
traditional
lambic
its
quite
tame
on
the
more
traditional
characteristics
of
the
style
but
at
the
same
time
its
very
refreshing
and
perfect
for
a
light
fruity
thirst
quenching
beer
on
a
hot
summers
day
o
a
delicious
fruit
lambic
that
is
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
im
growing
to
like
the
lambicssours
this
is
a
very
nice
raspberry
lambic
id
love
to
have
it
with
a
slice
of
chocolate
cake
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
sediment
the
aroma
is
full
of
raspberries
and
malty
sugars
in
the
taste
tart
raspberry
and
lemon
flavor
there
is
a
bit
of
oak
but
otherwise
pretty
jammy
and
slightly
acetic
has
a
slight
musty
quality
and
ever
so
faint
bitterness
about
it
but
overall
this
reminds
me
of
a
wild
raspberry
champagne
not
that
ive
had
one
to
compare
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
other
berry
lambics
which
is
refreshing
here
i
prefer
this
to
the
overly
sweeter
versions
this
is
a
nice
balanced
lambic
o
love
these
traditional
lambics
reminds
me
of
cantillons
kriek
in
its
dryness
fruitiness
and
no
added
sugar
drank
it
on
my
41st
birthday
may
15
2014
i
read
afterward
that
there
are
cherries
in
it
so
i
wasnt
just
imagining
it
on
the
nose
i
like
boon
framboise
more
than
these
scores
may
let
on
its
only
fault
is
not
being
as
satisfyingly
sour
or
seductively
sweet
as
its
compatriots
still
its
a
remarkably
enjoyable
offering
one
worth
the
bigger
price
tag
and
its
also
a
safe
bet
for
initiates
this
will
make
you
plenty
of
friends

d
this
was
good
but
not
a
lambic
i
would
revisit
given
the
generally
subdued
qualities
just
wish
there
were
more
lambics
to
choose
from
in
ontario
stores
overall
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
intro
into
sours
beers
its
got
a
light
tartness
but
is
in
no
way
overpowering
most
of
these
types
of
beers
are
also
a
little
cloying
this
one
keeps
the
sweetness
in
check
that
being
said
it
is
a
little
one
dimensional
but
decent
and
refreshing
nonetheless
ill
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
have
on
hand
to
introduce
others
to
the
style
overall
a
very
good
lambic
that
i
certainly
enjoyed
certainly
a
refreshing
beer
in
the
spring
because
of
the
price
point
for
the
quantity
this
isnt
something
id
pick
up
regularly
but
would
have
again
if
offered
o
i
found
the
tartness
of
this
beer
to
be
refreshing
at
first
but
it
became
a
little
overwhelming
toward
the
end
i
am
not
sure
id
have
this
again
o
overall
i
find
this
a
little
weak
accessible
but
not
exactly
bursting
with
favour
overall
not
the
best
framboise
certainly
easy
to
find
and
not
expensive
to
boot
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
just
a
bit
above
average
beats
lindemans
offering
for
sure

great
raspberry
forward
but
lacking
a
bit
of
sourness
and
some
of
the
complex
flavors
wild
microbes
bring
in
great
lambics
still
a
nice
framboise
to
sip
on
with
great
fruit
and
funk
aromas
smell
is
very
nice
after
having
a
lot
of
good
and
bad
sours
this
stacks
up
pretty
well
i
probably
would
have
been
tougher
on
this
earlier
on
in
my
reviewing
but
i
now
realize
the
true
dedication
it
takes
to
brew
a
beer
even
this
good
o
this
beer
drinks
more
like
raspberry
soda
than
beer
if
you
are
expecting
a
cantillion
or
a
fff
sort
of
experience
pass
this
bottle
on
by
in
all
likely
hood
this
is
the
last
bottle
of
this
i
will
ever
buy
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
at
7
for
a
bottle
its
far
from
the
most
expensive
lambic
out
there
but
its
not
overly
complex
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
its
a

fairly

overall
a

here
not

but
after
a
bit
there
is
a
strange
unpleasant
funk
left
in
my
mouth
i
dunno
what
it
is
i
am
new
to
lambics
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
sweeter
fruited
lambic
like
the
girardin
framboise
low
b
o
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
didnt
get
it
reminded
me
of
a
manishevitz
wine
i
wont
go
back
to
this
one
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
thankfully
so
almost
more
of
a
juice
than
a
lambic
as
it
was
pretty
onetrack
minded
and
not
very
complex
at
all
an
easy
drink
no
doubt
and
something
that
may
be
nice
to
open
with
someone
who
doesnt
care
much
for
beer
but
dont
purchase
this
expecting
cantillon
or
drie
fonteinen
quality
and
you
wont
be
too
upset
an
aged
version
i
love
how
the
fruit
holds
up
on
this
and
the
beer
has
a
superb
clarity
at
first
then
all
the
sediment
starts
getting
in
on
the
game
and
things
change
up
consistency
of
flavor
is
the
most
interesting
thing
here
brewing
mastery
that
keeps
the
drinking
experience
interesting
even
after
so
long
a
real
pleasure
to
be
able
to
drink
o
so
drinkable
and
tasty
this
fruit
beer
is
great
for
a
raspberry
beer
but
not
that
great
as
far
as
lambics
go
served
icecold
this
is
a
perfect
thirst
quencher
on

warm

day
drinking
this
on

night
it
brings
back
memories
of
summer
which
is
not

worst
thing
overall
this
is
a

lambic
i
have
enjoyed
over
the
years
i

it
a

weeks

at
the
bbf
and
happy
to
have
gotten
a
bottle
to
take
home
too
world
renowned
and
very
tasty
overall
this
was
by
far
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
the
flavors
were
just
too
barnyard
dominante
for
my
tastes
and
the
light
bubbly
airy
palate
is
just
not
my
style
this
one
was
relatively
hard
to
drink
and
theres
no
way
id
be
able
to
drink
a
bottle
myself
not
my
beer
if
you
like
your
lambics
a
little
less
sour
than
some
of
the
heavy
hitters
this
is
your
man
right
here
bridging
the
gap
between
the
sweeter
lindemans
or
mort
subite
style
and
the
sourbombs
from
cantillon
and
others
this
is
a
solid
brew
indeed
but
if
youre
looking
for
that
sour
fix
this
probably
wont
be
your
thing
o
a
bit
too
young
to
enjoy
at
this
point
but
i
could
see
this
developing
quite
nicely
with
some
age
no
where
close
to
the
heavy
hitters
but
decent
enough
for
offtheshelf
at
12
i
guess
i
havent
much
experience
with
lambics
there
just
arent
that
many
available
where
i
live
this
framboise
from
boon
is
a
lot
different
than
the
offering
from
lindemans
where
this
one
is
very
tart
and
acidic
the
other
is
quite
sweet
and
fruity
i
suppose
its
all
a
matter
of
preference
though
diehard
fans
of
sour
beers
will
probably
insist
that
this
one
is
more
representative
of
the
style
i
like
them
both
drinkability
is
ok
its
a
reallly
fruity
lambic
not
oude
which
i
prefer
but
not
what
what
was
on
the
label
either
so
i
cant
ding
them
too
much
pours
a
clear
crimson
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
sour
raspberries
and
raspberry
puree
taste
is
much
the
same
but
only
mildly
sour
with
some
nice
fresh
raspberry
flavors
there
is
also
an
acidic
quality
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
neither
too
sweet
or
sour
with
some
nice
fresh
raspberry
aromas
and
flavors
o
well
color
me
impressed
how
well
this
beer
held
up
it
just
so
happens
i
got
to
try
a
bottle
from
1995
the
following
week
and
it
wasnt
as
good
as
the
1986
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
tart
notes
and
oak
for
me
to
enjoy
with
this
much
age
o
pretty
good
but
sort
of
simple
some
more
funktartness
might
help
on
a
new
style
run
tonight
my
first
framboise
and
its
pretty
good
but
also
pretty
onedimensional
alcoholic
tart
raspberry
juice
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
not
as
candylike
as
other
framboise
lambics
ive
had
and
its
got
a
good
overall
balance
and
composition
o
i
expected
much
more
after
sampling
the
marriage
parfait
earlier
i
guess
the
two
are
completely
different
beers
drink
eh
ill
pass
if
i
see
this
one
again
on
tap
wonder
if
any
different
from
a
bottle
a
simple
sweet
raspberry
beer
though
too
sweet
and
not
complex
enough
to
drink
in
much
quantity
o
i
was
afraid
this
would
be
sweet
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
raspberry
presence
is
very
nice
and
the
other
components
work
well
to
yield
a
nice
framboise
aroma
deep
deep
raz
seems
sweet
slightly
medicinal
moderately
sweet
on
taste
moderately
tart
slightly
puckering
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
tart
tasty
d
overall
a
decent
and
balanced
belgian
lambic
that
was
easy
to
drink
the
premium
price
may
be
a
bit
steep
but
compared
to
the
price
of
cantillon
around
here
its
not
that
bad
and
to
be
honest
this
isnt
too
far
off
from
the
cantillon
100
kriek
i
had
the
other
night
o
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
continually
dropping
7
bucks
a
bottle
a
fresh
balanced
and
nice
sour
ale
a
flavorful
lambic
to
me
has
the
same
effect
that
cat
nip
has
to
an
awaiting
feline
i
wish
i
had
another
one
to
open
but
at
7
a
bottle
thats
unlikely
o
not
the
best
offering
from
boon
but
on
a
hot
night
with
serve
a
thirst
pretty
light
body
drinkability
is
good
not
as
complex
as
some
fruit
lambics
but
pretty
nice
if
maybe
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
o
this
is
a
nice
authentic
lambic
lacks
the
depth
that
cantillon
features
in
their
brews
but
worth
a
try
nonetheless
nicely
done
here
nothing
is
overly
sweet
or
cloying
like
other
sugaredup
lambics
can
be
but
perhaps
i
was
looking
for
just
a
bit
more
fruit
flavor
its
still
a
nice
beer
and
one
id
like
to
have
another
of
sitting
in
the
cellar
for
a
bit
longer
next
time
o
i
think
im
finally
starting
to
realize
the
craze
of
lambicsgueezessour
beers
they
may
or
may
not
be
the
best
beers
youve
ever
had
but
they
sure
as
hell
challenge
your
pallette
and
nose
though
this
was
cheap
compared
to
others
in
the
style
it
certainly
was
still
an
experience
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
as
i
introduce
myself
to
these
styles
not
overly
impressed
not
the
worst
by
any
means
a
very
good
beer
overall
delicious
with
chocolate
with
the
first
glass
i
had
some
trouble
with
the
funky
earth
flavor
but
my
taste
buds
assimilated
thereafter
it
is
on
the
pricey
side
but
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
this
poured
out
as
a
reddish
looking
color
with
a
pink
fizzy
head
that
rapidly
faded
away
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
tart
with
raspberries
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
full
of
tart
raspberry
flavors
with
a
bit
of
acidic
vinegar
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
not
carbonated
at
all
and
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
chilled
wine
overall
this
brew
isnt
the
greatest
in
my
opinion
but
it
might
be
worth
trying
if
you
like
this
style
o
a
good
beer
i
will
try
this
more
often
interested
with
what
to
pair
it
both
boons
i
have
had
were
similarly
sweet
candy
flavor
it
really
reminds
me
of
robitussin
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
lambic
more
similar
to
a
raspberry
soda
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
there
wasnt
yeastsedimentdregs
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
seeing
that
pair
with
the
taste
really
makes
me
think
the
beer
was
pasteurized
back
sweetened
and
forced
carbonated
like
a
keg
the
cpj
poured
a
1
lavendar
head
fading
fast
dark
violet
in
masstone
but
clear
and
watery
during
pour
smells
of
raspberry
syrup
taste
is
raspberry
far
far
less
sweet
than
other
fruit
lambics
but
still
so
much
fruit
it
overwhelms
the
beer
aspects
of
the
beer
and
although
the
sour
is
present
it
is
far
less
funky
than
id
anticipated
color
is
much
paler
and
more
natural
than
the
lindemans
with
a
thick
foamy
pink
head
similar
raspberry
funk
aroma
flavor
is
of
tart
raspberry
juice
with
a
funky
edge
perhaps
the
oak
im
pretty
sure
this
lambic
is
hopped
because
theres
a
really
interesting
play
between
the
sour
flavors
of
the
lambic
and
bitter
undertones
in
the
beer
where
by
really
interesting
i
mean
enough
to
get
me
to
finish
the
quarter
bottle
o
decent
but
needs
just
a
bit
more
sourness
o
this
is
probably
the
driest
beer
ive
ever
had
i
can
deal
with
this
to
an
extent
but
when
it
totally
takes
away
from
enjoying
the
fruit
its
just
no
good
fruit
funk
or
sour
this
beer
needed
more
of
at
least
one
of
those
to
be
good
i
can
see
why
these
are
a
cheaper
option
there
were
parts
of
this
beer
i
liked
and
some
not
so
much
pours
a
dark
red
maroon
cloudy
with
visible
sediment
smells
strongly
of
raspberries
tastes
strongly
of
raspberries
little
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
sour
and
tart
and
quite
refreshing
dry
mouthfeel
i
liked
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
would
consider
drinking
it
again
o
yet
another
beer
from
boon
that
doesnt
do
it
for
me
sadly
they
all
cant
be
oude
kriek
much
of
the
subtle
character
of
the
classic
lambic
notes
are
swamped
underneath
the
immense
raspberry
flavor
sweetness
and
feel
a
good
framboise
but
theres
a
few
nuances
that
make
it
almost
world
class
overall
nice
brew
tastes
like
fresh
raspberries
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
not
as
good
as
many
other
lambics
i
have
had
o
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
to
strong
but
the
nice
bright
fruit
in
the
nose
turns
darker
in
the
taste
there
is
not
much
depth
in
this
beer
with
a
little
tartness
and
hints
of
funk
hidden
underneath
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
a
complex
flavor
and
great
raspberry
presence
something
is
missing
though
this
is
what
i
am
loving
about
my
new
sour
craze
the
ones
i
least
suspect
are
totally
blowing
me
away
in
every
way
o
an
easy
drinking
fruit
lambic
went
very
well
with
the
chocolate
dessert
it
was
paired
with
would
certainly
consider
picking
up
a
bottle
3350
5
alcvol
home
from
1st
rochester
trip
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
beer
becomes
a
bright
and
powerful
red
but
at
bottom
it
swims
a
pinkish
orange
hue
the
head
of
whiteorangeish
bubbles
starts
low
and
stays
at
a
healthy
disc
of
dense
bubbles
good
strong
aromas
of
sweet
raspberries
though
i
would
suspect
their
natural
origin
sour
acidic
lambic
aromas
well
displaying
the
oak
maturation
smells
creamy
sorbetlike
like
a
raspberry
yogourt
slightly
sulfurous
acrid
raspberry
flavours
dry
oaky
old
lambic
acids
come
up
with
a
metallic
odd
bilelike
acrid
flavour
they
smells
right
but
they
dont
taste
fresh
at
all
still
as
you
finish
the
bottle
it
gets
easier
and
easier
to
handle
great
natural
raspberry
sediment
acidic
and
sour
but
the
sourness
is
at
an
odds
with
something
in
the
beer
the
raspberry
bitterness
seems
like
raisin
tannins
acrid
and
powerful
leaves
a
dry
impression
and
robs
a
bit
from
the
fruitiness
sample
is
a
year
old
from
the
shelf
of
beers
of
the
world
so
handling
might
have
been
an
issue
this
lambic
would
be
much
much
better
served
fresh
in
a
barrel
this
sample
is
a
far
ways
from
the
coasts
of
belgium
would
warrant
another
try
otherwise
fresh
red
fruitseeds
raw
lambic
acidity
and
a
sulfurous
bile
bitterness
that
puts
us
at
odds
with
nice
fruity
flavours
oaked
and
aged
o
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
excellent
and
it
avoids
the
artificial
sweetness
i
taste
in
lindemans
good
beer
i
wonder
what
would
happen
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
o
i
love
the
boon
fruit
lambics
i
think
they
are
some
of
the
most
drinkable
fruit
beers
around
period
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
one
of
these
offerings
and
will
continue
to
hoard
as
much
as
i
can
find
cheers
d
easy
enough
to
enjoy
and
savor
but
a
let
down
considering
the
style
and
other
beers
this
brewery
has
out
there
drinkability
a
good
framboise
lambic
most
of
them
either
have
fake
fruit
flavor
and
no
sourness
or
even
if
they
have
a
real
fruit
flavor
also
lack
the
sourness
this
has
both
of
those
good
fruit
lambic
flavors
but
again
this
beer
doesnt
ever
quite
assert
itself
still
more
than
worthy
though
beer
is
thin
but
the
heavy
fruit
presence
on
the
palate
makes
the
beer
seem
thicker
it
is
jelly
flavored
strong
raspberries
and
sweetened
at
least
it
tastes
that
way
eh
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
there
is
even
some
mild
tartness
from
the
berries
on
the
finish
its
a
big
big
fruit
beer
the
beer
appears
a
light
brown
hue
with
delicate
rouge
highlights
and
a
quarter
inch
of
head
that
dissipates
within
a
few
moments
the
aroma
brings
raspberries
sugar
and
jam
with
a
touch
of
oak
and
just
a
slight
funk
the
flavor
is
overly
sweet
with
a
formidable
sugary
raspberry
presence
the
sweetness
becomes
cloying
after
just
a
small
pour
this
beer
was
not
in
the
same
echelon
of
the
great
belgian
fruit
lambics
i
have
grown
to
love
im
really
impressed
how
well
the
fruit
character
has
held
up
for
15
years
tasting
very
ripe
and
juicy
and
bursting
with
raspberries
other
lambic
character
is
a
bit
muted
by
the
fruit
and
the
beer
could
certainly
be
more
sour
and
sharp
d
easy
to
drink
but
very
very
sweet
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
this
style
i
do
have
a
latent
fear
of
sugary
fruity
malt
bombs
and
likewise
enameldissolving
acetic
acid
attacks
im
looking
at
you
cantillon
so
it
is
quite
pleasant
to
come
across
a
level
fruity
lambic
such
as
this
everything
that
the
eponymous
fruit
promises
rendered
in
beer
form
good
stuff
d
a
generally
well
made
drinkable
beer
d
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
very
dry
framboise
this
is
it
d
low
abv
check
tart
and
delicious
check
awesome
dvery
drinkable
like
a
fruit
drink
not
like
a
lambic
some
have
suggested
that
this
is
a
good
beginners
lambic
but
if
this
were
my
first
i
wouldnt
have
been
motivated
to
try
others
especially
at
this
price
point
10
i
tasted
again
today
same
feelings
d
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
sweeter
than
cantillon
but
heads
and
shoulders
above
things
like
lindemans
and
stlouis
overall
a
nice
lambic
in
many
ways
but
nothing
ever
really
takes
hold
even
to
make
me
notice
definitely
not
a
bad
beginner
lambic
especially
for
the
price
d
very
drinkable
except
for
the
price
a
nice
lambic
wish
it
was
easier
on
the
wallet
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
goes
right
through
you
and
is
leaving
some
interesting
flavors
on
the
way
down
but
no
heavy
feel
in
the
mouth
feel
a
great
fruity
beer
boon
framboise
was
like
an
intermediate
beer
framboise
not
the
syrupy
fruit
pop
that
some
massproduced
fruit
lambics
are
but
also
not
the
challenging
battery
acid
enamel
stripping
sour
offerings
from
the
more
artisanal
producers
the
beer
was
a
deep
ruddy
pink
with
a
seemingly
perpetual
effervescence
the
nose
was
full
of
raspberry
and
a
mineral
and
earthy
aroma
the
beer
tasted
very
fruity
and
dry
but
again
had
minerally
tang
that
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
carbonation
ample
and
paired
well
with
a
hearty
vegetarian
meal
nice
drinking
but
at
12
a
pop
i
wont
be
a
repeat
buyer
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
was
disappointed
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
compared
to
a
cantillon
or
a
drie
fonteinen
i
dont
think
it
stands
up
i
could
drink
this
all
night
until
i
started
to
miss
my
stouts
at
5
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
still
be
able
to
spell
stout
small
pour
at
lambic
summit
event
of
course
its
trendy
to
dismiss
this
among
the
3
fonteinen
and
cantillon
offerings
as
the
previous
rater
predictably
did
but
in
doing
so
one
looks
beyond
the
merit
this
beer
offers
pours
a
cloudy
deep
maroon
nose
of
rich
seedy
raspberries
jamlike
and
really
full
much
more
naturally
sour
than
the
boon
kriek
given
the
nature
of
the
fruit
used
which
makes
the
beer
much
more
palatable
really
fullon
seedy
raspberries
in
the
mouth
pretty
decent
balance
between
sweet
and
tart
elements
certainly
not
as
dry
sour
and
complex
as
the
unsweetened
lambics
at
this
event
but
pretty
good
still
finish
is
a
bit
weak
the
best
of
the
three
boon
offerings
at
the
summit
94
points
d
i
think
this
is
the
definition
of
a
middleoftheroad
lambic
no
real
outrageous
flavors
and
not
really
tart
flavors
are
pleasantly
mellow
but
body
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
at
times
still
worth
a
try
as
this
onell
ease
you
into
the
more
complex
sours
some
of
the
harsher
flavors
are
stopping
me
from
appreciating
this
wonderful
smelling
brew
i
think
i
might
just
go
buy
a
pack
of
raspberries
instead
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
primarily
raspberry
sweetness
with
a
very
slight
underlying
of
funk
and
earthiness
the
taste
is
tart
upfront
with
a
sweet
flavor
of
raspberry
through
the
body
and
a
lingering
amount
of
sourness
light
feel
with
a
moderate
to
low
level
of
carbonation
that
leaves
this
brew
feeling
a
bit
watery
for
the
most
part
this
brew
tastes
sweet
and
makes
my
mouth
salivate
however
it
finds
a
way
of
finishing
with
a
bit
of
dryness
the
drinkability
it
is
hurt
due
to
the
watery
aspect
but
it
is
easier
drinking
that
say
lindemans
take
on
fruited
lambics
that
get
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
drink
again
always
interesting
and
pleasant
to
drink
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
framboise
that
i
have
ever
had
in
my
opinion
i
would
say
this
is
better
than
lost
abbeys
fda
this
is
sort
of
the
peak
of
framboise
for
me
flavor
is
sweet
not
sure
if
this
has
sugar
or
sweetners
added
but
its
refreshing
and
nowhere
near
the
sweetness
of
a
framboise
like
st
louis
or
lindemans
tart
aspect
is
decent
and
long
lasting
light
crisp
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
fruit
flavors
are
strong
of
raspberries
and
the
tartness
contributes
to
the
overall
flavor
at
the
perfect
time
to
keep
this
beer
from
becoming
too
sweet
very
tasty
an
easy
drinker
a
recommended
framboise
d
i
really
dont
understand
the
point
of
these
sweetened
lambics
if
youre
going
to
go
through
the
trouble
of
making
lambic
do
it
right
notes
2004
vintage
mariage
parfait
this
is
a
fairly
sweet
and
fruit
sour
but
the
raspberries
also
add
a
tartness
as
well
some
other
fruit
and
acidic
and
funk
aspects
come
out
but
this
is
a
very
raspberrycentric
beer
pretty
good
and
enjoyable
beer
even
if
it
didnt
wow
me
deep
ruby
in
color
hazy
with
spritzy
head
first
scents
are
of
tart
and
acidic
raspberries
slightly
herbal
and
medicinal
the
taste
brings
what
the
nose
dictates
with
hints
of
red
wine
vinegar
very
artifically
build
to
it
medium
bodied
dry
a
decent
beer
that
avoided
being
too
tart
or
sweet
the
palate
opens
quite
medicinally
sweet
with
raspberries
and
a
mild
harshness
jammy
mildly
fatty
even
mildly
artificial
in
sweetness
this
beer
is
medium
light
in
body
with
a
mildly
metallic
finish
not
terribly
impressive
d
i
would
seek
this
out
again
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
was
perfectly
balanced
i
highly
reccomend
seeking
this
one
out
like
i
said
earlier
it
was
a
very
pleasent
surprise
notes
one
of
my
first
nonsweetened
lambics
and
i
thought
it
was
quite
enjoyable
not
too
sweet
yet
not
pushing
any
extreme
boundaries
on
the
sour
side
either
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
so
i
would
probably
on
continue
to
buy
this
one
for
special
occasions
very
sweet
with
a
nice
sour
funky
tartness
that
is
puckering
without
being
overbearingly
acidic
nice
oak
tannis
and
slightly
vinous
with
slight
vanilla
soft
carbonation
with
a
huge
raspberry
flavor
and
less
funk
than
i
expected
well
balanced
and
very
quaffable
d
really
sweet
to
drink
too
much
but
very
enjoyable
for
the
taste
starts
with
some
funkiness
and
ends
with
sweet
raspberries
fairly
nice
nothing
earthshattering
but
fine
for
what
it
is

beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied

a
somewhat
sticky
finish
and
lingering
sourness
light
carbonation
makes
this
fairly
drinkable
if
this
is
your
cup
of
tea
i
personally
do
not
find
this
beer
appealing
as
it
is
not
fruity
enough
or
funky
enough
to
catch
my
interest
d
i
actually
poured
this
one
out
halfway
through
and
thats
unusual
for
me
just
couldnt
drink
it
d
an
ok
framboise
if
you
like
them
on
the
sweet
side
overall
a
solid
framboise
especially
for
the
age
and
very
happy
to
get
to
try
this
old
of
a
beer
had
a
bottle
with
dessert
at
the
farmhouse
this
is
a
heck
of
a
framboise
i
sincerely
wish
lindemans
which
seems
to
be
everywhere
was
this
good
its
not
an
oude
fruit
beer
but
it
still
incorporates
wild
yeast
and
oak
barrel
character
to
begin
theres
a
big
pure
raspberry
taste
and
aroma
thats
only
slightly
sweetened
the
background
has
a
crisp
toasted
oak
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
yeast
adds
a
mildly
tart
lemon
juice
note
and
blends
with
the
barrel
to
give
off
peppery
and
earthy
background
notes
delicious
one
of
the
best
young
fruit
beers
ive
had
it
is
highly
drinkable
not
overpowering
with
sweetness

not
prohibited

sourness

is

some

too
good
introduction
to
the
world
of
traditional
lambics
not
stupid
sweet
but
not
overly
tart
or
funky
either
id
say
one
to
try
but
nothing
extreme
not
sure
why
this
beer
has
been
slammed
perhaps
the
2000
vintage
has
aged
more
gracefully
d
good
would
have
some
more
but
after
having
a
rasberry
tart
from
new
glarus
would
prefer
that
over
this
one
i
find
this
framboise
to
be
much
more
drinkable
than
most
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
not
too
strong
on
the
tart
or
sweet
flavors
i
would
still
be
worried
a
bit
about
the
heartburn
tho
overall
really
drinkable
the
sweet
fruity
raspberry
flavor
is
delicious
then
quickly
becomes
sourtart
which
fades
to
a
sweet
flavor
making
you
want
more
this
is
a
great
fruit
beer
currently
my
favorite
since
it
has
the
sweetspicy
malt
character
at
the
end
overall
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
lambics
i
have
had
though
at
this
point
i
have
not
had
many
overall
this
is
a
nice
apertif
or
dessert
beer
the
fruit
component
isnt
overly
sweet
but
i
still
find
myself
craving
something
sour
and
truly
complex
like
the
oude
kriek
maybe
someday
an
oude
framboise
will
exist
d
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
took
me
a
minute
to
get
into
the
tartness
but
things
were
great
from
there
out
this
is
a
very
nice
lambic
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
alot
ease
to
drink
with
one
of
my
favorite
berry
flavors
the
price
is
expensive
but
worth
trying
even
once
this
goes
great
with
cakes
and
fruit
tarts
cheese
cake
you
bet
go
for
it
overall
it
was
a
balanced
lambic
that
was
both
easily
sipped
and
gulped
a
nice
lambic
great
fruit
presense
and
quite
sweet
that
being
said
a
nice
tartness
and
bitterness
cuts
through
the
sweetness
providing
a
good
balance
as
much
as
i
love
the
fruit
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
character
to
this
beer
still
very
good
the
aroma
is
fruit
mostly
raspberry
but
with
some
vague
bread
and
a
hint
of
iron
the
taste
is
mostly
tart
with
a
very
light
sourness
light
yeastiness
and
faint
berry
flavour
its
tingly
and
rather
dry
with
everything
being
mild
it
doesnt
have
a
strong
tart
berry
flavour
or
as
much
of
a
lambic
quality
as
i
was
expecting
but
its
still
quite
good
and
very
crisp
and
refreshing

d
well
if
you
like
lindemans
et
al
this
is
another
one
for
you
fruity
with
a
very
straight
forward
raspberry
flavor
funk
not
here
it
is
what
it
is
but
if
youre
looking
for
depth
in
a
lambic
look
somewhere
else
drinkability
is
ok
here
but
russian
river
has
the
market
on
sour
beers
poured
a
reddish
color
with
a
big
pinkish
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
aroma
was
of
sweet
raspberries
flavor
was
also
dominated
by
the
taste
of
raspberries
has
a
bit
of
sourness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
very
light
had
kind
of
a
wine
feel
to
it
a
nice
beer
that
is
probably
to
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
sweet
and
a
bit
sticky
good
dessert
beer
extremely
drinkable
but
simple
and
on
the
cloying
side
looked
to
pour
a
rose
color
out
of
the
bottle
settled
on
a
light
crimson
color
with
a
nice
white
head
at
first
then
a
thin
film
the
aroma
has
a
nice
raspberry
tang
to
it
and
a
slight
lambic
funk
the
raspberries
come
out
nicely
in
taste
nice
and
tart
slightly
sweet
at
first
with
a
underlying
oak
and
perhaps
wheat
just
riding
below
the
surface
the
mouth
is
well
carbonated
tart
and
puckering
good
enough
body
and
all
overall
not
nearly
the
best
framboise
that
ive
had
but
still
plenty
nice
nice
raspberry
bown
color
with
a
creamy
pink
head
the
nose
has
a
good
amount
of
fresh
tart
raspberries
funky
manure
and
musky
oak
the
taste
was
tart
and
sour
with
some
light
fruits
and
funky
oak
a
crisp
body
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
damn
fine
lambic
great
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
nice
to
have
the
body
mellow
when
the
flavor
is
so
sour
easy
beer
to
drink
but
i
would
recommend
this
as
an
after
meal
dessert
more
than
a
stand
alone
drink
not
thin
slight
texture
and
astringency
lively
carb
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
think
it
would
be
better
paired
with
food
rather
than
a
standalone
drinker
d
probably
wont
ever
buy
this
again
considering
the
price
but
if
i
did
i
could
see
having
a
couple
heavy
and
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
there
is
a
mild
raspberry
flavor
hiding
behind
the
lambic
tartness
this
one
has
much
more
of
a
bite
and
less
sweetness
than
lindemans
this
is
a
great
beer
for
those
warm
summer
afternoons
not
as
watery
as
i
thought
actually
quite
decent
the
excessive
tartness
makes
this
a
one
off
for
me
though
hazy
light
brown
with
some
reddish
hues
peeking
through
here
and
there
pinkish
white
head
that
shrinks
to
a
thin
coating
pretty
quikly
and
leaves
some
but
not
much
lace
nose
is
very
nice
raspberryish
with
some
beer
scent
that
come
through
just
a
tad
taste
is
sweeet
yet
balanced
very
well
by
the
sourness
tastes
very
real
hard
to
describe
this
is
outside
of
my
usual
realm
i
do
know
that
ive
tried
a
few
other
lambics
before
and
this
is
above
and
beyond
the
other
framboise
ive
tried
perhaps
ill
have
to
delve
into
this
side
of
beerdom
more
often
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
my
dessert
tonight
d
an
interesting
one
thats
for
sure
id
possibly
drink
it
again
but
not
on
a
regular
basis
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
thick
head
that
recedes
with
some
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
sweet
with
an
intoxicating
unmistakable
strawberry
scent
a
slight
sourness
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
very
sour
though
with
the
strawberry
taking
a
backseat
in
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
funky
as
well
but
thats
par
the
style
still
quite
drinkable
and
not
too
sweet
very
true
to
the
style
a
tasty
unique
as
certain
oak
wine
and
gueuze
characteristics
intertwine
in
the
lambic
refreshingly
tartdry
brew
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
mild
and
drinkable
lambic
light
and
tart
but
not
too
sour
and
definitely
not
too
sweet
a
good
summer
beer
if
youre
looking
for
an
alternative
to
the
usual
wits
and
weizens
boon
framboise
is
a
beer
for
the
lambic
lover
much
more
than
it
is
a
beer
for
the
fruit
beer
lover
my
lambic
experience
is
still
in
the
novice
stage
but
im
pretty
sure
this
isnt
a
classic
of
the
style
raspberries
or
not
even
though
ill
be
able
to
make
it
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
with
no
trouble
at
all
this
will
the
last
bottle
that
i
ever
buy
quite
drinkable
and
quenching
a
more
than
suitable
framboise
that
ill
try
and
rememeber
to
come
back
to
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
the
taste
leaves
me
a
bit
underimpressed
notes
of
berry
plum
tart
wet
paper
and
some
definate
earthy
notes
alot
like
eathing
a
blackberry
that
has
yet
to
fully
ripen
accordingly
a
sour
tonguelashing
ensues
after
each
sip
its
surprisingly
refreshing
and
juicy
but
the
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
flat
for
a
corked
bottle
bottom
line
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
brew
but
i
cant
imagine
ever
drinking
more
than
one
and
i
might
look
to
other
better
lambics
than
this
the
smell
was
mainy
sweet
raspberry
and
with
a
slightly
sour
tinge
no
doubt
coming
from
the
yeast
the
taste
however
was
practically
an
inversion
of
that
a
tart
puckering
sensation
to
start
and
ending
sour

though
not
necessarily
because
of
the
raspberry
more
from
the
yeast
the
sweetness
detected
in
the
smell
was
mostly
absent
the
carbonation
was
lively
on
the
palate
but
the
overall
feel
was
a
bit
watery
once
again
an
okay
dessert
beer
or
would
do
well
complimenting
chocolate
especially
dark
chocolate
however
ill
be
nursing
this
one
for
quite
some
time
with
no
need
to
run
out
and
buy
more
until
i
have
a
special
occassion
for
it
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
since
the
fruit
flavor
and
sweetness
are
comparatively
mild
if
i
didnt
mind
the
goat
smelltaste
i
could
probably
have
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
that
is
a
personal
opinion
i
know
this
is
a
true
lambic
not
the
overly
sweet
artificial
fruit
beers
that
others
have
labeled
as
lambic
good
for
the
style
just
not
for
me
poured
from
a
corked
355ml
bottle
the
beer
pours
with
a
nice
red
color
and
a
large
lightly
pink
head
the
head
sinks
down
to
two
finger
widths
that
stays
around
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
lovely
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
raspberries
and
the
barnyard
lambic
smell
taste
is
amazing
the
balance
between
the
sweetness
of
the
raspberries
and
the
acidity
and
tartness
from
the
brett
fermentation
play
together
very
nicely
the
beer
also
feels
very
good
in
the
mouth
the
beer
sets
lightly
on
the
tongue
with
a
high
level
of
carbination
that
almost
tickles
the
tongue
a
great
framboise
from
boon
drinkability
is
very
good
a
great
value
sour
lambic
overall
this
was
quite
drinkable
has
a
real
taste
to
it
as
compared
to
others
in
this
style
very
traditional
feel
more
like
a
good
champagne
than
others
that
tend
to
be
more
like
a
fruit
juice
classy
not
too
sweet
i
really
like
the
boon
over
any
other
framboise
ive
tried
because
the
presence
an
flavor
of
the
raspberries
come
through
while
the
overpowering
sweetness
and
tartness
are
somewhat
curtailed
its
all
in
the
balance
notes
one
of
the
better
lambics
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
more
of
what
ive
been
looking
for
in
a
lambic
fairly
clear
red
beer
with
a
champagne
head
a
big
waft
of
raspberries
and
horse
blanket
oh
yeah
initially
it
starts
out
mouth
puckering
sour
but
after
a
little
while
you
really
dont
notice
that
at
all
this
allows
you
to
appreciate
the
sweettart
raspberry
flavors
yum
a
very
light
body
way
lighter
and
dryer
than
lindemanns
excellent
drinkability
i
wish
the
bottle
was
bigger
smells
like
strawberry
shortcake
theres
a
great
interplay
of
fresh
fruit
tartness
and
your
usual
mustyfunky
lambic
aromas
flavorwise
an
easy
tartness
gives
way
to
soft
raspberry
before
that
mild
tartness
reenters
in
this
finish
some
may
be
curious
how
this
compares
to
lindemans
framboise
well
boons
features
less
raspberry
flavor
but
i
think
the
result
is
greater
balance
ill
take
boons
served
at
kulminator
with
great
ritual
and
care
with
the
basket
to
preserve
serving
angle
and
all
i
must
confess
i
am
impressed
by
this
ritual
smells
like
a
perfect
balance
between
beer
and
fruit
with
characteristic
lambic
tartness
and
slight
funk
this
is
my
ideal
version
great
balance
delectable
and
addictive
dry
finish
oh
so
good
overall
i
dont
have
alot
of
experience
with
the
lambic
styles
this
is
only
the
second
framboise
lambic
ive
had
i
prefer
it
to
lindemans
on
its
own
i
find
that
its
not
as
sweet
and
just
seems
more
well
balanced
though
i
think
lindemans
wins
as
far
as
pairing
with
desserts
mouthfeeldrinkability
moderate
carbonation
accentuates
the
interplay
of
fruit
with
the
wild
yeasts
it
flattens
out
a
bit
towards
the
end
however
as
far
as
lambics
go
this
doesnt
venture
too
far
outside
the
safe
zone
but
thats
fine
this
beer
is
a
refreshing
aperitif
and
palate
cleanser
between
courses
and
is
worth
trying
i
really
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
except
another
bottle
d
the
bitterness
is
a
tad
overwhelming
but
otherwise
this
is
a
nice
beer

i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
raspberry
part
was
ok
but
the
lambic
had
a
stuffy
odd
yeasty
note
that
didnt
go
too
well
with
the
fruit
i
enjoyed
this
with
a
cherry
cheesecake
for
dessert
tonight
we
shared
a
bottle
of
framboise
i
even
let
her
drink
hers
out
of
my
linderman
glass
sweet
and
heavy
raspberry
aroma
with
a
crisp
bittersweet
taste
a
nice
dessert
drink
to
keep
on
hand
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
an
underrated
lambic
that
is
full
of
character
and
very
entartaining
and
unique
it
really
satisfies
the
palate
wihtout
overwhelming
it
one
of
the
better
lambics
ive
had
it
just
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
late
sunday
night
not
as
light
as
i
expected
more
of
a
medium
bodied
feel
with
very
delicate
carbonation
drinkable
surely
but
perhaps
a
slight
bit
out
of
balance
a
nice
quaff
but
give
me
rose
de
gambrinus
anyday
drinkable
and
smooth
but
a
bit
of
overkill
goin
on
tasted
the
2000
vintage
however
it
didnt
say
marriage
parfait
it
had
the
6
2
alcohol
and
on
the
back
label
theyre
mentioning
marriage
parfait
appearance
is
very
nice
with
its
pinkred
colour
and
pink
foam
smell
is
sour
cherryframboise
notably
but
not
as
fresh
as
a
fruitgeuze
could
be
somehow
i
had
that
feeling
as
if
a
litle
bit
of
motoroil
drupped
into
this
beer
forgot
that
as
soon
as
i
took
the
first
sip
tasted
it
blind
but
liked
the
taste
and
aftertaste
nicely
balanced
sourfruittaste
with
some
bitterness
at
the
end
hardly
any
malttaste
but
who
wants
that
in
a
framboise
beer
taste
is
tart
up
front
hints
of
funky
sourness
the
sourness
really
builds
as
it
warms
the
funkiness
grows
too
theres
some
light
sweetness
but
not
much
most
everything
is
overwhelmed
by
the
tart
raspberry
flavor
lightly
bitter
and
spicy
in
the
finish
gingery
the
mouth
is
a
little
thin
but
does
not
detract
from
the
enjoyment
tasty
and
tart
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
all
in
all
a
nice
surprise
and
one
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
again
finished
dry
which
was
ok
with
all
the
tartness
the
dryness
just
made
the
tartness
that
much
more
stronger
good
or
bad
its
really
personal
preference
in
that
department
this
was
ok
but
for
the
price
was
it
worth
it
thatll
be
for
you
to
decide
bottle
poured
a
deep
red
colored
beer
with
a
medium
head
with
average
retention
for
a
lambic
aroma
is
comprised
solely
of
raspberry
taste
is
also
dominated
by
raspberry
with
a
little
tart
and
sour
ending
this
one
is
a
guilty
pleasure
for
me
since
i
know
it
taste
more
like
fresh
raspberry
juice
then
beer
but
i
like
it
nonetheless
very
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
overall
a
very
nice
framboise
not
too
sweet
not
too
syrupy
but
with
a
nice
sharpsour
feel
that
lends
a
tangible
old
school
aspect
to
this
one
worth
trying
if
not
to
just
remind
you
that
not
all
lambicframboise
are
for
girls
pours
a
muddy
redbrown
color
with
no
head
and
instant
fruit
aroma
looks
like
port
wine
but
muddy
aroma
gentle
beer
smell
with
light
berry
aroma
some
sweetness
and
beinginthewoods
organic
leaves
flowers
overall
very
nice
aroma
flavor
not
at
all
sweet
like
the
aroma
slightly
sour
with
the
berry
flavors
not
bright
fresh
strong
fruits
like
i
have
had
in
some
others
but
musty
and
mulled
that
doesnt
sound
good
on
the
page
but
it
really
tastes
better
i
am
not
a
fruit
beer
lover
but
this
is
pretty
good
and
would
be
a
good
way
to
cool
off
on
a
hot
day
when
you
want
something
light
and
refreshing
with
good
flavor
this
was
a
1997
bottle
drank
with
kimchee
martint
tiggmtl
and
oakes
it
pours
darker
than
i
expected
a
rather
deep
brown
dirty
soil
alike
with
barely
no
head
but
lots
of
flaoties
aroma
is
very
leafy
with
raspberry
coulis
notes
like
youd
put
over
a
good
ice
cream
hints
of
old
books
dirt
and
earth
in
mouth
acidity
level
is
disappointingly
low
its
earthy
with
raspberry
grains
flavors
but
ultimately
just
too
sweet
to
be
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
thinmedium
with
moderate
carbonation
cloying
finish
with
more
of
the
leafy
aspect
a
pleasant
suprise
this
was
an
undated
vintage
bottle
late
90s
probably
this
poured
our
a
dark
pinkish
colour
with
a
small
offwhitepink
head
of
foam
that
lasted
for
a
bit
and
left
some
interesting
lace
on
my
glass
the
aromas
are
of
sweettart
raspberries
and
lambic
funk
the
taste
is
tart
sour
funky
and
berrylike
all
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
as
is
the
drinkability
this
is
the
half
way
point
between
cantillon
and
lindemans
not
quite
traditional
not
quite
sweet
mor
source
liquid
solutions
addition
i
later
noticed
a
stamped
best
before
date
in
a
white
space
on
the
bottom
of
the
back
label
of
06062004
offerings
this
was
a
definite
step
above
in
quality
smells
lightly
funky
with
lots
of
sweet
raspberry
aromas
lightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
raspberry
seed
taste
to
go
along
with
the
raspberry
fruit
flavor
a
bit
of
sour
acidity
as
well
as
a
faintly
musty
taste
fairly
simple
for
a
lambic
type
beer
a
light
red
color
that
shows
brilliantly
clear
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
leaves
a
fruity
residual
taste
behind
again
very
winelike
i
guess
if
youre
into
this
sort
of
thing
this
would
be
drinkable
for
you
but
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
its
not
unpleasant
but
perhaps
its
more
an
acquired
taste
ill
work
on
i
have
some
lindemans
kriek
geuze
and
framboise
in
the
minifridge
well
see
what
happens
pinkred
cloudy
brew
with
a
pink
top
aroma
of
raspberries
and
lambic
sourmustiness
thats
expected
out
of
the
glass
there
may
be
even
a
hint
of
woodiness
in
the
aroma
the
body
starts
out
medlight
with
a
good
wheatmalt
base
to
balance
the
slightly
sweet
but
potently
sour
raspberry
flavor
it
finishes
dry
and
lemony
and
the
carbonation
seems
to
add
complexity
to
the
flavors
on
the
tongue
i
do
like
the
sweetsourness
of
this
one
and
generally
like
all
the
boon
beers
highly
recommended
for
the
lambic
explorers
got
this
for
my
girlfriend
and
she
liked
it
alotpoured
a
raberryred
with
a
bg
fluffy
head
had
kind
of
a
musty
smell
wich
was
more
preverlant
to
me
than
the
rasberry
smell
started
off
very
sweet
like
rasberry
syrup
almost
but
finished
with
some
nice
tartness
almost
sticky
sweeta
little
too
fufu
i
guess
for
meseemed
real
drinkable
though
as
im
in
a
bit
of
a
sour
mood
i
thought
this
evenings
samplings
should
all
be
lambics
so
here
goes
number
two
a
deep
sanguineous
color
on
the
pour
the
head
modest
in
size
frothy
in
its
consistency
the
color
a
winsome
raspberry
red
as
it
evanesces
quite
quickly
the
resultant
lace
a
bit
thin
and
clumpy
as
one
would
expect
the
nose
is
like
smelling
a
raspberry
tart
sweet
and
sour
crisp
and
clean
and
a
real
treat
for
the
beezeer
start
is
ambrosial
chased
quickly
by
the
tartness
top
is
slender
in
feel
with
the
finish
astringent
raspberry
sweet
tart
and
quite
dry
once
again
a
quite
good
lambic
not
great
just
quite
pleasant
to
the
palate
hazy
ruby
raspberry
red
purple
tinged
white
head
recedes
steadily
into
a
thin
spotty
layer
that
leaves
sparse
foam
aggregates
vibrant
freshly
pressed
ripe
raspberries
hit
the
nose
at
first
then
are
ceded
by
mellow
lactic
tartness
and
subdued
hints
of
damp
wool
and
must
a
mildly
tart
lactic
wash
initially
in
flavor
fades
into
a
sweet
and
sour
melange
of
ripe
sweet
raspberry
and
sour
citric
kumquats
understated
ghostly
wisps
of
dryish
bready
grain
emerge
late
light
in
body
but
with
a
pleasantly
smooth
coating
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
snap
of
fruity
fructose
sweetness
that
yields
to
drying
clean
tartness
quite
an
enjoyable
lambic
its
not
overly
complex
and
seems
intermediate
in
character
between
the
cloyingly
sweet
lindemans
and
the
puckeringly
deeply
tart
classics
boon
framboise
nonetheless
retains
an
elegant
quaffability
smellability
is
high
but
drinkability
is
pretty
low
due
to
soso
taste
and
disappointing
mouthfeel
certainly
not
up
to
boon
kriek
or
marriage
parfait
in
my
book
compared
to
the
lindemans
this
frambroise
is
a
little
thin
in
body
and
flavor
a
really
nice
red
color
with
a
sweet
reapberry
nose
i
thought
that
the
taste
was
a
little
thin
not
much
fruit
more
of
a
champagney
taste
to
it
worth
a
try
but
only
once
you
think
its
gonna
be
sweet
when
you
smell
it
but
its
only
slightly
sweet
at
the
start
then
tart
slightly
sour
and
lots
of
fruit
very
nice
and
refreshing
raspberry
and
astringent

as
lindemans
yuuuuup
this
is
a
goddamn
kriek
delicious
as

pours
a

with
one
finger
pink
head
that
left
little

aroma
is

acidic
little
bit
sour
but
this
isnt
a
sour
ale
aroma
and
there
are
cherries
and
hints
of
oak
in
the
aroma
smooth
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
oakiness
the
tart
cherries
are
not
too
sharp
but
flavorful
enough
to
give
off
acidic
crispness
and
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
good
balance
and
great
drinker
final
score
4
22
this
is
an
excellent
kriek
especially
for
the
more
available
brands
like
boon
nothing
incredible
or
worldbeating
but
definitely
a
very
good
beer
had
a
bottle
with
uncle
jimbo
and
some
other
beefreinds
last
night
the
kulminator
this
was
a
1983
bottle
i
am
not
a
lover
of
this
style
but
this
one
was
nice
to
try
the
mariage
parfait
beers
are
easily
the
best
boons
d
im
having
this
right
after
the
boon
kriek
2012
it
is
far
more
complex
than
the
former
from
start
where
it
is
opaque
and
not
translucent
to
the
finish
where
it
is
more
acidic
woody
and
has
more
diverse
sweet
notes
and
a
dryer
finish
overall
a
very
nice
ale
and
i
will
be
buying
more
for
the
cellar
healthy
pop
from
the
cork
followed
by
a
dark
red
pour
into
a
tulip
glass
pink
head
retains
nicely
sourness
and
acidity
is
on
the
tame
side
but
good
mix
of
cherry
juice
woodsy
mushroom
funk
pleasant
tartness
white
wine
grapes
wheat
great
mouthfeel
easygoing
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
a
lambic
no
hint
of
that
8
a
great
subtle
sour
nice
mixing
of
sweet
cherries
tartness
funk
o
great
sour
second
bottle
i
have
had
and
both
were
good
very
satisfying
but
that
mineral
component
at
the
finish
could
be
better
but
still
almost
sessionable
for
this
relatively
high
abv
kriek
overall
my
first
belgian
oude
kriek
lambic
ale
i
felt
i
needed
to
try
this
type
to
broaden
my
tastes
a
little
which
it
did
not
sure
i
would
order
it
up
in
place
of
other
types
but
definitely
different
and
the
taste
profile
lived
up
to
what
the
beer
store
said
it
would
i
would
rate
it
outstanding
based
on
its
merits
but
it
is
not
my
type
overall
better
than
expected
from
boon
very
tasty
but
not
as
complex
as
its
more
illustrious
brethren
to
quote
burroughs
its
the
most
decent
most
deeply
sour
beer
i
have
ever
known
or
something
to
that
affect
either
way
its
the
finest
example
of
a
lambic
that
ive
had
so
these
beers
just
might
be
growing
on
me
o
this
is
a
very
solid
well
made
lambic
definitely
drinkable
pours
a
bloodred
pink
body
with
a
head
that
is
unmistakably
pink
cream
sour
cherries
in
the
aroma
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
cherries
feel
is
a
touch
acidic
next
to
no
carbonation
oak
is
light
enjoyed
it
but
not
quite
up
to
par
with
some
other
krieks
imo
i
just
want
to
mention
that
this
is
further
evidence
that
boon
is
up
there
with
cantillon
and
drie
fonteinen
for
top
lambic
producers
between
this
and
their
standard
mariage
parfait
they
prove
to
be
to
producing
top
notch
stuff
would
love
to
see
some
other
fruit
variants
added
to
the
parfait
range
would
be
awesome
pours
cranberry
juice
red
with
a
finger
of
pink
head
that
quickly
subsides
the
nose
is
clean
and
sweet
with
the
smell
of
green
apple
skins
cherries
a
little
bit
of
barnyard
and
a
little
bit
of
lactic
acid
this
is
a
delicious
beer
it
starts
off
with
a
sour
bite
melding
into
sweet
natural
cherries
and
ending
with
another
huge
surge
of
sourness
with
grassy
lemony
notes
i
get
a
nice
dose
of
vanilla
in
the
aftertaste
its
never
artificial
and
never
overthetop
sour
the
body
is
light
with
high
carbonation
deep
ruby
color
with
a
soft
creamy
pink
head
super
smooth
mellow
cherry
creaminess
in
the
nose
sour
black
cherry
a
bit
of
sherry
and
a
really
delicate
touch
of
vinegar
along
with
spices
big
tart
cherry
flavor
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
going
on
but
it
keeps
everything
corralled
into
a
nice
tidy
flavor
profile
much
more
sourness
coming
through
here
just
enough
sweetness
nice
acidity
woody
spice
must
and
some
sort
of
potpourrilike
element
astringent
and
puckering
but
far
from
offensively
so
oh
man
very
satisfying
ill
try
to
keep
my
hands
off
the
other
bottle
for
a
few
years
if
i
can
very
dark
burgundy
red
with

taste
is

and
smacky
woody
musky
tart
dry
berries
grape
skins
astringent
and
puckering
very
well
combined
concoction
the
word
encrusted
comes
to
mind
very
dry
implosively
so
brightly
and
smoothly
carbonated
almost
chalky
texture
very
nice
great
kriek
lambic
i
really
like
the
ruggedness
of
these
mariage
parfaits
o
an
excellent
sour
kriek
the
appearance
is
absolutely
amazing
and
should
be
used
as
a
standard
for
kreiks
this
is
way
more
sour
than
sweet
the
cherries
come
through
very
dry
and
subtle
this
is
in
my
rotation
constantly
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
more
than
the
geuze
but
it
still
wasnt
worth
what
i
had
to
pay
for
them
i
think
their
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
if
the
price
was
right
i
would
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
overall
a
great
kriek
boons
kriek
mariage
parfait
is
a
damn
fine
authentic
kriek
and
although
i
prefer
gueuze
mariage
parfait
the
kriek
adds
a
unique
twist
while
the
wet
wood
complexity
is
what
makes
this
beer
i
could
see
it
becoming
taxing
over
time
a
375
is
just
he
right
amount
ill
grab
some
more
of
these
guys
o
i
got
this
beer
originally
as
a
gift
for
a
friend
of
mine
who
was
getting
married
and
grabbed
an
extra
for
myself
im
quite
glad
i
did
the
beer
was
very
enjoyable
and
i
am
happy
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
id
definitely
recommend
this
this
is
a
great
sour
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
4
75
darn
close
to
the
perfect
beer
perfectly
cellared
there
is
clearly
something
inherent
in
this
beer
that
takes
it
beyond
what
is
already
a
complex
style
i
e
kriek
i
really
feel
like
some
lone
beer
reviewer
after
the
nuclear
apocalypse
who
found
the
last
bottle
of
beer
in
the
world
in
fact
if
that
apocalypse
ever
comes
this
is
the
beer
i
want
with
me
while
i
watch
the
rockets
red
glare
this
beer
gets
my
highest
recommendation
purchased
at
minks
in
atlanta
bottle
poured
a
deep
red
color
lambic
with
a
nice
large
pink
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
sour
and
tart
cherries
notes
is
quite
enticing
taste
is
a
wonderful
mix
between
some
tart
cherries
with
some
oak
and
light
funky
notes
with
lightly
sweet
finish
and
almost
no
acidity
body
is
full
with
great
carbonation
wonderful
interpretation
of
the
style
with
great
restraint
on
the
acidity
level
overall
real
impressed
by
this
why
cant
the
boon
regulars
be
this
good
o
gorgeous
beer
id
consider
giving
all
the
rest
up
and
being
a
lambic
kriek
and
framboise
devotee
for
the
price
of
this
beer
in
the
375ml
it
is
a
no
brainer
once
your
past
the
sugary
lindemans
beers
which
i
do
still
enjoy
at
times
try
out
the
boon
thin
body
typical
of
the
style
very
fine
kriek
up
with
the
best
available
p
s
reading
the
other
reviews
just
realized
that
this
kriek
has
8
which
is
really
high
for
a
kriek
didnt
taste
the
booze
at
all
but
this
explains
somehow
its
immaculate
balance
no
change
of
score
though
cheers
this
is
quite
a
solid
kriek
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
a
lovely
lambic
i
got
in
a
trade
for
2
heady
toppers
worth
it
in
my
opinion
lots
of
nice
sourness
makes
me
love
this
even
more
than
i
should
cant
really
feel
the
heavy
abv
it
is
masked
well
by
the
tart
fruityness
ive
been
into
sour
beers
for
several
months
now
surprisingly
this
is
my
first
traditional
fruited
lambic
i
will
be
making
a
trip
to
belgium
in
a
couple
weeks
and
will
drown
myself
in
lambics
to
get
a
better
stylistic
comparison
for
this
beer
for
now
however
i
really
love
this
kriek
o
this
is
a
nice
gueze
really
easy
to
drink
and
good
sour
flavor
with
a
fruitysweet
kick
it
was
pretty
flat
and
definitely
seems
like
it
will
develop
more
over
time
so
i
hope
to
report
back
on
that
though
that
being
said
it
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
recommend
is
worth
a
try
full
bodied
intensely
tart
and
puckering
with
a
much
funkier
flavor
than
the
aroma
suggests
lots
of
barnyard
sour
acidity
and
lactic
funk
along
with
damp
toasted
oak
and
a
sweet
vinous
fruit
character
slightly
syrupy
and
sweet
with
a
strong
cherrycherry
juice
flavor
very
organic
tasting
with
cherry
skin
and
juicy
fruit
flavor
balancing
out
the
funk
and
acetic
acid
again
the
pit
from
the
fruit
is
evident
complimenting
the
funk
and
charred
oak
subtle
acetic
vinegar
lingering
in
the
bone
dry
finish
but
its
not
harsh
or
solvent
like
at
all
with
plenty
of
juicy
cherry
fruit
flavor
balancing
things
out
not
as
extreme
as
some
of
the
other
fruit
lambics
that
ive
had
but
its
a
really
nice
kriek
that
ill
definitely
be
buying
again
overall
i
would
say
this
is
very
comparable
to
a
cantillion
in
the
flavor
profile
but
cantillion
has
a
better
mouthfeel
really
nice
kreik
d
besides
the
shitty
appearancecarbonation
level
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
matured
lamic
flavor
with
plenty
of
sour
cherry
aspects
the
flavor
was
definitely
the
biggest
standout
aspect
in
my
opinion
o
the
nice
blend
of
fruit
and
tartness
has
some
mellow
hints
of
funk
and
the
gentle
fizz
helps
to
enhance
all
the
flavors
very
nice
drinking
beer
tasted
along
with
a
10
cantillon
kriek
a
10
drie
fonteinen
schaarbeekse
kriek
and
a
07
drie
fontienen
oude
kriek
ranked
in
the
bottom
two
im
glad
i
decided
to
take
a
chance
on
this
beer
i
will
probably
make
this
one
of
my
go
to
sours
as
i
can
readily
find
this
beer
nice
this
is
a
solid
middle
of
the
road
kriek
by
which
i
mean
you
get
a
nice
dose
of
sour
fruitiness
without
the
over
the
top
puckering
power
of
the
more
extreme
examples
but
it
also
isnt
a
candy
sweet
fake
attempt
at
the
style
you
can
actually
find
on
store
shelves
on
occasion
and
its
not
prohibitively
expensive
two
more
factors
to
recommend
it
from
the
bottle
purchased
at
beer
and
gin
house
in
gent
the
larger
37
5
cl
bottle
with
cork
label
lists
this
as
the
2011
harvest
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasantly
sour
wellmade
enjoyable
lambic
it
will
not
appeal
to
fans
who
judge
these
things
purely
by
how
sour
they
are
this
one
is
too
wellbalanced
the
acidity
is
not
at
all
overwhelming
it
is
definitely
far
superior
to
boons
standard
kriek
and
is
well
worth
the
extra
dollar
or
two
in
price
o
pretty
disappointed
if
you
like
sweet
krieks
this
is
all
you
if
you
want
something
thats
tart
and
sour
might
want
to
go
a
different
route

i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
surprisingly
drinkable
at
8
abv
i
think
it
finds
a
great
balance
of
tartness
and
sweetness
definitely
recommend
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
lambics
an
incredibly
drinkable
and
tasty
kriek
though
not
at
all
in
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
o
a
very
solid
kriek
very
sour
and
mouth
puckering
with
some
light
oak
and
brett
notes
a
very
good
starter
kriek
that
i
actually
prefer
to
the
drie

oude
kriek
still
stumped
at
why
the
mariage
parfait
series
has
such
a
high
abv
though
o
a
pretty
nice
kriek
its
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
like
its
very
drinkable
but
i
easily
preferred
the
geuze
mariage
parfait
wasnt
sure
that
it
would
be
a
true
kriek
as
opposed
to
a
sweet
one
but
its
quite
nice
would
gladly
drink
again
and
no
worse
than
the
standard
krieks
from
other
brewersblenders
only
a
lou
pepe
would
be
a
significant
step
up
a
massive
thanks
goes
out
to

bringing

with
a

pink

that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
funk
cherry
wood
and
sugar
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
cherry
and
sugar
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
this
was
a
really
well
balanced
brew
the
funk
aspect
on
this
one
really
added
a
nice
touch
to
everything
else
going
on
here
i
went
into
this
one
expect
to
pick
up
on
tart
cherries
but
they
were
more
along
the
lines
of
sweet
cherries
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
very
nice
lambic
with
lots
of
sour
and
tartness
just
enough
fruit
notes
to
balance
out
the
sourness
and
acidity
this
is
a
shockingly
great
kriek
hell
i
may
go
buy
a
half
case
for
putting
down
quite
impressed
like
this
far
more
than
the
gueuze
version
drinkability
and
overall
impression
im
finding
this
one
every
drinkable
in
that
each
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
and
the
beer
is
disappearing
more
quickly
than
id
intended
with
this
one
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
well
made
beer
and
an
example
of
something
ill
hope
to
be
having
again
in
the
future
im
also
reaching
the
conclusion
that
i
definitely
prefer
my
fruit
lambics
relatively
fresh
so
that
the
fruit
flavors
are
still
strong
throughout
the
beer
i
fond
this
a
really
nice
kriek
and
think
im
beginning
to
develop
an
appreciation
for
what
the
blender
contributes
to
the
mix
o
more
sour
than
i
had
anticipated
the
8
abv
is
nonexistent
yet
it
still
remains
a
sipper
due
to
the
higher
than
average
lactic
and
vinegar
qualities
although
theres
an
abundance
of
raspberry
notes
the
cherry
comes
through
beautifully
towards
the
back
end
of
the
palate
this
is
a
really
nice
kriek
that
would
make
a
great
dessert
good
real
cherry
flavor
with
an
okay
raw
lambic
presence
ive
had
better
but
this
is
still
a
solid
authentic
lambic
o
overall
this
was
delicious
lambic
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
cherry
was
not
astringent
and
the
tart
acidity
was
not
overwhelming
mlight
and
crisp
carbonation
is
high
and
bounces
on
your
tongue
overall
this
is
a
really
smooth
sour
ale
the
cherry
and
tartness
are
quite
refreshing
i
would
definitely
have
another
overall
this
beer
is
bomb
and
if
you
can
try
it
go
for
it
bomb
a
wellaged
kriek
to
be
sure
boon
delivers
again
very
very
pleased
with
this
beer
definitely

more

red
with

this
to
a
collar
nose
is
black
cherry
with
touches
of
sweetness
wood
and
funk
amid
a
mildly
brettspicy
backbone
reminds
me
of
the
cherries
the
cherry
tree
and
the
farm
they
are
on
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
of
the
above
with
black
cherry
and
wood
flavor
dominating
to
me
just
barely
sour
and
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
led
me
to
think
it
was
going
to
be
medium
body
with
almost
prickly
carbonation
and
a
very
cherry
finish
a
completely
different
animal
than
say
hannsens
the
best
overall
very
very
good
definitely
has
its
own
personality
and
it
is
interesting
to
see
what
happens
to
the
lambic
flavors
when
the
abv
is
elevated
a
bit
2008
vintage
too
bad
no
ones
getting
married
right
now
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
rose
topped
by
a
couple
fingers
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
a
blast
of
tart
cherry
hovering
above
sour
orange
spicy
white
wine
grapes
and
a
touch
of
wheaty
funk
the
taste
follows
this
recipe
pretty
closely
with
the
cherries
really
blossoming
on
the
tongue
they
range
from
overtly
tart
to
almost
sweet
every
iteration
sloshing
across
the
tongue
in
eccentric
waves
a
bit
more
sour
funk
here
but
not
by
too
much
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
damn
tasty
brew
one
that
makes
the
3f
schaerbeekse
kriek
completely
obsolete
especially
for
the
price
d
overall
a
solid
kriek
an
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
offering
so
very
approachable
if
you
are
just
getting
into
the
style
surprisingly
refreshing

nothing

i

for
in

with

not
my

not
horrible
i
grabbed
three
of
these
when
a
case
came
in
just
in
case
i
thought
it
was
especially
good
ill
be
going
back
today
to
grab
another
four
to
sit
on
considering
the
price
and
availability
id
say
this
beer
joins
cantillons

for
lambics
i
am
very
impressed

by
the

awesome

2008

purchased

a

its
a

the
nose
would
lead
you
to
expect
but
is
still
pretty
dry
it
drinks
medium
in
body
has
nice
flavor
and
keeps
you
salivating
as
opposed
to
killing
your
palate
with
brett
overall
this
is
a
fine
kriek
and
was
well
worth
the
8
o
i
like
this
pretty
much
i
can
count
the
lambics
ive
had
on
two
hands
and
this
is
isnt
the
best
but
certainly
isnt
the
worst
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
lambics
it
is
excellent
very
drinkable
complex
with
an
excellent
sour
cherry
flavor
overall
fantastic
so
glad
i
was
able
to
get
a
few
of
these
a
must
have
for
the
lambic
connoisseur
this
held
up
really
well
against
some
awesome
sours
and
personally
i
thought
it
was
several
times
better
than
the
marriage
parfait
geuze
schaerbeek
pie
cherry
flavors
tart
and
complex
wet
oak
traces
emerge
in
the
drying
aftertaste
moderate
sourness
and
puckering
cherry
skin
and
tannic
bitterness
as
it
warms
up
resonating
tart
aftertaste
cherry
pits
dried
stems
and
skins
altogether
light
feel
a
little
spritzy
it
dries
up
quickly
on
the
palate
a
nice
variation
on
boon
oude
kriek
more
of
a
pie
cherry
flavor
and
less
intense
sourness
but
it
holds
its
own
nice
pairing
with
dark
chocolate
o
this
is
one
exceptional
kriek
and
easily
rivals
boons
oude
geuze
mariage
parfait
in
terms
of
quality
and
depth
this
would
make
an
incredible
afterdinner
treat
d
not
incredibly
complex
but
not
as
dull
uninteresting
as
some
reviews
seem
to
suggest
rich
raspberry
taste
wraps
around
the
tongue
and
then
puckers
the
cheeks
with
the
tartness
very
nicely
done
some
subtle
apple
maybe
pear
like
flavors
dancing
around
in
the
back
now
as
well
before
really
drying
out
for
the
fini
huge
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
breaking
this
one
out
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
1995
vintage
purportedly
from
frank

personal
cellar
pours
the
color
of
maple
syrup
with
no

clarity
is
hazy
without
being
cloudy
aromas
of
leather
tart
cherries
tannins
and
a
suggestion
of
sweetness
comprises
the
nose
taste
follows
nose
earthy
leathery
and
tart
cherry
flavors
come
out
some
oxidation
is
also
present
as
well
as
whiskey
notes
and
tobacco
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
virtually
still
carbonation
a
slight
acidity
and
a
mild
oilyviscous
quality
to
the
texture
im
not
really
sure
how
to
describe
this
brew
its
by
far
the
oldest
beer
ive
had
and
its
quite
interesting
and
complex
with
some
oud
bruin
qualities
a
little
definitely
goes
a
long
way
though
because
there
is
so
much
going
on
with
this
beer
o
this
beer
could
become
even
better
if
i
would
wait
a
few
years
ill
try
that
looking
forward
already
375ml
bottle
dated
2008
harvest
with
a
best
by
date
of
2030
so
this
must
have
been
bottled
in
2010
bright
red
with
a
punk
head
that
looked
great
at
first
and
then
died
even
though
the
beer
was
very
fizzy
dirty
glass
smelled
like
cherries
no
must
no
barnyard
no
lambic
taste
was
tart
cherries
but
i
want
the
funk
too
and
i
got
none
mouthfeel
was
also
way
too
fizzy
for
my
liking
this
beer
is
awesome
its
a
an
almost
opaque
cherry
wood
color
with
a
huge
head
that
leaves
a
very
thin
delicate
lace
its
got
great
cherry
aroma
there
is
a
good
bit
of
funky
with
sharp
brett
but
also
very
bright
fruit
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
perceived
sweetness
that
helps
ground
the
funk
love
it
a
good
kriek
that
by
design
retains
some
sweetness
and
fuller
cherry
flavor
leaving
it
less
than
bonedry
but
not
as
sickly
sweet
as
many
others
a
good
compromise
to
taste
and
texture
overall
this
is
as
good
of
a
strong
kriek
as
any
i
have
tasted
very
well
put
together
future
outlook
this
beer
is
one
of
the
few
that
i
think
might
actually
improve
with
certain
fooddesert
pairings
exactly
what
im
not
quite
sure
yet
no
matter
cant
get
it
around
here
but
happy
to
have
tried
as
a
fruit
lambic
this
offering
is
not
very
good
the
cherries
are
prominent
but
theres
little
tartness
or
cheesiness
that
usually
accompanies
a
topnotch
offering
from
the
style
a
bit
too
sweet
too
i
wont
revisit
this
one
o
another
nice
kriek
a
well
crafted
product
d
good
a
nice
drinkable
brew
big
thanks
to
g311
for
the
hookup
2008
bottle
it
pours
a
translucent
oxblood
hue
and
has
a
smattering
of
small
bubbles
atop
the
nose
is
full
of
rich
sour
cherry
notes
and
a
small
amount
of
tannic
oak
funk
per
se
is
limited
tartness
is
not
the
flavor
delivers
again
intense
sour
cherry
notes
and
is
exceptionally
vibrant
complementing
the
fruit
musty
oak
and
faint
notes
of
mulled
spice
especially
cinnamon
are
suggested
the
feel
is
silky
and
very
softly
carbonated
and
it
has
a
mellow
dryness
on
the
finish
which
is
quite
nice
overall
it
does
not
blow
me
away
in
any
specific
regard
but
it
is
exceedingly
solid
across
the
board
pours
an
attractive
purple
tinted
red
thin
cap
of
pinkish
hued
head
minimal
head
retention
but
active

constantly
to
the
top
scent
is
muted
tart
cherries
lightly
sweet
grahmn
cracker
faint
touches
of

sip
brings
a
nice
taste
of
mildly
tart
cherries
combined
with
mildly
sweet
grahmn
crackery
malt
the
backbone
has
a
mildly
earthy
feel
touches
of
mild
vinegar
and
for
as
many
times
as
i
said
mild
thats
agood
thing
because
none
of
the
flavors
overpower
making
this
highly
drinkable
finnished
with
notes
of
blackberry
raspberry
and
red
wine
body
is
medium
bone
dry
finish
a
nice
all
around
approachable
but
sophisticated
kriek
2008
vintage
a
firey
purple
blaze
descends
spewing
forth
a
voluminous
pink
front
that
eventually
settles
into
a
small
pinking
whitehead
sour
and
sweet
cherries
a
little
acetobacter
and
a
little
sweetness
in
the
nasal
aroma
starts
with
tang
and
zip
then
the
sweet
cherries
begin
to
mellow
it
out
bringing
some
sweetness
to
the
table
the
tart
vinegar
comes
through
towards
the
middle
and
end
and
it
finishes
with
a
long
sweet
and
sour
cherry
flavor
that
can
only
be
described
as
in
my
mouth
a
bit
drying
in
the
coating
of
my
cavernous
maw
but
absolutely
delectable
a
wonderful
lambic
something
that
mine
shall
aspire
to
o
as
others
have
mentioned
not
an
especially
complex
kriek
but
a
very
solid
and
interesting
version
very
pleasant
drinker
that
im
very
happy
to
have
tried
you
cant
feel
that
there
is
8
abv
in
this
beer
and
it
is
refreshingly
and
intriguing
and
feels
very
original
o
i
really
loved
this
kriek
right
up
there
with
the
cantillion
version
i
would
like
to
grab
a
few
to
lay
down
for
a
couple
of
years
o
a
great
beer
without
question
but
i
think
it
would
benefit
from
a
bit
more
time
in
the
cellar
some
residual
sweetness
i
have
two
more
from
the
2008
bottling
and
i
will
sit
them
for
at
least
two
years
before
trying
again
pours
a
really
nice
red
color
with
a
beautiful
pink
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
some
time
leaving
behind
ample
lacing
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
herbal
character
along
with
some
oak
and
cherries
mild
acid
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
has
more
dry
earthiness
and
an
odd
herbal
character
cherries
are
fairly
minimal
bit
of
an
oak
presence
with
a
touch
of
tannin
dry
finish
without
too
much
acid
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
plain
mariage
parfait
o
easy
to
get
down
for
the
abv
this
is
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
nothing
really
special
going
on
but
i
like
drinking
it
d
at
8
this
is
an
easy
way
to
get
a
buzz
on
quickly
as
it
goes
down
like
juice
perhaps
they
should
rename
it
mariage
panty
dropper
not
the
most
complex
kriek
but
an
enjoyable
one
nonetheless
d
easily
drinkable
goes
down
so
quick
i
wish
this
was
distributed
in
the
us
but
of
course
its
awesome
and
not
on
the
shelves
get
you
some
of
this
o
as
noted
above
not
the
best
representative
but
certainly
a
respectable
offering
appearance
is
a
lovely
red
hue
like
cherries
smell
is
funky
earthy
and
tart
taste
is
funky
sweet
and
sour
cherry
overall
very
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
some
real
crisp
carbonation
it
helps
cut
the
acidity
real
nice
very
drinkable
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
surprised
it
doesnt
have
more
reviews
beer
is
thin
and
the
beer
has
this
musky
mildewy
flavor
on
the
late
palate
that
i
wasnt
expecting
at
all
the
forward
is
some
mild
sweetness
from
the
cherries
mild
fruit
flavors
lactic
creaminess
some
acetic
bite
and
a
mildly
tart
finish
overall
its
not
the
best
lambic
ive
ever
had
but
it
was
decent
id
have
it
again
for
sure
bottle

more

be
interesting
to
see
if

pours
a
deep

a
thick
pink

aroma
of
light

smelly

perhaps
a
hint
of
fruit

has
much
more
sweet
cherry
fruitiness
and
a
tart

finish
very
tasty
and
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
beer
as
lambics
arent
my
usual
style
of
choice
this
was
excellent
and
i
think
its
great
to
see
more
alternatives
to
the
overly
sweet
lambics
that
are
more
commonly
available

into
a
standard

about
55

deep
beautiful
cloudy

aroma
is
quite
sour
and
funky
and
i
think
im
smelling
tannins
although
i
never
reviewed
wine
so
it
is
an
ingredient
that
i
am
still
a
novice
at
pointing
out
there
is
some
oak
aromaflavor
behind
the
tart
cherries
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
cough
syrup
at
all
which
is
what
i
expect
with
everything
made
with
cherries
gross
this
is
a
much
deeper
classier
taste
unlike
the
supersweet
flavors
of
lindemans
lambics
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
aging
so
once
i
get
a
little
more
experience
under
my
belt
i
will
review
this
again
mouthfeel
was
borderline
mediumbodied
with
a
slight
effervescent
feel
but
very
smooth
overall
i
particularly
enjoyed
this
while
it
was
very
cold
because
every
sip
gave
off
an
incredible
refreshing
vibe
i
could
now
see
why
some
of
these
belgian
blenders
prefer
to
fill
up
pints
of
this
remarkable
stuff
i
finished
my
375
bottle
in
15
minutes
this
was
seriously
delicious
and
easily
drinkable
definitely
buying
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
for
future
consumption
best
until
2028
yes
sir
too
good
thank
you
mr
boon
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
it
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
95
points
d
i
liked
this
it
just
did
bot
blow
me
away
a
bit
one
sided
although
the
cherry
component
is
quite
bold
and
noticed
a
bit
more
oak
would
of
been
a
treat
and
a
tad
more
bubbles
as
this
seemed
kinda
dead
although
it
could
be
unblended
glad
i
tried
it
d
very
drinkable
and
not
to
sour
not
saying
that
you
can
get
to
sour
i
love
me
some
sour
but
this
is
an
easy
intro
to
the
style
and
a
tasty
treat
for
the
super
fan
highly
reccomended
for
the
style
this
is
quite
nice
i
definitely
prefer
a
bit
more
funkiness
and
complexity
in
my
lambics
but
this
definitely
gets
the
job
done
it
is
very
quaffable
though
perhaps
just
a
touch
heavier
than
i
prefer
d
this
is
a
very
good
well
balanced
lambic
overall
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
krieks
this
was
a
nice
surprise
as
well
as
i
wasnt
expecting
this
brew
to
be
so
good
would
love
to
have
this
again
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
to
high
carbonation
not
gushing
so
highly
carbonated
in
a
good
way
dthis
is
a
very
tasty
brew
nice
amounts
of
acidity
and
sourness
with
a
ton
of
sweetness
the
oak
is
more
in
the
nose
lighter
in
the
flavor
with
a
good
presence
d
an
extreme
beer
before
its
time
this
beer
is
great
the
fact
that
no
one
seemed
to
enjoy
it
as
much
allowed
me
several
oz
and
id
gladly
drink
this
again
this
lambic
has
held
up
incredibly
well
for
being
at
least
fifteen
years
old
too
bad
this
is
not
in
production
anymore
along
with
the
gueuze
too
would
love
to
drink
again
but
not
likely
recommended
tart
cherries
and
sweet
berry
flavors
in
the
finish
quite
dry
too
some
tart
and
dry
raspberry
dried
apricots
very
tasty
low
carbonation
but
proper
for
the
style
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
it
was
quite
good
unbelievably
drinkable
its
almost
sherry
or
port
like
but
an
aged
version
this
was
my
first
seriously
aged
beer
so
i
am
sure
my
naiveté
is
making
a
difference
here
it
is
just
in
a
different
class
at
this
point
from
the
age
i
think
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
and
a
real
treat
to
have
this
bottle
was
dated
1995
by
far
the
oldest
bottle
conditioned
beer
i
have
had
to
datepoures
a
color
of
a
ripe
cherry
with
a
thin
white
spotty
head
aroma
of
sour
cherries
and
vinegar
with
a
woodiness
but
its
pretty
fainttaste
is
tart
but
not
as
tart
as
alot
of
beers
this
style
maybe
because
of
the
age
also
a
light
sherry
flavor
in
the
finish
a
nice
find
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
kinda
like
this
more
than
others
1983
vintage
sampled
at
the
kulminator
in
antwerpen
belgium
a
costly
13
euros
but
it
was
damn
worth
it
a
lovely
pinkishreddish
brew
with
a
small
cap
of
offwhite
foam
the
aromas
scream
traditional
kriek
and
consist
of
some
crazy
lambic
funk
cherry
pie
filling
slighlty
medicinal
hops
and
some
light
malts
the
taste
is
quite
awesome
it
consists
of
cherry
pie
filling
exotic
spices
yeast
some
light
malts
and
some
great
meidicinal
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
good
enough
for
me
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
excellent
sure
i
would
have
rather
had
a
cheaper
more
recent
vintage
of
this
brew
but
this
was
the
only
vintage
that
they
currently
have
at
the
kulminator
and
who
else
is
going
to
have
this
stuff
tart
acidic
funky
cherries
dominate
with
musty
earthy
flavours
all
over
the
pallette
nutty
hints
in
the
background
mouthpuckering
sour
finish
with
a
heavy
oak
flavour
lingering
on
medium
bodied
very
gently
carbonation
the
woody
oak
flavour
becomes
a
little
overbearing
eventually
overall
well
worth
10
50
i
paid
for
it
hazy
thick
pea
soup
opacity
married
with
sludge
brown
and
blood
red
and
a
soapy
frothy
head
that
wont
die
powerful
swirling
carbonation
really
lively
plum
and
tart
cherry
skin
aromas
mingle
nicely
with
a
sourish
yeasty
unrefined
earthy
character
carries
through
to
the
palate
which
is
suprisingly
integrated
and
held
together
certainly
the
sourness
of
a
traditional
lambic
shines
through
but
theres
a
great
understated
cherry
flavor
and
a
musty
dullness
that
tempers
the
ascerbic
nature
of
the
beer
very
well
put
together
and
as
far
as
traditionalstyle
lambics
go
this
thing
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
for
those
looking
for
a
slightly
less
jarring
introduction
to
the
traditional
take
on
the
style
if
you
think
it
is
jarring
of
course
this
might
be
a
good
start
i
paid
about
10
for
this
a
much
much
better
value
than
the
more
oversweetened
and
popular
lambics
the
aroma
is
musty
with
some
cherry
it
finishes
very
dry
1995
vintage
loved
it
one
word
springs
to
mind
here
exceptional
stinky
barnyard
earthiness
in
the
aroma
quite
vinous
almost
pinot
noir
like
very
complex
aged
cherry
skin
lovely
lambic
tart
sourness
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
o
an
alright
beer
overall
but
id
like
a
bit
more
depth
and
carbonation
and
less
phenols
and
acetic
flavors
definitely
not
feeling
this
beer
it
tasted
like
someone
poured
vinegar
into
cherry
cough
syrup
and
shook
it
up
thats
not
a
good
taste
really
thought
id
like
this
more
the
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
didnt
hit
me
right
though
i
love
tart
beer
very
enjoyable
brew
cranberry
flavor
is
very
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
sour
in
this
beer
is
just
right
another
great
new
glarus
beer
this
is
fantastically
drinkable
for
the
style
tart
fruity
minerally
light
lively
effervescence
was
craving
something
tart
on
a
beautiful
albeit
chilly
spring
day
and
this
is
perfect
another
marvelous
beer
from
new
glarus
in
their
thumbprint
series
it
says
on
the
bottle
that
they
only
cut
dan
loose
a
few
times
a
year
to
let
him
brew
whatever
he
wants
goshdarnit
if
this
is
what
he
does
when
their
back
is
turned
i
wish
theyd
turn
him
loose
more
often
overall
not
sure
what
separates
this
from
the
unplugged
version
wishing
this
were
a
little
more
sour
but
it
has
an
excellent
fruit
flavor
some
nice
tartness
the
cranberries
are
there
semi
sweet
but
more
tart
the
balance
could
be
improved
another
good
ng
fruit
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
others
thanks
sj3324
for
the
opportunity
m
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
great
finish
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
pale
maroon
almost
pink
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
ripe
tart
cranberries
taste
is
much
sweeter
up
front
than
the
smell
with
a
juice
like
feel
no
carbonation
felt
and
a
very
pleasant
tart
taste
at
the
finish
just
excellent
cranberry
shines
it
has
almost
an
ocean
spray
cranapple
vibe
with
some
dry
tart
bacteria
want
it
to
be
more
intense
but
for
this
to
be
in
4pks
and
sitting
on
shelves
wow
extremely
tart
but
good
stuff
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
was
sort
of
like
a
7up
and
cranberry
juice
definitely
a
sour
beer
nice
cranberry
flavor
really
good
actually
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
on
the
head
but
its
ok
on
mouth
feel
pretty
good
overall
as
im
not
a
huge
sour
person
but
could
drink
these
on
summer
days
weird
after
taste
ruined
this
one
for
me
sweet
and
sour
fruits
similar
taste
as
the
fruit
beers
with
a
light
tart
finish
too
sweet
for
me
just
not
a
fan
overall
another
outstanding
beer
a
lot
like
their
fruit
beers
and
definitely
up
to
par
with
them
reminds
me
a
lot
of
rrs
supplication
in
appearance
and
smell
good
carbon
level
with
a
nice
wet
finnish
great
cranberry
flavor
profile
with
underlying
funky
earthy
n
oak
elements
initial
burst
of
vanilla
esque
sweetness
followed
by
a
sharp
tart
kick
this
brewery
sure
knows
how
to
make
fruit
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
to
that
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
classic
lambics
from
belgium
impressive
tart
crisp
refreshing
cranberry
flavor
enjoyed
this
with
cremeaux
and
mareike
gouda
cheeses
overall
just
a
tad
sweet
for
my
taste
but
very
pleasant
enjoyed
it
overall
i
could
probably
chug
one
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
going
on
a
15
mile
hike
overall
i
dont
expect
much
from
any
north
american
lambic
but
the
smell
was
pretty
impressive
overall
another
great
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
not
the
sour
funky
lambic
i
was
maybe
hoping
for
but
still
an
excellent
beer
worth
trying
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
easy
drinker
lots
of
flavor
yet
another
great
fruit
beer
from
ng
great
fall
like
aroma
for
me
with
the
cranberries
reminded
me
of
cooking
in
the
kitchen
just
delicious
while
i
am
not
a
huge
cranberry
fan
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
as
new
glarus
always
does
this
beer
wont
blow
you
away
with
its
complexity
or
layers
of
flavor
but
its
very
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
simple
tothepoint
fruit
beer
thats
world
class
in
its
purity
of
flavor
starts
with
a
big
lambic
nose
lemony
tartness
some
barnyard
a
trace
of
cinnamon
and
a
suspicion
of
cranberry
it
pours
a
brilliant
rose
with
a
quickly
dissipating
pinkish
white
head
that
produces
fine
light
lace
cranberry
leads
the
attack
on
the
palate
with
a
big
lemony
tart
finish
spiced
with
cinnamon
long
lingering
lemony
cranberry
tastes
has
a
very
prickly
effervescence
good
balance
between
the
initial
sweetness
and
the
finishing
lemony
tartness
i
am
consistently
amazed
by
new
glaruss
skill
with
fruit
beers
this
one
is
full
of
fruit
but
so
well
balanced
i
love
it
and
i
wish
they
made
it
more
often
the
body
was
light
clean
crisp
and
very
very
dry
near
perfect
drinkability
is
madwhack
good
yo
gs
these
little
boogers
could
slide
right
down
your
throat
all
day
long
overall
a
great
beer
a
must
try
on
the
other
hand
that
describes
a
lot
of
this
breweries
beers
bottle
as
a
trade
extra
labeled
as
unplugged
not
thumbprint
so
unsure
if
the
year
pours
murky
amber
color
with
a
small
white
to
off
white
head
into
my
cantillon
taster
aroma
of
toffee
caramel
oak
even
some
chocolate
along
with
the
expected
cranberry
fruit
smells
pretty
rich
not
a
huge
lacto
tartness
here
that
i
would
expect
from
something
claiming
to
be
in
the
lambic
style
flavor
is
lots
of
funky
cranberries
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
malt
oak
and
a
bit
of
metallic
oxidation
on
the
sweeter
side
with
light
tartness
from
the
fruit
medium
plus
body
with
high
prickly
carbonation
very
much
in
the
style
if
their
big
fruit
beers
and
less
so
in
the
lambicwildsour
category
nevertheless
a
nice
little
fruit
beer
t
taste
is
somehow
better
than
the
smell
tons
of
sweet
cranberry
and
cherry
juice
upfront
with
a
sweet
wave
of
golden
delicious
apple
behind
it
finish
brings
just
a
tickle
of
oak
and
a
touch
of
honey
mouthfeel
is
just
a
touch
slick
with
some
prickly
carbonation
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
here
in
check
this
is
belgian
red
level
for
me
a
really
delicious
beer
i
feel
bad
for
the
rest
of
america
that
cant
get
this
wonderful
brew
initially
i
gave
this
a
low
score
last
year
at
release
time
just
cracked
one
the
other
night
and
oh
my
has
it
gotten
better
after
a
year
crisp
tart
refreshing
and
not
nearly
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
it
was
fresh
light
bodied
and
tart
full
of
cranberry
juiciness
though
theres
a
musty
minerally
wet
dirty
dishrag
note
that
throws
it
off
a
bit
sharpness
of
the
acidity
tends
to
build
sip
slowly
and
its
less
of
an
issue
crisp
and
quenching
where
the
aroma
had
complexity
the
taste
is
a
little
more
one
note
i
still
enjoy
it
though
it
seems
more
acetic
and
a
little
off
from
the
last
iteration
same
beer
as
unplugged

this
beer
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
rate
and
should
probably
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
it
hits
all
of
the
marks
of
the
style
e
g
look
funkyfruity
smell
funkytart
flavor
etc
and
is
probably
an
extremely
solid
option
for
those
who
love
sours
i
have
enjoyed
sours
but
i
much
prefer
that
the
sourness
itself
be
on
the
milder
end
of
the
spectrum
this
beer
was
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
to
handle
in
terms
of
tartness
slowly
sip
and
get
ready
to
have
your
taste
buds
assaulted
wow
this
is
an
exceptional
sour
beer
very
complex
if
you
see
it
and
enjoy
sours
its
a
must
by
o
really
enjoyable
but
definitely
a
slower
sipping
beer
because
of
the

aroma
of

cherries
and
some

taste
of

and
sour

very
very

this
is
very
good
indeed

almost
a

color
with
a
small
half

white
bubbly
head
no

it
smells
slightly
of
cherries
with
an
earthy
lingering
scent
at
the
end
it
tastes
much
better
than
the
scent
a
strong
cherry
flavor
which
surprises
you
with
a
strong
tart
bite
not
a
bad
one
though
i
was
just
used
to
lindemans
kriek
which
is
a
lot
more
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
strong
carbonation
and
as
mentioned
previously
a
really
strong
tart
bite
it
is
good
though
overall
a
good
kriek
i
prefer
lindemans
to
it
though
o
an
outstanding
kriek
i
love
that
i
can
still
find
this
easily
and
will
enjoy
it
until
the
american
market
realizes
what
theyre
passing
up
o
in
conclusion
this
is
a
great
advocate
for
its
style
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
overwhelming
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
i
look
forward
to
tasting
the
younger
and
older
vintages
in
comparison
overall
pretty
good
stuff
and
one
of
the
better
shelf
krieks
out
there
worth
picking
up
really
enjoyed
this
kriek
overall
a
wonderful
take
on
the
style
im
admittedly
a
sucker
for
krieks
but
this
one
is
exceedingly
well
done
sour
and
puckering
with
a
nice
depth
of
aroma
and
a
nice
dry
finish
that
entices
the
next
sip
in
spite
of
the
aggressive
sourness
i
dont
know
what
this
one
tastes
like
fresh
but
honestly
i
dont
care
its
fantastic
with
over
a
year
on
it
and
i
will
have
to
make
a
point
to
grab
bottles
of
this
when
i
see
it
around
town
its
an
acceptable
substitute
for
its
more
famous
belgian
sour
beer
making
counterparts
and
more
readily
available
excellent
sour
lambic
it
has
some
funk
but
the
sourness
is
the
main
player
if
your
in
the
mood
for
some
puckering

lambic
juice
this
is

a

o
delicious
beer
the
best
lambic
i
have
tasted
really
exemplifies
the
belgian
stlyle
my
grandma
wasnt
quite
as
fond
but
seeing
as
this
was
her
second
sour
ever
after
rodenbach
grand
cru
it
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
for
her
slightly
expensive
but
with
good
reason
this
is
a
great
beer
for
special
occasions
overall
this
was
excellent
i
have
only
recently
started
to
gain
an
appreciation
for
the
style
indeed
for
a
cherry
beer
hanssens
oude
kriek
has
lots
of
candid
unvarnished
lambic
qualities
some
fruit
is
appreciable
but
not
as
much
as
the
dusty
cellar
in
which
this
surely
spent
considerable
time
aging
before
during
and
after
the
fruit
was
added
its
arguably
one
of
the
most
genuine
least
embellished
examples
on
the
market
i
loved
it
o
really
good
beer
very
enjoyable
drink
price
point
is
excessive
for
what
it
is
22
whole
foods
newport
beach
o
great
appearance
smells
taste
a
great
belgian
sour
beer
at
a
decent
price
i
think
i
paid
about
10
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
if
i
see
it
on
the
shelves
also
for
those
who
care
about
food
pairing
i
really
thought
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
ever
paired
with
filipino
pork
bbq
skewers
and
pickled
papayas
who
knew
o
very
easy
drinking
especially
on
a
hot
day
not
too
overpowering
with
the
cherries
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
overall
i
believe
this
bottle
is
an
exception
and
the
beer
is
likely
usually
better
carbed
than
this
very
tasty
though
overall
a
very
solid
kreik
though
i
find
myself
wanting
a
bit
more
balance
at
times
o
very
nice
example
of
a
sour
kriek
my
wife
really
enjoyed
it
too
worth
seeking
out
o
im
glad
that
i
gave
this
one
a
go
when
i
have
an
itch
for
a
good
sour
kriek
i
will
likely
revisit
this
again
a
fresh
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
red
with
a
nonexistant
head
this
beer
is
very
acidic
acid
is
predominantly
acetic
this
dominates
but
of
course
there
is
plently
of
funk
but
also
notes
of
smoky
oak
and
even
some
raw
meat
overall
a
decent
kriek
but
a
little
over
the
top
with
too
much
vinegar
taste
overall
this
is
too
sour
and
the
acetic
acid
is
too
strong
detracting
from
the
cherry
and
funk
aspects
clearly
i
didnt
do
this
any
favor
by
cellaring
two
years
hope
to
try
this
again
fresheron
cask
o
pretty
nice
reasonably
priced
ans
easy
to
find
sour
in
my
area
o
good
drinkability
good
lambic
kriek
othis
is
my
fist
kriek
but
i
feel
like
i
started
off
with
a
bang
and
i
really
like
the
style
i
am
interested
in
seeing
how
this
beer
would
change
with
age
but
i
like
it
right
now
as
i
have
a
very
high
tolerance
for
sour
which
this
really
gives
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
krieks
or
sours
impressive
and
seriously
assertive
one
of
the
better
oude
krieks
ive
had
although
not
quite
in
the
league
of
3f
o
a
solid
kriek
there
are
others
that
i
like
more
but
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
definitely
worth
picking
up
tastes
a
bit
like
an
organic
shock
tart
like
if
something
unnaturally
intense
were
somehow
robbed
of
its
cloying
fakeness
and
all
thats
left
behind
seems
wholesome
and
real
in
spite
of
its
intensity
its
like
how
exercise
feels
a
good
high
while
this
is
only
my
3rd
lambic
or
so
and
only
the
first
ive
reviewed
i
think
i
might
be
coming
around
to
the
style
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
quite
enjoyable
asis
but
i
could
do
with
a
little
more
fruit
and
a
little
less
sour
those
who
are
big
on
sour
notes
would
do
well
to
seek
this
out
pours
a
dark
amber
red
with
lots
of
head
tastes
of
cherries
and
dark
fruits
with
some
good
tart
sourness
finishing
through
not
overpowering
was
the
sour
taste
however
drinks
down
really
smooth
and
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
bottles
of
this
i
love
the
way
sours
tastes
on
the
tongue
after
reading
about
the
potential
for
aging
the
beer
kind
of
wish
id
done
so
oh
well
just
have
to
get
some
more
and
do
so
poured
this
at
a
good
temperature
with
an
amazing
roiling
head
that
is
maintained
by
the
incredible
effervescence
of
this
wonderful
brew
no
lace
clear
amber
cherry
color
and
loads
of
teeny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
cherry
musk
yeast
oak
vinegar
flavor
is
brut
champagnesque
with
a
demure
cherry
presence
and
the
yeast
bitterness
is
exactly
matched
by
the
small
sharp
peaks
of
tartness
from
carbonic
acid
and
wild
yeast
finish
is
like
flavor
gradually
diminishes
and
is
satisfying
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
bit
of
reddishwhite
foam
the
smell
initially
was
off
to
my
nose
chlorphenols
after
the
brew
settle
down
a
little
the
fragrance
was
definitely
that
of
a
sour
beer
but
not
a
ton
of
fruit
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
cherry
in
it
than
the
smell
would
suggest
but
overall
its
a
pretty
light
beer
the
sourness
is
pretty
strong
but
it
ends
up
being
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
the
carbonation
helps
give
it
a
bit
of
lift
as
well
overall
i
would
probably
drink
this
beer
more
regularly
if
it
was
a
bit
less
expensive
and
i
didnt
have
so
many
other
beers
i
still
want
to
try
what
a
delicious
surprise
of
a
beer
this
was
wow
medium
body
nicely
carbonated
unlike
the
experimental
lambics
and
dry
on
the
tongue
a
nicely
done
fruit
lambic
although
theres
better
available
especially
considering
the
price
overall
nice
dry
kriek
plenty
sour
without
being
overwhealming
o
a
pretty
nice
kriek
not
in
your
face
cherry
but
good
nonetheless
o
a
good
fruit
lambic
in
a
pinch
but
at
this
point
its
more
like
a
venomous
flanders
red
or
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
with
an
extra
dose
of
sour
power
o
solid
lambic
in
my
opinion
a
nice
step
up
from
a
monks
cafe
this
has
very
mellow
carbonation
if
any
with
a
light
body
this
is
very
good
i
find
this
is
one
that
has
a
lot
of
bottle
variation
at
times
its
been
one
of
the
most
acidic
beers
ive
had
this
particular
bottle
strikes
a
pretty
good
balance
a
overall
an
impressively
sour
and
well
blended
lambic
beer
the
proportion
of
cherries
just
add
to
the
tartness
and
this
beer
ends
up
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
or
stomach
pounding
acidity
and
a
flavor
that
lasts
i
love
me
some
sour
and
funk
this
certainly
fits
the
bill
and
i
did
enjoy
my
bottle
though
over
barring
in
a
sense
that
even
puts
cantillon
to
shame
if
you
want
to
impress
some
sour
heads
this
is
what
you
should
bring
overall
a
really
tasty
kriek
it
a
bit
expensive
at
12
for
350ml
cc
bottle
but
its
very
enjoyable
the
vinegar
is
a
bit
stronger
than
i
like
but
it
not
horrible
drinkability
bottle
is
just
a
hare
too
sour
and
needs
a
bit
more
complexity
otherwise
a
good
beer
m
light
to
medium
o
i
didnt
like
the
raspberry
very
much
but
this
one
was
a
little
better
the
flavors
are
more
balanced
and
the
sourness
is
more
manageable
for
the
right
price
i
would
get
another
but
i
wouldnt
run
to
the
store
to
get
some
like
others
from
the
style
pours
a
semiopaque
dark
crimson
with
no
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
of
sour
cherries
funk
earth
and
some
woody
aromas
i
am
getting
a
sharp
whiff
of
acidic
notes
if
i
really
stick
my
nose
in
the
glass
taste
is
of
extremely
tart
and
sour
cherries
earthy
funk
and
wood
there
is
a
very
acidic
feeling
left
in
the
mouth
with
each
sip
this
beer
is
basically
flat
with
a
very
tiny
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
as
it
stands
but
the
carbonation
level
is
pretty
lacking
which
seems
to
be
a
common
theme
for
hanssens
o
a
good
kriek
but
well
below
de
cam
and
cantillon
for
me
overall
im
rather
disappointed
by
this
beer
though
it
is
possible
ive
got
a
bad
bottle
how
does
a
naturally
tart
and
wildfermented
beer
go
bad
i
dont
know
but
this
beer
is
undercarbonated
overtart
and
just
not
cherry
enough
for
the
style
o
too
much
acidity
without
enough
fruit
to
back
it
up
even
with
more
fruit
the
lactic
is
probably
too
much
and
the
acetic
character
needs
to
be
taken
down
a
bit
lively
carbonation
decently
crisp
the
funkiness
of
this
one
was
really
appealing
not
at
all
overpowering
but
fully
integrated
with
the
beers
other
elements
however
i
have
to
disagree
with
a
handful
of
others
who
feel
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
sour
styleits
strong
stuff
overall
with
concentrated
intense
sourness
and
acidity
m
o
carbonation
is
just
right
for
the
style
no
too
fizzy
but
stable
enough
to
help
move
this
along
the
finish
is
lactic
tart
and
lingers
a
very
long
time
a
more
advanced
kriek
i
wouldnt
start
a
sour
beer
lover
out
with
this
one
8
years
ago
i
would
have
hated
this
but
today
its
mighty
fine
375
ml
bottle
aged
one
year
in
my
cellar
no
best
before
date
explosive
cork
served
cellar
temp
clear
ruby
red
color
little
to
no
head
wo
an
aggressive
pour
smell
good
even
though
its
made
from
cherries
i
get
a
strong
strawberry
aroma
highly
acid
just
in
the
nose
taste
is
tart
and
fruity
yet
very
dry
only
slightly
carbonated
flavor
is
darker
fruitiness
than
smell
i
believe
the
smell
is
mostly
yeast
and
bacteria
where
the
flavor
pushes
the
actual
fruit
wide
range
of
mouthfeels
lots
of
lactic
acid
kind
of
scorching
and
definitely
a
last
beer
of
the
night
kind
of
beer
it
literally
made
my
tongue
sore
and
i
love
sour
beer
and
drink
them
regularly
thats
never
happened
to
me
before
i
still
enjoyed
it
unique
and
exciting
overall
hanssens
kriek
certainly
lived
up
to
my
expectations
in
terms
of
sourness
even
though
it
didnt
quite
match
the
cantillon
kriek
of
2007
aside
from
the
sourness
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
one
i
will
seek
out
again
o
this
is
a
solid
lambic
well
balanced
easy
drinking
nice
sweetness
mixed
in
with
the
sourness
enjoyable
o
sugary
sweet
and
pleasant
good
funk
on
the
acidic
side
but
not
harsh
great
drinking
all
around
thanks
again
chad
randall
wonderful
cheers
o
the
appearance
of
this
brew
is
enthralling
but
it
lacks
in
the
flavor
feel
some
carbonation
would
have
really
helped
this
one
out
this
beer
has
the
lack
of
flavors
and
complexities
that
i
find
noteworthy
in
many
others
it
just
seems
like
the
vinegar
and
sourness
show
off
too
much
and
dont
let
anything
else
shine
thru
exept
for
perhaps
some
black
cherries
and
i
love
sour
so
its
kind
of
awkward
for
me
to
not
like
this
one
a
bit
of
vinegar
in
the
finish
like
a
flanders
red
this
was
a
bit
less
desirable
for
me
funky
cherries
the
most
striking
part
of
the
beer
was
the
very
strong
sourness
and
the
very
soft
round
mouthfeel
would
still
drink
this
often
if
i
could
i
do
wish
the
cask
could
be
kept
a
bit
cooler
somehow
conclusion
this
is
an
awesome
kriek
and
one
that
i
imagine
would
benefit
from
aging
the
aroma
is
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
the
flavor
seems
to
me
to
be
masked
by
the
intense
tartness
and
sourness
but
know
the
little
know
about
the
blenders
that
made
this
i
think
that
the
end
product
is
exactly
what
they
intend
it
to
be
so
i
will
strive
to
appreciate
what
they
produce
if
you
are
a
lover
of
traditional
lambic
or
of
wild
ales
in
general
i
recommend
you
try
this
as
soon
as
possible
o
this
was
great
paired
nicely
with
the
pie
couldnt
do
more
than
a
glass
though
o
this
beer
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
over
a
century
of
traditional
belgian
brewing
can
yield
this
beer
is
perfectly
crafted
not
only
in
the
way
its
spontaneously
fermented
and
blended
with
cherries
but
how
its
aged
in
barrels
and
then
bottle
conditioned
after
all
that
it
comes
out
nearly
crystal
clear
with
head
great
carbonation
and
an
amazinlgy
crisp
refreshing
taste
i
can
find
it
locally
but
it
takes
time
this
beer
is
amazing
5
overall
outstanding
kriek
glad
i
got
a
carbonated
bottle
oi
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
one
the
price
was
okay
17
99
for
a
750
i
think
i
was
kind
of
expecting
a
little
more
on
this
one
the
carbonation
is
really
what
lowers
the
score
on
this
one
it
was
just
too
flat
i
would
not
recommend
this
one
oas
krieks
go
this
is
above
average
i
like
that
hanssens
really
goes
for
it
with
the
sharp
acidity
and
bold
fruit
flavors
a
little
more
carbonation
wouldnt
hurt
overall
a
disappointment
i
know
that
this
beer
can
be
amazing
so
if
i
ever
get
a
chance
to
spend
some
time
with
a
fully
carbonated
bottle
i
will
revisit
this
review
until
then
the
beer
is
deserving
of
my
low
score
and
it
appears
i
am
not
the
only
one
to
have
had
a
similar
problem
o
the
flavors
are
pretty
good
and
this
thing
is
incredibly
potent
with
tart
berry
flavors
with
some
carbonation
im
sure
this
is
a
much
better
beer
but
as
a
flat
beer
its
very
rough
to
drink
the
acidity
is
very
taxing
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
the
tartness
makes
it
feel
like
forcefed
medicines
i
could
get
this
thing
down
if
it
was
a
magical
elixir
to
cure
all
my
problems
but
otherwise
this
isnt
drinking
very
well
ill
revisit
this
one
and
ill
hope
for
a
loud
pop
from
the
cork
overall
a
really
nice
well
done
fruit
forward
and
sour
kriek
tons
of
cherry
notes
makes
this
refreshing
and
nicely
complex
the
lack
of
carbonation
detracts
a
little
but
not
enough
to
keep
me
from
buying
this
again
sometime
thanks
to
the
magician
of
sarro
tasting
crew
very
old
bottle
age
unknown
15
years
aroma
still
very
fruity
despite
the
age
obviously
cherries
lots
of
barnyard
funk
humid
earth
appearance
beautiful
red
pour
with
decent
white
head
flavors
very
sour
but
still
enjoyable
mainly
wood
flavors
some
medicinal
herbs
cherries
faded
quite
a
bit
something
a
little
harsh
about
it
palate
one
of
the
driest
beer
ive
had
low
carbonation
overall
very
interesting
experiment
as
for
vintage
fruit
lambic
i
slightly
prefered
the
96
gambrinus
but
this
was
very
good
too
this
was
a
really
great
beer
id
love
to
give
this
another
go
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
tasting
o
sour
yes
one
must
at
a
minimum
like
sour
beers
before
trying
this
in
general
my
tastes
are
going
more
and
more
toward
sours
as
it
is
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
bottle
was
definitely
left
lacking
for
the
missing
carbonation
im
not
sure
that
i
would
buy
another
bottle
but
in
the
right
circumstances
i
dont
think
i
would
hesitate
what
a
shame
i
was
looking
for
a
more
affordable
kriek
and
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
ill
have
to
stick
cantillon
and
liefmans
when
i
can
afford
them
o
this
is
my
gold
standard
for
krieks
spot
on
overall
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
cask
lambic
cask
the
lack
of
carbonation
was
nice
as
it
let
me
concentrate
on
the
flavor
o
this
beer
is
simple
with
an
acidic
bite
to
the
finish
with
hints
of
cherries
and
wild
critters
and
wood
they
are
all
overpowered
by
the
acid
beautiful
color
mostly
flat
thin
ring
this
is
a
very
pretty
kriek
the
nose
has
a
great
cherry
character
leathery
fruity
and
tannic
with
a
nice
lambic
backbone
the
cherry
character
is
about
as
far
from
bright
as
you
can
possibly
get
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
funk
cherries
and
noticeable
sulfur
rather
fartlike
the
sulfur
gets
in
the
way
of
enjoyability
of
the
beer
lots
of
sour
cherry
with
leather
and
oak
moderate
vinegar
fruity
acidity
this
is
mildly
watery
on
the
finish
too
much
acidity
for
my
palate
this
is
not
as
good
as
the
bottled
version
imo
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
one
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
a
good
sour
i
usually
do
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
fizzy
pop
on
the
tongue
to
my
lambics
so
this
was
sort
of
a
let
down
o
not
an
expert
in
sours
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
acidity
vinegar
and
tartness
is
not
overpowering
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
has
not
had
a
lot
of
sours
this
is
a
great
brew
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
and
prominent
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
im
hoping
to
review
this
again
down
the
line
oddly
enough
the
lack
of
carbonation
might
show
the
balance
off
more
on
the
tongue
its
also
rather
drinkable
once
again
proving
that
you
cant
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
or
smell
375ml
bottle
labeled
lot
e
with
no
other
information
this
beer
poured
a
medium
bodied
dark
dark
rich
red
in
color
with
no
a
single
bubble
of
carbonation
it
poured
really
flat
the
aromas
are
of
slightly
tart
cherries
with
slight
funk
there
isnt
much
complexity
it
tastes
good
there
just
isnt
too
much
going
on
it
tastes
of
subtle
sour
cherries
with
a
light
sweet
tart
esque
finish
it
drinks
kind
of
watery
in
consistency
but
it
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
pretty
lackluster
kriek
im
surprised
because
i
normally
love
hanssens
but
this
one
couldve
been
better
bought
two
bottles
of
this
one
bottle
had
liquid
almost
to
the
top
of
the
bottle
where
the
other
bottle
had
liquid
just
to
the
midneck
of
the
bottle
i
chose
to
review
the
one
with
less
liquid
in
it
and
cellar
the
other
one
this
beer
pours
an
almostclear
bright
ruby
red
color
with
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
thats
why
i
chose
to
do
this
one
now
i
hope
the
other
bottle
will
have
better
carbonation
scent
is
very
lovely
with
some
amazing
tart
cherry
aromas
and
a
ton
of
funk
hints
of
oak
and
balsamic
vinegar
taste
is
just
mindblowing
so
many
amazing
flavors
the
cherry
is
spoton
and
just
makes
for
a
perfect
kriek
beer
amazing
sour
barnyard
funkiness
with
some
delightful
oak
and
lactic
acid
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
no
carbonation
whatsoever
the
sourness
i
just
tingling
all
over
my
mouth
from
the
inside
of
my
cheeks
to
my
teeth
overall
im
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
having
zero
carbonation
i
dont
normally
enjoy
still
beers
o
fantastic
allaround
this
kriek
is
delicious
with
a
huge
sourness
thats
one
of
the
more
sour
beers
ive
ever
experienced
i
grabbed
another
bottle
to
share
with
thedtrain
which
wasnt
anywhere
near
as
sour
this
one
gets
much
better
with
some
age
this
was
an
exceptionally
nice
pairing
with
some
spare
ribs
from
honey
1
had
this
on
cask
at
the
map
room
first
drink
of
the
night
and
started
the
night
off
right
poured
with
the
color
of
a
nice
red
wine
with
about
a
quarter
inch
of
bright
white
head
this
receded
to
a
small
ring
around
the
outside
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
had
lots
of
acid
mostly
with
some
vinegar
acidity
not
a
ton
other
than
some
fruityness
and
acidity
nice
but
nothing
super
special
the
flavor
was
very
nice
and
refreshing
and
complex
with
good
cherry
and
acetic
and
lactic
acid
and
some
tannic
red
wine
flavors
pleasant
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
was
very
light
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
very
dry
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
good
lambic
d
wonderfully
delicious
still
has
all
the
classic
elements
and
tartness
is
almost
at
the
same
level
however
cask
version
provides
a
smoothness
that
increases
overall
drinkability
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
really
like
the
style
and
this
one
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
a
big
sour
kick
and
nice
cherry
flavor
im
going
to
have
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
really
great
stuff
dont
tell
anyone
though
i
dont
want
it
to
disappear
from
the
shelves
i
still
think
its
quite
enjoyable
though
and
its
better
out
of
the
cask
i
think
this
needs
a
food
pairing
ideally
than
casual
drinking
id
like
to
have
dinner
with
this
for
sure
a
nice
dry
aged
steak
seems
in
order
but
not
sure
how
the
vinegar
component
would
fit
perhaps
a
kale
vegetable
and
red
wine
vinegar
reduction
on
the
side
and
you
have
magic
i
really
want
food
with
this
beer
overall
pretty
impressed
however
i
found
the
beer
to
be
quite
acidic
ill
be
looking
to
compare
this
kriek
to
others
such
as
cantillon
o
this
is
now
my
third
favorite
kriek
behind
lp
kriek
and
cantillon
100
kriek
much
easier
to
find
too
md
mouthpuckering
sour
and
has
you
begging
for
another
sip
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
works
well
though
awesome
beer
for
the
style
o
a
great
sour
cherry
lambic
worth
the
price
will
pick
it
up
again
overall
ok
but
not
great
sour
and
tart
acidic
lots
of
cherry
fairly
sweet
flemmy
but
mostly
no
carbonation
o
i
think
i
might
overall
prefer
wilds
to
lambics
who
knows
in
the
end
both
are
solid
styles
as
for
this
one
it
was
good
to
try
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
would
definitely
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
and
again
awesome
pours
a
murky
reddish
with
a
bit
of
head
around
the
edges
smells
like
sweaty
dog
ass
lots
of
funk
on
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
funky
vry
very
sour
lote
of
cherry
hitting
hard
good
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
overall
interesting
and
fairly
tasty
but
nothing
special
md
mouthfeel
is
harsh
and
tart
but
smooth
on
the
tongue
reasonably
drinkable
and
great
when
shared
among
a
group
very
neat
beer
id
have
this
again
dvery
drinkable
taste
was
gone
in
no
time
d
well
youd
better
like
sours
if
you
decide
to
tackle
this
one
easily
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
had
but
im
really
digging
it
one
bottle
is
plenty
for
now
but
ill
certainly
keep
one
or
two
of
these
around
for
a
special
sour
mood
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
and
has
low
carbonation
and
little
head
the
smell
is
wonderful
light
cherry
smell
a
good
funk
and
nice
sourness
the
taste
is
fairly
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
cherries
having
a
slightly
more
pronounced
flavor
and
the
sourness
being
stronger
than
the
funk
this
beer
is
sour
and
awesome
i
will
be
sinking
more
hanssens
from
now
on
the
mouthfeel
lose
points
for
being
under
carbonated
but
other
than
that
it
is
thin
dry
and
puckering
this
beer
even
though
it
is
so
sour
is
still
very
drinkable
and
is
going
to
become
somewhat
of
a
regular
in
my
lineup
d
a
delicious
kriek
nicely
balanced
and
very
complex
at
the
same
time
my
first
hanssens
just
leaves
me
wanting
more
poured
into
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
nice
red
violete
color
with
no
head
but
damn
this
color
is
great
the
smell
is
sour
sour
cherries
and
barnyard
with
notes
of
red
wine
vinnegar
all
the
way
through
this
is
the
most
insanely
sour
beer
lost
of
crisp
sour
cherry
flavor
the
feel
is
good
flat
as
far
as
i
notice
and
light
a
bit
tough
on
the
pallet
after
a
while
but
this
one
rocks
hard
d
hanssens
makes
some
very
good
beers
at
an
affordable
price
although
they
arent
quite
cantillon
for
the
price
they
are
close
enough
another
winner
d
drink
this
one
very
slow
and
serve
it
at
least
60
enjoy
the
subtle
nuances
as
it
warms
this
one
has
a
very
dry
and
sour
finish
overall
this
beer
tasted
absolutely
magnificent
but
because
of
the
low
carbonation
the
drinkability
suffers
i
was
completely
satisfied
after
only
2
or
3
ounces
and
didnt
really
want
any
more
a
fine
beer
for
sure
but
one
that
i
would
split
many
ways
this
is
one
of
my
first
ventures
into
the
sour
realm
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
and
intriguing
beverages
ive
ever
consumed
i
now
understand
why
there
is
such
a
strong
following
for
beers
like
this
and
i
can
certainly
see
myself
digging
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
style
its
an
extremely
sour
tart
beer
i
can
see
a
lot
of
people
not
liking
this
but
it
works
for
me
even
without
the
carbonation
beer
is
thin
as
expected
and
quite
sour
on
the
get
on
there
is
a
moderate
tartness
and
a
dry
finish
on
the
end
there
is
a
malic
flavor
and
a
mild
acetic
flavor
next
its
not
as
complex
again
as
some
others
but
it
is
quite
good
i
can
only
wonder
what
this
could
have
been
if
it
had
carbonation
it
is
actually
a
pretty
sour
beer
as
well
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
without
carbonation
its
not
the
easiest
drinking
thing
i
would
like
to
retry
this
and
hopefully
it
will
be
carbonated
d
with
all
of
the
sour
flavors
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
beautiful
color
pinkish
read
with
a
red
tinted
head
that
fades
oh
so
fast
the
nose
finds
some
sour
cherry
but
much
more
acetic
acid
red
wine
vinegar
sharp
citrus
rind
and
a
bit
o
cherry
pie
like
a
sour
punch
to
the
face
wow
so
much
acetic
flavor
vinegar
pithy
citrus
cherry
mixes
in
faint
notes
of
oak
not
getting
alot
of
brett
charecter
or
too
much
from
the
barrels
a
hint
of
tobacco
is
detectable
almost
still
in
the
mouth
but
carbonation
is
elevated
by
the
sourness
not
the
most
drinkable
kriek
around
but
a
top
one
thats
for
sure
fabulous
beer
with
each
smell
it
reveals
new
dimensions
and
one
sip
begs
for
another
wow
blown
away
every
time
i
have
one
of
these
glowing
dark
cherry
red
with
no
head
but
a
little
collar
that
hangs
on
the
whole
time
nose
is
horse
barn
oak
earth
wet
earthmushroom
and
tons
of
real
cherry
very
acidic
all
is
expressed
simply
wonderfully
in
the
taste
and
the
palate
just
opens
up
for
loads
of
sour
cherry
goodness
it
makes
me
salivate
like
crazy
virtually
still
and
softsilky
medium
body
it
is
so
lovely
i
never
want
it
to
end
the
most
refined
and
elegant
flavors
are
going
on
here
and
my
gears
are
really
turning
i
just
cant
say
enough
good
stuff
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
very
very
sour
one
of
the
best
lambics
i
have
ever
tasted
seriously
underrated
in
my
opinion
deep
ruby
red
pour
with
little
to
no
head
almost
still
looking
pour
big
cherry

with
some
barnyard

by

and

wateringly
sour
with
a
pleasant
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
d
the
vinegar
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
my
wife
and
i
split
a
25
4
oz
bottle
so
a
smaller
serving
may
have
mitigated
somewhat
as
it
was
the
last
few
sips
were
a
chore
although
this
was
a
very
pleasant
drinker
early
on
o
not
as
drinkable
as
the
beersel
the
only
other
kriek
ive
tried
due
to
extreme
tartness
and
tannic
bitterness
dont
get
me
wrong
still
a
fine
beer
with
all
of
the
fine
kriek
qualities
but
for
the
money
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
bottle
poured
a
clear
red
color
ale
with
a
large
lightly
pink
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
funk
and
barnyard
notes
with
some
tart
cherries
taste
is
also
a
funky
mix
between
some
tart
and
barnyard
notes
with
light
oak
and
fresh
tart
cherries
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
refreshing
while
being
complex
and
funky
as
hell
better
then
the
strawberry
with
good
controlled
acidity
level
from
a
375ml
bottle
pours
a
clear
red
with
a
thin
ring
of
head
after
like
15
krieks
all
i
can
pull
out
here
are
the
extreme
outlying
qualities
of
this
band
aid
hospital
room
sour
dry
cherry
heavy
acidity
in
the
front
palate
which
just
kills
it
for
me
im
thinking
that
its
really
difficult
to
make
a
sour
cherry
or
raspberry
beer
lambic
or
otherwise
without
that
blinding
acidity
hanssens
failed
in
this
regard
picked
it
up
while
looking
for
some
thanksgiving
sours
and
it
was
definitely
the
highlight
the
only
other
true
kriek
ive
had
is
the
lou
pepe
which
i
aged
for
a
year
and
while
this
was
a
shade
under
that
one
the
difference
is
negligible
combines
the
sweet
and
sour
aspects
of
the
style
superbly
the
cherries
hit
first
and
quickly
it
quickly
moves
onto
an
excellence
puckering
sour
this
would
probably
mellow
out
into
a
nice
sweeter
beer
within
a
year
but
i
like
it
as
is
d
keep
in
mind
that
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
the
sourness
will
put
some
people
off
that
being
said
i
think
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
certainly
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
and
at
this
price
range
i
dont
recon
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
di
must
say
this
isnt
very
drinkable
it
does
not
go
down
easily
at
all
its
just
entirely
way
too
sour
for
me
drinkability
good
d
not
my
favorite
kriek
lambic
beer
but
certainly
a
world
class
example
nonetheless
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
in
a
heartbeat
really
sour
d
a
great
lambic
tastes
great
with
a
great
balance
and
fruit
profile
crisp
and
just
plain
enjoyable
dare
i
say
one
of
the
better
krieks
out
there
d
it
drank
good
but
fell
a
bit
short
side
by
side
with
the
cantillon
kriek
it
is
still
a
pretty
damn
good
fruit
lambic
a
decent
kriek
not
up
to
cantillon
standards
but
not
bad
drinkability
this
is
a
sipping
kriek
without
a
doubt
mouthfeel
problems
aside
this
is
a
pretty
complicated
brew
not
sure
why
i
skipped
it
so
many
times
well
worth
the
purchase
to
sour
ale
lovers
d
a
delicious
but
intense
kriek
that
even
i
had
to
take
slowly
i
think
increased
carbonation
would
have
helped
with
the
drinkability
here
same
with
the
cassis
d
awesome
and
completely
unexpected
man
amazing
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
palpable
carbonation
on
the
tongue
this
lambic
drinks
very
well
albeit
sipperslow
but
very
intriguing
this
oude
kriek
is
definitely
easing
my
transition
into
the
sour
beers
realm
very
nicely
over
all
i
lioked
this
beer
couldnt
pick
out
many
flavors
but
its
really
the
sourness
that
satisfies
me
and
this
one
has
plenty
of
it
the
first
impression
is
deinitley
wine
i
would
have
liked
a
tad
more
carbonation
but
its
still
good
im
not
sure
i
can
finish
this
not
so
much
because
its
so
bad
but
because
the
pain
my
mouth
and
throat
are
in
i
dont
know
what
its
like
to
drink
bleach
but
it
has
to
be
similar
to
this
d
definitely
a
sipper
tart
and
tasty
but
not
something
i
would
drink
a
whole
lot
of
a
nice
change
and
definitely
something
to
quench
the
sour
craving
d
really
sour
but
extremely
tasty
great
for
a
once
in
awhile
treat
cant
imagine
going
through
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
single
sitting
a
very
nice
kriek
lambic
funky
sour
and
very
tasty
d
as
with
most
good
brews
of
the
style
very
good
flavor
quotient
but
high
acidity
content
leads
to
a
brew
that
you
dont
mind
reaching
for
regularly
but
cant
drink
in
excess
d
this
is
traditional
fruit
lambic
i
like
the
real
fruit
flavour
in
this
beer
much
more
of
a
crossover
from
lindemans
than
cantillon
would
ever
be
so
theres
something
to
be
said
for
that
but
still
authentic
to
a
t
d
the
minor
sweet
cherry
note
does
a
lot
for
drinkability
being
more
tart
wouldnt
be
a
bad
thing
but
it
would
probably
cut
drinkability
back
more
at
this
point
its
very
tart
but
feels
manageable
halfway
through
the
bottle
my
first
from
hanssens
but
ill
be
looking
for
more
drinkability
is
high
a
very
nice
refreshing
fruit
lambic
i
couldnt
ask
for
anything
else
other
then
a
lower
price
ill
have
to
enjoy
this
one
again
defiantly
worth
a
second
visit
soon
d
not
the
easiest
style
to
drink
but
such
a
refreshing
and
summery
treat
drinking
this
in
brilliant
sunshine
with
a
bowl
of
fresh
oregon
blueberries
perfect
day
excellent
beer
extremely
worthy
a
strange
hazy
blood
grapefruit
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
tart
and
acidic
on
the
nose
like
a
slightly
sweeter
geueze
some
phenol
in
the
nose
too
taste
has
the
familiar
lemony
twang
of
a
geueze
but
with
a
hint
of
cheery
peel
moderate
tannins
dry
the
finish
the
body
and
drinkability
are
right
for
the
style
well
in
the
good
range
im
not
sure
about
the
cherry
flavor
itself
however
it
comes
through
quite
pleasantly
sometimes
but
then
it
is
sometimes
very
medicinal
i
dont
like
phenolmedicinal
flavors
when
they
overpower
the
rest
of
the
flavor
not
bad
ill
stick
to
the
oude
geueze
dvery
good
beer
great
balance
as
nothing
dominates
the
flavors
are
well
pronounced
and
work
in
tasty
lambic
harmony
d
pretty
intensely
sour
and
i
dont
think
i
could
quite
handle
a
second
serving
of
this
however
it
is
a
damn
fine
lambic
and
this
is
my
first
beer
from
hanssens
recommended
thanks
arne

of
buttery

very
tart
and

finish
excellent
stuff
the
beer
pours
an
orangebrown
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
with
some
cherry
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
tart
cherries
along
with
some
nice
character
from
the
oak
aging
not
extremely
sour
but
a
great
mix
between
cherry
flavor
and
tartness
the
beer
is
extremely
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
noticeably
heavy
mouthfeel
not
viscous
but
big
body
taste
of
dark
fruits
but
not

sweet
very
nice
a
lot
going
on
some
funk
but
not
heavy
quite
balanced
in
the
direction
of
a
very
subtle
acidity
astringent
tart
finish
a
drying
and
slight
puckering
effect
on
the
inside
of
the

some
noticeable
tannins
there
a
great
beer
quite
drinkable
d
i
could
sip
on
this
one
anytime
pairs
very
well
with
chocolate
recommended
a
says
like
a
kiss
between
two
punches
to
the
face
we
disagreed
on
the
score
to
this
one
drinkability
very
nice
and
a
lot
of
fun
the
moderate
abv
and
wonderful
scents
and
flavors
make
for
a
very
enjoyable
experience
i
will
gladly
drink
this
one
again
and
may
even
get
another
to
put
up
for
a
while
and
see
how
it
does
with
a
bit
more
age
on
it
d
its
one
of
the
most
sour
brews
ive
ever
had
but
its
so
tasty
that
you
want
more
i
had
no
problem
enjoying
my
half
a
bottle
but
might
have
been
soured
out
if
i
had
the
whole
thing
this
is
a
fine
beer
all
around
it
is
very
sour
but
also
very
tart
with
a
good
underlying
sweetness
a
very
well
crafted
brew
d
the
high
acidity
makes
it
a
little
tougher
to
drink
than
other
sour
beers
but
it
has
really
great
fruit
flavors
a
surprisingly
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
a
bit
her
mouth
pull
back
quickly
leaving
me
nothing
but
the
hunger
for
more
ive
never
experienced
such
a
velvety
smooth
and
sensual
kiss
before
quickly
she
hurried
away
and
before
i
could
see
where
she
went
she
had
turned
a
corner
and
vanished
i
was
left
with
a
burning
pit
in
my
stomach
that
could
only
be
neutralized
with
her
not
my
favorite
lambic
but
not
bad
by
any
stretch
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
layered
and
complex
carb
could
have
used
a
bit
of
sprucing
up
too
not
quite
on
the
level
of
their
geuze
this
was
certainly
drank
in
classier
surroundings
than
my
first
hanssens
but
its
not
as
good
as
the
gueuze
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
complexity
of
that
beer
and
this
one
seems
a
touch
unbalanced
and
a
little
harsh
i
also
like
my
krieks
with
a
touch
less
sourness
and
a
touch
more
funk
its
certainly
a
slow
drinker
because
of
the
sourness
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
and
with
a
few
tweaks
i
think
it
can
be
phenomenal
d
i
take
my
time
with
good
lambics
and
i
spread
my
glass
over
a
hour
or
so
so
i
guess
this
one
is
good
now
i
need
to
find
some
more
great
stuff
that
im
surprised
i
have
not
tried
before
d
drinkability
is
good
for
a
beer
so
sour
requires
small
sips
to
appreciate
the
flavor
i
think
a
gulp
would
be
unpleasant
d
not
so
good
this
has
some
nice
elements
to
it
but
is
a
little
questionable
overall
both
aromas
and
flavors
are
more
gentle
and
slightly
edgier
than
older
bottles
the
cherries
are
more
pronounced
and
almost
have
a
candylike
character
its
less
acidic
and
less
funky
it
has
more
sweetness
to
it
due
to
the
bigger
cherry
flavors
i
preferred
the
older
bottle
since
it
was
more
complex
more
sour
and
all
in
all
more
interesting
this
one
has
great
flavor
but
the
sharpness
of
the
mouthfeel
would
keep
most
people
from
enjoying
it
in
abundance
m
d
tingling
carbonation
medium
bodied
with
a
puckering
dry
finish
giving
it
a
bit
of
a
dusty
feel
moments
after
finish
the
sour
qualities
make
it
a
sipping
brew
but
like
a
lemon
finish
with
that
mouthwatering
savoury
note
good
stuff
drinkability
is
good
very
funky
and
full
of
sour
cherry
character
very
palatable
with
a
nicely
concentrated
profile
cheers
d
fantastic
kriek
d
an
overall
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
there
are
better
lambics
out
there
wow
talk
about
tart
bought
this
one
at
the
bottle
shop
in
carlsbad
poured
a
nice
red
with
a
big
bubbly
head
that
quickly
dissipated
tart
as
tart
can
be
sour
cherries
leather
and
funk
come
through
in
about
that
order
this
is
by
far
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
ever
tried
love
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
was
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
one
of
this
style
on
cask
i
dont
necessarily
think
the
cask
makes
the
beer
taste
any
better
but
its
also
certainly
not
any
worse
its
just
different
and
worth
a
shot
md
light
body
carbonation
isnt
as
high
as
first
expected
helping
a
very
smooth
body
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
long
as
you
can
stand
the
tartness
d
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
than
i
was
expecting
to
something
id
like
to
treat
myself
to
once
in
a
while
i
doubt
that
i
could
have
another
one
the
sourness
felt
like
it
was
quickly
eroding
my
stomach
lining
and
teeth
a
wonderful
night
cap
but
unless
i
was
willing
to
wait
a
while
trying
something
else
wouldnt
have
worked
out
well
m
i
could
feel
the
sourness
it
had
a
good
weight
to
it

musty

like
a
basket

cherries
sitting
on
a
pile
of
straw
has
an
earthiness
to
it
as
well
wow
thats
sour
the
cherries
start
the
party
off
promising
a
sweetness
that
dives
down
underneath
the
sharp
applelike
sour
note
that
comes
on
oddly
enough
subsequent
sips
find
the
sourness
disappearing
rapidly
just
leaving
the
crispness
i
feel
like
ive
got
a
sourness
hangover
somehow
the
aftertaste
is
malty
and
pleasant
really
taking
the
edge
off
the
finish
really
really
remarkable
the
mouthfeel
is
slippery
and
light
but
not
watery
nice
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
really
great
particularly
for
such
a
sour
beer
a
very
very
nice
sour
lambic
drinkability
by
far
the
most
acidic
beverage
i
believe
ive
ever
come
across
fairly
tasty
but
its
a
real
gutwrencher
you
can
literally
feel
yourself
rotting
away
from
the
inside
due
to
your
newlyformed
bleeding
hanssens
ulcers
so
please
have
some
tums
handy
pours

brilliant

dies

a
slight

sour
some

mediumthin
body
dry
lingering
finish
this
is
indeed
a
world
class
kriek
that
deserves
repeated
indulgences
but
a
word
of
caution
i
naively
followed
it
up
with
a
rochefort
8
and
the
latter
was
not
its
usual
delicious
if
you
drink
this
make
it
the
last
thing
you
drink
for
the

and
smooth
slightly
creamy
even
with
a
good
cherry
taste
that
is
slightly
sour
and
sharp
due
to
carbonation
smooths
as
it
warms
although
abv
is
slightly
noticeable
as
you
take
your
time
hints
of
some
earthy
hops
in
there
as
well
and
cherry
gives
off
some
sweetness
but
mostly
this
is
a
more
dry
sour
beer
that
is
to
be
sipped
like
a
red
wine
perhaps
the
only
reason
my
grades
arent
higher
is
i
prefer
saisonfarmhouse
ale
kind
of
sweetness
over
a
dryness
thats
more
of
me
than
the
beer
this
beer
is
a
brownishcherry
color
with
a
modest
white
head
the
aroma
is
fantastic
lots
of
funky
brett
horse
earth
barnyard
and
yeast
i
love
it
some
acidic
scents
as
well
and
a
little
fruit
cherry
but
this
takes
a
backseat
to
the
funk
the
taste
is
tart
sour
actually
with
more
fruit
coming
out
in
the
midtaste
bone
dry
the
sourness
sets
the
stage
for
the
mouthfeel
very
puckering
some
carbonation
this
stuff
is
great
its
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
fruit
lambic
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
red
color
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
of
cherries
hints
of
nuts
and
a
significant
sourtartness
the
taste
is
very
sour
this
is
by
far
the
most
sour
fruit
lambic
i
have
tasted
there
are
still
some
tart
cherries
but
not
as
much
as
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
appropriately
low
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
overall
a
very
nice
sour
if
your
looking
for
a
traditional
belgian
kriek
this
one
will
most
certainly
not
dissapoint
a
fine
lambic
and
one
i
am
glad
to
be
putting
some
age
on
good
stuff
overall
wont
be
buying
or
trying
this
one
again
d
yep
a
sipper
invites
more
and
more
for
sure
75cl
bottle
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
almost
no
head
smells
immediately
of
brett
character
kind
of
cheesy
and
musty
some
sour
cherrycitrus
the
taste
is
predominately
though
far
from
overpoweringly
sour
with
some
funk
noticeable
sweetness
with
cherry
tastes
somewhat
artificial
some
earthy
woody
notes
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
not
a
fan
of
the
sweetness
d
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
overall
not
too
memorable
if
only
that
i
rarely
make
work
of
a
750
of
anything
but
cheap
champagne
drinkability
suffers
because
of
price
the
unmemorable
qualities
my
limited
shortterm
memory
retains
d
like
i
have
already
stated
this
beer
was
like
sticking
several
warheads
in
your
mouth
it
had
a
huge
sour
cherry
kick
that
really
made
this
beer
undrinkable
not
a
good
lambic
drinkability
this
is
a
slow
sipper
based
on
the
sour
cherries
and
overall
mouthfeel
one
glass
was
enough
in
a
session
despite
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer
even
with
the
solventlike
pinch
in
there
its
hard
to
stop
drinking
this
one
the
hand
just
keeps
going
back
to
the
glass
no
matter
what
that
said
i
think
the
carbonation
in
the
bottled
version
does
a
lot
to
soften
the
bite
of
this
one
which
seems
counter
intuitive
still
worthy
of
a
try
375
ml
green
champagne
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
not
that
it
matters
its
been
aged
for
three
years
before
being
released
and
ive
had
it
for
at
least
a
year
and
a
half
it
pours
into
the
flute
glass
an
auburntinged
amber
fairly
clear
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thin
lighttan
head
the
aroma
is
nice
and
sour
earthy
with
mouthwatering
sour
cherry
that
opens
my
nostrils
like
menthol
insanely
pungent
sour
cherries
pinch
my
salivary
glands
and
tingle
the
back
of
my
throat
on
the
way
down
there
are
hints
of
wildness
and
oak
that
blend
well
with
the
extreme
acidity
and
little
if
any
residual
sweetness
the
body
is
light
and
tingly
dry
and
puckering
yet
its
crazy
drinkable
but
only
a
sip
at
a
time
a
delicious
kriek
that
any
fan
of
sour
ales
needs
to
seek
out
another
fine
artisan
ale
from
this
belgian
brewery
pours
a
redwood
color
with
a
silky
tan
head
the
nose
has
tart
cherries
sweet
malts
oak
and
funk
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
between
oak
manure
sour
funk
and
sweet
cherries
crisp
body
drinks
well
pairs
well
with
a
fish
and
game
a
little
too
tart
for
a
kriek
i

overall
ive
had
krieks
before
that
i
thought
were
too
sour
for
my
taste
but
this
one
is
so
acidic
it
could
probably
put
a
hole
through
your
skin
i
couldnt
tolerate
more
than
a
couple
sips
d
wow
i
split
the
750
but
could
have
easily
drank
it
by
myself
this
brewery
does
not
fuck
around
when
it
comes
to
sour
or
tart
i
gave
the
gueze
to
my
dad
and
he
nearly
threw
up
and
thought
i
played
a
joke
on
him
the
breweries
air
has
more
bugs
in
it
than
a
stray
dog
worth
trying
good
drop
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
cherry
ruby
red
with
thin
pink
head
that
quickly
dissipates
funky
sour
aroma
with
sweet
cherry
juice
cherries
and
syrup
very
puckering
and
vinuous
sweet
cherry
syrup
flavor
that
stays
sour
throughout
with
a
very
dry
and
way
too
acidic
finish
drinkability
would
be
a
5
if
i
could
get
this
locally
i
was
expecting
as
delicious
cherry
lambic
i
wasnt
dissapointed
it
was
more
acidic
than
expected

possible

thanks
nathan
a
wonderful
beer
in
my
opinion
would
be
perfect
with
a
vinaigrette
salad
or
desert
course
luckily
the
meal
that
i
had
it
with
rabbit
in
a
nice
wine
reduction
was
an
excellent
pairing
that
made
the
beer
tolerable
a
musttry
but
be
sure
to
have
it
with
good
food
although
im
not
very
well
traveled
when
it
comes
to
lambics
this
is
without
a
doubt
an
enjoyable
drinker
whether
this
is
a
world

cherry
lambic
i
have
yet
to
see

should
be
an
enjoyable
one
pours
a
foggy
reddish
hue
no
head
nose
is
antiseptic
and
funky
like
i
want
the
lambics
to
be
ahhhh
pure
heaven
its
been
too
long
since
i
have
had
a
lambic
oh
how
i
have
missed
thee
my
love
mildly
sour
but
not
overpowering
the
fruit
tones
caress
the
tongue
beautiful
earthy
tones
feel
is
very
very
smooth
fairly
full
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
well
bodied
like
i
said
its
been
some
time
since
i
have
had
a
lambic
now
i
remember
why
i
love
them
so
much
actually
i
never
really
forgot
how
could
i
have
upfront
taste
is
very
sour
and
tart
with
a
surprising
hint
just
a
hint
of
cherry
sweetness
way
at
the
back
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
carbonation
prickling
at
the
tongueso
amazing
it
really
is
incredible
that
this
is
beer
drinkability
is
goodthe
beer
actually
makes
my
mouth
water
and
want
more
its
a
shame
there
was
only
one
375
ml
bottle
oh
well
maybe
i
will
get
another
one
at
abes
for
just
over
four
bucks
a
steal
at
that
price
simply
amazing
prefer
this
over
the
geuze
which
can
get
overpoweringly
sour
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
with
little
to
no
head
strong
sour
aroma
of
predictably
cherries
with
farmhouse
hay
and
wood
crisp
nice
sour
in
the
mouth
finishes
very
tart
on
the
tongue
nice
and
clean
i
really
appreciate
the
strength
of
the
tartness
an
excellent
sample
not
exactly
a
session
beer
but
a
very
flavorful
tart
lambic
one
to
be
had
many
times
enjoyed
this
beer
at
hop
haus
in
chicago
very
traditional
lambic
pours
a
crimson
hue
somewhat
gritty
but
typical
of
the
style
very
sour
but
still
had
an
easy
drinkability
for
those
of
us
out
there
that
truely
admire
and
enjoy
the
puckering
ability
of
this
style
this
was
my
first
experience
with
this
kriek
and
i
was
extremely
pleasantly
surprised
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
beer
again
and
will
consciously
seek
it
out
for
at
least
a
great
start
or
finish
to
a
tasting
night
drinkability
very
good
for
me
but
near
impossible
for
others
i
would
rate
this
drinkability
higher
than
most
hopefully
the
abv
wouldnt
be
too
overpowering
i
found
it
quite
soothing
poured
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
an
opaque
red
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
tart
the
taste
is
complex
with
a
tart
green
apple
flavor
a
vinegery
sourness
and
a
cherry
sweetness
all
present
yet
somehow
blending
together
into
a
very
interesting
whole
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
light
this
tastes
like
a
combination
of
a
fruit
beer
and
a
flemish
sour
ale
drinkeability
depends
on
how
much
one
appreciates
sourness
in
a
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
pitcher
of
it
but
by
the
glass
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
delicious
another
winner
of
a
traditional
lambic
this
and
cantillon
are
the
only
traditional
fruit
lambics
ive
had
and
theyre
both
similar
with
their
intense
sour
flavors
cantillon
may
have
the
slight
edge
on
this
one
in
a
couple
of
categories
but
theyre
both
great
if
youre
a
fan
of
traditional
lambics
definitely
seek
this
one
out
recommended
only
better
when
dug
out
of
the
cellars
surrounding
brussels
with
a
meal
from
a
local
cafe
brought
a
750
ml
bottle
to
a
friends
house
to
have
with
dessert
after
a
bbq
the
homeowners
were
novices
to
lambics
so
i
was
interested
to
gauge
their
response
split
the
bottle
four
ways
into
white
wine
glasses
it
had
an
earthy
cherry
and
sour
smell
once
i
popped
the
cork
it
poured
a
hazy
red
into
the
glasses
the
taste
was
very
tart
at
first
since
i
was
expecting
a
bit
of
mellowness
since
this
was
a
3
year
aged
bottle
once
it
warmed
up
some
the
tartness
grew
on
me
i
think
the
rookies
took
a
liking
to
it
and
i
was
glad
to
introduce
them
to
a
new
style
of
beer
overall
it
was
a
decent
example
of
an
oude
kriek
at
a
pretty
good
price

for

tarty
funk
poured
into
a
red

cup
and
enjoyed
quickly
really
the
only
issue
is
the
price
point
otherwise
this
is
a
really
good
sour
this
is
tolerable
upon
the
first
few
sips
but
towards
the
middle
and
end
its
absolutely
intolerable
cheese
funk
not
the
good
kind
you
look
for
in
a
sour
and
razor
thin
zero
body
certainly
has
the
strong
sour
followthrough
but
its
not
enough
to
save
this
one
too
many
offputting
flavors
o
i
like
this
though
i
can
see
why
it
has
such
a
discrepancy
in
scores
definitely
not
for
everyone
and
given
the
price
not
sure
how
readily
id
get
it
again
definitely
worth
a
try
o
slightly
disappointed
mainly
from
the
carbonation
when
it
comes
to
belgian
sours
hanssens
is
the
only
one
to
show
up
in
casper
and
i
am
thankful
for
that
i
always
enjoy
hanssens
but
at
the
same
time
always
feel
they
are
not
in
the
same
league
as
some
of
the
other
true
lambic
makers
they
certainly
are
incredibly
funky
and
cheesy
more
so
than
i
recall
with
examples
from
other
breweries
still
something
i
do
enjoy
a
solid
if
not
exceptional
take
on
the
style
raspberries
are
there
with
a
nice
pop
of
citrus
fairly
tart
with
a
light
souring
doesnt
seem
like
much
funk
behind
it
more
of
a
showcase
of
tart
and
fruit
this
is
from
a
bottle
that
is
true
years
old
and
i
think
the
quality
has
been
compromised
poured
with
no
head
nor
lace
and
a
clear
amber
aroma
is
yeast
tart
raspberries
flavors
like
aroma
acid
is
strong
raspberries
come
in
slightly
dry
with
missing
carbonation
cant
really
give
a
fair
judgment
on
body
actually
not
too
bad
for
its
condition
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
no
carbonation
leading
to
a
completely
smooth
mouthfeel
that
would
be
strongly
benefitted
by
some
modest
foam
helping
to
move
this
along
the
palate
closes
very
dry
as
expected
with
light
stickiness
clinging
to
the
lips
and
palate
lovely
lambic
here
and
an
expert
use
of
raspberry
although
its
not
as
forward
or
nearly
as
clean
as
some
of
their
other
fruited
beers
lots
of
residual
sugar
in
this
one
but
the
fruit
profile
is
very
forward
crashing
into
the
lambic
tartness
at
full
speed
creating
a
unique
drinking
experience
that
is
both
summery
and
sweet
but
also
sour
as
anything
but
finishing
a
little
longer
than
its
brothers
the
nose
is
the
best
part
as
the
berries
fade
out
a
little
towards
the
end
the
carbonation
is
less
than
it
could
be
here
and
the
body
is
a
little
fuller
than
the
others
as
well
the
berries
also
dont
stain
this
very
much
red
so
its
smell
and
taste
come
from
nowhere
the
looks
could
foreshadow
like
all
beers
from
hanssens
this
is
well
made
i
just
like
it
a
little
less
than
the
black
currant
version
if
it
wasnt
for
the
cost
i
would
drink
these
a
lot
more
frequently
hmmm
poured
with
literally
no
carbonation
looks
more
like
juice
than
beer
smells
of
raspberries
and
tartness
sadly
this
was
a
letdown
with
no
carbonation
this
drinks
like
tart
raspberry
juice
not
sure
what
happened
here
but
it
is
a
huge
disappointment
not
worth
the
15
bucks
for
the
375ml
carbonationless
bottle
m
lighter
side
of
medium
overall
this
was
interesting
fun
to
try
but
just
overpoweringly
tart
o
a
very
enjoyable
lambic
the
fruit
is
not
as
present
as
found
in
other
hanssens
varieties
such
as
their
kreiks
but
holds
its
own
in
the
sour
department
low
b
o
this
one
started
out
okay
but
in
the
end
this
was
quite
a
misfire
overall
id
like
it
much
better
with
some
bubbles
and
realize
flat
is
appropriate
for
the
style
its
quite
pricey
at
15
per
12oz
and
not
really
worth
it
to
me
o
i
dont
understand
the
kriek
is
so
good
idk
what
happened
here
total
drain
pour
couldnt
finish
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
a
complete
mess
how
they
even
released
this
and
it
has
a
13
price
tag
it
should
come
with
a
warning
sign
saying
tear
your
money
up
now
a
little
upset
on
this
one
do
not
buy
o
a
decent
sour
but
not
exceptional
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodies
brew
that
is
still
the
color
of
this
brew
is
borederline
fake
and
surreal
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
and
while
a
bit
harsh
for
me
the
taste
was
pretty
good
as
well
i
am
thankful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
it
and
appreciate
that
ed
i
would
not
be
able
to
take
a
bottle
of
this
down
myself
though
o
i
liked
the
raspberry
flavors
going
on
here
but
the
sourness
is
just
too
intense
like
drinking
a
bottle
of
the
stuff
they
coat
warheads
in
i
cant
call
this
a
great
lambic
but
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
in
a
perverse
way
o
i
liked
it
more
than
shane
who
dumped
his
glass
but
it
was
a
struggle
to
get
through
would
try
it
again
if
hanssens
bottles
werent
so
expensive
o
this
was
an
interesting
experiment
but
it
wasnt
worth
what
i
paid
for
the
bottle
id
say
grab
this
if
you
like
really
sour
beers
but
if
you
like
good
ones
you
can
steer
clear
matt
and
i
went
into
this
beer
with
an
open
mind
despite
the
less
than
stellar
reviews
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
destroyed
what
could
have
been
an
ok
fruit
lambic
im
quite
glad
this
was
just
an
experiment
not
recommended
drain
poured
cheers
o
a
nice
sour
with
a
great
tartness
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
would
be
good
on
a
nice
summer
day
o
i
heard
that
this
one
might
be
a
bit
of
a
letdown
and
boy
was
it
dead
from
the
start
way
too
much
vinegar
flavor
at
14
a
375ml
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
o
nice
sour
ale
not
the
most
complex
but
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
lambics
are
traditionally
uncarbonated
o
im
taking
the
kid
gloves
off
here
this
is
a
terrible
beer
its
lacking
carbonation
its
totally
freaking
overpriced
at
17
per
bottle
what
a
complete
waste
of
money
drain
pour
poured
into
a
stone
brewery
flute
pours
a
bright
orange
amber
absolutely
no
carbonation
or
head
aroma
of
sour
fruit
and
light
vinegar
taste
follows
sour
raspberry
juice
and
mild
funk
finishes
sour
and
acidic
thin
to
moderate
body
and
slight
mouthfeel
due
to
lack
of
carbonation
not
very
complex
a
straightforward
sour
fruit
lambic
certainly
quite
a
sour
one
this
is
on
par
with
fou
foune
sour
and
very
fruity
even
though
the
raspberry
character
is
almost
nonexistent
big
ups
to
matt
for
leaving
this
one
behind
o
this
beer
is
very
interesting
but
the
sourness
is
a
big
punch
in
your
face
if
youre
not
sure
if
youll
like
sour
beers
this
is
definitely
not
an
entrylevel
beer
to
start
with
pairing
this
with
salty
food
such
as
pretzels
helps
to
cut
through
the
acidity
o
hey
its
no
riserva
2010
but
damn
is
this
beer
sour
acidic
to
the
max
theres
a
good
bacteria
involvement
and
bold
funk
but
little
beyond
that
to
make
the
price
tag
worth
it
o
overall
a
decent
lambic
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurts
it
in
my
opinion
lots
of
raspberries
in
the
nose
as
intended
but
the
taste
seems
a
tiny
bit
muted
and
odd
not
as
good
as
their
normal
kriek
or
gueuze
and
given
the
price
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
when
those
are
cheaper
sour
and
puckering
tartness
with
some
barnyard
aged
raspberries
pretty
delicious
and
drinkable
if
not
otherworldly
drinkability
and
overall
impression
given
the
aggressive
vinegar
character
of
this
beer
it
is
a
slow
sipper
and
one
to
have
with
food
or
spend
a
good
amount
of
time
slowly
sipping
so
as
to
pick
up
the
raspberry
and
other
flavors
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
take
no
prisoners
fruit
lambic
which
one
will
either
like
or
intensely
dislike
while
id
prefer
a
bit
more
of
the
raspberry
to
show
up
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
i
come
down
on
the
side
of
like
overall
impression
great
sour
this
is
my
second
brew
from
hanssens
and
a
big
fan
go
for
this
one
if
available
and
you
enjoy
lambics
w
fruit
added
in
cheers
o
had
to
drain
pour
this
as
it
nearly
made
me
throw
up
back
to
the
drawing
board
leaves
a
strong
flavor
of
lactic
sourness
and
raspberries
overall
im
not
liking
this
one
too
much
yeah
its
very
sour
but
that
isnt
everything
a
litttle
more
flavor
less
burning
and
some
carbonation
would
go
a
long
way
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
pretty
nice
looking
dark
pink
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
it
almost
looks
like
a
slightly
carbonated
blush
wine
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
super
acidic
with
a
little
fruitiness
in
there
as
well
the
taste
of
this
is
super
tart
its
got
the
acidic
bitterness
like
most
gueze
lambics
do
there
is
a
semi
sweet
raspberry
flavor
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
is
smooth
and
dry
overall
its
a
pretty
impressive
brew
cant
say
id
buy
it
again
because
its
not
really
much
style
but
having
tried
it
it
was
nice
to
try
it
has
medium
body
with
no
carb
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
just
wish
it
had
some
carbonation
would
definitely
change
the
review
o
not
a
good
beer
saw
this
on
the
shelf
and
thought
about
picking
one
up
glad
i
didnt
this
is
a
nice
experiment
i
like
the
way
the
oak
and
raspberries
mesh
the
flavor
is
interesting
and
will
appeal
to
sour
lovers
bottle
poured
a
reddish
color
lambic
with
almost
no
carbonation
or
foamy
head
aroma
of
sour
raspberry
with
light
notes
of
sweetness
with
medium
barnyard
notes
is
interesting
and
not
as
extreme
as
the
cassis
version
taste
is
a
refreshing
mix
between
some
tart
raspberry
notes
with
balanced
sourness
and
some
barnyard
notes
body
is
about
average
with
almost
no
carbonation
which
was
expected
this
one
is
drinking
very
nice
with
a
lot
more
balanced
then
the
cassis
version
d
not
an
incredibly
drinkable
lambic
bit
one
that
you
will
be
glad
to
have
tried
o
somewhat
disappointing
liked
their
oude
kriek
a
lot
has
a
lot
of
sourtart
notes
but
not
a
lot
of
distinguisable
fruit
notes
o
this
is
something
id
like
to
try
again
and
i
think
ill
grab
a
couple
to
age
this
is
probably
the
best
raspberry
lambic
that
i
have
had
check
this
one
out
it
seems
khazadum
picked
up
on
the
fact
that
im
slowly
trying
to
break
into
sours
and
he
kicked
my
ass
off
the
cliff
in
that
regard
so
far
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
very
unique
and
it
will
be
quite
hard
for
some
to
appreciate
these
wonderful
characteristics
overall
if
this
is
an
experiment
it
is
more
interesting
than
the
various
other
commercial
fruit
lambics
that
are
sweet
and
use
fruit
syrups
but
it
is
not
up
to
par
with
other
artisanal
versions
being
too
acidicbordering
on
vinegar
actually
o
nothing
horrible
but
not
really
exciting
either
hanssens
makes
an
incredible
gueuze
and
kriek
so
its
surprising
this
falls
so
flat
o
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
expected
it
to
have
some
raspberry
flavor
but
instead
it
leans
on
the
sour
lambic
style
to
pass
itself
off
o
you
know
i
didnt
like
the
flat
strawberry
lambic
but
this
one
is
better
in
my
opinion
before
i
popped
the
cork
i
told
myself
id
run
to
grab
another
one
tomorrow
to
leave
it
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
but
i
dont
know
thats
gonna
happen
nonetheless
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
experience
as
i
do
with
most
sour
beers
update
i
have
since
tried
hanssens
oude
gueuze
which
i
have
found
to
be
the
best
lambic
i
have
ever
tried
has
the
funk
of
a
well
aged
lambic
without
sacrificing
the
fruit
which
usually
fades
tremendously
after
age
sufficient
to
bring
out
the
wild
notes
present
here
though
the
oak
introduces
further
vinuous
qualities
which
interfere
with
the
pure
flavors
of
a
more
traditional
framboise
not
cheap
but
worth
trying
375ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
redpink
color
with
no

looks
almost
like
juice
aroma
is
raspberry
some
funk
and
wood
taste
follows
suit
but
with
a
little
more
sweetness
and
as
the
beer
warms
becomes
much
more
sour
and
quite
vinegary
thin
to
medium
bodied
finish
is
dry
not
quite
the
beer
i
expected
but
it
is
tasty
bottle
cork
comes
off
with
a
very
muted
pop
sign
of
things
to
come
poured
into
a
great
lakes
tulip
glass
a
rosy
pink
color
with
absolutely
no
head
booo
slightly
sweet
raspberry
in
the
nose
along
with
some
underlying
barnyard
funk
light
mouthfeel
hmm
the
carbonation
level
is
a
serious
downfall
on
this
one
mildly
sour
with
some
underlying
raspberry
notes
vinegar
ending
md
mouthfeel
is
harsh
and
biting
with
nothing
to
really
enjoy
with
little
carbonation
you
want
to
get
it
out
of
your
mouth
as
fast
as
possible
not
very
drinkable
dvery
drinkable
taste
was
gone
in
no
time
quite
intense
and
interesting
it
indeed
tasted
very
very
tart
i
wish
there
was
more
raspberry
taste
to
this
this
could
be
very
young
and
not
ready
to
drink
not
a
fan
of
this
and
would
want
to
try
this
again
if
it
was
aged
for
a
little
while
d
i
like
sour
beers
really
sour
beers
too
but
this
was
a
lot
to
ask
of
someone
im
still
afraid
to
try
the
new
batch
d
a
solid
slightly
better
than
middleoftheroad
fruit
lambic
here
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
and
besides
the
color
of
the
beer
its
not
much
to
actually
look
at
but
the
feel
is
impressive
and
it
has
potential
to
develop
in
my
opinion
worth
revisiting
at
some
point
with
some
age
on
it
im
not
super
well
versed
in
lambics
but
ive
had
a
few
and
i
find
this
one
really
tough
to
drink
this
one
was
actually
pretty
enjoyable
a
nice
fruity
one
that
gives
a
good
relatively
clean
tartness
drinkability
is
only
as
good
as
the
availability
of
this
beer
given
the
other
reviews
i
was
a
little
concerned
about
this
beer
and
when
i
poured
the
beer
i
got
really
nervous
however
the
smell
and
taste
was
quite
good
there
are
many
other
beers
of
this
style
i
enjoy
more
so
i
probably
will
not
seek
this
beer
out
again
but
it
was
a
good
one
off
poured
a
pinkish
bubbly
brown
in
color
with
brown
highlights
that
had
a
very
thin
head
and
left
almost
no
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
there
was
definitely
some
raspberries
in
the
aroma
with
bretty
barrel
oaky
funk
lemony
citrus
and
faint
vinegar
notes
however
it
did
have
acidic
character
the
raspberries
were
more
apparent
on
the
palate
with
mild
tart
flavors
but
did
come
with
oaky
brett
funky
accents
and
a
touch
of
lemony
citrus
notes
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
oaky
funky
citrusy
fruity
tart
and
dry
finish
i
really
like
my
sour
beers
but
this
one
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
up
front
and
was
lacking
the
sour
punch
it
still
drank
good
and
was
a
decent
fruit
lambic
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
sour
overall
and
highlights
the
raspberry
well
its
not
very
complex
and
the
fact
that
there
is
no
carbonation
really
detracts
from
the
otherwise
well
put
together
brew
dthis
is
watery
and
lacking
any
carbonation
the
nose
was
alright
but
the
flavor
is
much
lacking
overall
a
really
big
disappointment
for
me
the
carbonation
really
is
the
death
knell
not
a
bad
beer
otherwise
but
something
ill
avoid
at
this
pricetag
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
you
just
cant
overstate
the
sourness
this
is
the
only
sour
beer
to
have
ever
given
me
slight
heartburn
d
so
disappointing
had
high
hopes
and
wanted
to
like
this
thought
it
might
be
a
bad
bottle
but
scanning
other
reviews
it
seems
like
they
are
all
flat
never
had
a
lambic
that
was
flat
or
even
less
than
extremely
lively
and
highly
carbonated
hope
i
dont
again
either
flavor
isnt
bad
but
would
improve
tremendously
with
some
fizz
to
it
this
is
exceedingly
quaffable
and
the
mid
50f
serving
temperature
was
about
perfect
i
would
like
to
see
a
carbonated
framboise
version
of
this
beer
as
i
think
the
fizz
would
add
a
nice
complimentary
texture
and
would
likely
boost
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
this
could
certainly
use
some
more
funkiness
i
do
like
the
light
touch
of
the
acetic
character
it
is
just
barely
there
but
some
more
wild
funkiness
would
be
much
appreciate
still
this
is
a
beer
that
grows
on
me
more
as
i
work
my
way
through
my
glass
thanks
alex
pours
a
bright
clear
watermelon
color
with
almost
no
head
or
lacing
smell
is
raspberry
and
a
good
amount
of
lactic
sourness
taste
brings
good
raspberry
flavor
oddly
sourness
doesnt
come
until
the
swallow
leads
to
an
odd
mouthfeel
strong
drinkability
given
the
fairly
muted
flavors
d
a
little
hard
to
drink
being
flat
and
all
but
for
the
traditional
still
lambic
style
i
think
this
is
fairly
average
not
quite
a
boon
lambiek
but
pretty
good
a
bottle
shared
by
alex
pours
an
ugly
watery
light
raspberry
not
very
appleaing
but
maybe
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
light
raspberriesgeneric
a
little
sourness
and
a
little
vinegar
just
not
much
to
excite
me
this
taste
is
god
awful
its
super
generic
sweet
raspberries
that
is
flat
this
beer
is
terrible
an
experiment
gone
way
awry
very
still
so
no
head
sits
on
top
of
the
fairly
clear
raspberry
red
nose
is
sour
tart
acid
that
comes
off
to
me
as
lemon
and
raspberry
with
a
touch
of
wild
and
a
touch
of
wood
wish
i
could
wait
a
few
years
to
drink
this
one
the
wild
is
just
coming
out
and
the
barn
and
funk
arent
quite
pronounced
enough
for
me
yet
taste
is
very
tart
with
ripefruit
sweetness
which
i
imagine
would
be
eaten
up
with
some
aging
holding
it
together
and
rounding
it
out
nice
slick
light
soft
mouthfeel
with
a
long
finish
and
no
unpleasant
aftertastes
really
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
think
its
mindblowingly
good
nonetheless
if
only
these
beers
were
easier
to
come
by
my
favorite
lambic
producer
right
now
d
not
so
easy
drinking
even
with
the
thin
body
a
little
life
might
of
spiked
this
up
for
me
its
good
just
a
bit
one
sided
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
not
too
bad
a
touch
overly
acidic
but
the
raspberry
is
nice
thanks
rob
yowza
im
a
fan
but
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
too
much
more
of
than
this
one
bottle
d
well
a
few
onces
is
plenty
to
get
the
idea
and
a
few
more
will
change
your
life
wild
stuff
and
a
hell
of
an
experience
notes
a
solidly
crafted
framboise
thats
super
acidic
this
is
lively
despite
its
lack
of
co2
like
unsweetened
lemonade
refreshing
but
intense
this
is
easily
the
worst
lambic
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
as
bad
as
some
of
my
fellow
bas
present
at
the
tasting
think
it
is
worth
drinking
if
only
to
allow
oneself
to
better
appreciate
the
really
good
lambics
d
this
is
to
say
the
least
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
acidity
is
over
the
top
and
makes
the
beer
pretty
difficult
to
drink
i
like
sour
beers
but
this
is
the
first
one
that
ever
burned
my
throat
the
acidity
is
so
intense
that
it
makes
it
difficult
to
appreciate
the
complexity
of
the
bugs
and
fruit
nonetheless
the
aroma
is
absolutely
spectacular
it
blends
complex
funk
with
fruit
and
a
nice
woody
character
that
makes
it
reminiscent
of
flemish
beer
or
a
good
red
wine
sadly
it
just
doesnt
work
as
a
whole
while
it
is
as
deliciously
aromatic
as
any
wild
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
crushing
acidity
and
lack
of
carbonation
make
it
almost
impossible
to
drink
im
glad
this
was
only
a
375ml
bottle
i
couldnt
have
finished
a
750
actually
im
not
sure
i
can
even
finish
this
d
the
acid
is
so
over
the
top
in
this
beer
that
it
can
really
be
no
more
than
a
sipper
this
is
basically
the
bizarro
lindemans
framboise
its
complete
opposite
expensive
but
split
it
between
3
people
because
46
oz
is
really
all
you
need
i
could
feel
it
in
my
chest
for
a
while
after
drinking
the
375
and
im
an
acid
hound
im
used
to
this
while
i
wouldnt
say
its
brother
the
cassis
is
a
truly
better
beer
its
certainly
the
more
drinkable
of
the
two
this
beer
is
an
experience
and
will
test
you
so
its
definitely
worth
a
try
once
way
too
much
sour
funk
acidity
for
me
d
um
i
really
liked
it
not
easy
to
drink
but
enjoyable
nevertheless
really
interesting
strap
yourself
in
though
not
for
everyone
hell
not
for
most
im
diggin
it
though
very
harsh
extremely
tartsour
mouth
puckering
vinegary
mouthfeel
its
sweet
at
the
same
time
with
a
crazy
funky
earthy
burnt
wood
flavor
this
beer
has
so
many
extreme
flavors
whether
it
be
tart
chemical
burnt
wood
acidic
sweet
raspberry
a
bit
too
much
and
over
the
top
i
really
like
hanssens
but
this
beer
is
too
much
i
can
feel
my
esophagus
burning
from
the
acidity
and
it
really
hurts
the
scoring
the
dry
tart
extremely
mouth
puckering
aftertaste
is
actually
pretty
good
and
is
the
best
characteristic
of
this
beer
the
sourness
is
kind
of
mouthwatering
leaving
me
intrigued
for
another
sip
unfortunately
when
i
take
that
next
sip
all
of
the
unpleasantness
comes
back
overall
this
beer
is
too
fing
sour
and
funky
its
alright
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
wouldnt
want
to
get
this
again
the
flavor
is
tart
harsh
solventy
and
acetic
to
the
point
of
churning
my
stomach
and
doing
permanent
damage
to
my
throat
so
much
vinegar
its
like
candy
vinegar
what
have
you
done
hanssens
the
pour
is
flat
raspberry
red
with
absolutely
no
head
and
no
lace
the
color
is
quite
gorgeous
though
as
for
the
nose
holy
shit
medicinal
hot
and
solventy
with
some
sour
raspberry
character
completely
devoid
of
the
funk
ive
come
to
expect
from
hanssens
this
is
super
aggressive
and
harsh
the
palate
is
no
better
opening
pleasant
with
some
raspberry
but
this
is
rapidly
overcome
by
a
harsh
solventy
medicinal
character
with
some
nail
polish
remover
quite
acetic
this
is
rather
like
raspberry
vinaigrette
finishing
dry
and
sour
this
burns
a
hole
in
my
stomach
medium
in
body
with
no
carbonation
the
feel
is
quite
appropriate
but
the
harshness
is
more
than
i
can
take
this
is
rather
undrinkable
hanssens
experimental
lambics
are
both
of
good
quality
the
raspberry
is
super
expressive
with
the
fruitiness
and
has
a
strong
backbone
of
balsamic
vinegar
i
could
easily
see
myself
picking
more
of
these
up
in
the
future
if
they
make
it
back
to
chicago
d
a
rather
bracing
lambic
for
sure
if
you
like
sour
and
acidic
then
this
is
for
you
vinous
also
very
tart
and
vinegary
it
puckers
the
cheeks
and
is
felt
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
raspberry
and
a
tidal
wave
of
vinegar
sourness
the
drinkability
takes
a
slight
hit
and
it
could
definitely
use
a
few
bubbles
though
unblended
lambic
is
traditionally
flat
which
this
is
otherwise
its
interesting
to
try
and
ill
be
looking
for
future
incarnations
down
the
road
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
and
boldness
of
this
sour
keeps
it
from
scoring
higher
you
will
not
forget
this
beer
edit
upon
trying
this
beer
a
second
time
ive
had
to
update
my
score
and
note
that
this
beer
is
actually
painful
to
drink
it
feels
like
its
eating
my
esophagus
and
trying
to
burn
its
way
out
of
my
stomach
acidic
isnt
even
a
fair
descriptor
this
beer
is
a
true
lost
soul
fantastic
dry
tartness
paired
with
sunny
stingy
fresh
strawberries
leading
to
a
chewy
mouthfeel
with
an
enormous
sour
aftertaste
which
leaves
the
palate
slightly
dazed
but
very
satisfied
this
is
simply
not
my
style
and
that
is
why
this
beer
getting
such
a
low
rating
had
it
and
now
trying
to
forget
it
mouthfeel
was
alright
although
completely
flat
the
flavor
follows
with
the
green
apple
but
is
not
as
tart
the
vinegar
and
funk
follow
through
the
beer
has
decent
complexities
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
on
this
flat
beer
was
an
issue
niet
mijn
ding
echt
wel
zoet
en
de
geur
is
niet
aangenaam
definitely
notes
of
strawberry
and
sour
lacto
pretty
awesome
flavor
nice
nose
great
color
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
while
this
beer
isnt
quite
as
refined
and
flavorful
as
some
of
hanssens
other
offerings
it
is
solid
and
drinkable
an
odd
lambic
good
carbonation
and
clarity
no
head
just
a
small
film
golden
and
light
rose
color
smell
is
funky
with
hints
of
berry
not
a
deep
great
funky
mouthfeel
does
not
get
dry
more
like
a
wine
taste
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
a
little
it
of
tart
but
nothing
special
overall
flavor
leaves
you
wanting
something
better
would
not
recommend
a
first
try
for
me
this
lambic
was
incredibly
interesting
right
when
i
popped
it
open
a
wafted
aroma
of
funk
and
musty
lust
braised
my
snout
as
it
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
arranged
itself
into
a
nice
murky
hazy
reddishorangishslightlybrownish
hue
i
examined
its
innards
and
saw
a
little
bit
of
what
looked
like
strawberry
seeds
floating
as
i
brought
the
glass
to
my
lips
that
musty
aroma
i
first
smelt
became
strong
with
force
it
tickled
the
inside
of
my
nose
and
i
could
almost
taste
the
concoction
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
the
first
sip
just
about
made
me
cough
in
a
good
exciting
way
the
first
flavor
i
noticed
was
a
green
olive
acidic
vinegarish
taste
i
was
oddly
intrigued
by
this
as
i
usually
discern
these
flavors
in
my
beer
but
i
liked
it
as
i
got
through
and
through
this
bottle
those
strawberry
notes
became
more
apparent
and
by
the
end
my
throat
was
scorched
my
palate
was
wrecked
and
i
was
internally
satisfied
i
even
let
my
room
mate
try
a
sip
who
does
not
drink
craft
beer
regularly
and
it
almost
made
him
throw
up
overall
definitely
a
solid
lambic
but
i
actually
think
it
would
benefit
from
being
a
little
less
sour
this
is
not
something
i
saytype
often
the
intense
sourness
overtakes
some
of
the
berry
nice
berry
and
funk
character
thats
going
on
underneath
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
find
it
around
10
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
lambic
style
as
most
fruit
lambics
either
stick
to
some
old
standbyscherries
raspberries
blackberries
etc
or
they
are
sugary
sweet
messes
a
la
lindemans
im
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
particular
hanssens
again
but
this
is
another
beer
that
shows
that
they
seem
to
know
their
way
around
a
sour
beer
or
three
this
is
a
fantastic
fruit
lambic
the
notes
are
numbered
but
theyre
fascinating
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
is
very
simple
light
nothing
harsh
nothing
lasting
o
this
is
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
as
it
is
quite
sour
and
pretty
much
lacks
any
carbonation
to
speak
of
i
would
only
recommend
this
beer
to
folks
that
really
enjoy
their
sours
not
for
the
novice
to
the
style
o
got
the
strawberry
notes
in
the
nose
but
flavor
was
lacking
this
might
have
helped
with
the
strong
cheese
and
funk
notes
o
the
strawberry
aromaflavor
here
is
really
nice
but
its
a
very
sour
beer
thats
flat
this
kind
of
bracing
acidity
needs
carbonation
to
carry
it
like
nothing
else
on
the
market
one
of
the
best
uses
of
strawberries
i
have
ever
come
across
pours
dense
and
golden
pushing
brassy
with
some
more
sediment
as
the
bottle
gets
low
literally
no
head
or
bubbles
at
all
completely
still
not
totally
appealing
to
be
honest
but
i
trust
its
sourness
right
away
as
soon
as
the
cork
is
off
this
beer
starts
emitting
tartness
and
funky
sour
all
over
the
shop
i
can
smell
it
in
my
jawline
a
mouthwatering
brew
here
with
unripe
fruit
and
lacto
notes
as
well
as
some
oak
complex
and
just
so
damn
sour
consecration
style
the
taste
comes
in
two
waves
the
first
is
a
berry
but
not
specifically
strawberry
tartness
fresh
and
addicting
sour
of
course
but
not
as
pucker
as
the
nose
some
wheat
malt
and
long
fermentation
characteristics
are
evident
as
well
as
an
acidity
that
is
quite
intense
the
second
wave
after
a
second
or
so
pause
is
a
full
bore
watery
mouth
salivation
and
drool
from
the
sourness
finally
catches
up
with
me
its
about
as
much
as
my
palate
can
handle
like
strawberries
that
are
still
pink
and
white
although
if
i
didnt
know
it
im
not
sure
i
would
have
been
able
to
say
strawberry
specifically
i
hate
that
its
still
though
it
needs
bubbles
to
percolate
this
into
my
palate
and
its
obviously
missing
it
needs
to
move
and
it
stagnates
still
the
acidity
is
enough
to
make
it
finish
quickly
and
drink
easy
enough
one
of
the
more
sour
beers
ive
had
and
a
great
use
of
fresh
fruit
expensive
but
worth
it
to
try
b
o
i
prefer
cherry
lambics
but
this
was
tasty
and
interesting
overall
a
bit
too
moldy
and
funky
on
the
nose
for
me
but
the
flavor
was
much
more
balanced
and
included
more
of
the
tartness
and
acidity
that
i
tend
to
enjoy
enjoyable
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
though
a
little
more
cabonation
is
needed
to
make
this
one
worth
while
ill
try
another
batch
but
will
pass
on
this
one
for
now
pretty
good
the
strawberry
may
be
one
of
my
least
favorite
fruits
used
in
lambic
but
its
interesting
and
different
i
would
drink
this
again
but
only
here
and
there
pours
a
cloudy
yellowgold
with
absolutely
no
head
at
all
smells
like
a
lambic
but
much
more
faintly
so
than
some
of
the
notorious
cherry
versions
taste
is
light
mildly
sour
and
has
a
mellowness
to
it
that
i
have
not
had
in
this
style
before
im
not
sure
i
would
have
identified
strawberry
if
it
werent
noted
on
the
label
as
it
is
not
a
strong
powerful
flavor
however
knowing
they
were
in
the
mix
you
get
a
sense
of
oh
yeah
i
can
get
a
taste
of
them
as
the
sour
element
fades
away
into
just
a
light
barelypresent
sour
coating
on
your
tongue
and
teeth
overall
a
really
refreshing
beer
but
in
its
style
there
are
others
that
have
a
bit
more
of
a
wow
factor
overall
i
cant
get
into
the
sours
without
carbonation
this
is
the
second
ive
had
and
i
doubt
ill
try
anymore
taste
was
great
but
it
needs
bubbles
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
little
to
no
carbonation
as
befitting
the
style
despite
the
lack
of
carbonation
this
does
not
stagnate
on
the
palate
the
sourness
easily
moves
this
along
closes
semidry
with
little
sweetness
or
stickiness
on
the
palate
overall
id
like
it
much
better
with
some
bubbles
and
realize
flat
is
appropriate
for
the
style
its
quite
pricey
at
15
per
12oz
and
not
really
worth
it
to
me
bottle
from
sams
in
durham
served
in
a
hanssens
tumbler
hazy
peach
color
beautiful
strawberry
nose
not
at
all
faded
moderate
lactic
and
strong
strawberry
very
good
the
strawberries
in
the
aroma
are
lovely
but
somewhat
overshadowed
by
the
assertive
lemon
juice
in
the
flavor
a
bit
overall
smells
incredibly
of
strawberry
which
fades
in
the
taste
and
stays
sour
drinks
like
an
unblended
lambic
as
carbonation
is
minimal
even
from
hanssens
standards
still
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
a
nice
dry
sour
from
belgium
o
pretty
tasty
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
for
the
price
there
are
other
gueuzelambics
i
would
go
to
first
especially
since
i
didnt
get
a
ton
of
strawberry
out
of
this
o
balanced
clean
and
smooth
fun
to
drink
at
a
great
beer
bar
in
a
sweet
town
not
my
style
ive
been
eyeing
this
one
for
a
long
time
now
it
pours
a
light
bodied
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
slightly
pinkish
hue
slightly
cloudy
and
with
no
head
or
bubbles
the
nose
is
what
i
expected
from
hannsens
nice
acidity
moderate
funk
and
a
strawberry
juice
aspect
that
offers
a
touch
of
berry
sweetness
the
flavors
are
interested
of
course
there
is
the
acid
and
funky
yeast
but
it
has
an
odd
juicy
strawberry
sweetness
its
kind
of
earthy
and
vinous
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
little
flat
its
ok
i
know
there
arent
many
strawberry
lambics
out
there
but
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
geueze
with
strawberry
juice
added
its
ok
but
being
more
expensive
than
their
gueuze
or
kriek
i
would
prefer
one
of
those
any
day
o
i
love
hanssens
and
i
love
fruit
in
my
lambic
great
beer
i
assume
that
this
and
other
hanssens
would
have
much
higher
scores
if
they
were
more
carbonated
like
the
cantillon
however
i
am
fine
with
hanssens
and
the
lack
of
simplesyrup
that
cantillon
adds
to
produce
beautiful
intense
carbonation
in
there
beers
one
of
my
favs
and
way
way
way
better
than
the
upland
strawberry
which
lacks
funk
o
a
great
fruit
lambic
gentle
acidity
balances
out
lambic
funk
and
mixes
with
strawberry
well
not
horrible
but
far
from
a
top
of
the
line
beer
there
are
some
issues
but
overall
the
strawberry
is
somewhat
pleasant
if
not
a
bit
too
tart
at
times
this
beer
was
incredible
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
lambics
overall
ive
had
a
few
hanssens
lambics
and
this
one
is
a
notch
above
some
of
the
other
fruit
iterations
ive
encountered
from
them
nice
balance
but
for
something
touting
strawberries
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
fruit
in
the
taste
not
the
best
lambic
ive
had
but
better
than
most
out
there
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
an
alright
beer
this
beer
is
overly
sour
and
undercarbonated
a
bit
difficult
to
get
through
o
not
sure
age
had
immensely
helped
this
or
not
perhaps
if
it
was
lighter
on
the
palate
and
had
less
acetone
it
would
help
as
is
i
wouldnt
care
to
drink
again
a
difficult
one
very
sour
big
difference
between
smell
and
taste
but
in
all
good
o
truly
one
of
the
weirdest
brews
ive
had
to
date
this
was
an
interesting
experience
the
highest
beer
ive
ever
rated
was
a
straight
unblended
lambic
from
the
barrel
completely
flat
although
i
found
that
experience
to
be
outstanding
this
one
is
far
from
that
the
beer
is
ugly
and
feels
awkward
i
expected
carbonation
where
previously
i
had
not
that
totally
flavored
my
experience
although
thrown
off
i
was
not
completely
disappointed
o
very
sour
very
funky
just
not
all
that
interesting
the
lack
of
carbonation
doesnt
help
either
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
cheers
o
this
is
the
best
lambic
ive
had
its
so
perfect
i
love
every
part
about
it
good
beer
would
have
liked
it
more
if
the
strawberry
was
more
forceful
and
it
was
made
with
carbonation
like
an
oude
kriek
style
good
pickup
on
the
journey
through
lambic
land
though
drinkability
and
overall
impression
im
finding
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
aromas
and
flavors
and
some
of
the
descriptions
i
read
before
buying
it
i
didnt
expect
to
enjoy
it
so
much
but
i
think
that
this
beer
suffers
from
the
inadequacy
of
words
alone
to
convey
the
rich
complexity
of
a
sensory
experience
like
this
i
wont
hesitate
to
buy
another
bottle
of
this
one
when
i
encounter
it
its
not
something
for
every
night
but
it
is
definitely
a
treat
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
beer
that
is
extraordinarily
complex
and
that
i
personally
am
giving
high
marks
based
on
that
complexity
and
the
fact
that
im
enjoying
this
one
so
much
overall
quite
a
fun
ride
that
moves
from
strawberry
to
lemon
sour
and
even
salty
ocean
saltiness
i
am
not
sure
if
the
appearance
is
to
be
this
sort
of
flat
but
otherwise
alright
checking
upon
other
reviews
appearance
is
about
the
norm
so
i
call
good
on
that
o
i
always
love
hanssens
sours
this
is
not
the
best
but
still
very
good
lack
of
carbonation
is
somewhat
disappointing
but
like
i
said
not
a
big
deal
either
nice
and
tart
like
i
like
em
easy
drinking
sour
that
i
would
love
to
enjoy
again
o
this
is
a
bright
crisp
crude
beer
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
maybe
a
strawberry
hint
when
it
is
very
warm
as
well
as
some
septic
qualities
that
come
through
the
tartness
is
full
and
everything
is
well
blended
it
was
a
nice
beer
but
didnt
have
an
dominating
flavors
everything
was
subtle
except
the
sour
o
i
enjoyed
the
strawberry
flavor
in
this
lambic
but
as
a
whole
its
missing
that
classic
funk
and
sourness
in
the
flavor
and
finish
this
beer
is
a
success
on
every
levels
except
for
the
taste
great
funk
aroma
and
a
mouthfeel
that
is
exactly
what
id
expect
from
the
style
however
the
flavor
profile
here
is
very
one
sided
worth
a
try
and
probably
even
worth
aging
to
see
what
happens
a
while
down
the
line
almost
a
year
later
and
another
batch
i
get
just
a
touch
more
strawberries
its
still
a
sour
tart
lambic
with
some
accent
flavors
perfect
use
of
strawberries
o
not
sure
what
happened
with
the
carbonation
on
this
one
but
it
definitely
affects
the
overall
experience
the
aroma
is
pretty
awesome
if
not
surprisingly
devoid
of
any
funk
and
kinda
sweet
but
smelling
the
bottle
did
yield
some
tart
funkiness
also
for
containing
strawberries
im
very
surprised
with
the
color
its
in
no
way
red
or
pinkish
looks
like
a
legit
no
frills
lambic
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
id
probably
drink
it
again
3
5
obest
strawberry
based
lambic
ive
had
o
has
some
nice
flavor
notes
but
falls
pretty
far
short
overall
with
what
is
just
too
flat
a
beer
i
understand
lambics
and
gueuzes
arent
the
most
bubbly
of
beers
but
this
has
nothing
at
all
and
really
needs
something
this
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
few
buboes
around
the
edge
it
is
nearly
still
the
nose
is
funky
tart
apples
slightly
sour
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
good
bit
of
sourness
but
nothing
over
the
top
the
strawberry
flavor
is
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
light
slightly
puckering
and
barely
any
carbonation
just
like
a
true
lambic
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
to
any
one
who
wants
to
try
sours
that
are
not
to
off
putting
o
a
really
really
funkyfresh
barynard
lemondrop
best
enjoyed
in
a
dirt
cellar
after
shoveling
horse
shit
for
a
day
in
brussels
highly
recommended
overall
i
would
say
this
was
a
let
down
the
same
way
opening
up
an
uncarbed
15
beer
from
any
other
brewery
is
a
let
down
i
bet
its
delicious
when
properly
conditioned
o
so
so
i
guess
by
far
the
weakest
offering
from
a
brewery
i
love
overall
a
good
lambic
i
tend
to
prefer
my
fruit
lambics
more
carbonated
but
this
one
was
still
pretty
tasty
pours
a
cloudy
murky
orange
color
with
barely
a
bubble
from
a
very
vigorous
pour
the
nose
is
very
pleasant
with
lots
of
strawberries
a
lactic
sourness
a
touch
of
oak
and
a
hint
of
barnyard
taste
is
quite
tart
with
lemons
and
some
vinegar
the
strawberry
comes
in
to
only
partially
sweeten
the
sour
earthy
funky
musty
come
through
before
once
again
turning
tart
and
lingering
on
the
palette
long
after
every
sip
almost
nonexistent
carbonation
medium
body
with
a
tart
mouth
puckering
feel
i
would
have
loved
some
carbonation
in
this
bad
boy
as
is
its
decent
but
probably
something
i
wouldnt
purchase
again
overall
just
wow
the
original
bottle
is
one
of
the
best
lambics
i
can
remember
but
the
ones
since
have
just
been
soso
hard
to

stood

wouldnt

2
5
overall
i
consider
hannsens
original
version
of
the
lambic
to
be
average
at
best
from
the
start
i
just
thought
that
perhaps
the
bourbon
might
have
been
its
secret
weapon
to
sway
me
but
i
was
dead
wrong
it
actually
made
it
worse
i
think
that
was
probably
the
last
straw
and
wont
be
returning
to
hanssens
offering
of
a
lambic
anymore
o
the
more
i
sip
this
the
more
i
enjoy
it
i
have
had
better
lambics
but
this
is
still
good
i
feel
that
if
it
had
more
strawberry
flavor
and
some
more
carbonation
it
would
be
a
great
beer
no
trouble
finishing
my
glass
going
for
the
oude
kriek
from
hanssens
next
tonight
o
a
little
disappointed
there
wasnt
a
more
noticeable
taste
of
strawberries
but
still
a
good
sour
lambic
still
love
their
oude
kriek
though
no
head
hazy
orange
color
nose
is
super
funky
and
earthy
lots
of
woodiness
and
horse
blanket
nose
has
a
little
bit
of
strawberry
blossoms
palate
is
super
funky
and
sour
with
zero
carbonation
hardly
any
fruit
on
the
palate
lots
of
wood
and
mulch
long
finish
more
finesse
than
their
other
offerings
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
strawberry
character
that
comes
across
but
a
nice
lambic
nonetheless
my
second
from
hanssens
and
another
one
that
i
like
i
wouldnt
say
theyre
as
good
as
say
cantillon
but
they
have
their
own
unique
character
that
is
very
interesting
some
might
be
turned
off
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
really
detract
i
would
like
to
see
the
difference
between
one
that
was
carbonated
though
for
comparisons
sake
d
this
isnt
my
favorite
offering
from
hanssens
and
certainly
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
maybe
its
past
its
prime
pours
an
orangyyellow
color
slight
haze
carbonation
level
is
low
little
head
on
pour
both
the
smell
and
flavor
have
a
serious
brettanomyces
character
i
feel
like
it
ate
everything
there
was
to
eat
in
the
ten
years
in
the
bottle
very
very
dry
brett
lends
an
interesting
cherry
flavor
oakiness
is
apparent
very
sour
and
highly
acidic
mouthfeel
is
thin
like
what
i
would
expect
in
a
saison
only
a
very
slight
strawberry
flavor
to
speak
of
it
could
be
placebo
and
my
brain
wanting
the
berry
flavor
pours
a
hazy
light
red
color
with
absolutely
zero
head
or
lacing
random
floating
sediment
can
be
seen
in
the
glass
very
suspicious
smells
strongly
of
skunk
spray
funkmust
vinegar
hmm
alright
lambics
can
smell
this
way
somewhat
but
i
am
even
more
suspicious
the
taste
confirms
everything
i
was
wary
about
very
skunky
very
sour
very
musty
very
funky
very
salty
all
in
a
horrible
and
disgusting
way
this
is
one
of
the
worst
tasting
beers
i
have
ever
had
just
layer
upon
layer
of
awful
beer
is
absolutely
flat
which
makes
the
taste
that
much
worse
its
like
a
big
glass
of
flat
vinegar
soda
mixed
with
fermented
strawberry
mold
overall
this
is
an
abomination
of
a
beer
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
but
i
hope
to
all
that
is
good
that
it
is
i
am
pissed
that
i
spent
10
on
this
one
dthe
more
i
tasted
this
one
the
grosser
it
got
this
was
a
drain
pour
i
would
never
even
use
this
as
marinade
for
meats
its
just
awful
o
too
intense
for
my
palate
the
sourness
and
tannins
are
overwhelming
no
body
or
sweetness
to
balance
and
considering
the
price
11375ml
makes
it
a
horrible
value
sorry
guys
i
appreciate
the
attempt
to
make
natural
products
in
traditional
style
but
this
does
not
mean
that
balance
of
flavour
can
be
overlooked
verdict
too
expensive
to
drink
when
its
not
fresh
look
elsewhere
d
despite
the
carbonation
im
really
enjoying
this
one
very
tart
and
complex
another
great
lambic
from
hanssens
beer
is
super
tart
and
really
sour
on
the
finish
there
is
a
dirty
blanket
after
taste
and
this
odd
sourness
that
sticks
to
my
gums
the
aftertaste
is
overwhelming
hard
to
process
i
think
i
might
be
blind
this
is
about
the
most
sour
thing
ive
ever
tasted
there
is
a
shadow
of
woody
oak
that
reaches
out
of
the
back
of
my
throat
and
tries
to
strangle
me
beer
is
also
thicker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
still
finishes
really
dry
the
second
drink
was
much
better
than
the
first
its
mellowing
and
growing
on
me
strawberries
really
i
dont
think
so
this
is
like
a
harsh
sour
tart
unblended
flat
lambic
i
like
it
pours
a
deep
yelloworange
with
a
pinkish
hue
pours
nearly
flat
just
a
few
bubbles
in
a
partial
ring
smells
funky
citrusy
and
sour
i
get
oak
but
dont
get
any
strawberry
the
taste
is
very
sour
oak
strawberries
a
bit
moldy
in
the
taste
too
body
is
light
overall
a
bit
tough
to
deal
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
d
tasty
brew
not
an
intense
sour
lambic
pretty
easy
drinking
i
will
be
getting
this
again
pours
a
hazy
peach
color
with
zero
head
whatsoever
perfumey
sour
aroma
with
lemons
and
freezedried
strawberries
its
got
that
deep
refreshing
tartness
that
you
only
smell
in
the
best
lambics
flavor
packs
a
nice
sour
wallop
with
ultratart
strawberry
notes
and
that
dried
strawberry
sweetness
a
little
unripe
stone
fruit
at
times
and
a
bit
of
hay
bale
as
well
once
the
tongue
acclimates
to
the
sourness
some
honeyed
malts
come
through
to
provide
a
touch
of
balance
a
completely
still
beer
but
the
sourness
acts
in
place
of
co2
to
refresh
the
palate
very
dry
despite
a
body
medium
in
heft
all
things
considered
the
drinkability
was
quite
good
but
i
was
happy
with
my
half
of
the
375ml
that
i
shared
with
a
friend
man
i
must
have
scored
a
good
bottle
of
this
because
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
i
really
love
how
the
strawberry
integrates
into
this
beer
well
done
d
if
you
have
one
of
these
2000
vintages
i
suggest
you
drink
it
with
a
friend
or
sip
slowly
drinkability
the
odd
funkiness
of
this
one
slowed
down
consumption
considerably
what
a
strange
and
interesting
beer
9
was
too
much
for
a
tiny
bottle
but
this
was
a
fun
one
to
try
the
thing
that
struck
me
the
most
was
how
different
the
taste
was
from
the
smell
d
ill
drink
this
anytime
anywhere
overall
not
my
most
favorite
offering
from
hanssens
but
alright
i
prefer
other
fruit
lambics
over
this
but
an
interesting
use
of
strawberry
well
what
this
one
lacks
in
depth
is
sure
as
hell
makes
up
for
in
balls
to
the
wall
flavor
big
and
fruity
and
sour
and
overall
extremely
tasty
meant
for
small
doses
though
unless
you
dont
mind
burning
a
hole
in
your
esophagus
d
drank
a
bit
slower
that
i
would
have
liked
really
enjoyed
the
funk
just
wished
there
was
a
bit
more
strawberry
to
go
with
the
acidity
if
youre
looking
for
a
sour
lambic
im
not
generally
this
might
float
your
boat
but
as
a
fruit
lambic
its
not
working
for
me
definitely
wouldnt
try
it
again
one
of
my
few
disappointments
with
true
belgian
lambics
d
a
good
lambic
not
extraordinary
but
an
easy
drinking
one
with
a
nice
freshness
to
it
d
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
i
wish
i
had
the
access
and
the
patience
to
get
a
fresh
one
and
age
one
for
this
long
in
the
same
vintage
year
for
a
solid
comparison
edit
after
having
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
i
realized
how
lucky
i
was
to
find
a
bunch
of
old
bottles
the
fresher
is
a
lot
more
tart
and
sour
and
definitely
loaded
with
strawberries
still
an
awesome
beer
but
needs
a
few
more
years
to
come
in
to
its
own
laying
a
few
of
these
down
is
a
great
idea
d
drinkability
is
low
for
me
i
cant
get
past
how
sour
this
is
its
pretty
tongue
curling
sour
the
strawberry
flavor
is
of
the
unripened
variety
which
really
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
a
little
carbonation
might
do
this
beer
a
lot
of
good
and
take
some
of
the
edge
of
the
sourness
its
relative
mellowness
makes
it
more
approachable
on
the
sour
scale
but
its
not
for
the
beginnerfaint
of
heartpregnantweak
stomachacid
reflux
prone
one
to
sip

7oz

pours
an
opaque
deep
honey
orange
flavor
with
zero
head
and
no
real
carbonation
to
speak
of
strong
aroma
of
sourness
mixed
with
fruit
in
this
case
strawberry
some
vinegar
noted
in
the
nose
tart
and
dry
are
the
2
words
that
come
to
mind
after
my
first
sip
some
acetone
flavors
as
well
the
zero
carbonation
doesnt
help
really
although
i
realize
that
no
carbonation
is
typical
of
this
age
and
maybe
style
the
more
i
have
it
the
more
i
kind
of
like
it
probably
not
a
beer
for
everyone
but
for
those
that
like
dry
sour
beers
its
fairly
decent
ill
probably
end
up
with
a
bottle
or
2
to
put
in
the
cellar
poured
into
a
chimay
glass
it
looked
like
apple
juice
the
only
hint
of
carbonation
i
could
find
was
a
few
bubbles
on
my
tongue
couldnt
taste
the
strawberry
but
could
smell
it
a
bit
sipping
and
taking
huge
swigs
it
tasted
good
im
not
sure
about
the
taste
it
is
kind
of
sour
definitely
not
sweet
this
almost
tastes
like
white
wine
my
first
lambic
and
after
this
i
can
imagine
i
will
try
to
seek
out
more
ill
definitely
get
another
bottle
this
is
probably
something
good
for
sitting
on
the
porch
on
a
hot
day
medium
bodied
and
firm
quick
short
finish
and
dry
just
the
slightest
hint
of
carbonation
but
not
viscous
as
id
expect
i
imagine
this
is
quite
a
bit
better
when
fresh
pours
hazy
light
orange
nearly
still
is
it
still
young
given
the
use
of
strawberries
it
is
strangely
not
red
nor
does
the
color
seem
to
be
affected
at
all
by
the
strawberries
on
the
nose
the
strawberry
is
definitely
present
i
could
smell
it
off
the
cork
and
quite
nice
i
also
get
an
elderflower
aroma
which
i
often
detect
in
fruit
lambics
with
a
cidery
component
flavor
has
a
nice
sourness
with
a
slight
tea
astringency
strawberry
lambics
are
rare
but
this
one
is
great
note
2000
vintage
flat
beer
stored
under
florescent
lights
at
the
store
poured
with
no
head
and
of
course
no
lace
aroma
was
skunky
a
friend
nearby
smelled
it
right
away
color
is
a
clear
amber
aroma
also
has
the
malt
yeast
and
strawberries
flavor
is
like
aroma
body
isnt
so
hot
being
flat
ditto
with
finish
wish
i
could
a
had
a
better
one
wow
tart
and
sour
as
hell
with
a
very
nice
and
prevalent
strawberry
presence
lack
of
carbonation
is
a
bit
of
a
downer
but
i
am
surprisingly
still
loving
this
beer
a
delightful
sensory
experience
damn
i
love
lambics
just
enough
sweetness
to
counteract
some
of
the
sourness
has
a
nice
bit
of
funk
in
here
as
well
as
the
bottle
drains
it
becomes
more
tart
than
sour
as
the
palate
adjusts
fairly
quickly
to
the
sour
aspect
there
is
also
a
mild
rubbery
flavor
that
has
me
thinking
brettomyces
might
be
involved
here
i
wish
i
had
20
more
of
these
around
awesome
beer
lack
of
co2
is
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
an
a
in
my
book
d
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
but
will
probably
pay
for
it
with
heart
burn
not
a
bad
offering
from
the
hanssens
blenders
d
needs
some
carbonation
but
not
bad
strawberry
is
stronger
than
i
expected
d
i
like
it
enough
not
enough
to
buy
this
same
year
again
i
just
wish
that
there
was
more
to
the
mouth
feel
here
eh
its
drinkable
enough
but
is
in
dire
need
of
some
carb
this
stuff
is
lacking
the
crispness
that
some
carb
would
bring
to
give
it
a
rounder
profile
interesting
flavor
but
just
not
the
best
lambic
ive
had
overall
considering
there
was
nearly
no
carbonation
this
is
a
good
example
for
the
style
although
there
was
no
carbonation
there
was
a
medium
body
i
am
sure
a
newer
vintage
would
be
more
representative
of
the
style
but
i
cannot
complain
too
much
d
a
solid
lambic
the
complexity
isnt
great
but
a
nice
drinkable
brew
too
expensive
for
what
you
get
though
d
between
the
stench
of
this
bottle
and
a
lackluster
experience
with
my
first
im
not
convinced
this
is
a
beer
i
really
need
to
try
again
lambics
are
hard
to
find
and
im
sure
theyre
hard
to
make
but
this
isnt
a
compelling
example
drinkability
is
above
average
overall
still
not
the
biggest
fan
of
hanssens
dwithout
question
a
finely
made
lambic
super
crisp
with
a
myriad
of
subtle
notes
that
you
get
to
discover
one
by
one
a
most
interesting
and
amazingly
complex
brew
d
obviously
rating
against
the
style
but
i
find
myself
wanting
to
keep
sipping
in
spite
of
the
low
carbonation
and
big
blend
of
sour
and
funkiness
a
very
interesting
beer
glad
i
snagged
a
bottle
to
try
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
that
i
got
from
bosse
it
was
significantly
more
carbonated
but
i
cant
remember
the
vintage
drinkability
is
high
this
slides
down
with
ease
a
nice
hint
of
strawberry
but
still
strongly
on
the
funky
side
yet
remains
quaffable
and
clean
yummy
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
very
nice
smell
the
beer
is
still
but
the
oak
and
acidity
provide
a
pleasantly
dry
and
full
mouthfeel
overall
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
and
a
lucky
find
highly
recommended
simple
direct
well
aged
nature
and
art
in
a
small
green
bottle
d
i
think
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
though
still
enjoyable
im
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
yeah
its
flat
but
still
a
pretty
good
sour
pretty
sure
it
will
never
cross
my
path
again
d
a
beer
that
ive
been
wanting
to
try
but
it
is
quite
acetic
and
sour
a
bit
more
dryness
would
have
been
nice
and
perhaps
a
little
more
fruit
character
pours
yellow
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
tart
with
some
vinegar
and
some
funk
the
taste
is
very
tart
with
some
sour
strawberries
and
other
fruit
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
funk
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
pure
tartness
light
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
very
dry
finish
my
guess
the
bottle
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
of
the
beer
shop
in
amsterdam
for
quite
some
time
dark
reddish
gold
crystal
clear
does
that
mean
that
is
has
no
live
yeast
sour
strawberries
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavour
some
notes
of
citrus
and
maybe
apples
in
the
background
usual
horseblanketness
with
a
bit
of
acidity
but
not
much
sourness
no
head
at
all
a
nice
lambic
light
pink
body
with
hardly
any
head
smell
is
sinusclearingly
tart
flavor
continues
with
the
tartness
with
just
a
hint
of
strawberry
that
you
have
to
work
for
leathery
aftertaste
this
may
be
blasphemy
against
the
lambic
gods
but
i
think
hanssens
beers
have
more
going
on
than
cantillon
with
the
latter
i
just
get
unrelenting
sourness
this
one
one
the
other
hand
seemed
to
have
a
bit
more
nuance
edit
i
looked
over
the
other
reviews
after
i
posted
mine
and
saw
that
d0b
has
given
this
same
vintage
a
very
bad
review
it
also
looks
like
he
got
his
bottle
at
west
lakeview
liqours
which
is
where
i
gat
mine
i
think
that
he
may
have
just
had
a
bad
bottle
i
say
this
because
he
comments
that
hes
had
it
before
and
really
enjoyed
it
but
it
was
a
different
vintage
i
know
that
taste
is
subjective
and
im
not
saying
that
hes
wrong
by
any
means
i
just
think
he
may
have
gotten
a
cooked
bottle
or
something
i
generally
agree
with
most
of
his
reviews
which
is
why
i
find
the
differences
between
these
to
be
odd
this
now
is
my
new
favorite
brew
in
this
category
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
any
category
very
refreshing
very
quaffable
and
above
all
very
interesting
had
this
earlier
at
delerium
in
brussels
a
the
recommendation
of
the
bar
manager
loved
it
then
d
very
good

balance
between
acidity
and

flavors

i
drained
the
bottle
rather
quickly
drinkability
it
was
an
interesting
drink
i
enjoyed
it
but
would
definitely
have
to
share
a

with
a
friend
or
2
d
super
drinkable
the
lacto
is
really
strong
and
you
can
feel
it
in
your
gut
after
a
while
that
never
stopped
me
though
overall
definitely
not
my
favorite
that
ive
sampled
in
the
style
by
no
means
terrible
its
just
lacking
something
this
certainly
isnt
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
casuale
lindemans
framboise
drinker
if
you
dont
like
tartbitter
stay
away
i
liked
it
would
not
get
it
again
for
the
price
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
i
read
a
few
reviews
on
this
brew
and
i
have
no
idea
where
theyre
coming
from
i
was
recommended
this
brew
and
would
happily
recommend
it
to
anyone
else
that
sees
it
on
their
local
shelves
the
play
on
the
fruitiness
is
incredibly
enjoyable
while
theres
a
nice
solid
puckering
quality
that
keeps
me
coming
back
d
this
is
an
interesting
lambic

bits
with
a

from
the
strawberries
that
are
said
to
be
used
in
the
brew
perhaps
ive
never
tasted
any
strawberrylambic
as
understated
as
this
one
but
something
tells
me
that
this
bottle
is
not
pretty
right
as
this
level
of
carbonation
next
to
none
is
not
even
quite
right
for
a
bottled
lambic
that
said
the
lambic
base
still
shows
a
degree
of
decency
in
quality
that
cant
be
brushed
off
that
easily
this
is
hanssens
with
very
little
carbonation
and
a
slightly
funky
it
does
grow
in
prominence
there
isnt
much
this
is
one
aspect
that
i
wish
had
a
little
more
complexity
to
it
quite
oaky
on
the
finish
with
vanilla
and
tannins
to
add
the
low

of

if

you
will
probably
enjoy
this

should
equally
enjoy
this

me
think
of
a

taste
gives
some
tart
hint
of
strawberries
but
not
much
a
very
fiery
tartness
overwhelms
the
senses
very
acidic
i
know
lambics
are
supposed
to
be
funky
and
tart
but
give
me
a
break
i
will
never
buy
this
beer
again
overall
initially
i
wasnt
impressed
but
it
really
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
this
is
a
really
wild
example
of
a
lambic
beer
and
it
was
a
good
experience
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
but
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
john
i
wonder
about
the
fact
that
it
says
lambic
on
the
label
and
not
a
gueuze
i
am
guessing
that
this
means
that
it
is
a
bottled
straight
lambic
like
cantillons
brouscella
if
this
was
the
case
it
would
make
it
even
more
appealing
to
try
again
over
and
over
and
over
i
would
recommend
this
beer
but
it
is
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
bottle
poured
a
light
redbrown
color
lambic
with
no
head
or
carbonation
aroma
of
funk
and
horse
blanket
is
quite
strong
with
some
very
subtle
strawberry
in
the
back
taste
is
mix
of
sour
and
funky
lambic
with
an
extra
dose
of
horse
blanket
with
some
faint
strawberry
also
noticeable
not
sure
if
this
lack
some
aging
or
if
the
balance
is
wrong
but
definitely
not
one
the
best
lambic
fruit
that
i
have
tasted
i
personally
would
not
drink
this
particular
one
very
often
it
was
not
really
sweet
and
was
very
sour
however
i
think
if
you
typically
enjoy
the
style
this
might
be
a
good
one
to
try
a
tricky
fruit
lambic
the
fruit
is
all
there
but
the
dominant
sourness
is
just
a
little
too
much
in
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
lambics
and
geuezes
but
this
one
just
wasnt
balanced
the
way
i
like
it
it
feels
balanced
in
the
taste
the
label
reads
limited
edition
2000

the
cork
is
removed
with
a
notable
pop
and
the
brew
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
virtually
no
head
what
an
amazing
aroma
musty
and
earthy
with
a
serious
acidic
note
a
very
nice
strawberry
nose
comes
through
almost
immediately
and
was
far
stronger
than
i
expected
it
smelled
vaguely
like
small
wild
strawberries
not
the
plump
farm
variety
the
taste
is
very
nice
sour
and
earthy
musty
funky
mouthpuckering
and
dry
the
strawberry
flavor
is
very
prominent
in
the
taste
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
dry
and
tart
finish
this
is
an
interested
beer
i
was
impressed
with
the
strength
of
the
strawberries
and
how
they
worked
well
with
flavor
of
the
brew
the
lambic
qualities
could
have
been
a
little
more
pronounced
sourness
and
that
earthyfunkywildness
its
certainty
worth
a
try
finishes
with
a
peppery
warmth
and
drying
with
a
lactic
twang
d
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
with
a
higher
carbonation
level
it
would
have
been
extraordinary
i
think
the
age
on
the
bottle
must
have
done
it
in
but
with
that
age
came
remarkabled
smoothness
sour
aroma
that
never
even
gets
in
the
vicinity
of
sweet
quite
tart
goldenamber
color
with
no
head
at
all
fore
is
vinegar
and
then
sweet
strawberries
and
then
vinegar
mildly
creamy
as
well
curiously
the
tart
vinegar
flavors
make
the
strawberry
side
seem
unripe
as
if
they
used
green
strawberries
its
interesting
but
it
is
also
failry
narrow
flavor
wise
and
that
can
get
boring
quickly
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
an
earthy
sour
scent
that
boasts
of
half
rotten
strawberries
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
musty
strawberry
flavor
that
is
earthy
and
quite
sour
the
fruit
is
not
as
pronounced
as
some
lambics
ive
had
it
goes
down
slow
and
very
tart
usually
these
brews
go
down
like
water
but
this
one
is
different
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
beer
but
just
an
average
lambic
i
wont
be
buying
this
again

the
corked
opened
without
a
sound
this
beer
has
a
mostly
clear
copper
color
with
no
head
there
is
a
single
chunk
of
something
floating
around
near
the
bottom
of
my
glass
sour
slightly
funky
aroma
with
strawberries
the
flavor
is
sharp
and
acidic
with
just
a
subtle
hint
of
strawberries
mostly
sour
but
a
little
sweet
too
tastes
great
but
the
acidity
is
challenging
the
only
fault
of
this
beer
is
the
entirely
flat
body
i
feared
that
the
fruit
would
be
overpowering
in
this
beer
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
mighty
tasty
lambic
with
a
hint
of
strawberries
the
beer
was
a
serious
let
down
the
bottle
had
no
pictures
of
strawberries
i
thought
i
was
getting
a
nonfruit
lambic
if
i
hadnt
had
quite
a
few
examples
from
the
lambicgueuze
style
i
might
have
sworn
off
the
style
after
trying
this
im
all
for
funkiness
but
this
beer
went
way
past
anything
enjoyable
for
me
loses
drinkability
points
in
my
book
for
being
a
big
old
donut
of
a
beer
and
that
weird
lingering
flavor
on
the
finish
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
up
to
hannsons
standard
the
oude
gueuze
is
their
true
entry
in
anyones
masters
collection
drinkability
still
very
new
to
the
lambic
scene
hopefully
i
will
come
across
the
better
ones
than
this
if
you
are
new
to
lambics
i
feel
this
one
can
be
enjoyed
on
quite
a
few
levels
if
you
are
looking
for
tart
or
sweet
or
both
it
is
here
not
overly
either
less
tart
than
most
cantillions
but
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
ls
this
geuze
is
tolerable
and
the
more
one
drinks
the
easier
it
gets
tiny
little
pop
when
the
cork
came
out
old
cheese
aroma
then
some
of
that
wild
yeast
sourness
this
beer
is
an
old
urine
yellow
with
no
head
took
awhile
for
bubbles
to
appear
anywhere
in
the
beer
but
they
finally
arrived
taste
is
wildly
sequential
starts
off
with
nice
fruit
notes
probably
strawberries
based
on
the
label
only
not
my
tastebuds
and
segues
into
a
graceful
sourness
and
then
bam
the
sour
comes
in
heavy
and
somewhat
artificial
its
puckering
but
doesnt
seem
natural
mouthfeel
especially
early
on
is
medium
the
heavy
duty
puckering
keeps
this
from
being
an
easy
quaff
12
7
ounce
green

bailed
and
corked
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
notes
this
one
said
it
was
a
kriek
and
it
would
be
my
first
real
wone
refreshing
not
quite
as
tart
as
other
lambics
i
have
had
not
quite
as
funky
as
i
would
hope
still
very
tasty
drinkability
and
overall
an
interesting
tasting
beer
that
somehow
works
this
is
not
as
wonderful
or
mindblowing
as
say
a
cantillon
or
a
lindemans
but
its
still
ok
give
it
a
shot
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
odd
it
is
good
very
interesting
but
to
be
honest
not
something
i
would
want
more
than
once
in
a
long
while
not
rated
to
syle
this
would
have
been
my
lowest
ranked
beer
375
ml
bottle
minimal
pop
behind
the
cork
and
then
an
immediate
aroma
of
strawberry
pours
a
brassy
gold
with
hardly
any
carbonation
at
least
not
to
leave
any
notation
of
head
color
or
retention
horse
blanket
aroma
mixed
with
a
healthy
dosage
of
strawberry
sweet
to
tart
ratio
is
right
on
with
lots
of
bittersweet
strawberry
i
detect
a
slight
bit
of
woody
smokiness
well
into
the
aftertaste
a
little
syrupy
the
carbonation
is
really
low
so
it
doesnt
hide
it
very
well
the
strawberry
seems
to
be
a
niche
kind
of
flavor
for
people
i
like
strawberries
but
this
beer
seems
to
posess
some
bubblegummy
sweetness
rather
enjoyable
overall
a
musthave
for
lovers
of
the
strawberry
and
lambic
beers
pours
a
flat
deep
orange
color
with
absolutely
no
head
or
lacing
aromas
are
quite
interesting
for
such
a
brew
consisting
mostly
of
sweet
floral
tones
and
passion
fruits
there
are
some
slight
acidic
tones
but
theres
just
so
much
sweetness
in
the
nose
that
it
keeps
these
tones
at
bay
flavors
start
off
quite
sweet
and
fruity
with
flavors
that
just
remind
me
of
a
tropical
summer
day
and
eating
passion
fruits
somewhere
in
the
mix
there
is
an
acetic
tone
within
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
subdued
by
the
sweetness
the
finish
is
slightly
earthy
and
floral
reminding
me
of
fresh
dandelions
oak
and
strawberry
fields
there
is
also
just
the
slightest
tone
of
vanilla
to
go
along
with
the
strong
sour
and
acetic
flavors
the
carbonation
to
this
brew
was
just
a
trickle
and
the
mouthfeel
was
just
a
bit
thin
overall
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
lambics
i
have
ever
tasted
i
have
never
had
one
that
was
soo
sweet
and
fruity
while
having
such
burst
of
acetic
and
sour
tones
very
interesting
to
say
the
least
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
i
give
it
a
5
for
lambics
not
in
general
interesting
theres
no
head
on
the
pour
but
one
starts
to
develop
as
the
beer
sits
in
my
tulip
the
color
is
a
cloudy
peachyorange
small
spots
of
lacing
the
odor
is
sour
funkybarn
tart
but
with
sugar
underneath
theres
a
little
burnt
popcorn
in
there
the
front
is
tart
and
fruity
the
middle
is
flat
and
funky
with
some
fermenting
almost
rotting
fruit
the
finish
has
a
full
fruitiness
with
alcohol
and
becomes
puckeringly
sour
burning
throat
sour
complex
fruity
tart
good
but
not
great
bottle
at
spuyten
duyvil
no
head
at
all
fairly
still
weird
extremely
clear
peach
color
it
looks
like
a
mix
of
apple
and
peach
juice
and
not
appealing
at
all
in
fact
the
aroma
catches
up
for
the
looks
though
with
its
straightforward
strawberry
pie
nuances
captivating
sweettart
combat
almost
as
candyish
as
if
lindemans
had
done
it
but
theres
still
a
hint
of
that
hanssens
funk
though
it
would
score
much
higher
with
me
if
this
wasnt
restrained
so
much
actually
hints
of
sugar
powder
palate
is
actually
very
tart
agressively
acidic
finish
with
obvious
strawberries
but
like
my
pal
martin
pointed
out
it
just
doesnt
procures
the
classy
combination
cherries
or
raspberries
do
puckering
grapeish
finish
decent
dose
of
lactic
funk
unusually
dry
finish
which
seems
to
arrive
from
nowhere
with
such
a
fruity
start
medium
body
is
almost
still
and
detracts
overall
enjoyment
just
like
the
appearance
did
taste
for
a
beer
with
no
head
it
was
surprisingly
effervescent
and
tangy
it
was
very
tart
but
sweet
not
overly
sweet
like
those
pseudolambics
the
acidity
is
there
just
a
bit
more
balanced
id
say
this
is
a
good
beer
to
slowly
rip
people
away
from
the
sugary
clutches
of
the
fake
lambics
and
push
them
slowly
towards
the
real
deal
comments

this
is
a
2000
vintage
orange
color
with
no
discernable
head
smell
of
wonderful
puke
in
college
after
drinking
tang
and
everclear
all
night
and
i
mean
that
in
the
best
way
possible
initially
acidic
orange
peel
and
aspirin
taste
mellows
in
the
mouth
with
floral
orange
blossem
and
slight
strawberry
finish
the
mouth
is
light
upfront
with
a
dry
tongued
finish
a
great
starter
refreshing
and
light
this
would
be
a
great
way
to
start
the
evening
overall
even
though
i
didnt
drink
in
under
the
best
conditions
i
still
enjoyed
it
ill
be
searching
for
it
again
pretty
awesome
the
label
tells
me
that
this
is
a
limited
edition
year
2000
at
least
3
years
oldand
i
have
to
wonder
if
its
age
affected
the
headappearance
no
popaction
at
all
from
the
uncorking
a
vigorous
pour
does
not
form
any
sort
of
a
head
only
the
slightest
of
bubbly
edging
appearance
is
light
orange
with
a
dash
of
sunlight
this
is
one
funky
smelling
beer
got
the
horse
blanket
barnyard
thing
going
on
and
also
a
little
mixture
of
sweet
and
sour
good
nose
this
beer
has
got
no
carbonation
at
all
flat
to
say
the
least
like
kool
aid
the
taste
is
quite
acidic
and
biting
mouth
puckering
to
a
large
degree
and
tart
lemon
juice
in
a
big
way
grass
and
hay
acetic
acid
the
taste
is
o
k
but
the
mouthfeel
really
drags
this
beer
down
for
me
375ml

limited

pours
a

tinged
light
amber
with
no

aroma
of

and
a
faint
mustiness
very
little
carbonation
but
you
dont
miss
them
taste
starts
out
sweet
on
the
tongue
then
turns
dry
and
tart
i
enjoyed
this
as
a
nice
change
from
the
everyday
beer
drinking
interestingly
enough
i
did
not
really
miss
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
this
brew
it
might
be
a
bit
better
with
it
but
it
is
interesting
enough
to
stand
up
without
it
i
think
that
this
would
probably
be
a
good
transition
lambic
for
going
from
lindemans
products
to
that
of
cantillon
very
interesting
and
i
am
still
not
quite
to
sure
what
to
think
of
it
wonderful
farmyard
stench
and
strawberries
some
public
toilet
smells
but
in
a
good
way
flavour
is
tart
and
sour
some
subtle
sweetness
from
the
strawberries
its
more
the
seeds
than
the
actual
flesh
dry
sour
and
refreshing
love
it
so
refreshing
and
lovely
to
drink
2000
vintage
goldenhued
liquid
with

looks
like
apple
juice
with
some
cloudiness
in
the
glass
nose
contains
pervasive
notes
of
strawberries
a
musty
barnyard
aroma
and
hints
at
some
sour
acidity
to
come
flavors
include
a
huge
strawberry
profile
in
addition
to
notes
of
apple
and
pear
imparted
by
the
yeast
and
a
very
nice
sweetandsour
interplay
throughout
very
tart
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
mildly
effervescent
at
first
but
turns
more
vinous
as
it
settles
this
is
a
unique
excellent
vintage
lambic
would
be
a
nice
introduction
to
the
more
traditional
style
of
lambics
the
beer
started
to
irritate
my
stomach
about
half
way
through
and
i
couldnt
finish
it
it
felt
too
acidic
i
got
my
girlfriend
to
drink
as
much
of
it
as
i
could
pawn
off
and
we
had
to
pour
the
rest
i
felt
terrible
considering
that
its
such
a
hard
to
find
expensive
beer
but
i
dont
think
im
ready
for
stuff
like
this
and
neither
is
my
digestive
system
this
brew
poured
a
very
little
white
head
of
large
bubbles
its
body
is
an
appealingly
nice
amber
brown
with
bubbles
clinging
to
the
side
on
my
mug
there
is
some
lacing
evident
as
the
head
disappears
before
i
can
taste
it
it
has
a
burnt
wood
aroma
not
fruity
as
i
expected
it
tastes
as
bad
as
it
smells
i
took
one
sip
and
poured
the
rest
too
bad
it

thin
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
rim
of
the

akin
to

cider
in
appearance
sweet
ripe
sugary
strawberries
hit
the
nose
at
first
then
are
ceded
by
notes
of
yeast
must
bready
grain
and
lactic
tartness
with
hints
of
wet
horse
and
trace
aged
cheesy
hops
emerging
towards
the
end
of
the
aroma
in
flavor
the
initial
snap
of
fruit
sweetness
is
quickly
overrun
by
a
nearly
puckering
tartness
fruit
flavor
is
not
lost
amongst
the
tart
character
and
strawberry
persists
throughout
albeit
in
an
unripe
fashion
the
hint
of
diacetyl
adds
a
creamy
buttery
undertone
that
supplements
the
lactic
tartness
and
prevents
it
from
being
overbearing
and
one
dimensional
wild
brettanomyces
yeast
emerges
as
mild
notes
of
wet
hay
as
my
palate
becomes
accustomed
to
the
tartness
fruitiness
reverts
to
a
freshly
picked
strawberry
nature
spot
on
in
body
light
somewhat
spritzy
but
not
at
all
weak
or
watery
finishes
simultaneously
sweet
tart
and
dry
oudbeitje
is
a
complex
and
delicious
lambic
the
interplay
of
sweet
fruitiness
and
lactic
tartness
teases
the
palate
in
a
capricious
way
the
real
deal
i
wonder
how
long
this
bottling
will
last
the
first
surprise
was
the
color
i
expected
some
pinky
red
lambic
but
this
was
a
dark
copper
colored
murky
looking
lambic
with
no
carbonation
whatsoever
totally
flat
this
was
a
lambic
that
had
hints
of
strawberry
rather
than
say
a
steeped
kriek
where
the
fruit
is
dominant
the
acidity
was
still
quite
high
good
sourness
was
prevalant
at
first
but
the
tinge
of
strawberries
invaded
in
the
middle
and
balanced
the
dryness
at
the
end
to
a
rather
sharp
but
sweet
finish
excellent
attempt
at
a
new
fruit
lambic
only
really
let
down
by
its
flat
appearance

simply

lightly

with
some

musty

the

the

starts
with
a
soft
acidity
which
immediately
turns
quite
sharp
on
the

of
the
tongue
puckering
leading
into
some
light
fruit
flavor
wow
and
some
broader
flavors
of
limited

leather
mustiness
as
the
liquid
warms
across
the
palate
then
dissolves
from
the

with
a
quickly
passing
light
metallic
note
leaving
a
dry
powdery
finish
and
a
sour
spot
at
the
back
of
the
throat
surprisingly
not
astringent
as
its
often
expected
not
a
very
complex
lambic
but
quite
surprising
in
the
clarity
of
the
strawberry
note
a
difficult
fruit
to
work
with
because
of
its
light
character
i
have
had
gallons
of
this
at
the
tavern
of
the
same
name
several
years
ago
located
an
alley
or
two
off
the
grote
markt
in
brussels
and
from
time
to
time
score
a
bottle
or
two
my
memories
of
mort
subite
kriek
with
an
omelet
for
a
late
breakfast
probably
influence
my
score

cherries
with
a
slight
funk
this
is
a
beautiful
brilliant
cherry
color
with
a
pink
tinted

and
a
fine
bead
the
beer
is
light
big
on
cherries
tart
with
a
light
balancing
sweetness
probably
a
little
sweeter
than
some
krieks
but
not
like

sweet
it
is
very
effervescent
with

fine

for

this

the

didnt

its
a

for

great
fruit
with
some

just
lacking
the
complexity

sourness
one
can
expect
for
the
style
overall
this
has
a
mild
tartness
lacks
any
real
sour
character
and
has
such
a
candy
cherry
sweetness
it
is
a
bit
cloying
if
not
for
the
carbonation
to
clean
off
the
finish
quite
a
light

only
a
slight

its
a
bit
of
a

bomb
but
makes
a
pleasant

would
want
to
restrain
myself
to
one
though
its
more
balanced
than
the
smell
would
indicate
and
makes
a
refreshing
if
overall
if
mostly
exciting
kriek
i
first
had
this
beer
at
belgo
centraal
in
the
covent
garden
region
of
london
it
was
a
fantastic
introduction
to
lambic
and
kriek
beers
then
it
seemed
to
disappear
for
a
couple
of
years
now
its
back
as
a
massproduced
product
complete
with
artificial
flavoring
and
color
sad
really
that
its
no
worse
than
bud
overall
this
isnt
something
i
would
purchase
regularly
but
a
nice
beer
to
have
in
the
summer
or
looking
for
something
with
a
nice
fruit
infusion
pours
with
a
dark
red
color
exact
color
of
cherries
and
is
topped
with
weak
head
the
aroma
was
a
bit
disappointing
luckily
the
only
disapointing
thing
here
i
expected
a
pleasant
cherry
aroma
but
i
got
a
slight
acid
smell
reminding
me
of
cheap
wine
the
taste
was
a
completely
different
story
sweet
and
slightly
hoppy
towards
the
end
i
could
definitely
taste
some
cherries
one
of
the
best
krieks
so
far
sweet
not
too
much
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
decent
fruity
beer
but
not
a
great
lambic
while
this
was
not
a
bad
drink
it
is
not
something
i
would
go
chasing
after
anytime
soon
i
think
i
will
give
the
style
another
chance
but
perhaps
with
something
of
a
better
reputation
this
pours
a
maroon
red
color
with
a
foamy
light
pink
head
the
aroma
is
rich
with
sweet
cherries
the
taste
is
sweet
with
cherries
evolving
into
a
tart
finish
decent
flavor
but
the
texture
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
have
imagined
a
smooth
refreshing
desert
beer
that
im
a
little
surprised
doesnt
have
a
higher
rating
this
beer
was
bought
in
france
for
a
whopping
25
eur
and
i
see
nothing
in
its
quality
to
justify
it
its
a
sweetsour
beer
that
tastes
like
more
like
strawberrycherry
wine
the
aftertaste
lasts
very
long
at
least
that
is
value
for
money
overall
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
raspberries
come
through
well
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
and
not
sour
enough

two
finger
offwhite
with
slight
pink
hue
head
that
subsided
to
one

very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
sugar
cherries
fruit
and
subtle
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cream
earth
strawberries
cherries
and
subtle
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
very
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
unfortunately
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
on
this
one
tons
of
sweetness
and
fruit
going
on
but
that
was
about
it
kind
of
seemed
like
this
was
the
only
thing
going
on
with
it
unless
you
investigated
further
worth
your
time
trying
at
least
once
but
that
is
about
it
i
would
say
this
is
an
introductory
lambic
not
quite
in
the
same
league
than
the
cantillon
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
final
grade
3
63
a
solid
b
grade
mort
subite
kriek
is
flavorful
tasty
stuff
that
id
say
is
worth
a
try
but
it
still
kind
of
straddles
that
line
between
alcopop
and
beer
so
purists
or
serious
lambic
fans
probably
wont
dig
it
that
much
i
really
wish
these
sorts
of
brews
were
available
yearround
in
my
area
but
for
now
it
seems
fruit
lambics
will
remain
a
onceinawhile
thing
for
me
i
rarely
drink
these
styles
in
general
so
its
fair
to
mention
that
im
far
from
a
connoisseur
here
this
might
not
be
the
best
kriek
in
the
world
but
its
still
tasty
and
easy
to
like
with
a
nice
balance
of
cherry
tartness
sweetness
and
funky
lambic
goodness
a
very
quaffable
brew
that
i
would
suggest
as
an
entry
point
into
the
style
for
anyone
curious
overall
a
nice
lambic
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
it
is
more
on
the
sweet
side
then
on
the
sour
side
making
it
more
refreshing
and
faster
drinking
good
for
a
go
if
you
get
a
chance
hmmm
overall
is
it
beer
or
is
it
soda
a
little
sweet
and
onedimensional
but
tasty
and
easydrinking
this
kriek
came
out
with
a
red
pour
and
a
finger
of
white
head
very
nice
retention
and
lacing
it
smelled
like
cherry
juice
not
much
else
just
cherries
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
so
sweet
no
sour
or
funk
at
all
basically
tastes
like
a
sweet
cherry
soda
with
less
carbonation
i
enjoy
it
but
it
isnt
great
i
will
say
that
this
is
at
least
pretty
damn
drinkable
i
just
wish
this
had
some
funk
too
sweet
and
average
pours
a
clear
cranberry
juice
color
with
a
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
small
curtain
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
cherry
juice
and
cherries
with
a
slightly
tart
quality
taste
is
also
of
cherries
and
cherry
juice
with
only
a
mildly
tart
quality
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
too
fantastic
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
kriek
it
feels
rustic
and
delicate
at
the
same
time
please
note
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
judge
since
i
have
never
drunk
anything
similar
having
said
that
i
think
it
would
benefit
from
being
sweeter
in
order
to
balance
the
tartness
overall
this
beer
serves
more
as
a
cooler
or
aperitif
due
to
its
low
abv
and
excessive
sweetness
othis
is
a
drinkable
lambic
with
strong
cherry
flavor
which
skews
towards
being
more
sweet
than
sour
but
not
overly
sweet
to
the
point
of
tasting
artificial
single
finger
head
on
a
reddish
brown
body
tons
if
lacing
light
aroma
which
is
as
expected
mostly
fruity
and
raspberry
like
this
is
an
excellent
lambic
with
a
nice
raspberry
and
medicinal
cherry
taste
up
front
and
brown
sugar
finish
with
moderate
to
high
carbinaion
and
light
body
overall
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
lambic
beers
out
there
d
a
very
strong
cherry
presence
with
enough
sweet
and
sour
character
to
be
eminently
drinkable
the
body
was
far
too
thin
for
my
preferences
but
otherwise
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
had
a
good
even
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
certainly
worth
your
time
when
you
have
a
chance
matured
in
oak
casks
for
several
months
says
the
promo
material
why
even
bother
sort
of
a
joke
compared
to
traditional
lambic
producers
aging
for
years
to
achieve
the
depth
and
complexity
sorely
missing
here
o
good
o
not
very
beer
like
but
tasty
in
its
own
way
overall
enjoyable
although
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
does
become
cloying
drink
overall
this
one
is
about
on
par
with
other
mass
produced
intro
lambics
in
the
us
the
color
and
feel
are
the
best
thing
about
this
one
probably
wont
come
back
to
it
pours
a
clean
reddish
pink
to
amber
color
with
a
light
pink
head
in
the
aroma
mellow
dark
cherry
in
the
taste
a
nice
bitter
to
sweet
dark
cherry
and
not
too
much
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
cherry
in
the
aftertaste
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
cherokee
red
i
had
this
on
tap
at
de
muze
in
antwerpen
its
a
dark
red
carbonated
candy
in
a
glass
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
i
expected
it
to
be
more
complex
to
me
this
is
not
much
better
than
the
very
commercially
available
lindemans
it
tastes
artificial
this
is
a
beer
for
the
nonbeer
drinker
at
your
party
well
i
will
give
fruit
lambics
another
try
with
the
near
10yearold
kriek
i
recently
acquired
purchased
a
growler
at
a
place
not
far
from
my
home
i
go
back
and
forth
with
lambic
and
this
beer
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
want
to
like
it
more
but
it
is
on
the
verge
of
being
way
too
sweet
the
color
is
almost
too
red
it
looks
like
cranberry
juice
and
the
taste
that
lingers
isnt
something
far
from
cranberry
juice
i
dont
think
i
will
be
getting
another
one
especially
at
the
price
i
paid
o
this
lambic
is
an
easy
drinker
and
is
on
the
sweeter
end
of
the
spectrum
for
the
style
this
is
a
great
desert
beer
and
a
great
introduction
to
lambics
it
has
both
a
quality
fruit
taste
and
a
proper
tartness
and
it
looks
great
to
boot
middle
of
the
road
kriek
o
not
for
me
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
was
but
not
for
me
o
too
sweet
for
me
ill
pass
time
to
pack
the
girlfriend
for
the
trip
home
to
atlanta
she
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
still
love
the
style
though
o
definitely
a
guilty
pleasure
beer
that
id
swipe
from
my
wife
when
shes
not
looking
arrived
with
two
fingers
of
dark
pink
to
red
head
body
is
deep
red
aroma
is
light
amount
of
funk
and
bitter
cherry
flavor
is
good
cherry
again
a
bit
of
funk
a
little
tart
as
well
light
on
the
palate
and
crisp
carbonation
also
the
head
laces
very
nicely
good
but
would
be
better
with
less
sugar
this
beer
is
too
sweet
and
sugary
consider
drinking
it
if
youre
reaching
for
a
smirnoff
ice
you
just
got
iced
bro
much
sweeter
and
deeper
than
traditional
lambics
i
have
had
this
isnt
bad
at
all
but
i
prefer
a
drier
more
sour
kriek
o
certainly
a
guilty
pleasure
although
its
not
necessarily
traditional
its
still
enjoyable
in
small
servings
deep
red
in
colour
topped
generously
with
offwhite
or
barely
pink
head
tart
cherry
aroma
is
simple
but
very
pleasant
while
this
has
been
sweetened
its
not
a
syrupy
mess
of
a
beer
it
is
still
predominately
tart
but
not
puckeringly
so
it
tastes
of
sour
cherries
with
a
light
tannic
note
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
this
would
work
well
as
a
simple
thirst
quencher
during
the
summertime
i
was
worried
this
would
be
a
cloying
mess
like
the
chapeau
sweetened
fruit
lambics
but
this
is
actually
decent
poured
clear
bright
red
with
a
foamy
white
head
obvious
aroma
of
cherries
with
not
much
else
coming
through
heavy
cherry
taste
more
sweet
than
sour
which
is
sometimes
good
comes
off
a
little
mediciney
than
authentic
fresh
cherries
but
still
very
nice
it
is
a
kriek
after
all
light
and
sweet
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
good
cherry
beer
overall
a
good
and
solid
kriek
d
drinks
well
for
a
tart
fruit
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
d
its
a
fruit
beer
that
tastes
like
fruit
candy
easy
to
drink
for
sure
just
not
super
interesting
d
fantastic
dessert
beer
give
me
this
with
a
chocolate
and
ill
order
it
everytime
d
pretty
drinkable
im
pretty
sure
i
could
polish
off
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
pours
crystal
clear
and
red
if
looked
at
in
light
but
a
brownish
colour
when
looked
at
from
atop
nice
head
little
lacing
but
excellent
retention
the
aromas
and
palate
are
dominated
by
dried
cherries
but
with
a
light
sourness
that
becomes
puckering
slowly
over
time
enjoyable
and
a
nice
light
sour
imo
light
body
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
well
balanced
and
refreshing
a
nice
light
fruit
limbic
please
bear
with
me
as
this
is
my
first
time
trying
lambic
i
picked
up
a
25
cl
bottle
at
carrefour
for
about
2
and
poured
it
into
a
champagne
flute
it
gave
me
about
12
of
pinkish
head
which
provide
generous
lacing
and
appeared
a
reddish
cranberry
color
it
was
clear
not
cloudy
smell
is
cherries
not
too
much
else
there
is
something
else
fruity
in
there
but
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
taste
is
malty
and
cherrries
like
a
cherry
soda
alcohol
taste
is
barely
present
mouth
feel
is
bubbly
and
lightnot
as
much
as
champagne
but
still
somewhat
dry
drinkability
is
okay
but
when
i
buy
something
belgium
i
am
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
manly
my
wife
didnt
even
like
this
may
try
again
but
when
i
can
get
a
chimay
red
for
almost
the
same
pricewhy
would
i
i
can
now
say
i
gave
it
a
try
brigt
red
cranberrycherry
couloured
body
with
a
few
fingers
of
lace
fizzling
to
some
splotches
with
some
sheets
of
lace
nose
is
a
sharp
a
tart
one
cherry
sweetness
but
there
is
a
sense
of
the
sourness
here
as
well
flavour
has
loads
of
cherry
in
it
sweet
initially
but
sours
up
against
the
cheeks
in
the
midmouth
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
goes
down
fast
and
easy
i
can
see
why
she
digs
this
fairly
likeable
and
drinkable
for
my
first
lambic
ever
surprisingly
the
beer
is
dry
tasting
and
tart
with
a
lactic
and
cherry
sourness
to
it
behind
this
is
a
note
of
sweet
baby
vomit
my
second
sip
has
a
berrylike
red
wine
character
being
noticeable
in
the
flavor
this
is
quite
tannic
though
it
is
not
overly
astringent
this
is
not
very
complexly
flavor
and
more
vaguely
fruity
with
some
faded
cherry
flavors
this
would
be
exceedingly
light
and
quaffable
if
not
for
the
tannic
cherry
skin
finish
d
the
sweetness
of
this
ruins
the
drinkability
its
ok
but
not
something
i
want
often
or
even
once
and
a
while
again
getting
away
from
juices
would
probably
make
this
better
one
as
a
novelty
is
good
enough
for
me
pours
a
pinkishred
colour
with
bubbly
white
head
lacing
has
some
coverage
of
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
cherry
almost
like
cherry
flavoured
candy
taste
is
both
sweet
and
a
sour
tartness
i
havent
had
a
lambic
before
that
i
can
remember
so
it
is
hard
to
review
to
style
but
i
do
enjoy
this
it
is
too
sweet
for
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
id
be
willing
to
have
this
again
sometime
d
a
refreshing
drink
however
i
dont
think
its
one
to
sit
down
the
pub
with
all
night
one
is
about
all
id
like
to
drink
d
looks
the
part
and
smells
promising
but
this
all
melts
away
into
a
lifeless
beer
on
the
tongue
shame
these
artificially
sweetened
lambics
are
like
fake
breasts
sure
they
look
good
and
are
appealing
on
a
purely
superficial
level
but
theyre
depthless
shallow
cosmetic
and
lack
the
distinct
character
of
real
lambics
they
may
bring
empty
gratification
but
it
comes
at
the
depreciation
of
natural
means
product
and
palate
integrity
and
traditional
values
looks
like
carbonated
cherry
nyquil
in
the
glass
cherry
soda
dominates
the
aroma
and
flavor
pretty
sweet
without
much
redeeming
tartness
has
a
dirty
aftertaste
doesnt
finish
clean
bleh
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
even
for
a
sweeter
style
lambic
xtreme
sorry
a
rather
typical
kriek
aiming
for
a
broader
public
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
as
a
digestif
with
some
strong
coffee
after
dinner
it
might
work
d
i
would
drink
it
sometimes
but
not
too
much
the
sweetness
can
be
a
little
bit
too
much
after
one
i
will
try
mort
subite
raspberry
next
time
to
see
if
it
looks
like
the
same
thing
overall
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
was
surprised
at
the
cherry
taste
not
being
sweet
i
expected
a
lot
of
sweetness
but
was
pleased
without
the
sweetness
and
slight
sour
taste
reminded
me
of
a
sour
cherry
candy
definately
a
recommend
for
someone
who
wants
a
lager
with
flavour
a
solid
and
flavourful
albeit
one
dimensional
lambic
their
framboise
seemed
to
be
a
bit
more
complex
and
a
bit
less
contrived
in
terms
of
taste
but
this
one
still
has
its
good
qualities
with
its
fantastic
appearance
and
light
and
bright
mouthfeel
id
probably
pick
one
up
again
down
the
road
but
i
feel
id
be
more
inclined
to
pick
their
framboise
over
this
after
reading
a
bit
on
this
style
i
see
the
purists
may
not
be
big
fans
they
add
juices
and
suger
to
flavour
rather
than
the
whole
fruit
375ml
corked
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pinkish
red
color
with
a
white
head
leaves
really
nice
lacing
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
cherries
the
taste
is
mostly
cherries
with
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
sourness
good
mouthfeel
with
a
light
dry
finish
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
nice
lambic
d
its
not
bad
your
middle
of
the
road
kriek
d
you
must
like
sweet
beers
to
enjoy
this
one
if
this
beer
was
cheaper
id
by
it
again
but
at
the
moment
i
cannot
justify
the
price
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
not
a
beer
i
will
pick
up
too
often
but
certainly
one
well
worth
trying
my
favourite
lambic
thus
far
i
adore
mort
subite
such
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
the
off
occasion
this
one
is
laced
with
cherries
aroma
is
very
subtle
but
you
can
detect
cherry
and
fruit
taste
is
an
explosion
of
taste
cherry
with
the
dry
bitterness
of
cranberry
with
the
bite
of
alcohol
just
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
it
tastes
sweet
with
cherries
dominating
but
has
a
nice
sour
kick
too
a
pleasantly
tasty
refreshing
and
drinkable
cherry
lambic
if
not
a
particularly
complex
one
the
only
danger
being
that
one
might
get
a
bit
tired
of
that
particular
fruit
flavour
as
with
any
fruit
beverage
however
theres
enough
going
on
here
to
obviate
that
concern
at
least
until
the
end
of
this
bottle
the
sweet
and
sour
mix
suits
my
palate
and
i
can
see
traditionalists
poohpoohing
the
sweetness
and
wanting
more
sourness
but
i
thought
it
fine
pours
the
colour
of
strawberry
juice
with
a
rocky
pink
tinged
head
that
exhibits
good
retention
and
leaves
behind
sticky
globs
of
lace
cherry
candy
aroma
mixed
with
earth
sweet
cherry
flavour
a
touch
of
cider
and
hint
of
sour
funk
and
then
coughdrop
in
the
finish
sweet
and
slightly
sticky
chewy
mouthfeel
with
soft
but
persistent
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
at
his
price
like
i
said
though
a
good
introduction
and
thats
more
or
less
where
im
at
pours
a
red
touched
ruby
with
a
thick
and
frothy
crème
head
nose
is
candied
sugars
flavor
is
cherries
sure
but
its
just
a
sweetened
seemingly
artificial
flavor
profile
clearly
additives
have
been
used
feel
is
slick
and
sticky
thick
on
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
standard
this
is
just
like
lindemans
so
if
that
is
your
thing
youll
be
able
to
appreciate
this
more
overall
not
bad
but
feels
rather
bland
im
not
terribly
familiar
with
lambics
this
seemed
like
a
nice
beer
but
i
get
the
feeling
that
there
is
more
to
the
whole
lambic
scene
than
this
im
convinced
though
that
i
want
to
try
some
others
definitely
worth
trying
magnificent
not
bad
and
definitely
a
more
appropriate
introduction
to
kriek
than
lindemans
as
it
isnt
as
sweet
and
medicinal
a
better
choice
for
easing
a
newcomer
into
the
more
traditional
sour
lambics
just
a
hint
of
sourness
this
is
not
my
favourite
style
of
beer
but
i
like
variety
and
this
makes
a
very
nice
break
from
the
ipas
and
strong
beers
that
i
usually
favour
ill
definitely
buy
it
again
dinkability
quite
good
i
could
certainly
have
more
than
one
honestly
despite
it
being
a
very
decent
cherry
tasting
fizzy
beer
it
has
an
industrial
pop
appearance
to
it
decent
not
magnificent
in
turn
i
appreciate
the
elaboration
of
cantillon
more
nowadays
d
its
good
but
the
watery
flavor
makes
this
less
appealing
i
would
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
then
the
watery
feel
would
be
the
deal
breaker
the
taste
was
dominated
by
sweet
and
sour
cherries
with
a
tingling
effervescence
much
like
champagne
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
great
way
to
finish
off
a
really
good
pot
of
mussels
worth
a
try
pass
lindemans
and
chapeau
up
for
this
stuff
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
with
sweet
cherries
and
a
bit
of
tartness
this
beer
has
a
sweetness
from
the
cherries
and
a
slight
tartness
very
balanced
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
creamy
and
the
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
solid
lambic
all
around
pours
a
crystal
clear

red

beer
with

it
smelled
like
cherries

not
as
strong
as

with

not
really
worth
any

to

not

you

recommended
its

taste
i
dont
know
what
to
say
i
think
it
fits
the
style
properly
but
it
not
my
favorite
beer
style
at
all
myabe
is
just
that
i
miss
the
taste
of
malt
from
this
beer
which
i
dont
feel
at
all
a
very
drinkable
kriek
not
a
big
tart
unsweetened
lambic
but
a
drinkable
fruit
beer
this
is
tastes
tart
and
lightly
sweet
some
sweet
spice
and
not
much
else
mouth
is
not
sticky
not
overly
sweet
even
a
bit
crisp
this
beer
is
tasty
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
special
of
course
ill
have
another
one
actually
i
am
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lambic
probably
a
little
kool
ade
for
a
died
in
the
wool
lambic
lover
but
i
really
liked
it
the
taste
is
crisp
and
only
slightly
tast
and
the
surprisingly
large
head
adds
a
creamy
aspect
aspect
to
the
mouthfeel
the
level
of
acidity
makes
there
more
of
a
lemon
taste
than
a
cherry
taste
though
some
cherry
notes
are
still
there
later
as
the
beer
warms
the
sweet
cherry
flavor
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
mmm
highly
drinkable
and
an
excellent
kriek
one

not
a

to

just
a
hint
of
cherry
sweetness
very
carbonated
lively
tongue
and

not
complex
tasting
at
all
decent

no
impressive
layers
of
flavor
and
complexity
that
you
expect
from
this

bottle

poured
a
reddish
brew
with
good
carbonation
aroma
of
cherries
is
overpowering
with
nothing
else
coming
out
in
terms
of
aroma
taste
is
bit
too
much
cheery
with
not
enough
tart
and
tannic
overall
this
one
is
very
refreshing
but
not
the
best
from
mort

nor
close
to
the
great
kriek
lambic
this
kriek
poured
a
clear
red
amber
with
pink
foam
that
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
modest
cherry
aroma
not
too
sweet
the
taste
was
dominated
by
sweet
cherries
though
not
overly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
moderate
carbonation
a
tart
cherry
flavor
lingered
a
bit
as
an
aftertaste
this
was
an
ok
kriek
fairly
refreshing
red
tinged
gold
2
fingers
head
this
is
a
lot
lighter
than
belle
vue
unfortunately
thats
the
only
other
kriek
ive
had
rather
sweet
some
cherry
flavour
its
more
of
a
flavoured
gueuze
than
a
proper
kriek
goes
down
well
its
red
but
not
candy
red
its
drier
than
the
framboise
the
cherry
is
there
but
it
meshes
with
the
gone
sour
taste
the
cherry
seems
to
go
really
well
with
the
natural
lambic
flavors
sweet
cherry
flavour
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
late
sourness
and
tartness
pretty
light
and
refreshing
which
makes
it
good
to
drink
in
summer
however
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
tastes
of
slightly
tart
cherries
among
earthy
barely
noteable
malts
a
crisp
note
of
lemon
peel
as
well
as
a
higher
carbonation
invite
the
funk
which
turns
quite
sour
with
a
dry
aspect
to
it
while
it
never
overpowers
the
cherries
instead
the
cherries
seem
to
rejuvenate
while
the
sourness
increases
evoking
a
refreshing
spriziness
the
sour
aspect
includes
a
fermented
fruit
note
as
well
as
a
glimpse
of
vinegar
among
wooden
malts
which
turn
more
recognizable
towards
the
finish
together
with
sweet
ripe
cherries
as
the
funk
settles
down
a
fruity
slick
cherry
flavor
remains
on
the
tongue
for
a
longer
while
with
the
sourness
already
faded
not
what
you
would
expect
from
a
kriek

horseblanket
thing
going
on
the
flavor
is
very
nice
it
doesnt
have
as
much
of
the
sour
character
that
was
in
the
nose
but
subdued
in
the
background
behind
the
funk
the
feel
was
thin
to
moderate
and
the
healthy
carbonation
only
enhances
the
whole
experience
thoroughly
drinkable

real
big
fan

this
is

quite
dry

beer

very
savoury
big
rich
raspberry
nose
with
a
touch
of
tartness
light
lemon
and
a
slight
funk
it
pours
brilliant
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
whisp
of
a
head
the
palate
is
exquisite
with
just
the
right
amount
of
lemony
tartness
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
back
the
story
here
is
deep
dry
raspberry
flavors
as
raspberry
as
it
is
possible
to
get
with
traces
of
malt
and
wheat
in
the
background
light
body
with
medium
high
carbonation
nothing
cloying
or
over
sweet
grab
a
bottle
of
this
a
baguette
some
smelly
cheese
and
sit
in
the
park
all
day
and
watch
the
roller
skaters
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
super
refreshing
fruit
lambic
not
with
a
heavy
tartness
or
funky
complex
dont
try
to
compare
it
to
a
gambrinus
i
could
have
several
of
those
drinkability
goes
down
easy
though
i
find
the
bitterness
a
bit
offputting
its
simply
not
my
cup
of
tea
tried
it
on
tap
and
it
was
just
too
fruity
the
perfect
balance
of
cherry
and
raspberry
flavors
fortunate
enough
to
have
this
one
on
draft
a
really
great
beer
all
up
enormously
better
than
their
base
kriek
i
think
the
fruit
is
less
medicinal
and
the
lambic
base
comes
through
more
i
see
more
grain
more
sourness
and
a
better
mouthfeel
that
isnt
so
weighted
down
by
fruit
sugars
the
raspberry
nose
is
robust
and
the
flavor
is
just
as
true
a
little
tart
a
lot
summery
and
all
fruit
on
the
finish
clear
in
color
way
more
clear
than
the
kriek
with
a
brilliant
ruby
red
as
its
base
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
i
smell
what
i
taste
and
im
fine
with
that
although
this
is
nowhere
near
as
dynamic
or
compelling
as
the
best
framboise
on
the
market
i
do
think
its
a
step
up
from
the
elementary
kriek
in
its
fruit
authenticity
and
its
dryness
which
is
only
medium
but
way
less
sweet
than
the
cherry
i
also
think
its
more
drinkable
for
the
same
reason
again
nowhere
near
as
good
as
some
of
the
more
mature
beers
they
do
oude
kriek
for
example
but
awfully
good
and
a
darn
good
presentation
of
what
raspberry
can
do
in
a
simple
base
beer
great
raspberry
flavor
but
too
sweet
for
my
taste
overall
a
good
beer
in
the
belgian
style
lambic
this
pours
a
clear
red
persimmon
color
theres
a
slight
funk
and

get

raspberry

lots
of
flavored
raspberries
with
a
touch
of
the
green
apple
decent
enough
loving
how
this
beer
came
together
it
simply
lacks
the
depth
of
earth
dryness
and
aged
complexities
that
great
fruit
lambics
offer
its
a
flawless
beer
for
its
age
but
its
still
a
pup
of
a
beer
while
tasty
and
mostly
easy
to
drink
with
a
heady
amount
of
veritable
raspberry
goodness
the
overall
complexity
seems
just
a
tad
lacking
this
is
just
in
relation
to
other
versions
of
the
style
and
meant
solely
as
constructive
criticism

improve

overall
maybe
its
because
i
drank
a
cantillon

the

but
this
raspberry

is
lacking
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
a
traditional

tasty
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
when
there
are
better

adds

this

good
brew
i
have
had
this
one
multiple
times
in
the
bottle
and
couldnt
pass
it
up
on
tap
i
definitely
did
not
make
a
mistake
here
unfortunately
this
one
didnt
shine
as
the
last
bottle
that
i
had
all
of
the
right
flavors
were
there
but
they
just
werent
as
intense
as
i
remembered
the

being

mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
on
the
carbonation
aspect
compared
to
what
i
enjoyed
about
this
out
of

still
an
absolute
must
try
regardless
of

decent
example
of
a

to
go
with
it
if
you
ask
me
tart
raspberry
with
a
whole

of
pucker
or
fresh
raspberry
with
some
pleasant

sweetness
this
one
halved
each
category
and
almost
pulled
it
off
would
pick
up
again
overall
really
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
during
the
summer
heat
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
even
after
the
not
so
appealing
appearance
very
nice
tartness
and
the
raspberry
flavor
was
perfect

dark

a
short

just
a

spots
of

down
thin

the
nose
carries
fresh
raspberries
along
with
a
bit
of
earthy
must
and
just
a
touch
of
acidity
the
flavor
is
predominantly
raspberries
but
also
has
a
slight
medicinal
quality
body
is
light
and
dry
with
some
medicinal
character
very
light
acidity
could
be
a
good
starter
lambic
o
i
think
i
see
the
appeal
of
this
beer
even
though
its
not
my
personal
favorite
style
seemed
to
hit
the
fruit
notes
and
add
a
bit
of
malt
and
sourness
for
intrigue
i
wish
it
were
less
sour
and
the
juicy
berries
were
allowed
to
flow
more
overall
this
is
probably
the
most
winelike
beer
i
have
had
to
date
still
the
fingerprints
of
lambic
are
all
over
this
one
its
the
type
of
beer
that
should
make
fans
of
sweet
beers
beer
geeks
and
sour
fiends

get

sweet

very
little
sour
punch
medium

with

certainly
not
the
worst
framboise
out
there
but
ive
had
much
better
medium

ditto
for
the
carbonation
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
its
easy
enough
to
drink
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
a
repeat
isnt
necessary
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
i
just
cant
get
over
the
sweetness
cant
pull
any
oak
out
of
this
one
an
impressive
lambic
though
at
least
for
my
palate
a
bit
less
sour
funk
and
a
touch
more
fruit
would
have
been
appreciated
o
a
good
framboise
definitely
in
the
middle
of
the
sweettart
spectrum
compared
to
others
of
the
style
while
it
didnt
blow
me
away
i
could
see
revisiting
this
one
in
the
future
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
i
have
had
much
better
framboise
that
have
stronger
beer
characteristics
however
if
you
are
looking
for
a
raspberry
champagne
for
new
years
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
dpretty
easy
drinking
and
not
too
sour
for
those
beginning
to
experiment
with
sour
beers
very
approachable
and
nuanced
beer
overall
raspberry
sours
are
among
my
favorite
style
and
fruit
treatment
but
this
one
was
just
done
with
a
flavor
that
is
a
little
too
casual
for
my
liking
simply
sweet
there
is
just
not
a
ton
of
complexity
here
to
ever
pique
my
interest
overall
i
thought
there
was
an
odd
taste
in
the
finish
of
this
one
i
dont
think
i
would
have
another
very
red
pour
with
a
huge
pink
head
the
lacing
and
retention
are
phenomenal
very
sweat
aroma
no
funk
or
acidity
tart
raspberries
and
fruits
take
it
over
the
taste
is
of
sweet
dry
raspberries
not
particularly
funky
the
beer
still
steers
clear
of
the
fruit
juice
moniker
sometimes
placed
on
sweeter
lambics
dry
finish
strange
aftertaste
tart
and
carbonated
well
it
was
very
sweet
but
not
on
the
level
of
timmermans
thankfully
i
enjoyed
it
3
5
d
decent
beer
but
not
as
complex
or
as
fruity
as
id
like
for
a
young
framboise
o
this
was
the
worst
of
the
three
the
fruit
was
really
only
present
in
the
taste
and
even
there
it
was
a
bit
dull
add
to
that
the
disappointing
nose
and
this
one
really
isnt
on
par
with
its
counterparts
o
like
a
delicious
raspberry
soda
with
a
dash
of
malt
drink
that
is
highly
sessionable
i
think
i
ordered
three
of
them
the
raspberries
did
come
out
well
not
too
sweet
and
stuffy
the
sourness
of
the
lambic
saves
the
brew
and
makes
it
refreshing
raspberry
preserves
are
prevalent
in
the
nose
light
tart
notes
keep
things
interesting
very
tasty
stuff
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
raspberry
flavors
midswallow
a
burst
of
carbonation
helps
keep
the
palate
refreshed
a
bit
musty
a
bit
earthy
an
approachable
reasonably
complex
lambic
definitely
worth
a
try
i
love
this
framboise
very
drinkable
one
that
doesnt
require
a
notepad
and
a
10way
pour
to
enjoy
its
one
i
revisit
often
o
this
is
the
first
framboise
ive
rewieved
on
ba
this
one
is
nice
like
most
products
from
oud
beersel
the
raspberries
balanced
the
brett
in
a
nice
way
o
this
is
the
first
lambic
i
have
not
loved
this
is
not
bad
but
not
the
price
i
was
hoping
for
a
solid
lambic
and
got
something
that
tasted
like
an
ok
fruit
beer
if
i
wanted
something
that
tasted
like
this
i
would
buy
more
american
fruit
beers
overall
i
think
this
one
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
ill
have
to
grab
something
else
in
this
style
taste
is
light
woodyfunky
yeastiness
with
faintly
sweettart
raspberry
dryish
with
a
lingering
gentle
funky
character
at
the
end
plus
light
woodiness
and
light
sourness
it
is
very
nice
best
before

this
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brownish
purple
in
color
with
a
two
finger
bubble
bath
like
white
head
there
were
also
chunks
of
sediment
in
the
pour
and
they
dispersed
along
the
bottom
of
my
founders
snifter
the
aromas
are
surprisingly
of
very
fresh
raspberries
or
a
raspberry
dessert
i
expected
them
to
be
muted
but
theyre
actually
quite
pungent
and
feature
both
a
nice
sweetness
and
nice
tart
aspect
the
flavors
begin
sweet
before
fading
into
a
light
raspberry
tart
the
finish
is
kind
of
strange
which
could
be
from
the
sediment
it
tastes
kind
of
yeasty
and
bitter
on
the
finish
its
almost
like
the
flavor
you
get
when
you
bite
into
raspberry
seeds
it
drinks
fine
and
isnt
overly
sweet
or
tart
i
can
see
why
some
people
wouldnt
like
this
and
i
can
see
why
some
people
would
its
almost
right
in
between
sweet
and
sour
framboise
i
guess
it
depends
on
your
preference
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
in
my
opinion
pours
a
very
dark
semiopaque
crimson
red
with
a
small
12
inch
light
red
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
random
fingers
of
lace

raspberry
other
mixed

blueberry
comes
out
with
only
a
slight

smell
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
with
an
intense
berry
flavor
blast
mainly
raspberry
other
berries
too
up
front
with
only
a
slight
bit
of
sour

coming
through
on
the
finish
a
bit
of
fruit
rindstem
bitterness
after
each
sip
carbonation
level
is
somewhat
high
which
makes
for
a
crisp
soda
like
mouthfeel
the
beer
leaves
the
palate
a
bit
sticky
after
each
sip
again
like
a
soda
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
raspberry
lambic
that
is
quite
different
from
ones
i
have
had
in
the
past
a
very
tasty
treat
the
mouthfeel
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
lower
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
really
reminded
me
of
my
moms
raspberry
pie
which
is
a
good
thing
the
fresh
raspberry
flavor
was
very
nicely
done
and
the
tart
slight
sour
flavors
really
helped
balance
it
out
some
and
make
it
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
definitely
not
one
of
the
sourer
beers
of
the
style
though
d
a
decent
lambic
definitely
on
the
milder
side
not
very
sour
either
but
just
a
little
bit
of
tartness
easy
to
enjoy
though
on
of
the
few
good
examples
of
framboise
that
i
have
had
on
tap
yum
my
wife
was
very
pleased
with
the
choice
thanks
for
pulling
this
out
rob
this
is
a
treat

i
would
drink
this
again
but
id
rather
have
a
lindemans
d
overall
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
had
hoped
for
while
it
still
resembles
a
true
lambic
its
dominant
fresh
raspberry
flavor
destroys
any
merits
it
receives
from
the
funk
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
certainly
didnt
pay
8
to
drink
this
if
you
like
wine
then
this
is
for
you
this
is
a
beer
to
get
a
wine
drinker
drinking
with
you
and
be
none
the
wiser
it
was
ok
but
i
would
not
order
it
again
unless
i
wanted
wine
instead
of
beer
brouwerij
oud
beersel
easily
one
of
the
best
framboise
ive
had
to
date
and
its
just
as
good
in
bottle
as
on
draft
d
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
because
the
fruity
and
sweet
flavors
do
not
overpower
the
taste
d
the
full
fruit
is
nice
and
not
sweet
with
some
soft
lambic
wild
characters
underneath
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
nice
relatively
straightforward
lambic
it
is
well
balanced
not
too
complex
but
also
not
too
demanding
definitely
quite
quaffable
pours
a
very
dark
red
almost
purple
with
a
medium
white
head
the
kriek
looks
way
prettier
scent
is
slightly
funky
with
a
lot
of
raspberry
and
pomegranate
aromas
this
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
pomegranate
beer
taste
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
loved
the
kriek
from
this
brewery
so
was
hoping
for
something
as
sour
definitely
not
a
sour
beer
way
more
sweet
still
very
tasty
with
great
raspberry
and
pomegranate
flavors
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
and
a
bit
overcarbed
drinkability
is
fair
poured
a
purplish
pink
in
color
with
reddish
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
a
little
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
brew
definitely
had
raspberry
aroma
with
some
oaky
funky
character
but
did
have
acetic
notes
and
some
weird
buttery
notes
that
almost
overpowered
the
whole
nose
strange
the
taste
was
quite
dominated
by
the
rasberrries
but
was
more
sweet
than
sour
or
tart
but
it
did
still
have
oaky
funky
and
acetic
accents
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
mild
fruity
oaky
slight
funky
and
very
mild
tart
finish
it
drank
very
good
but
it
definitely
not
a
favorite
for
the
style
a
young
lambic
this
one
is
only
supposed
to
exhibit
mild
levels
of
funk
and
acid
dark
reddish
purple
with
a
pink
head
nose
is
real
fresh
raspberry
with
an
underlying
oak
vanilla
funk
and
tannin
taste
is
wellbalanced
between
sweet
and
sour
and
carries
just
enough
funk
to
let
you
know
this
is
the
real
thing
medium
body
sort
of
slick
with
nice
tingle
from
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
real
pleasure
that
this
is
available
at
one
of
dcs
best
music
venues
pfunk
and
oud
beersel
framboise
a
winning
combination
for
sure
d
nowhere
near
as
good
as
their
gueuze
or
kriek
plenty
of
other
good
lambics
out
there
that
i
would
recommend
instead
tassssteeee
way
to
go
oud
beersel
this
is
the
stuff
good
as
they
get
d
not
bad
this
beer
is
a
far
cry
from
the
cantillons
and
drie
fonteinens
of
the
world
but
is
is
solid
nonetheless
lacks
the
puckering
sourness
that
i
desire
still
much
better
than
some
of
the
overly
sweet
fruit
lambics
that
are
out
there
i
preferred
the
oud
beersel
kriek
to
this
framboise
looking
forward
to
trying
the
geueze
d
a
beautiful
summer
drink
but
works
just
as
well
on
a
cool
fall
day
taste
and
easy
to
drink
very
nice
not
bad
by
any
means
but
nothing
i
will
buy
again
it
tastes
just
as
it
smells
sweet
and
sour
with
a
nice
multidimensional
raspberry
character
theres
a
bit
of
tannic
astringency
that
may
be
the
byproduct
of
both
oak
aging
snd
raspberry
seedsskin
which
does
something
to
balance
the
sweetness
this
is
more
fruit
beer
than
true
framboise
to
me
but
its
not
bad
i
would
order
this
again
if
in
the
mood
when
available
respectable
for
the
style
not
bad
and
has
a
little
more
complexity
than
lindemans
for
example
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
among
those
brewers
still
making
a
traditional
framboise
poured
gently
into
a
goblet
thin
lacing
floats
on
top
of
a
mahogany
colored
body
the
carbonation
bubbles
are
racing
to
the
top
of
this
one
its
darker
than
i
expected
smells
like
sweet
vinegar
not
much
raspberry
to
be
detected
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
immediately
disappointing
too
sweet
for
me
there
is
only
a
faint
tartness
that
i
get
mostly
from
the
raspberry
flavor
not
much
funk
in
this
one
the
balance
reminds
me
of
a
flanders
red
in
the
vane
of
monks
cafe
or
duchess
i
would
have
a
hard
time
recommending
this
one
to
anyone
d
i
like
the
sweeter
style
lambics
i
know
some
dont
and
thats
okay
i
recommed
this
to
some
one
wanting
to
get
started
into
lambics
thank
god
for
cantillon
girardin
drie
fonteinen
et
al
there
should
be
a
clearer
designation
between
authentic
fruit
lambics
and
these
sodas
especially
when
you
can
buy
authentic
quality
lambic
for
the
same
expensive
price
overall
great
a
must
try
one
of
the
highlights
of
my
day
i
will
do
my
best
to
seek
this
one
out
again
sometime
somewhere
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
few
white
bubbles
not
much
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
raspberries
and
oak
with
the
fruit
standing
out
the
flavor
is
very
heavy
on
the
raspberries
with
some
light
oak
there
is
very
little
tartness
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
in
retrospect
i
should
have
let
this
beer
age
for
quite
a
bit
longer
but
with
no
bottling
date
i
thought
it
was
older
than
it
was
still
not
a
bad
beer
the
finish
is
light
and
oaky
oud
beersel
framboise
probably
isnt
hardcore
enough
for
the
lambic
purists
and
it
isnt
sweet
enough
for
the
casual
crowd
im
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
those
two
extremes
and
it
doesnt
really
appeal
to
me
either
at
least
not
enough
to
buy
it
again
d
pretty
inoffensive
and
goes
down
fairly
easily
but
a
huge
disappointment
i
was
expecting
something
more
along
the
lines
of
oud
beersel
oude
kriek
vielle
this
is
definitely
not
in
the
same
ballpark
dthis
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
very
sweet
good
feel
to
it
with
a
nice
smoothness
on
the
palate
not
too
tart
at
all
with
all
of
the
raspberry
goodness
oude
beersels
fram
has
a
deep
dark
red
berry
look
with
some
light
shades
of
purple
no
lacing
comes
from
it
and
its
hard
to
come
up
with
a
cap
its
all
good
though
smell
is
of
weak
raspberries
with
a
tinge
of
chocolate
and
lactic
sourness
it
tastes
like
raspberries
and
thats
pretty
much
it
not
the
boldest
ive
had
but
good
enough
not
really
complex
for
me
though
pretty
simple
the
feel
is
a
bit
tart
and
a
step
below
the
medium
side
carb
is
stable
after
having
this
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
have
it
again
solid
workmanlike
framboise
better
than
most
raspberry
lambics
which
still
appeal
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
sour
beer
drinkers
pours
a
clear
raspberry
red
with
with
a
finebubbled
slightly
pinkish
beige
head
rich
aroma
is
mainly
raspberry
with
a
firm
malty
undertone
malty
yeasty
raspberry
flavor
is
both
sour
and
sweet
quite
pleasing
texture
is
lively
and
quite
tingly
definitely
for
anyone
who
loves
raspberry
d
this
is
a
very
good
raspberry
lambic
it
has
a
somewhat
soft
character
but
offers
some
complexity
with
oak
raspberries
and
two
different
kinds
of
sour
well
done
overallwould
not
mind
having
it
again
framboise
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
as
is
traditional
gueuze
this
brings
a
bit
of
both
very
nicely
in
a
highly
drinkable
brew
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
nice
framboise
in
the
middle
of
the
sweetsour
spectrum
fairly
refreshing
but
the
blood
taste
i
could
do
without
due
to
the
extreme
low
lighting
in
the
tt
its
hard
to
get
a
great
look
at
what
your
drinking
they
poured
it
in
a
wine
goblet
probably
1012
ounces
the
color
was
raspberry
with
no
head
the
smell
was
pretty
much
nothing
only
a
hint
of
raspberry
the
taste
was
very
good
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
you
get
the
raspberry
flavor
and
when
it
gets
to
the
back
the
sourness
really
kicks
in
this
is
a
nice
toasting
drink
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
totally
eh
those
looking
for
a
good
sour
lambic
should
look
elsewhere
those
looking
for
a
moderately
raspberry
flavored
mellow
beer
could
do
worse
why
why
why
beer
is
buttery
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
and
very
sour
not
tart
hurts
my
mouth
to
drink
it
finishes
completely
and
wet
a
very
interesting
beer
even
though
the
beer
didnt
seem
carbonated
once
in
my
mouth
it
was
filled
with
carbon
and
it
helped
to
bring
out
the
sour
notes
in
the
beer
probably
too
much
drinkability
is
really
high
and
so
is
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
great
beer
very
nice
fresh
raspberry
finish
with
hints
of
citrus
mouthfeel
is
ok
drinkability
is
strong
classic
framboise
flavors
without
an
overly
sour
bite
this
has
a
fresh
raspberry
flavor
without
extra
sugar
added
nice
body
with
a
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
great
mildly
sour
aftertastelike
swallowing
a
unsweetened
raspberry
jam
drinkability
is
decent
sweet
raspberries
with
little
else
it
could
be
better
with
a
sour
or
funky
note
but
it
ends
up
being
little
more
than
fruit
juice
without
much
sugar
on
the
palate
d
drinkability
not
so
much
if
it
were
to
be
sweet
like
lindemans
framboise
then
id
want
much
more
mouthfeel
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
tart
raspberry
flavor
and
didnt
get
that
either
ultimately
i
finished
the
glass
but
will
not
be
ordering
again
anytime
soon
overall
this
isnt
cloyingly
sweet
but
its
still
too
sweet
for
my
liking
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
framboises
on
the
sweeter
side
d
goes
down
very
easy
lightness
on
the
palate
acidity
pleasant
fruitiness
crisp
mouthfeel
make
this
a
pleasure
appearance
is
gorgeous
with
rubies
and
light
brown
hues
there
is
a
good
deal
of
sediment
floating
around
aromas
are
huge
raspberries
freshly
picked
with
dirt
and
earth
all
over
them
flavors
are
similar
the
tartness
of
the
raspberries
tickles
my
tongue
and
puckers
my
mouth
this
brew
goes
down
smoothly
with
high
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
i
can
sip
on
lambics
all
day
and
this
one
was
a
pleasure
very
reminiscent
of
ng
raspberry
tart
this
raspberry
lambic
isnt
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
to
find
the
raspberry
character
is
bursting
from
the
glass
but
theres
too
much
malt
for
my
liking
and
not
enough
sour
now
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
when
compared
to
some
of
the
other
delicious
lambics
out
there
it
falls
far
short
d
quite
nice
a
good
example
of
a
genuine
lambic
made
with
whole
raspberries
not
sweetened
or
dramatically
sour
but
a
nice
middle
ground
really
drinkable
due
to
its
balance
and
really
dry
finish
and
body
hv
d
this
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
a
fun
experience
nonetheless
nope
this
doesnt
do
it
for
me
d
great
sweet
raspberry
flavor
it
drinks
like
a
champagne
or
fruity
soda
d
my
first
dabble
into
a
real
lambic
framboise
pretty
refreshing
im
ready
to
try
more
drinks
easy
but
after
a
fe
w
the
dryness
would
drive
me
in
search
of
something
cleaner
or
maltier
very
nice
lambic
o
d
overalla
great
framboise
it
is
of
the
more
drinkable
kind
but
still
authentic
if
you
want
a
good
fruit
beer
with
some
funk
that
you
dont
need
12
tums
to
finish
this
is
your
winner
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
lambics
not
too
tart
not
too
acidic
but
not
too
sweet
as
well
nice
balance
good
lambic
and
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style

this
is
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
wanting
to
get
into
guezes
and
other
sours
anyway
its
a
good
lambic
and
as
usual
gets
great
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
this
one
really
grew
on
me
375ml
bottle
split
with
a
friend
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
sour
but
it
was
more
tart
if
that
makes
any
sense
it
smelled
like
raspberry
preserves
very
jammy
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
muddy
wet
hay
and
barnyard
the
taste
was
heavily
raspberry
but
not
sweet
or
cloying
good
but
i
preferred
their
kriek
drinkability
a
decent
enough
and
competent
enough
fruit
lambic
at
least
on
draft
while
it
isnt
quite
as
exquisite
as
the
cantillon
and
3
fonteinen
i
cheerfully
finished
my
glass
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
clouded
red
nose
is
oddly
funked
seems
almost
like
old
shoes
maybe
some
honey
too
flavor
is
firm
raspberries
not
a
whole
lot
of
funkiness
to
it
but
there
is
a
good
fruit
flavor
to
it
similar
to
the
intensity
of
lindemans
but
you
can
easily
tell
this
is
all
natural
it
gets
a
4
5
on
flavor
because
the
fruit
is
so
balanaced
and
natural
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
low
but
silky
this
is
a
nice
lambic
the
fruit
is
a
bit
too
intense
but
it
still
works
out
beautifull
deep
ruby
red
with
a
creamy
pinkish
head
the
nose
is
a
perfect
blend
of
tart
raspberries
musky
oak
and
funk
taste
is
also
well
balanced
rich
sweet
raspberries
complimented
by
sour
funkyness
full
silky
body
is
well
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
dry
finish
a
fantastic
brew
from
oud
beersel
drinkability
fun
to
sip
on
but
not
something
to
drink
in
quantity
bottle
shared
at
tasting
pours
a
cranberry

with
a
light
filmy
white

smell

strong

and
dry
tart
raspberries
very
fizzy
and
bubbly
in
the
mouth
light
tart
funkiness
as
well
in
the
flavor
pretty
good
i
thought
close
tie
to
lindemans
but
i
still
need
to
explore
the
style
a
bit
more
drinkability
a
nice
sweet
afterdinner
drink
but
it
had
a
little
too
much
wild
funk
for
me
to
tolerate
d
awesome
just
about
the
perfect
mixture
of
fresh
and
natural
raspberry
spice
and
tangy
acidity
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
pinkred
with
a
pinkish
frothy
head
smells
of
tart
raspberries
with
layered
vinous
aromas
in
the
background
somewhat
acetic
but
in
balance
the
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
to
my
liking
sour
slightly
woody
flavors
and
a
fresh
raspberry
zinginess
followed
by
some
more
complex
tannins
and
slight
funk
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
perhaps
a
tad
too
much
so
a
little
bit
more
astringency
would
be
nice
very
enjoyable
indeed
color
was
a
bit
redder
than
amber
the
foam
on
top
was
light
and
incredibly
sour
great
head
retention
it
had
a
very
dry
crisp
aroma
to
it
that
immediately
sucked
me
in
very
unique
and
enjoyable
d
this
is
an
unusually
drinkable
example
of
the
style
if
there
is
a
weak
point
in
this
beer
it
is
the
aroma
which
is
a
bit
weak
and
lacks
some
of
the
spectacular
complexity
found
in
the
nose
of
other
classic
fruit
lambics
the
flavor
however
is
perfectly
balanced
and
the
funk
and
sourness
are
masterfully
restrained
to
the
point
that
they
allow
the
beer
to
remain
easy
to
drink
while
maintaining
the
complexity
of
a
great
lambic
d
a
very
good
fruit
lambic
funkier
and
tarter
than
lindemans
not
as
dry
as
cantillon
but
a
solid
drinking
beer
a
very
good
lambic
in
my
opinion
very
tasty
and
drinkable
poured
out

certainly
more

foamed
up
a

not

with

residual
of

taste
raspberry

candies
with
a
little
dryness
to
sweetness
of
the
beer
but
still
more
sweet
than
dry
mouthfeel
is
tart
and
pops
with
a
lightness
and
a
steady
carbonation
helps
give
a
little
for
body
to
the
mouthfeel
its
good
framboise
for
those
looking
for
more
sweetness
in
their
fruit
lambics
a
little
more
complex
than
sweeter
framboise
such
as
lindemans
or
cherish
but
less
complex
than
boon
cantillon
or
drie
fonteinen
framboise
not
bad
for
a
sweetened
framboise
not
overly
sweet
and
enough
tartness
to
provide
a
nice
balance
it
doesnt
rise
to
the
great
heights
of
the
more
traditional
offerings
from
oud
beersel
but
its
still
excellent
in
its
own
right
d
i
can
drink
a
couple
bottles
of
these
in
a
setting
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
disappointing
beer
not
a
bad
one
necessarily
but
just
disappointing

the

thanks
for

logan
drinkability
not
amazing
due
to
the
metalic
mouthfeel
and
bitterness
drinkable
nonetheless
i
do
like
the
ultra
sourness
but
might
enjoy
a
bit
more
raspberry
i
could
hardly
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
and
for
someone
unaccustomed
to
this
style
of
beer
it
grew
on
me
pretty
quickly
its
not
for
everyone
but
for
those
who
like
fruity
beers
with
taste
substance
and
durability
this
will
fit
nicely
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
place
like
the
steelgaarden
here
in
jersey
cheers
da
its
pretty
easy
to
go
through
this
beer
the
sourness
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
and
it
allows
for
more
quaffing
than
is
usual
for
a
sour
beer
cheers
overall
ive
enjoyed
the
other
oud
beersel
lambics
that
ive
tried
theyve
all
been
sour
with
a
mild
funky
character
this
one
was
good
for
a
sweeter
lambic
but
disappointing
to
me
because
it
was
a
sweet
lambic
a
beer
my
wife
ordered
at
the
pizza
plant
i
tired
it
and
liked
it
enough
to
get
my
ownpoured
into
a
small
chalice
a
murky
kind
of
brownish
red
with
a
well
formed
light
pinkish
colored
head
tart
raspberry
and
oaky
sherry
notes
mainlyquite
tingly
in
the
mouth
maybe
a
bit
muchdecent
sweetness
upfront
and
flavors
of
raspberry
puree
a
sherry
vinegarlike
sour
note
comes
thru
late
along
with
a
woody
presence
at
first
its
tasty
but
it
seems
to
become
a
little
less
palatable
after
a
bit
the
vinegar
like
sourness
is
annoying
after
a
bit
if
you
dont
drink
much
of
this
beer
its
greatall
in
all
iam
glad
i
tried
it
overall
this
is
quite
an
amazing
beer
usually
im
not
so
much
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
with
the
sourness
of
the
lactic
acids
it
balances
very
well
definately
drink
this
one
again
one
bottle
is
enough
unless
you
are
really
into
acidic
fruit
juice
raspberry
nose
without
much
of
the
candy
found
in
many
other
framboise
lambics
medicinal
raspberry
flavor
with
white
pepper
about
as
tart
as
a
raspberry
tame
as
far
as
lambics
go
but
pretty
nice
grassy
profile
screaming
to
be
paired
with
a
dinner
salad
with
raspberry
vinegarette
mouthfeel
lost
a
few
points
for
the
thick
sugars
that
hurt
my
teeth
although
its
not
as
bad
as
some
others
much
better
than
the
gueuze
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
cheers
drinkability
is
not
good
this
stuff
will
sour
your
stomach
quick
a
unique
version
of
framboise
that
isnt
all
sugary
sweet
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
nice
to
find
a
lambic
that
wasnt
as
sweet
as
lindemans
but
not
as
sour
and
funky
as
cantillon
this
was
definitely
a
nice
middle
path
between
the
two
this
was
definitely
a
tasty
one
but
the
tart
aftertaste
made
this
a
bit
hard
to
drink
taste
very
successful
balancing
act
between
sweet
and
funk
the
former
taking
more
room
at
first
but
then
the
prickly
carbonation
and
acidity
slowly
released
more
barnyard
flavors
within
the
steady
stream
of
fruit
of
raspberries
that
had
some
sugar
but
tasted
like
they
werent
quite
ripe
enough
very
very
nice
sampled
at
coles
belgium
fest
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
plenty
of
bubbly
carbonation
that
gives
a
creamy
aspect
to
each
sip
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
as
it
lacks
the
strong
acidity
that
some
lambics
tend
to
have
not
something
id
choose
on
a
regular
basis
but
always
a
nice
treat
ill
be
looking
forward
to
sampling
the
kriek
and
gueuze
sometime
soon
uf
draught
raspberry
red
color
with
a
nonpink
foam
artificial
raspberry
aroma
with
zero
lambic
qualities
to
back
up
the
fruit
flavor
is
unbelievably
sweet
not
sour
with
little
other
character
besides
raspberries
thin
body
crappy
nontraditional
lambic
for
lindemans
framboise
fans
and
preteens
i
wish
i
had
a
champagne
flute
for
this
im
drinking
from
my
slimmest
glass
but
i
cant
help
but
think
that
tall
and
thin
would
be
better
i
always
enjoy
framboise
so
was
happy
to
try
this
one
my
pour
was
a
hazy
tea
color
with
a
ting
of
henna
there
was
a
wisp
of
raspberry
aroma
in
the
air
tastewise
definitely
raspberries
but
i
picked
up
on
a
bit
of
concord
grapes
in
the
taste
as
well
interesting
contrast
and
i
appreciated
the
complexity
definite
dry
finish
with
noticeable
tannins
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
a
touch
sweet
for
my
taste
but
i
dont
regret
buying
it
in
the
least
nice
burgundy
color
but
with
only
a
faint
bit
of
froth
on
top
aroma
of
tart
raspberries
and
wild
yeast
present
with
a
mild
smell
of
alcohol
taste
is
strong
initially
i
notice
sweet
raspberry
flavor
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
which
becomes
slightly
tart
but
not
overdone
alcohol
is
somewhat
evident
in
finish
but
doesnt
affect
the
drinkability
very
bubbly
and
feels
slightly
thin
on
the
palate
i
felt
this
was
more
drinkable
than
many
other
lambics
as
the
sourness
was
not
as
overpowering
as
i
could
have
been
i
was
able
to
enjoy
it
without
being
turned
off
by
any
overly
strong
flavors
not
bad
at
all
but
if
anything
it
lacks
a
little
funky
tartness
that
i
suspect
the
oud
beersel
drinkers
would
wish
to
see
let
me
start
off
by
saying
that
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
flavored
lambics
ive
tried
the
ultra
sweet
ones
e
g
lindemans
and
the
ultra
pucker
ones
e
g
cantillon
and
they
were
ok
had
their
good
points
and
bad
i
could
appreciate
what
they
had
done
but
overall
i
have
yet
to
find
any
that
i
really
just
enjoyed
sitting
there
and
drinking
well
i
finally
found
one
fresh
raspberries
but
in
a
subtle
toned
down
way
that
allows
the
beery
lambic
to
also
be
present
not
overly
sour
but
enough
sour
to
keep
it
from
being
boring
i
liked
it
so
much
i
wanted
to
try
it
again
today
but
it
was
already
gone
finished
off
on
the
first
day
of
a
2
week
festival
id
love
to
have
it
again
hopefully
next
time
out
of
a
bottle
just
to
see
whats
different
had
this
lambic
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
in
decatur
ga
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
heavy
pinkish
tinge
to
it
the
head
is
over
1
thick
and
lasts
throughout
the
session
the
smell
is
grassy
with
a
bit
of
raspberry
thrown
in
i
can
already
tell
by
the
smell
that
this
is
more
of
a
traditional
lambic
the
taste
proves
it
it
isnt
over
the
top
sweet
it
has
a
good
sweetsour
balance
and
the
raspberries
are
not
overpowering
one
of
the
best
lambics
that
ive
had
so
far
drinkability
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
be
able
to
drink
throughout
a
night
but
just
sitting
down
to
enjoy
a
drink
or
two
with
this
is
definitely
a
good
possibility
the
beer
eructs
for
the
375ml
green
bottle
into
my
snifter
glass
a
limpid
deep
red
with
a
decorous
creamy
light
pinkish
head
that
after
its
dematerialization
leaves
a
fragile
sheet
of
lace
to
enshroud
the
glass
nose
has
a
delicate
sweet
aroma
of
raspberries
with
a
nice
tart
background
a
real
foreshadowing
of
things
to
come
start
is
sweet
with
a
pleasant
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
sturdy
in
its
acidity
the
raspberries
quite
evident
and
the
aftertaste
a
tart
dry
that
makes
you
pucker
a
bit
but
what
a
treat
and
to
think
at
one
time
i
disliked
lambics
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
mouthfeel
becomes
fuller
and
more
tannic
think
raspberry
skins
this
is
a
nice
quaffable
fruit
beer
not
sweet
either
so
none
of
that
horrible
sweet
raspberry
flavor
is
present
definitely
a
good
session
beer
it
does
not
reach
contemplative
though
a
good
lambic
in
my
mind
is
incredibly
complex
this
one
isnt
yet
at
the
same
time
eminently
quaffable
and
thirst
quenching
this
one
is
from
notes
poured
a
clear
brilliant
red
color
with
no
head
over
top
absolutely
beautiful
beer
nose
was
full
of
brilliant
raspberry
aroma
and
just
a
slight
sourness
it
smells
good
id
like
a
touch
more
sour
but
it
still
smelled
great
flavor
was
big
in
sweet
raspberry
with
just
a
touch
of
sourness
very
nice
the
feel
was
moderate
wtih
a
light
carbonation
right
where
i
expected
it
overall
a
really
really
nice
beer
id
really
like
a
touch
more
sourness
but
i
wont
complain
it
was
good
taste
is
tart
and
sour
and
then
some
but
well
supported
by
a
strong
raspberry
presence
amazing
how
this
is
accomplished
without
making
it
sweet
overall
this
is
a
unique
highly
desireable
lambic
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
particulary
as
the
lambic
warmed
up
tastes
of
sweet
cherries
very
intense
goes
along
with
a
decent
bitterness
which
is
for
a
very
long
time
not
as
present
as
the
cherries
themselves
the
supporting
tartness
brings
out
the
cherries
realy
good
in
the
end
bitterness
gets
stronger
and
takes
over
overall
when
you
drink
this
beer
you
feel
like
chewing
on
ripe
cherries
which
grow
younger
and
more
sour
the
longer
they
linger
on
my
tongue
fruits
are
present
nearly
to
the
very
end
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
reminds
me
of
summer
because
of
its
somehow
warm
smell
carbonation
grows
more
present
in
the
end
revealing
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
blind
vertical
tasting
of
krieks
o
refreshing
complex
a
nice
level
of
sourness
at
a
reasonable
price
having
had
only
a
few
authentic
krieks
from
belgium
im
no
expert
but
this
about
an
810
if
cantillon
kriek
was
a
10
and
much
easier
to
obtain
in
the
us
id
purchase
it
again
overall
an
aggressive
and
real
impressive
kriek
which
surprisingly
is
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
drink
a
good
solid
brew
but
kind
of
going
overboard
on
aggression
deep
red
pour
with
creamy
pink
head
smells
like
sweet
cherry
pie
filling
and
lemon
with
a
touch
of
bready
malt
the
cherry
tastes
surprisingly
dry
and
intense
it
steals
the
show
and
overshadows
the
base
lambic
however
what
is
there
is
really
tasty
moderately
sour
there
is
some
lemon
and
apple
on
the
taste
and
an
oakiness
that
adds
some
astringent
medicinal
quality
there
is
also
an
earthiness
throughout
but
not
very
funky
the
mouthfeel
is
great
tiny
bubbles
and
creamy
head
work
as
a
perfect
delivery
system
for
this
cherry
pie
in
a
glass
i
really
like
this
beer
and
glad
i
finally
found
it
on
the
shelf
at
my
local
shop
its
nicely
balanced
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
perhaps
the
base
lambic
would
develop
a
little
bit
more
with
some
age
but
im
not
sure
how
the
intense
cherry
flavor
would
fare
ill
just
have
to
put
one
away
for
awhile
and
find
out

mouthfeel

with
a
carbonation
that
falls
just

and
a

overall
a
decent
fruit
lambic
but
a
little
too
medicinal
for
my
sensibilities
drinkability
the
acidity
and
dryness
makes
this
beer
quite
refreshing
would
drink
all
the
time
serving

decently
tart
mildly
dry
but
not
as
much
of
the
cherry

id

enjoyed
it
but
not

its
worth
another
purchase
at
the
price
i
paid
the
best
fruit
wildsour
ale
ive
had
the
fruit
is
extremely
prominent
in
this
beer
undoubtedly
due
to
the
high
ratio
of
cherries
to
lambic
400gl
per
the
label
the
base
beer
is
extremely
well
made
bracingly
sour
and
refreshing
with
no
off
flavors
extremely
clear
for
a
fruit
beer
and
lambicbased
one
at
that
this
beer
shows
off
the
art
of
brewing
at
as
high

anything

rather
clear
for
the
style
with
a
pink
quartz
colored
head
thick
as
whipped
cream
and
rising
up
like
this
thing
has
been
ready
to
burst
through
the
cork
and
cage
for
an
eternity
so
happy
to
be
free
it
emits
aromas
of
tart
cherries
baking
pies
and
of
course
funky
oaky
lactic
lambic
thats
well
blended
and
especially
sour
the
cherries
sweeten
it
up
only
slightly
in
the
taste
and
the
vinegar
smelling
salt
intensity
of
the
nose
is
better
integrated
in
the
flavor
cherries
are
enormous
not
a
faint
accent
but
a
dominant
flavor
i
could
have
predicted
that
from
the
jammy
red
color
head
never
settles
and
the
carbonation
on
it
is
effervescent
and
super
bright
tart
and
sour
both
from
the
fruit
sour
from
the
lambic
and
downright
woody
from
its
time
in
oak
mature
as
they
come
dynamic
and
never
getting
too
sweet
a
lightness
hangs
in
this
one
making
a
small
bottle
not
quite
enough
for
me
its
interesting
enough
that
i
will
likely
buy
another
one
because
i
dont
feel
done
with
it
top
notch
stuff
super
fairly
priced
and
as
good
as
any
kriek
out
there
trust
me
o
at
first
it
was
too
cold
and
the
cherries
were
very
hidden
but
as
it
warmed
a
good
amount
of
the
fruit
sweetness
came
through
the
fruit
is
obviously
from
actual
fruit
and
really
works
well
with
the
base
beer
solid
authentic
kriek
overall
a
fine
ale
here
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
kriek
lambic
to
date
the
flavors
are
balanced
yet
scream
on
your
palate
very
raw
yet
sophisticated
a
nice
dose
of
complexity
yet
not
exhausting
all
in
all
this
brew
is
recommended
a
decent
enough
denuded
fruit
lambic
a
la
cantillon
and
their
lot
wherein
the
guest
fruit
is
only
represented
in
its
most
basic
form
one
best
appreciated
by
yer
average
high
school
chemistry
student
i
would
proffer
given
that
i
aced
that
class
20
or
so
years
ago
i
suppose
that
i
have
just
the
right
credentials
to
proclaim
this
a
success
inasmuch
as
i
have
any
clue
what
theyre
actually
trying
to
achieve
overall
this
is
something
that
i
could
not
really
justify
outside
of
this
particular
belgian
ale
context
im
afraid
to
say
too
loudly
palate
medium
creamy
lively
carbonation
gorgeous
appearance
as
is
typical
of
belgian
kriek
lambics
dark
ruby
body
with
a
thick
creamy
lavender
cap
the
aroma
is
musty
funk
and
cherry
the
flavor
is
a
showcase
for
the
cherries
with
additional
notes
of
earth
nuts
cherry
pit
hay
wet
basement
this
is
a
particularly
good
bottle
of
this
beer
a
fairly
common
bottle
as
far
as
lambics
are
concerned
i
should
keep
this
in
stock
recommended
overall
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
these
sours
but
damn
i
think
im
gonna
soon
great
stuff
the
aroma
is
potently
phenolic
at
first
but
it
improves
substantially
as
it
warms
up
and
the
taste
is
consistently
good
this
isnt
the
most
complex
kriek
but
its
definitely
interesting
and
worth
a
try
a
nice
but
unexciting
sour
cherry
is
prevalent
but
so
are
bandaids
o
surprised
at
the
depth
of
flavours
this
beer
offers
for
comparison
i
greatly
preferred
this
to
the
much
more
highly
rated
foufoune
i
had
early
this
week
dials
up
the
wood
and
fruit
and
dials
down
the
lambic
funk
may
have
to
grab
a
bottle
with
which
to
test
the
best
before
date
underrated
o
really
good
for
the
money
clean
and
crisp
kriek
minimally
sour
with
good
balance
i
bought
a
case
of
this
after
i
had
it
for
the
first
time
this
isnt
the
kriek
for
you
if
you
need
them
sugary
and
sweet
it
is
however
very
wellcrafted
focusing
on
cherries
more
than
any
overly
sour
sweet
or
wild
aspects
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
more
organic
and
less
sugary
you
should
give
this
a
try
this
is
kriek
the
way
it
should
be
unlike
most
krieks
which
are
brewed
for
american
tastes
this
beer
is
not
at
all
sweet
a
wonderful
funky
barnyard
smell
gives
way
to
an
amazing
tart
and
dry
sip
the
true
nature
of
this
beer
comes
out
at
warmer
temperatures
drinking
it
too
cold
is
a
waste
the
spontaneous
fermentation
by
lactobacillus
means
this
is
a
truly
one
of
a
kind
brew
which
is
unique
to
its
location
think
terrior
for
beer
while
admittedly
a
different
experience
every
person
i
have
seen
take
a
properly
poured
sip
has
been
amazed
this
beer
is
worth
seeking
out
and
i
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
one
overall
i
really
liked
this
kriek
very
wine
like
and
carries
a
not
overly
harsh
sourness
would
buy
it
again
paid
16
overall
a
solid
true
belgian
kriek
great
true
cherry
flavor
and
good
complexity
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
lambic
the
funkiness
is
fairly
relaxed
but
still
shows
itself
oprobably
wont
be
having
this
one
again
but
it
was
worth
the
experience
i
remember
not
liking
dieu
du
ciels
solstice
dété
aux
cerises
when
i
had
it
over
the
summer
but
i
would
prefer
it
to
this
one
and
would
certainly
try
it
again
overall
a
good
kriek
not
the
best
but
very
enjoyable
o
a
very
dry
clean
kriek
not
too
sour
pretty
nice
a
very
nice
kriek
if
not
quite
at
the
top
of
the
class
this
kriek
is
a
bit
softer
in
mouthfeel
and
less
intense
than
the
best
of
the
true
unsugared
krieks
not
as
intensely
sour
as
deeply
flavored
and
mostly
lacking
any
funky
notes
it
does
have
a
nice
acidity
especially
in
the
finish
pure
sour
cherry
flavors
and
a
long
moderately
refreshing
finish
just
touched
by
some
wood
notes
that
help
round
things
out
very
pleasurable
in
any
case
and
probably
the
best
that
can
be
found
over
here
on
any
sort
of
regular
basis
these
days
though
even
thats
a
spotty
proposition
mouthfeel
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
actually
rather
soft
yest
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
its
a
really
enjoyable
sour
right
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
really
suggest
aging
this
in
a
cool
dark
place
for
as
long
as
possible
it
becomes
less
acidic
and
a
little
more
complex
the
date
on
the
bottle
says
best
before
2024
as
if
anyone
can
wait
nearly
that
long
overall
im
going
3
5
as
the
flavors
i
dont
care
for
arent
out
of
the
parameters
of
the
style
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
interesting
kriek
not
getting
much
woody
character
here
just
odd
flavors
bad
bottle
i
am
not
a
fan
but
i
dont
really
like
the
style
either
no
specific
knock
on
it
but
tastes
more
like
cherry
champagne
than
a
lambicgueze
at
least
whats
going
on
with
my
tastebuds
o
good
tart
and
refreshing
im
always
happy
to
enjoy
this
beer
o
a
good
balance
of
cherry
and
tartness
nice
from
start
to
finish
i
honestly
believe
that
beer
would
have
an
entirely
differently
reputation
if
brands
like
oud
beersel
oude
kriek
were
more
readily
available
seriously
try
it
bring
a
bottle
to
your
next
party
for
better
or
for
worse
youll
be
the
most
popular
person
there
the
few
people
who
dont
love
it
will
at
least
be
impressed
and
realize
theres
more
to
beer
than
bland
fizzy
lagers
this
is
the
quintessential
kriek
having
been
a
kriek
drinker
for
years
that
is
really
saying
something
no
its
not
hyped
like
other
beers
but
it
definitely
deserves
the
highest
praise
the
problems
with
most
other
krieks
ranges
anywhere
from
a
bold
bitterness
which
results
from
the
cherry
pits
to
cloyingly
sweet
the
aging
in
the
oak
really
rounded
out
and
mellowed
that
flavor
and
this
beer
is
fully
attenuated
so
there
is
virtually
no
residual
sweetness
the
body
is
almost
like
velvet
but
still
thin
enough
to
make
this
beer
insanely
drinkable
such
a
dark
rich
red
color
its
almost
like
a
fine
rose
champagne
with
the
bubbles
to
match
the
smell
of
vanilla
oak
and
cherries
hit
you
drink
in
and
are
intoxicated
with
fresh
juicy
cherry
essence
there
is
absolutely
no
trace
of
hotness
in
this
beverage
you
would
think
its
alcohol
free
the
aftertaste
is
pleasant
and
sings
of
cherries
perfection
i
will
be
keeping
this
on
stock
as
often
as
possible
such
a
fine
beverage
overall
this
is
a
great
fruit
lambic
a
spectrum
of
tastes
sweet
tart
oakey
it
is
all
here
and
plays
in
a
wonderful
spectrum
of
flavors
would
highly
recommend
overall
one
of
the
best
easily
obtainable
krieks
around
the
sourness
and
funk
are
more
subdued
which
allows
the
cherries
to
really
shine
through
at
the
same
time
its
stays
away
from
being
too
sweet
and
artificial
as
some
krieks
tend
to
be
id
definitely
recommend
trying
this
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
oude
kriek
it
is
not
very
complex
funky
nor
highly
tart
but
it
is
a
pleasant
kriek
that
really
tastes
of
fresh
cherries
and
respects
tradition
it
is
delightfully
not
the
cherry
syrup
or
worse
versions
that
are
out
there
tastes
like
carbonated
berry
juice
not
really
my
thing
but
id
be
able
to
appreciate
it
more
if
it
wasnt
insanely
bubbly
to
the
point
where
i
had
trouble
swallowing
it
took
about
5
sips
and
couldnt
do
more
maybe
ill
try
other
beers
of
this
style
but
this
one
really
isnt
for
me
this
was
my
favorite
find
this
trip
overall
i
was
in
the
mood
for
nice
fruity
lambic
and
this
is
a
niceone
d
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
with
good
complexity
especially
for
style
the
color
alone
makes
it
a
perfect
valentines
day
beer
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
kriek
and
am
glad
i
held
on
to
a
few
of
these
to
taste
over
the
years
when
fresh
these
just
taste
like
cherry
soda
but
give
them
a
few
years
and
damn
it
really
comes
alive
o
enjoyed
much
dark
cherry
flavor
than
i
recall
having
in
some
other
krieks
i
have
had
great
blend
as
well
somewhere
between
tart
and
sour
has
that
lovely
sour
quality
but
a
smoothe
body
that
balances
that
out
serving
type
bottle
a
o
outstanding
one
of
the
standards
for
belgian
kriek
d
very
drinkable
very
bold
and
sour
but
still
smooth
and
decently
balanced
o
decent
kriek
probably
wouldnt
pursue
on
a
reguarl
basis
but
i
enjoyed
consuming
it
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
belgian
style
traditional
lambic
to
drink
at
cellar
temperature
totally
great
beer
with
a
wonderful
fruity
flavor
and
a
highly
drinkable
character
from
the
37
5
ml
corked
bottle
purchased
at
beer
and
gin
house
in
gent
o
absolutely
drinkable
excellent
quality
belgian
kriek
which
can
be
easily
compared
with
a
cantillon
or
a
drie
fonteinen
o
impressed
with
this
kriek
the
fruit
and
tart
blend
nicely
making
it
enjoyable
to
drink
oi
was
surprised
by
the
powerful
sour
flavor
of
this
one
the
flavors
were
good
and
complex
so
i
cannot
complain
that
it
was
a
onenote
wonder
but
i
prefer
a
touch
more
balance
in
this
style
of
brew
excellent
looking
beer
very
balanced
levels
of
sweet
and
sour
funk
levels
are
musky
and
dusty
good
sharp
sourness
with
loads
of
fruit
and
a
dry
finish
id
love
to
have
a
couple
of
cases
of
this
overall
an
enjoyable
and
balanced
lambic
not
sweet
not
overly
tart
not
overly
funky
and
the
flavors
are
well
constructed
its
still
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
id
have
this
one
again
o
while
i
personally
found
this
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
this
beer
being
tough
for
folks
that
are
not
huge
fans
of
the
more
funky
fruit
lambics
it
is
not
sweet
like
some
of
the
others
in
the
style
i
dont
think
of
this
as
a
sessionable
beer
but
i
would
say
that
is
mostly
true
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
5
years
old
and
the
cherry
smell
and
taste
is
still
absolutely
amazing
would
love
to
try
an
older
one
i
should
mention
that
some
of
the
oud
beersel
krieks
and
gueuzes
we
tried
in
the
sf
bay
area
seemed
to
have
an
unpleasant
metallic
flavor
to
them
in
most
of
2011
and
were
then
back
to
normal
it
was
especially
noticeable
in
the
gueuzes
so
i
think
that
they
may
suffer
from
some
inconsistency
issues
poor
quality
control
or
else
the
importers
handled
the
bottles
badly
we
first
thought
it
was
limited
to
bottles
from
lunardis
but
then
realized
that
the
taste
was
present
regardless
of
the
local
source
that
said
as
of
2012
they
seem
just
fine
there
may
still
some
very
slight
metallic
flavor
but
nothing
unusual
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
does
it
come
in
a
keg
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
but
for
me
i
like
a
little
bit
more
cherry
character
in
my
krieks
would
i
go
after
this
beer
again
probably
not
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
really
its
a
good
beer
but
its
a
beer
that
detracts
from
its
progenitor
i
almost
wish
i
had
tried
this
first
being
as
it
is
a
very
good
kriek
but
having
had
the
gueuze
i
cant
help
but
compare
it
to
that
and
the
addition
really
does
it
no
favours
o
i
enjoyed
this
lambic
i
am
very
interested
in
this
style
of
beer
and
i
have
to
say
this
one
was
very
delicious
i
plan
on
trying
it
again
o
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
lambic
to
my
tastes
could
be
a
little
drier
but
overall
a
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lambic
and
quite
an
enjoyable
drink
i
would
pick
this
up
again
o
a
pretty
excellent
kriek
anyone
who
likes
really
tart
lambics
will
enjoy
this
one
probably
the
most
balanced
and
least
funk
forward
lambic
ive
ever
experienced
wonderful
treat
on
my
vacation
to
compliment
my
meal
totally
fine
and
pretty
tasty
i
cant
really
dock
the
fruit
for
being
too
vibrant
but
a
slightly
deeper
level
of
complexity
and
sourness
would
certainly
help
o
excellent
lambic
that
is
up
there
with
cantillon
in
my
opinion
ogreat
kriek
would
definitely
get
again
o
good
no
expectations
going
in
and
none
coming
out
good
for
what
it
is
and
well
worth
trying
just
dont
expect
super
sour
on
this
one
its
more
acidic
mbubbly
and
smooth
tart
feels
great
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
pale
red
with
a
pretty
pink
head
of
bubbles
of
that
fades
quickly
nice
balance
of
acidity
and
tartness
the
cherry
seems
to
soften
the
sourness
and
mute
some
of
the
funkier
lambic
characteristics
hay
and
lemon
peel
seem
to
be
the
most
prominent
flavors
emerging
from
the
sourness
perfect
dryness
and
spoton
carbonation
a
well
done
if
not
understated
kriek
do
very
good
lambic
would
have
liked
a
little
more
fruit
but
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
the
ones
that
are
syrupy
this
is
not
on
the
upper
end
of
light
bodied
with
a
brisk
level
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
lively
and
the
beer
is
like
i
said
a
joy
to
drink
a
very
well
executed
beer
for
the
style
drinkability
and
overall
impression
im
finding
this
one
quite
sippable
as
each
follows
the
last
slowly
but
surely
and
as
i
focus
on
sorting
out
the
components
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
here
this
is
nicely
complex
but
also
relatively
subtle
and
something
ill
be
more
than
happy
to
have
again
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
first
rate
kriek
the
cherries
add
a
wonderful
dimension
of
flavor
to
the
lambic
and
this
is
a
complex
and
subtle
beer
id
enjoy
this
bottle
again
and
recommend
it
to
those
interested
in
sour
beers
particularly
newcomers
to
the
style
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
not
a
great
deal
of
fruit
flavors
going
on
here
mainly
oak
and
earthy
notes
still
pretty
good
o
a
kriek
without
much
kriekcould
have
had
more
cherries
for
me
o
i
am
not
going
to
knock
this
one
very
much
for
its
explosive
carbonation
because
the
taste
was
pretty
good
i
will
have
to
grab
another
bottle
of
this
in
the
future
to
give
it
another
try
pours
a
vibrant
pinkish
red
with
a
big
pinkish
white
froth
aroma
of
wild
funky
yeast
and
cherry
in
the
flavor
big
time
sour
notes
with
a
mild
complimentary
tart
cherry
note
mostly
acidic
sour
and
funky
the
abv
is
hidden
well
by
the
strong
puckering
wild
yeast
notes
and
cherry
light
bodied
feel
effervescent
semi
dry
sophisticated
feel
overall
this
is
a
lovely
kriek
lambic
very
unique
and
full
of
character
color
with
hints
of
red
blood
pure
nose
powerfully
tannic
cherry
skins
which
give
bitterness
and
with
wreaths
of
red
wine
very
pleasant
the
mouth
gives
the
sensation
of
biting
into
juicy
cherries
the
flavor
of
the
fruit
feels
more
than
in
other
kriek
but
without
any
sweetness
that
does
not
come
to
disturb
or
saturated
tasting
we
also
note
the
presence
of
bitterness
due
to
the
nuclei
of
cherry
that
gives
a
taste
of
almonds
but
it
really
does
not
persist
in
the
palace
a
place
we
find
ourselves
with
a
touch
of
red
fruit
jam
style
and
i
must
say
that
this
is
successful
even
very
well
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
delicious
beer
the
cherries
were
very
nice
in
it
it
wasnt
the
sourest
of
the
style
but
it
was
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
and
felt
nicely
balanced
in
relation
to
the
style
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
overall
an
excellent
kriek
which
has
mellowed
nicely
in
the
6
years
since
i
bought
it
one
of
my
favourites
of
this
style
o
very
good
oude
kriek
but
a
little
less
complex
than
the
cantillon
oude
kriek
bio
i
tried
last
week
beer
pours
a
hazy
deep
cherry
red
shocking
i
know
with
a
frothy
pinkish
head
the
foam
on
this
beer
is
dense
and
tightly
packed
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
best
before
date
says
10032030
wow
some
musty
in
a
good
way
earthy
and
barnyard
aromas
along
with
that
ever
present
cherry
sharp
tartness
upfront
that
hits
your
tongue
in
a
wave
and
the
acidity
moves
to
the
side
of
your
tongue
and
to
the
back
of
your
palate
next
comes
the
cherry
flavor
to
give
you
a
bit
of
a
break
from
that
acidity
a
little
maltiness
to
remind
you
that
you
are
in
fact
drinking
a
beer
followed
by
a
long
dry
finish
that
leaves
the
palate
cleansed
and
ready
for
another
sip
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
lambics
and
a
great
example
of
its
particular
style
i
only
wish
i
could
afford
to
drink
it
more
often
o
while
its
good
its
hard
to
get
past
how
disappointing
the
beer
is
after
the
outofthisworld
aroma
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
anyway
o
a
very
nice
kriek
the
nose
was
super
tart
and
funky
yet
the
flavor
was
mainly
tart
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
kriek
by
a
long
shot
this
is
quite
a
complex
brew
one
of
the
better
krieks
i
have
had
it
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
lively
amount
of
fizzy
carbonation
but
not
excessively
done
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
it
takes
more
than
a
glass
and
a
warming
up
to
room
temperature
before
i
even
start
to
pick
up
on
the
alcohols
contribution
of
warmth
down
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
a
very
earthy
brew
that
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
brew
finishes
quite
crisp
and
dry
leaving
you
wanting
more
my
only
gripe
about
this
brew
is
how
much
the
oak
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
a
little
over
the
top
even
for
someone
who
loves
oak
inclusion
in
a
brew
a
superb
kriek
not
overly
sour
or
sweet
and
nicely
carbonated
id
certainly
pick
this
one
up
again
pours
a
dark
non
see
through
cherry
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
two
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
fresh
tobaccocherrieshorse
blanket
and
haythe
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
sour
cherriessour
funka
touch
of
nuts
and
finishes
with
a
mouthpuckering
sherbet
sourness
that
is
bone
dry
and
overall
ive
been
pleasantly
suprised
by
this
brew
as
i
have
to
admit
im
not
the
biggest
fans
of
krieks
im
more
of
a
framboise
bloke
but
this
one
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
as
the
cherry
is
there
but
it
doesnt
overpower
and
is
just
another
ingredient
to
this
brew
and
i
would
drink
this
again
anyday
of
the
week
cheers
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
smells
of
sour
citrus
with
some
nice
sweet
cherries
taste
is
similarstarts
with
lemony
citrus
sourness
that
has
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
intermixed
with
it
finishes
with
an
oak
cherry
and
more
of
the
sour
profile
from
earlier
on
the
palate
mouth
is
nice
and
full
with
carbonation
burn
on
the
back
end
pretty
solid
kriek
i
never
heard
of
it
and
ordered
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
this
again
would
buy
next
time
i
come
across
it
in
the
bottle
10
a
375
seems
worth
it
overall
i
am
impressed
this
is
delicious
lower
price
than
most
krieks
making
this
a
great
deal
overall
a
pretty
good
lambic
beer
while
framboise
is
more
of
my
preferred
flavor
for
lambics
kriek
is
also
pretty
good
as
well
i
enjoy
the
fact
that
this
beer
was
not
overally
tart
and
sweet
like
lindemans
framboise
is
but
it
tended
toward
the
more
not
sweet
at
all
side
which
i
didnt
like
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
acidic
nature
made
it
hard
to
do
much
more
than
sip
but
in
no
way
is
that
a
bad
thing
d
overall
a
respectable
sour
the
carbonation
and
acidity
work
together
to
make
this
a
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
easy
huge
cherry
presence
without
the
sweetness
overall
very
enjoyable
i
think
there
was
a
nice
balance
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
for
a
375ml
but
worth
it
dpretty
nice
and
refreshing
take
on
the
style
although
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
tartsour
d
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
i
personally
preferred
it
over
most
other
krieks
ive
tried
due
to
the
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
however
the
aftertaste
was
not
pleasant
and
the
body
was
too
bubbly
so
it
wasnt
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
the
oak
was
more
present
and
a
bit
of
funk
would
add
to
the
complexity
nicely
im
guessing
this
one
really
needs
some
age
to
shine
nearly
fresh
this
was
good
but
definitely
not
great
this
beer
pours
a
very
deep
and
murky
rosewood
red
in
color
with
a
two
finger
bright
pink
poofy
head
the
aromas
are
of
apple
skins
house
yeast
and
funk
and
tart
cherries
im
glad
its
not
just
cherries
and
then
onto
the
flavor
the
complexity
is
appreciated
the
flavor
consists
of
sweet
and
slightly
tart
cherries
light
yeast
and
red
apple
skins
its
definitely
not
as
tart
as
it
could
be
but
its
a
fine
drink
it
drinks
very
well
and
has
good
flavor
i
do
enjoy
the
complexities
that
show
themselves
throughout
but
it
couldve
been
a
little
more
bold
as
far
as
the
tart
cherry
flavor
is
concerned
overall
its
a
very
good
kriek
and
worth
trying
taste
is
nice
rusticfunky
yeastiness
then
cherry
and
woody
leafiness
citric
lightly
tart
lightly
sweet
hint
of
sour
and
overall
slightly
on
the
tart
and
dryish
side
but
not
too
tart
or
dry
and
very
flavourful
it
has
excellent
lambic
character
in
addition
to
a
firm
but
gentle
cherryfruity
quality
and
is
overall
an
excellent
complex
kriek
lambic
overall
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
beer
but
its
in
the
top
3
its
a
perfect
lambic
and
i
will
be
buying
the
store
out
d
a
superbly
focused
and
drinkable
lambic
overall
i
think
a
very
well
done
kriek
enough
residual
cherry
flavor
and
a
complexity
with
the
aged
beer
pours
a
semiopaque
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
huge
3
inch
foamy
light
red
head
that
lasts
lacing
after
each
sip
slips
back
down
into
the
beer
after
a
few
seconds
smells
of
sour
dark
cherries
red
wine
vinegar
and
funkmust
my
mouth
waters
with
each
sniff
in
anticipation
of
the
sourness
taste
is
of
delicious
sour
cherries
vinegar
and
a
musty
funkiness
there
is
a
bitter
tartness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
that
is
puckering
very
carbonated
beer
that
is
prickly
on
the
drink
down
almost
soda
like
in
that
regard
overall
a
very
good
lambic
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
should
be
sought
out
accordingly
so
im
tempted
to
downgrade
my
ratings
just
so
that
it
doesnt
become
a
rarity
o
wonderful
fruit
lambic
very
complex
and
could
definitely
win
over
some
wine
drinkers
definitely
want
to
stock
one
away
for
a
while
and
see
how
it
tastes
further
down
the
roadgreat
experience
an
excellent
fruit
lambic
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
lamnbics
i
have
had
lovers
of
cantillon
should
grab
this
if
they
see
it
highly
recommended
d
very
nice
sour
that
drinks
as
one
should
crisp
sour
dry
and
full
of
cherry
funk
whats
not
to
like
dthis
is
well
balanced
and
tasty
nothing
supernatural
but
still
enjoyable
the
funk
is
subtle
but
present
and
the
fruits
are
there
but
lighter
with
a
faint
acidity
d
a
slightly
milder
lambic
leaning
more
towards
the
lactic
funk
side
of
things
but
still
a
great
kriek
that
is
easier
on
the
palate
and
a
good
starting
point
for
someone
just
getting
into
the
style
affordable
too
i
can
see
this
being
a
goto
kriek
when
the
mood
hits
d
i
came
in
to
this
beer
worrying
that
it
would
be
yet
another
pateurized
and
sweetened
lambic
what
i
received
however
is
nothing
short
of
lambic
genius
such
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
are
rarely
found
in
this
countrys
lambics
and
it
is
nice
to
see
something
this
tasty
available
in
my
area
which
is
currently
tallahassee
sadly
this
brewery
has
shut
down
as
of
2003
according
to
wild
brews
it
is
such
a
shame
and
i
can
only
hope
that
enough
was
brewed
to
last
up
to
the
2030
expiration
date
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
a
lot
to
enjoy
but
at
the
same
time
no
way
id
countenance
more
than
one
in
a
session
yeah
hit
and
miss
at
the
same
time
interesting
and
pleasant
enough
but
also
doesnt
leave
you
feeling
great
bottle
dated
best
before
1042029
opens
with
a
very
forceful
pop
of
the
cork
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
large
pink
head
that
fades
to
a
lasting
ring
of
pink
foam
deep
vinous
aroma
with
lots
of
vinegar
sourness
mild
funk
and
a
moderately
soft
dark
cherry
note
the
flavor
is
dry
grainy
and
funky
upfront
with
a
lasting
tart
dark
cherry
and
spice
finish
the
body
light
and
effervescent
like
a
nice
champagne
this
beer
was
excellent
i
have
just
been
getting
into
sour
beers
and
someone
at
my
local
brewery
suggested
this
and
i
thought
it
was
great
it
poured
very
red
like
a
raspberry
color
almost
mixed
with
cola
upfront
you
get
sour
cheery
as
usual
and
finishes
surprisingly
dry
it
was
a
mixture
of
tart
and
sweet
before
i
had
this
i
had
a
la
folie
and
felt
the
folie
was
a
bit
better
of
a
sour
i
felt
this
was
a
little
fruity
and
not
enough
tart
for
my
preference
i
would
however
definitely
buy
another
one
on
occasion
as
it
was
10
bucks
for
a
12oz
poured
very
nice
with
a
2in
foam
carbonation
was
definitely
on
the
heavy
side
the
cork
went
sailing
across
the
room
it
was
very
very
drinkable
it
was
gone
in
a
bout
10
minutes
i
tried
savoring
it
but
the
flavor
was
too
delicious
overall
i
think
this
was
a
great
krieke
i
dont
think
it
would
ever
disappoint
anyone
i
would
have
like
more
of
an
oakyvanilla
finish
but
it
remained
fruity
throughout
in
my
opinion
slow
drinker
definitely
one
to
sip
and
savor
a
good
example
of
a
traditional
kriek
the
cork
on
this
could
have
flown
but
i
controlled
it
pours
red
with
slight
pink
tint
with
a
very
light
lavenderish
pink
head
that
is
dense
with
tight
carbonation
light
cherry
fruity
aroma
meets
the
nose
supported
by
some
wet
oak
basement
and
brett
scents
light
vinous
notes
too
fantastic
smooth
flavor
that
bounces
between
fruity
and
tart
i
would
not
say
this
beer
is
a
lip
puckering
sour
but
it
is
tart
tart
cherry
wet
hay
vaguely
sweet
pie
crust
is
a
go
nice
mouthfeel
i
love
the
pricklyness
of
a
lambic
this
is
a
real
quafable
kriek
this
was
my
first
and
possibly
last
lambic
at
least
in
the
near
future
i
just
didnt
like
this
beer
however
those
who
like
lambics
my
really
enjoy
it
overall
a
complex
and
delicious
kriek
pours
an
extremely
murky
reddishpink
color
with
a
big
pink
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
funkiness
reaches
the
nostrils
as
soon
as
the
cork
is
popped
scent
is
vinegar
sour
cherries
and
sweet
cherries
as
well
taste
is
delicious
the
sour
cherry
taste
is
spot
on
in
almost
every
possible
way
the
balance
of
sweetness
and
sour
is
awesome
the
tartness
comes
first
followed
by
the
sweetness
i
also
get
great
wooden
flavors
and
acidic
fruit
juice
this
beer
is
delicious
all
the
cantillon
heads
must
have
reviewed
this
beer
because
they
made
it
seem
like
it
wasnt
sour
at
all
although
this
lambic
finishes
with
a
sweet
cherry
flavor
it
definitely
has
a
sour
taste
which
i
love
im
so
glad
my
local
whole
foods
got
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
like
a
champagne
that
has
tartness
lingering
drinkability
is
very
high
o
a
very
complex
well
balanced
beer
most
importantly
for
this
style
it
is
dry
yet
has
a
tart
sweetness
for
balance
a
great
beer
overall
the
taste
falls
back
to
mostly
cherry
with
some
lactic
character
some
mild
oak
and
funk
with
a
slight
pucker
factor
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
bit
dry
with
a
slightlysour
finish
i
keep
coming
back
for
more
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
krieks
ive
had
d
its
not
difficult
to
drink
this
beer
because
the
sour
aromas
and
flavors
are
not
overpowering
hell
yes
excellent
mix
of
old
and
new
lambic
with
huge
tartness
and
little
of
the
sugars
remaining
this
is
fantastic
and
a
damn
good
price
cant
recommend
this
highly
enough
overall
i
have
to
give
oude
kriek
vielle
a
nomelettes
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
but
it
had
plenty
of
zippy
carbonation
d
solid
tasty
fruit
lambic
the
true
lambic
fermentation
and
use
of
real
fruit
restrains
the
beer
into
going
over
the
top
with
sugar
bit
of
an
unstable
balance
imo
but
its
there
would
make
a
good
food
pairing
beer
for
sure
drinkability
though
it
is
tart
and
fruity
and
undeniably
dry
the
flavor
profile
lacks
funky
complexity
in
the
middle
still
a
very
nice
beer
the
palate
opens
plenty
sour
with
a
blend
of
lactic
dominant
and
lemony
secondary
sourness
upon
which
a
brilliant
ripe
cherry
character
is
present
very
bright
and
fruity
rich
and
deep
theres
some
leather
some
earth
petrichor
and
a
little
bit
of
dust
all
beautifully
balanced
drying
and
tart
on
the
finish
theres
some
leather
cherry
skins
and
of
course
a
copious
amount
of
cherry
flavor
acidity
is
moderate
with
no
acetic
character
present
just
mostly
lactic
with
some
citric
mildly
tannic
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
mediumlow
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
im
disappointed
ive
passed
on
in
the
past
a
very
well
structured
beer
bottle
deep
crimson
red
with
a
pink
head
that
slowly
collars
around
the
glass
aroma
is
funky
over
ripe
cherry
woody
and
earthy
the
taste
is
fruity
and
tart
that
ends
crisply
no
evidence
of
the
alcohol
very
light
mouthfeel
and
very
carbonated
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
am
glad
i
can
get
it
regularly
if
i
wanted
a
little
pricey
though
really
really
good
lambic
that
ive
enjoyed
many
times
over
the
past
several
years
its
great
to
be
able
to
pick
this
one
up
so
readily
in
many
parts
of
the
country
a
solid
unsweetened
kriek
with
plenty
of
flavour
and
good
balance
drinkability
a
very
interesting
and
complex
kriek
that
is
not
overly
sweet
or
overly
sour
funky
and
sour
with
a
dry
finish
nice
beer
overall
this
was
a
nicely
done
kriek
the
funk
was
at
a
good
level
and
the
cherry
flavors
were
a
nice
mix
of
tart
and
sweet
d
as
with
all
lambicssours
this
one
is
a
slow
sipper
not
something
you
can
chug
by
any
means
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
high
but
not
too
prickly
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
not
really
in
the
top
tier
of
fruit
lambics
but
still
a
very
worthwhile
purchase
cherry
flavors
grows
as
i
drink
more
and
as
it
warms
much
better
adjusting
my
review
gotta
have
something
sweet
to
balance
this
one
out
perhaps
i
should
have
tried
a
kriek
lambic
that
used
fruit
flavoring
or
concentrates
first
so
that
i
could
fully
appreciate
the
painstaking
methods
used
to
create
this
pink
sparkling
wine
of
the
ale
world
overall
a
decent
kriek
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
with
a
few
years
on
it
would
be
very
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
so
carbonated
and
fizzy
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
overall
glad
to
try
it
and
damn
right
on
for
the
style
would
do
it
again
delicious
md
light
prickly
carbo
lightens
the
body
very
drinkable
if
you
crave
tart
beers
and
like
a
dry
finish
very
pleased
with
this
lambic
an
incredible
aroma
started
things
off
right
and
the
taste
did
not
deviate
from
there
surprisingly
complex
and
overall
just
a
great
beer
d
quite
tasty
not
as
profoundly
sour
as
some
krieks
like
the
cantillon
lou
pepe
a
quality
kriek
that
is
worthy
of
praise
2006
bottling
with
a
best
by
date
of
442026
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
tart
with
notes
of
cherries
oak
and
vanilla
this
is
what
a
fruit
lambic
is
supposed
to
smell
like
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
tart
cherries
with
some
oak
notes
the
oak
character
is
pretty
strong
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
the
four
years
of
age
on
this
beer
really
made
it
shine
and
turned
it
into
something
special
drinkability
ive
taken
the
better
half
of
a
750ml
bottle
from
my
significant
other
already
and
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
liter
or
more
during
these
warm
summer
days
what
a
beer
it
is
a
great
fruit
beer
d
it
leaves
the
glass
far
too
quickly
too
delicious
d
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
krieks
ive
had
though
i
prefer
beers
of
this
style
to
be
a
little
sweeter
still
im
glad
i
tried
it
even
if
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
wild
funk
good
stuff
bottle
home
delicious
kriek
this
beer
pours
a
bright
shade
of
crimson
with
an
enormous
bubbly
pink
head
its
obviously
very
carbonated
as
tiny
bubbles
race
up
the
glass
champagnelike
the
aroma
is
a
fantastic
mix
of
bright
cherries
and
softly
sour
funk
its
really
good
cherry
pie
as
a
lambic
theres
a
little
bit
of
vinegar
in
the
flavor
and
somewhat
more
sour
funk
its
a
dry
beer
but
the
cherries
nearly
seem
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
but
soft
and
very
clean
excellent
t
highly
drinkable
a
little
tart
but
refreshing
pours
a
cloudy
red
with
nice
large
pink
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
cherry
raspberry
leathery
funk
with
a
buttery
element
flavor
is
vinous
with
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
evoking
sour
andor
black
cherry
and
nice
funk
aromas
on
the
dry
finish
i
may
go
back
and
try
a
fresher
batch
i
think
this
is
a
sour
that
is
good
for
people
that
are
trying
to
get
into
the
style
because
its
not
too
sour
unfortunately
im
beyond
that
a
nice
drink
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
and
dry
lambic
that
is
highly
drinkable
another
in
a
line
of
good
intro
sours
i
will
look
for
this
again
d
a
very
drinkable
kriek
but
i
cant
see
wanting
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
combined
effects
of
the
funk
and
tartness
would
eventually
dull
ones
taste
to
the
point
where
nuances
would
be
missed
you
smell
sour
cherries
and
you
taste
sour
cherries
but
this
was
what
you
expected
and
exactly
what
the
beer
delivers
pleasant
carbonation
quite
a
dry
finish
totally
different
from
most
of
the
commercial
kriek
beers
i
am
so
glad
the
people
at
dafspraak
in
mechelen
recommended
this
one
or
i
might
never
have
tried
another
kriek
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
lambic
if
you
like
flanders
this
may
peak
your
interest
but
even
then
it
wasnt
that
great
not
bad
but
not
great
oak
is
a
little
top
heavy
and
i
fell
like
a
lot
of
the
flavors
clash
as
opposed
to
integrating
md
fizzy
with
a
champagne
like
body
and
carbonation
dry
finish
a
nice
kriek
not
too
sweet
not
too
sour
man
those
belgians
know
what
there
doing
d
the
low
abv
makes
this
surprisingly
easy
drinking
even
if
it
probably
should
have
been
consumed
10
years
ago
it
was
really
interesting
to
see
what
happens
to
a
kriek
as
it
reaches
its
bestbefore
date
and
its
still
eminently
drinkable
albeit
different
the
carbonation
is
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
but
otherwise
it
goes
down
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
carbonated
and
complex
the
brew
is
an
excellent
apéritif
although
not
very
suitable
in
my
opinion
for
other
purposes
due
to
the
dry
nature
very
drinkable
because
it
is
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
tart
easy
drinking
although
its
depth
makes
one
want
to
savor
it
a
bit
d
a
wonderful
beer
tons
of
flavor
and
just
a
great
choice
for
my
100th
review
d
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
wonderfully
quaffable
and
drinkable
if
youre
at
all
a
fan
of
gueuze
andor
sours
youll
love
this
i
only
wish
that
i
had
the
patience
to
wait
until
2027
to
see
how
this
beer
develops
over
time
i
have
not
had
much
experience
with
this
style
but
this
is
definitely
a
wonderful
example
of
a
kriek
although
not
in
a
traditional
sense
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
again
when
reviewing
beer
on
this
site
i
think
an
error
factor
of
0
10
2
while
high
may
be
reasonable
for
those
offerings
with
wild
cultures
this
one
caught
me
on
a
good
day
the
funk
doesnt
overpower
the
cherries
and
the
light
grains
first
time
mentioned
i
know
really
provide
that
hayish
bed
for
nesting
of
the
yeast
and
ripe
cherries
i
do
like
the
almost
solera
blending
of
young
and
old
having
read
and
thinking
of
it
depth
is
certainly
enhanced
there
is
a
slight
heft
to
this
depth
so
its
something
that
i
sip
and
i
savor
but
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
and
contemplative
effort
375ml
bottle
with
bbd
of

making
this
a
4
5
y
o
bottle
i
think
pours
an
opaque
dark
red
with
a
large
fizzy
light
pink
head
that
lasts
looks
like
a
glass
of
blood
with
some
sediment
mixed
in
the
smell
is
largely
barnyard
must
and
tart
cherry
definite
lacto
character
sour
cherry
taste
but
the
tartness
is
rather
restrained
compared
to
offerings
from
some
other
traditional
producers
a
certain
funk
and
woody
earthiness
to
it
overall
quite
dry
as
it
should
be
medium
body
with
heavy
carbonation
nice
traditional
kriek
that
makes
for
an
easy
drinker
as
far
as
lambics
go
md
granted
im
not
a
fruitlambic
drinker
i
e
big
fan
but
this
one
really
ticks
all
the
boxes
for
me
as
a
reasonably
complex
yet
immensely
pleasantly
drinkable
example
the
fine
and
soft
carbonation
supports
a
medium
body
that
in
turn
shows
the
moderately
tart
fruitiness
treading
light
on
a
mature
and
rounded
lambic
platform
maybe
the
secret
lies
in
the
old
lambic
base
as
pointed
out
by
many
previous
reviewers
i
also
share
the
opinion
that
although
this
is
not
the
most
distinctive
kriek
beer
its
nonetheless
a
harmonious
and
superblycrafted
one
i
truly
like
it
bottle
at
the
alibi
room
in
vancouver
dark
murky
brown
in
color
topped
with
a
finger
of
head
that
doesnt
linger
too
long
the
aroma
is
massively
funky
sweaty
and
mineral
with
a
hint
of
tart
cherry
and
red
wine
vinegar
on
the
tongue
the
fruit
flavor
is
much
more
pronounced
and
complex
largely
sour
but
with
a
very
subtle
hint
of
sweetness
acidity
is
moderate
to
high
making
for
a
slow
sipper
but
a
highly
enjoyable
one
a
touch
of
grain
and
esters
appear
in
the
dry
finish
but
the
cherry
flavor
dominates
here
an
exemplary
kriek
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
drink
it
at
55
degrees
the
warmer
the
better
would
highly
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
as
a
traditional
kriek
not
to
abrasive
an
easy
to
go
eric
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
amazing
for
the
style
the
vinegartartness
is
perfect
great
example
of
the
style
high
recommendation
an
interesting
experience
not
one
to
drink
steadily
but
a
nice
sipper
i
will
be
getting
this
one
again
and
again
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
to
everyone
who
has
not
tried
a
really
good
lambic
this
one
will
help
you
discover
this
style
and
i
loved
it
overall
im
doing
this
one
mostly
from
memory
of
last
night
was
in
a
hotel
room
and
unable
to
procure
internet
access
to
write
a
review
but
what
i
remember
was
good
it
was
a
nice
bracingly
tart
cherry
lambic
to
start
off
what
would
be
an
awesome
night
of
food
and
beer
3

cheers
drinkability
remains
in
the
average
category
because
that
is
how
drinkable
i
think
this
beer
is
it
does
not
wow
me
into
wanting
to
guzzle
the
whole
thing
down
with
me
trying
to
restrain
myself
from
doing
so
the
whole
time
the
beer
just
seems
to
fit
the
bill
of
a
whole
host
of
other
lambics
in
terms
of
drinkability
still
remains
a
tasty
and
complex
beer
though
i
didnt
like
this
beer
my
palates
not
sophisticated
enough
for
this
one
it
tasted
like
sparkling
cherryflavored
cough
medicine
to
me
the
sour
aftertaste
made
me
think
twice
about
taking
another
sip
i
prefer
sweeter
lambic
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
i
never
finished
the
bottle
i
like
it
a
lot
if
anything
it
is
lacking
a
little
in
complexity
and
feels
thin
having
said
that
i
will
drink
this
again
as
always
with
these
beers
many
thanks
to
those
getting
these

this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
deep
red
color
with
a
small
pink
head
it
immediately
smells
of
barnyard
funk
must
mildew
old
wood
there
is
also
a
nice
cherry
sweetness
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
nice
tart
and
sour
its
funky
it
tastes
like
licking
an
old
wood
barrel
that
had
been
sitting
around
for
a
while
the
cherry
flavor
is
there
to
balance
some
of
that
out
but
this
is
a
great
sour
beer
the
beer
is
not
too
heavy
and
goes
down
quite
easy
despite
the
sourness
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
terrific
stuff
its
a
masculine
way
to
do
a
fruity
beer
and
a
way
to
get
that
sour
beer
kick
filled
notes
i
may
consider
re
reviewing
this
beer
at
a
later
date
when
i
develop
my
taste
for
this
style
dark
pink
with
a
fluffy
pink
head
it
smells
good
sour
cherries
and
a
little
bit
of
manure
the
taste
was
not
too
heavy
on
the
cherry
some
sourness
a
little
bit
of
acidity
this
was
cool
ill
be
interested
to
try
their
framboise
and
gueuze
mmm
gueuze
very
much
looking
like
raspberry
juice
and
iced
tea
mixed
together
with
a
pink
head
the
nose
is
pure
lambic
with
some
fruit
rising
up
this
is
a
bracing
beer
with
a
dark
fruit
flavour
matching
up
against
the
sour
lambic
body
the
finish
is
quite
dry
with
a
fairly
quick
drop
off
not
on
the
cantillon
level
but
very
nice
and
unsweetened
deep
raspberry
color
with
a
pinkish
head
the
nose
has
fresh
mountain
cherries
funky
oak
and
some
tart
sour
aromas
the
taste
is
also
a
nice
blend
between
funk
tart
fruits
and
sweet
cherries
a
delicious
brew
complimented
by
a
crisp
body
i
could
enjoy
this
masterpiece
all
night
pours
a
dark
burgundy
in
color
theres
a
pinkishwhite
head
that
forms
plenty
of
carbonation
on
the
pour
smell
is
cherry
and
all
kinds
of
funky
tart
taste
is
more
of
the
cherry
and
funk
but
the
cherries
have
more
of
a
green
taste
good
carbonation
again
in
the
mouthfeel
very
tart
and
funky
lambic
i
like
it
this
was
a
great
example
of
a
style
i
cant
seem
to
have
enough
of
and
would
recomend
this
lambic
to
anyone
interested
in
lambics
edit
a
bottle
purchased
about
a
year
later
mid2009
had
very
little
acidity
very
strange
not
bad
but
not
very
good
either
kind
of
like
a
boring
version
of
orval
probably
a
fluke
i
guess
the
body
is
more
on
the
dry
side
but
some
residual
maybe
a
bit
sweeter
than
typical
krieks
but
the
aftertaste
accentuates
the
cherry
finish
also
carbonation
seems
light
for
style
but
also
helps
the
cherry
overall
very
enjoyable
as
my
mouth
got
use
to
the
sour
it
became
very
easy
to
drink
a
must
have
for
kriek
lovers
brilliantly
clear
ruby
red
color
and
just
crown
of
carbonation
on
top
black
cherries
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
general
tartness
and
acidity
and
hints
of
pineapple
hay
and
a
yeasty
character
cherry
is
less
dominant
in
the
taste
allowing
for
more
beer
qualities
to
come
through
and
also
more
tart
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
hinted
medium
acidity
with
citrus
tones
slight
pucker
charcoal
dryness
belgian
yeast
character
and
slightly
nutty
caramel
maltiness
sharp
carbonation
with
an
initial
fizz
eases
up
before
in
becomes
too
much
thin
mouthfeel
is
quite
enjoyable
here
pours
very
clear
but
still
a
deep
deep
red
color
with
good
barely
pink
head
nose
is
tart
with
cherry
and
wood
taste
follows
very
tart
flavor
up
front
and
good
sour
lambic
pucker
the
cherry
flavors
come
out
in
the
middle
with
the
wood
and
continue
through
the
finish
a
wonderfully
sour
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
just
about
perfect
and
the
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
easier
as
it
warms
would
love
to
see
how
this
ages
great
lambic
mouthfeeldrinkability
active
and
well
carbonated
it
certainly
provides
a
launching
pad
for
the
fruit
to
show
its
stuff
it
smooths
out
over
the
duration
but
its
good
the
whole
time
this
beer
is
easier
to
drink
than
most
due
to
its
refreshment
factor
and
milder
tartness
relative
to
the
style
i
figured
i
would
try
this
one
given
the
chance
but
this
was
not
enjoyable
at
all
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
just
overpowering
in
my
book
and
tartness
doesnt
give
much
characther
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
sometime
however
i
think
it
would
be
best
with
some
more
age
to
let
it
gather
some
more
complexities
the
best
before
date
was
21
10
2025
so
i
definitely
think
it
was
too
young
picked
up
a
small
corked
bottle
at
bauer
for
6
99
removed
the
cork
to
hear
a
loud
snapping
pop
poured
into
two
tulip
shaped
glasses
the
color
was
fire
engine
red
the
smell
invades
the
nose
with
a
very
pronounced
sharpness
taste
wise
it
was
an
awesome
kriek
lambic
so
tart
on
the
tongue
first
but
became
delightful
after
the
first
few
sips
the
subtle
cherry
flavor
showed
up
more
as
the
beer
warmed
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
one
is
one
of
the
more
tart
beers
ive
tried
bits
of
dark
sediment
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
glasses
at
the
end
though
due
to
all
that
funk
it
was
nice
to
have
only
a
small
bottle
on
hand
lambics
to
me
should
only
be
enjoyed
a
small
dose
at
a
time
glad
i
bought
this
one
pours
reddish
with
a
pink
hued
head
that
rises
high
and
falls
for
the
most
part
quickly
nose
is
very
funked
fairly
thick
antiseptic
tone
flavors
got
a
nice
level
of
the
funky
wih
a
mild
amount
of
sour
yes
my
friends
this
is
a
lambic
why
have
i
stayed
away
from
you
for
so
long
quite
a
smooth
feel
with
a
full
carbonation
so
drinkable
i
would
buy
cases
of
this
at
a
time
i
would
bathe
in
it
but
that
would
be
a
stupid
waste
why
dirty
it
just
drink
it
d
good
kriek
all
around
but
lacking
a
bit
of
length
on
the
flavor
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
though
drinkability
no
problems
with
this
bottle
not
at
all
for
the
intro
lambic
drinker
definitely
an
excellent
lambic
i
could
drink
this
early
and
often
but
of
course
it
isnt
cheap
great
drinkability
notes
a
good
exmple
of
a
kriek
much
better
than
the
more
tame
lindemans
version
pours
a
deep
amber
reddish
color
with
a
pink
head
aromas
of
a
sour
dark
cherry
as
in
the
taste
dry
to
a
sour
dark
cherry
flavor
a
sour
bigger
body
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
sour
cherry
aftertaste
a
true
lambic
great
sour
cherry
flavor
not
sweet
all
tartness
d
a
tasty
beer
that
would
have
been
even
better
if
the
gueze
and
cherry
flavors
blended
a
little
better
it
is
weird
how
sweet
the
aroma
is
but
how
tart
the
flavor
is
overall
i
dont
think
that
i
would
buy
this
again
i
have
had
oud
beersels
gueze
vielle
and
kriek
vielle
and
this
is
not
even
in
the
same
league
i
can
tell
that
this
kriek
is
for
the
sweet
kriek
lovers
i
like
them
sour
sooo
sour
super
tar
with
a
touch
of
oxidation
and
cork
the
kriek
is
reclusive
however
really
very
little
sign
of
cherry
or
any
other
fruit
for
that
matter
i
do
detect
some
distinct
oak
character
however
d
this
beer
has
great
cherry
presents
and
a
nice
tartness
with
some
supporting
flavors
it
will
be
interesting
to
taste
this
at
year
2025
to
compare
drinkability
this
is
a
very
special
lambic
and
it
is
devastatingly
wonderful
with
some
creamy
goat
cheese
a
great
summer
beer
too
as
refreshing
and
crisp
as
it
is
complex
and
robust
i
suppose
its
just
a
little
thin
in
body
but
overall
very
enjoyable
with
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
would
i
really
want
more
body
on
something
this
sour
anyway
not
something
i
want
to
drink
several
bottles
of
and
sometimes
not
at
all
but
on
the
right
day
ive
found
few
brews
more
refreshing
cheers
pours
out
a
nice
big
head
that
falls
into
a
nice
thick
head
with
a
killer
lacing
the
head
stays
in
a
thick
layer
across
the
top
of
the
beer
the
color
is
pink
too
the
color
of
the
beer
is
redruby
red
and
very
dark
the
smell
is
fragrant
with
sour
cherries
and
some
horse
blanket
in
the
background
the
taste
is
of
sour
cherries
that
are
not
tart
nice
sour
flavor
its
not
followed
up
by
a
lot
of
tart
flavor
the
kind
that
usually
makes
your
mouth
pucker
isnt
there
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
nothing
negative
to
report
overall
i
would
have
this
again
definitely
drinkability
not
very
good
not
dry
enough
for
me
and
too
medicinal
meh
not
impressed
a
gorgeous
pour
and
color
deep
shiny
red
with
a
slight
head
a
small
metallic
taste
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
a
decent
tartness
at
the
finish
left
me
wanting
to
drink
more
i
enjoyed
the
consistency
of
it
as
it
wasnt
watery
and
not
too
thick
not
much
smell
to
it
and
basically
i
just
wanted
more
from
this
drink
bottle
poured
a
deep
pink
color
lambic
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sour
cherry
oak
and
tart
is
well
balance
taste
is
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
sour
cherry
oak
and
tart
with
some
well
balance
level
of
acidity
and
sweetness
this
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
after
a
long
crosscountry
ski
outing
definitely
one
of
the
most
well
balance
fruit
lambic
ive
tried
poured
out
a
raspberry
red
dark
cloudy
crowned
with
a
thick
frothy
pink
head
the
nose
is
sour
cherry
lemony
overly
sour
feet
wrapped
in
leather
the
taste
is
sour
sour
sour
lemon
acidic
bit
of
cherry
more
towards
the
finish
totally
turns
on
your
mid
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
highly
carbonated
finishes
dry
and
clean
a
bit
of
sourness
on
the
tongue
overall
milder
but
still
has
some
nice
lambic
qualities
very
complex
with
scads
of
lambic
flavor
and
very
fresh
fruit
flavors
this
stuff
reminds
me
of
drie
fonteinen
scharsbeek
kriek
a
must
try
drinkability
this
is
a
slow
sipper
and
if
the
tart
cherry
tones
were
a
bit
mellower
i
would
really
like
this
interesting
beer
everyone
should
try
as
personal
thoughts
will
vary
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
tart
sour
cherries
balsamic
vinegar
yeasty
funk
and
that
mildly
funkychemicalish
aroma
i
can
only
describe
as
stir
fried
chinese
baby
corn
the
body
is
a
dark
pink
leaning
to
red
in
darker
light
the
head
a
pink
tinted
white
a
thumb
thick
and
lasting
tart
funky
fore
is
very
acidic
and
tangy
with
balsamic
vinegar
notes
faintly
oaky
in
the
middle
quite
dry
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
very
long
lingering
sour
flavor
goes
well
into
the
aftertaste
the
flavor
was
very
tart
there
were
cherries
and
maybe
hints
of
grape
some
spices
orange
rind
it
was
very
earthymusty
and
very
very
dry
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
a
dark
sparkling
red
wine
there
was
a
sweet
tartness
to
it
but
i
would
hesitate
to
call
it
sweet
overall
i
enjoyed
it
d
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
wellworth
it
complex
and
refreshing
this
is
definitely
one
for
the
beer
geeks
and
not
the
masses
great
mouthfull
of
dense
and
smooth
carbonation
very
drinkable
wonderfully
refreshing
375
ml
bottle
ordered
at
allen
st
hardware
cafe
in
buffalo
served
in
a
tulip
this
kriek
is
an
opaquely
hazy
magenta
with
steady
carbonation
and
a
modest
pink
head
sour
funk
and
assertive
brett
aromas
with
a
distinctly
cherry
character
throughout
the
taste
is
tart
indeed
but
not
nearly
as
mouthpuckering
as
offerings
from
cantillon
or
de
ranke
tannic
sour
cherry
skin
flavors
ride
along
a
dense
and
driving
bretty
funk
train
vinous
and
terribly
refreshing
with
an
appropriate
and
satisfying
dryness
to
the
finish
that
provokes
the
next
sip
not
quite
phenomenal
but
certainly
a
worldclass
fruit
lambic
recommended
cloudy
red
like
squeezed
strawberries
small
tan
colored
head
smells
like
alcohol
grapes
and
red
fruit
a
bit
like
the
odor
of
a
light
red
wine
taste
is
a
mild
fruity
cherry
tartness
up
front
changing
to
nothing
at
all
after
the
tartness
leaves
its
as
if
i
drank
a
glass
of
water
or
at
least
pretty
close
to
that
my
wife
said
the
flavor
was
like
nonalcoholic
red
wine
and
too
tart
fizzy
and
full
bodied
like
a
soda
without
the
sweetness
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
cant
say
that
id
want
to
buy
another
uf
drinkable
while
i
have
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
fruit
beers
at
a
time
i
imagine
that
lambic
fans
would
find
this
totally
sessionfriendly
a
beer
ill
definitely
e
keeping
my
eye
out
for
from
now
on
drinks
easily
sweet
and
sour
cherries
most
prominent
with
a
lemony
sourness
heavily
and
tightly
carbonated
for
a
fizzy
light
feel
cherry
component
cuts
through
the
barny
tartness
with
a
sweetness
and
a
delicate
cherryskin
tartness
drinkable
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
beer
can
be
wrapped
up
in
one
word
cherry
it
smelled
like
cherry
juice
and
tasted
likewise
however
it
wasnt
visited
by
the
koolaid
man
oh
yeah
rather
the
cherry
lingers
pretty
gently
no
oversugared
red
dye
5
concotion
here
i
was
expecting
sour
when
i
first
sipped
it
but
was
surprised
by
a
slight
sweetness
the
cherry
overtakes
the
drink
but
im
not
complaining
it
even
looks
like
cherry
juice
in
the
glass
with
only
a
slight
lace
resting
on
top
for
a
head
after
the
first
pour
as
a
fan
of
lambics
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
go
for
another
round
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
the
body
is
a
slightly
cloudy
pinkpurple
hybrid
topped
by
a
substantial
inch
or
so
of
creamy
pinkish
head
excellent
carbonation
keeps
coming
for
quite
a
while
aroma
is
a
bit
musty
with
sour
cherries
and
lambic
yeast
battling
it
out
for
supremacy
ultimately
fiighting
to
a
draw
palate
strikes
a
balance
between
the
ultrasour
gueuze
lambics
and
the
syrupsweetened
fruit
lambics
sour
cherries
blend
with
a
tarter
more
vinegary
base
from
the
gueuze
a
fairly
sharp
astringency
seizes
the
tongue
at
first
but
subsides
a
bit
after
a
few
more
sips
body
is
smooth
lightly
creamy
and
beautifully
sparkling
certainly
a
tasty
beer
although
it
is
too
assertive
and
challenging
to
be
a
frequent
selection
its
still
going
to
be
a
long
time
before
i
really
know
what
to
look
for
in
a
lambic
however
this
is
rather
drinkable
i
think
this
beer
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
it
is
sweet
but
not
too
overbearing
also
it
is
not
too
high
in
alcohol
i
am
happy
to
have
had
the
oportunity
to
try
this
one
higher
than
expected
alcohol
this
bottle
was
stored
upright
for
at
least
2
years
without
apparent
cork
issues
a
bold
and
delicate
blend
of
what
is
good
with
belgian
beers
a
hazy
maroon
brown
color
with
a
light
yet
vigorous
carbonation
smells
very
tart
and
fruity
with
a
woodsy
musky
earthy
tone
tastes
very
fruity
and
vineous
quite
musky
and
earthy
flavors
woven
around
an
abundance
of
raspberry
a
light
apple
cider
flavor
persists
carbonation
and
fruitiness
adds
to
much
creaminess
but
the
light
souness
thins
the
beer
in
the
finish
for
easy
drinking
a
pleasure
to
drink
much
complexity
in
here
375
ml
bottle
oud
beersel
kriek
has
a
hazy
red
color
with
a
large
pink
head
earthy
aroma
of
cherries
oak
and
vinegar
much
more
of
a
subtle
aroma
that
i
remember
from
previous
tastings
the
flavor
is
mainly
cherries
notably
dry
a
minimum
of
lambic
funkiness
but
beware
if
you
are
not
used
to
sour
beers
this
one
if
pretty
sour
the
cherry
flavor
is
very
nice
not
at
all
artificial
tasting
unlike
mainly
fruit
lambics
finish
is
short
and
very
dry
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
i
list
it
among
the
elite
of
the
style
drinkability
since
its
dry
and
not
to
sweet
or
sugary
i
could
see
someone
maybe
having
more
than
one
bottle
but
would
you
have
more
than
one
bottle
of
champagne
maybe
you
would
but
i
wouldnt
also
its
fairly
expensive
and
so
certainly
a
good
treat
try
it
on
new
years
instead
of
going
to
the
liquor
store
for
champagne
your
guests
may
be
both
surprised
and
pleased
drinkability
definitly
wouldnt
drink
more
then
1
in
a
sitting
and
dont
know
as
id
drink
another
whole
bottle
by
myself
but
if
i
was
splitting
with
someone
it
would
be
just
right
this
would
go
well
with
some
fine
cheese
or
some
kind
of
appetizer
to
complement
its
sourness
pours
a
brilliant
ruby
red
with
a
rosecolored
head
that
has
very
good
retention
and
leaves
behind
some
lacing
a
high
level
of
carbonation
is
visible
after
the
initial
pour
aromas
of
cherries
and
alcohol
seem
to
dominate
the
taste
is
well
different
to
say
the
least
i
can
best
describe
it
as
a
subtle
fruitflavored
champagne
this
doesnt
really
have
the
consistency
taste
or
feel
of
beer
the
cherry
flavor
doesnt
come
out
all
that
much
its
the
tartness
and
dryness
of
this
beer
that
doesnt
suit
me
the
aftertaste
is
very
dry
like
champagne
or
even
a
chardonnay
i
wont
be
having
this
beer
again
in
fact
i
couldnt
finish
my
pint
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
crazy
sour
vinegar
nose
smells
like
a
stale
musty
barnyard
with
a
hint
of
sour
cherries
pours
a
deep
burgundybrick
red
hue
and
makes
a
fizzy
pink
head
flavor
is
vinegary
hint
of
sour
cherries
tastes
very
much
like
a
sour
red
wine
very
tart
and
astringent
hint
of
cranberry
light
on
the
palate
coats
the
mouth
very
thin
and
finishes
quite
dry
nice
quality
lambic
moderately
complex
enjoyed
this
one
i
suppose
i
was
expecting
some
fruited
sweetness
from
the
cherries
to
emerge

especially
with
all
the
color
they
contribute
to
the
body
but
this
was
effectively
overruled
by
the
full
lambic
sourness
i
cant
say
as
id
care
to
drink
any
great
measure
of
this
beer
but
the
puckering
tartness
has
a
frolicking
refreshment
to
it
why
should
i
even
describe
this
to
you
she
was
wet
and
sour
and
she
quenched
my
fire
she
gave
me
sweet
tender
kisses
inside
raspberry
tendrils
covered
in
not
quite
ripe
fruit
her
finger
tips
tasted
of
sandalwood
patchouli
and
sex
if
i
could
own
this
all
of
it
every
sexy
bit
of
her
i
would
never
share
her
id
laugh
as
she
teased
you
id
laugh
as
i
described
my
passion
with
her
id
never
share
a
taste
with
anybody
shes
my
cleopatra
best
by
sometime
in
2022
this
is
my
first
real
kriek
so
i
may
be
updating
this
review
as
i
gain
more
experience
in
the
style
and
finish
off
the
cantillon
and
de
ranke
in
my
fridge
smell
is
a
little
oak
and
vinegar
in
the
back
dominated
by
an
overpowering
sourness
there
is
some
mustiness
that
perks
up
at
one
point
bringing
to
mind
an
old
cobwebby
barn
very
subtle
though
taste
is
shockingly
sour
this
is
possibly
the
sourest
thing
ever
very
acidic
and
yet
behind
it
all
there
is
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
of
course
the
cherry
flavor
though
it
is
purely
tart
and
not
sweet
at
all
as
others
have
mentioned
the
cherry
comes
out
more
as
it
warms
making
this
taste
juicier
but
i
prefer
it
served
very
cold
the
finish
is
extremely
dry
and
never
ending
it
took
me
forever
to
finish
this
bottle
but
i
savored
every
last
drop
bottle
best
before
03
04
2023
poured
a
hazy
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
pink
head
that
didnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
funky
barnyard
oak
and
tart
cherry
aroma
tart
cherry
skin
sour
lemon
taste
mouthfeel
of
soft
lively
bubbles
purply
garnet
with
a
pinkish
mountain
of
foam
gem
like
quality
on
the
edges
just
gorgeous
in
the
snifter
smell
is
like
an
unblended
lambic
with
a
tiny
bit
of
cherry
syrup
coming
through
taste
is
tart
bubbly
cherries
throughout
and
a
long
cherry
finish
yet
not
sweet
at
all
never
overly
aspirinish
wet
in
the
middle
and
then
dry
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
especially
pleasant
for
this
type
of
beer
so
this
is
a
real
lambic
without
the
heavy
duty
fruitiness
that
makes
one
think
of
malternatives
for
being
so
tart
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
worth
nabbing
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
one
brew
that
really
sticks
out
in
my
mind
and
haunts
my
memory
the
beer
pours
a
nice
rosey
color
with
a
2
finger
slightly
pink
head
that
falls
to
a
light
coating
over
the
brew
very
pretty
the
nose
is
super
with
a
big
sour
acrid
blast
but
i
can
actually
smell
the
sour
cherry
playing
around
underneath
that
very
enticing
the
flavor
is
intense
upon
taking
a
sip
my
cheeks
pucker
in
and
my
salivar
glands
close
off
giving
me
that
stickey
spit
thing
going
on
the
sour
and
acidic
flavor
intensifies
as
i
swallow
the
beer
but
fading
as
quickly
as
they
assaulted
my
taste
buds
it
leaves
a
residual
cherry
flavor
and
gives
nice
sweet
cherry
burps
the
feel
is
light
moderate
with
a
nice
moderate
carbonation
it
leaves
my
mouth
with
the
sticeky
spit
feel
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
easy
to
drink
and
it
tastes
really
good
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
very
nice
this
one
pours
a
pink
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
looks
kinda
like
a
wine
the
aroma
is
very
nice
lots
of
belgian
funkiness
and
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
cherries
the
flavor
isnt
as
sour
as
i
expected
but
still
plenty
sour
slightly
sweet
with
an
intense
cherry
flavor
slightly
drying
on
the
finish
drinkability
is
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
but
right
on
for
the
style
great
brew
12
7
ounce
bottle
corked
and
bailed
date
on
back
of
bottle
was
an
unbelievable
best
before
11
12
2022
the
cork
near
exploded
from
the
bottle
after
the
bail
was
removed
and
the
beer
allowed
to
warm
a
few
minutes
best
of
its
class
in
my
book
miles
above
de
ranke
i
need
to
adjust
to
this
style
the
huge
champagne
head
and
pink
hue
were
beautiful
but
it
tasted
like
sour
patch
kids
without
the
sweetness
yes
i
can
see
how
one
would
enjoy
this
but
im
not
there
yet
beyond
the
overbearing
sourness
there
was
an
interesting
funk
i
really
want
to
like
it
maybe
i
can
try
some
others
and
work
up
to
it
nice
stuff
oh
and
the
best
by
date
was
in
2023
comical
well
this
should
be
the
one
for
today
opening
it
up
and
pouring
it
in
even
boosted
this
feeling
woww
what
a
carbonation
and
what
a
great
bit
pink
head
and
a
clouwdy
red
colour
smell
is
very
aggresive
there
so
to
say
giving
you
chery
sourness
and
everything
you
want
to
smell
in
a
kriek
what
a
presance
to
bad
the
taste
is
a
litle
less
without
offence
sour
fruity
and
dry
bitter
in
aftertaste
for
its
kind
but
all
in
all
one
to
try
overall
very
tart
cherry
lambic
i
need
to
try
more
of
this
style
as
my
reference
points
are
lindemans
and
rock
bottom
reddishpink
in
color
with
a
light
pink
head
it
does
leave
a
bit
of
lacing
a
nice
steady
stream
of
carbonation
flows
up
from
the
middle
a
very
pretty
beer
the
aroma
is
very
musty
with
a
wet
cardboad
smell
hints
of
sour
cherries
are
in
the
back
the
flavor
is
tart
up
front
with
the
musty
horse
blanket
characteristics
next
nice
sour
cherry
flavor
throughout
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
on
this
one
it
leaves
a
bit
of
sourness
through
each
sip
a
very
nice
brew
pretty
drinkable
i
take
back
what
i
said
about
that
in
the
hanssens
review
i
can
give
a
lambic
decent
scores
in
this
catergory
this
brew
is
quite
quenching
with
its
fairly
mellow
hardcore
funk
and
sharp
crisp
tartness
and
earthy
characteristics
pours
a
fairly
clear
ruby
body
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
is
tinged
pink
the
aroma
is
sour
and
very
cherry
with
a
slight
medicinal
character
and
something
slightly
cheesy
that
i
keep
catching
occassionally
the
flavor
is
fairly
sour
and
the
cherries
come
through
nicely
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
backing
it
up
except
for
a
slightly
metallic
sourness
the
palate
is
bigbubbled
and
sodalike
dark
pinkishred
with
a
offwhitepinkish
head
of
foam
which
is
massive
nice
smallbubbled
carbonation
streams
up
the
glass
quite
rapidly
as
well
aromas
are
of
oak
brett
and
sour
cherries
this
is
a
bit
funky
but
nowhere
near
a
girardin
black
label
or
cantillon
kriek
taste
is
good
but
quite
subdued
for
a
traditional
lambic
sour
cherries
and
acidic
notes
mix
with
some
slight
oak
tones
and
brett
characteristics
mouthfeel
is
sharp
at
first
but
dulls
and
becomes
creamier
with
the
addition
of
yeast
drinkability
remains
good
although
this
is
not
what
i
think
of
as
a
traditional
lambic
taste
i
will
not
do
this
one
justice
but
here
it
goes
sour
and
funky
that
barnyard
brett
flavor
is
front
and
center
sour
cherry
there
really
isnt
any
fruity
sweetness
here
about
the
closest
you
get
is
tart
lightly
metallic
and
earthy
mouth
seems
to
be
a
bit
thin
at
first
but
its
jsut
really
crisp
and
dry
cuts
in
and
cuts
out
leaving
your
palette
with
the
memory
and
a
sweetart
aftertaste
nice
understated
pucker
factor
in
this
brew
not
a
chugger
but
not
a
sipper
either
has
a
champagney
body
really
nice
the
best
kriek
lambic
i
have
had
so
far
this
beer
kicks
some
serious
ass
and
if
theres
a
better
kriek
out
there
im
looking
forward
to
it
the
best
by
date
is
march
12
2023
so
maybe
this
is
a
bit
young
but
i
dont
think
its
as
developed
as
i
would
have
liked
it
to
have
been
but
its
still
really
good
and
quite
impressive
as
it
stands
now
sparkling
in
the
mouth
light
and
fluffy
feel
its
hard
to
resist
drinking
something
like
this
its
very
graceful
yet
powerfully
defined
with
such
a
long
shelflife
id
love
to
see
another
bottle
15
years
from
now
i
dont
even
live
in
the
same
house
for
that
long
stopped
by
kahns
in
indianapolis
again
today
and
was
surprised
to
see
2
of
these
on
the
shelf
why
did
i
only
pick
one
up
oh
well
therell
be
some
lucky
soul
to
get
the
last
bottle
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
this
being
my
first
proper
kriek
ie
not
lindemans
merely
taking
the
cage
off
caused
the
cork
to
fly
out
hit
my
9
foot
ceiling
than
land
about
6
feet
away
that
certainly
made
a
nice
first
impression
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
an
immense
obviously
pinkish
head
that
is
very
soft
and
cloud
like
aroma
is
very
sour
with
just
a
little
hint
of
mustiness
if
you
strain
or
imagine
a
faint
note
of
cherry
is
perceivable
taste
is
intense
very
tart
definetely
causes
some
pucker
the
brett
funk
becomes
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
up
cherry
is
present
in
the
finish
great
drinkability
im
thankful
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
at
least
1
oud
beersel
product
as
this
kriek
will
surely
make
a
fan
in
mourning
of
me
pours
out
a
blood
red
color
with
a
big
head
that
has
to
settle
down
a
little
bit
before
drinking
aromas
of
cherries
hit
the
nose
first
with
some
big
tartness
follows
it
quickly
taste
was
just
down
right
terrific
sweet
and
sour
but
its
more
on
the
sour
side
geuze
like
with
a
bunch
of
cherries
added
in
to
make
this
so
smooth
finishes
very
very
dry
almost
reminded
me
of
orval
with
its
dryness
an
excellent
beer
and
this
isnt
being
brewed
anymore
ill
go
weep
in
a
corner
now
if
you
see
this
buy
it
by
the
case
best
before
of
122022
poured
a
very
dark
pinkred
colour
with
a
nice
foamy
pink
head
thick
sticky
lacing
around
the
edges
of
my
glass
the
smell
is
very
musty
reminiscent
of
an
old
damp
dank
basement
also
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
in
the
smell
as
well
a
tiny
bit
of
cherry
perhaps
some
other
fruits
way
down
in
there
but
certainly
not
overpowering
like
alot
of
other
lambics
the
taste
is
really
sourtart
and
leaves
a
bit
of
dryness
in
your
mouth
very
tasty
only
the
after
taste
has
any
fruit
taste
to
it
fairly
carbonated
but
easy
to
drink
nevertheless
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
very
nice
medium
bodied
the
cherry
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
lambic
and
really
ads
to
the
overall
flavor
i
must
confess
my
lack
of
familiarity
with
this
style
i
enjoyed
a
few
krieks
on
visits
to
belgium
and
the
netherlands
several
years
ago
enjoyed
them
but
had
no
interest
in
taking
notes
or
learning
about
the
esoterics
of
the
style
i
dont
intend
to
disparage
this
one
simply
because
im
now
more
accustomed
to
the
sweeter
krieks
in
fact
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
my
personal
preference
is
for
a
kriek
to
have
a
dominant
cherry
personality
which
this
one
lacks
still
this
one
is
nicely
complex
and
highly
drinkable
obviously
this
is
a
high
quality
lambic
just
not
your
average
kriek
if
you
ever
see
any
of
this
beer

buy
it
for
sadly
soon
it
may
just
be
a
memory
sigh
this
to
me
is
the
perfect
drinking
kriek
and
the
great
intermediate
step
between
the
sweet
poppy
nature
of
the
lindemans
products
and
the
hard
unforgiving
assertiveness
of
the
cantillon
and
boon
lambcs
this
is
a
wonderful
thing
and
may
be
my
favorite
kriek
among
the
several
ive
sampled
the
big
faint
pink
foamy
head
dies
very
fast
leaving
a
bald
clear
pinkish
red
beer
with
hallucinations
of
gold
its
hazy
on
the
last
pour
nose
is
sour
musty
farmy
with
cherries
very
cool
front
is
tangy
then
puckeringly
sour
wow
middle
is
almost
spicy
full
and
complex
fruity
and
sour
to
be
sure
finish
is
astringent
and
earthy
best
before
date
was
05042022
it
would
be
great
to
see
how
this
beer
evolves
over
the
next
18
years
but
sadly
mine
is
empty
i
wouldnt
drink
another
of
these
although
using
it
as
a
marinade
might
be
an
option
thanks
to
my
buddy
matta
for
this
one
beautiful
shining
ruby
body
wears
a
superbly
laced
pink
head
generous
and
fully
lasting
even
half
an
hour
later
sticky
and
foamy
very
impressive
core
cherries
aroma
orange
peel
light
brett
funk
great
balance
in
mouth
its
fairly
carbonated
sour
and
dry
admirative
notes
of
oak
dust
and
unusual
pineapple
this
is
lovely
balance
very
smooth
and
quaffable
for
a
lambic
but
still
full
of
the
eminently
refreshing
character
very
fine
execution
and
sadly
discontinued
the
balance
and
total
absence
of
any
artificial
feel
is
what
really
puts
this
one
apart
12
7
oz
bottle
pours
a
highly
carbonated
brilliant
red
with
a
massive
pink
head
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
tart
and
musty
like
old
hay
taste
is
the
quick
pucker
of
a
lambic
with
just
the
right
amount
of
cherry
and
some
malt
to
balance
it
out
finishes
smooth
and
dry
i
really
like
this
very
tasty
pours
a
beautiful
red
with
light
pink
head
nice
lacing
along
the
glass
tiny
bubbles
smells
of
tart
cherries
almost
like
a
dessert
interesting
aromas
very
pleasing
taste
takes
off
with
a
sharp
tartness
that
is
very
interesting
mellows
out
a
bit
and
rounds
out
with
nice
cherries
and
many
other
flavors
tastes
almost
like
a
wine
at
times
but
it
still
has
a
nice
grainybready
taste
to
it
this
is
one
intense
brew
tartness
reigns
supreme
but
the
multitude
of
other
flavors
makes
this
a
great
lambic
very
refreshing
brew
for
a
nice
hot
day
vaguely
hazy
amazingly
scarlet
in
hue
with
a
tint
of
magenta
it
has
great
color
depth
a
massive
amount
of
bubbles
raced
towards
the
largely
white
but
noticeably
pink
influenced
head
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
head
retention
it
reached
a
modest
half
finger
in
height
and
held
that
size
for
a
long
time
the
subsequent
lacing
was
lacking
as
in
none
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
visually
the
nose
screams
real
deal
lambic
there
is
a
big
all
encompassing
airiness
about
the
bouquet
that
somehow
captures
the
essence
of
belgium
it
seems
bigger
than
the
beer
itself
it
wraps
the
other
aromas
in
a
nice
little
parcel
this
package
contains
notes
of
hay
cherries
that
are
largely
tart
barnyard
funk
a
box
of
nails
wine
stray
sourness
lemon
twoweekold
wheat
bread
wood
and
a
sack
of
old
barley
the
potency
is
a
little
shy
for
me
i
worked
hard
for
the
subtle
aromas
i
am
glad
i
found
them
as
this
is
one
inviting
beer
the
palate
is
very
refined
there
is
no
bullshiting
here
it
is
straightforward
pedal
to
the
metal
tart
it
is
puckering
tart
that
is
damn
nice
and
very
refreshing
after
a
few
shocking
sips
i
could
notice
more
cherry
flavor
wood
too
hay
funk
a
bit
of
white
wine
lemon
zest
some
bready
notes
grape
skins
and
more
cherries
damn
this
is
tart
if
you
missed
the
point
ill
summarize
this
is
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
pleasant
medium
in
body
with
big
carbonation
as
wanted
i
have
no
complaints
about
the
mouthfeel
but
id
like
a
touch
more
bulk
thats
just
me
the
drinkability
is
excellent
there
is
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
and
it
jived
perfectly
with
my
tastebuds
i
found
it
amazingly
refreshing
i
know
this
would
be
killer
on
a
humid
summer
day
i
hope
the
next
time
i
visit
johns
grocery
in
iowa
city
they
will
still
have
some
more
to
purchase
that
is
where
i
bought

and
the
candy
like
sweetness
of
a
lindemanns
but
this
one
has
a
balance
that
i
just
find
more
palatable
and
consumeable
for
session
drinking
this
one
raises
a
middlefinger
to
friendly
fruity
versions
of
the
style
then
it
spits
in
lindemans
face
this
beer
poured
a
deep
red
almost
maroon
color
and
formed
a
pink
salmon
bubbly
head
that
retained
itself
only
slowly
subsiding

a
heavy
amount

an
aroma

aspects
with
a

of

a
flavor
of
cherries
with
a
vinous

in

types
the
finish
is
sour
and
astrigent
in

style
that
is
not
present
in

and

overall
impression
a
quite
high
quality
kriek

a
bit
too
sour
without

beautiful

and

quite
a
clean
flavor
served
from
a
corked
and
caged
375
ml
green
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
2022
the
smallish
cork
popped
with
little
effort
when
the
geuzekriek
was
poured
into
a
glass
chalice
an
ample
fizzy
pinkish
white
head
formed
and
gradually
settled
into
a
fine
rich
blanket
with
thicker
edges
and
fantastic
lacing
it
was
quite
effervescent
like
champagne
this
pinkruby
hued
beauty
was
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
the
complex
nose
was
beaming
with
fresh
cherries
accompanied
by
sourtinged
oak
earth
and
must
the
first
sip
was
very
puckering
in
a
lemon
juice
kind
of
way
with
the
second
sip
the
puckering
was
gone
and
in
its
place
was
a
fantastically
complex
array
of
sourtart
notes
that
danced
on
my
palate
this
delightful
celebration
of
flavor
was
infused
with
juicy
cherry
essence
and
earthy
tones
the
kriek
finished
dry
and
alive
with
longlingering
cherry
tartness
the
flavors
were
big
but
masterfully
balanced
resulting
in
an
extremely
satisfying
experience
the
carbonation
was
just
right
and
the
body
was
appropriate
the
vandervelden
family
made
a
fine
product
here
and
it
is
sad
that
they
are
no
longer
going
to
produce
fine
ales
such
as
this
again
they
dont
much
better
than
this
this
was
wonderful
the
taste
was
of
tart
cherries
and
an
excellent
tasty
yeast
bite
the
lingering
effect
of
the
tart
taste
was
very
nice
and
it
certainly
made
me
want
more
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
chock
full
of
the
various
malts
used
in
this
beer
this
is
one
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
but
must
be
done
so
with
considerable
respectthere
simply
arent
many
beers
in
the
world
like
this
one
although
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
lambicguezefaro
family
i
know
a
classic
when
i
taste
one
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
them
happy
new
year
i
believe
this
brewing
has
stopped
brewing
if
so
that
is
a
true
shame
i
will
be
buying
more
of
these
i
am
not
very
fond
of
lambicsfruit
style
beers
but
this
one
i
truly
enjoyed
drinking
and
rating
it
poured
an
average
sized
ivory
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
was
mostly
lasting
the
body
was
clear
with
very
lively
carbonation
with
a
redruby
hue
the
nose
was
that
of
cherries
with
a
sweet
cherry
sour
tart
and
tangy
flavor
it
had
a
tingly
and
dry
mouthfeel
and
was
light
bodied
this
beer
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
this
is
a
lambicfruit
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
if
given
the
opportunity
deep
dark
red
with
tons
of
bubbles
champagnelike
large
wispy
head
that
fades
to
form
a
quarter
inch
that
stays
for
the
rest
of
the
session
smell
is
sour
cherry
with
hints
of
horse
blanket
and
raw
earthy
yeast
taste
is
sweet
for
a
brief
second
and
then
overwhelmingly
sour
sour
but
dry
cherry
dominates
with
more
hints
of
gueze
dry
champagnelike
finish
cherries
are
real
and
raw
and
the
flavors
here
are
amazingly
complex
and
satisfying
an
amazing
beer
i
recommend
drinking
this
beer
at
cellar
temperature
cold
it
is
needlessly
dry
and
only
faintly
aromatic
warm
it
bursts
with
rich
aromas
of
giant
clods
of
pressed
cherry
pulp
and
baked
cheese
on
the
palate
it
has
the
noble
richness
of
aged
vinegar
and
oak
barrels
combined
with
vitamin
c
sour
cherry
and
dough
flavors
there
is
a
distant
luxardolike
cherry
pit
dimension
that
shares
bitter
almond
and
almond
paste
nuances
something
that
adds
sweetness
as
it
warms
extremely
persistent
complex
and
balanced
on
the
finish
i
would
serve
this
next
time
with
fish
in
sauce
made
from
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
beauty
it
pours
like
a
perfectly
clear
ruby
in
liquid
form
there
is
perhaps
a
hint
of
haze
but
you
really
have
to
try
to
see
it
this
bottle
was
not
highly
carbonated
the
head
is
almost
nonexistent
when
carefully
poured
into
my
glass
it
is
well
carbonated
though
because
when
i
agitated
and
swirled
the
beer
it
quickly
shows
a
nice
pink
head
there
are
notes
of
sharp
acidity
in
the
aroma
musty
old
barn
a
hint
of
cherry
there
too
this
beer
is
bone
dry
as
any
authentic
lambic
should
be
and
sharply
acidic
at
the
front
of
my
mouth
yet
it
finishes
with
a
mellow
acidity
and
a
bit
of
tannin
in
the
finish
i
also
find
a
bit
of
an
astringent
cherry
pit
flavor
perhaps
definitely
astringent
but
is
it
cherry
pit
derived
i
did
not
detect
this
astringency
in
the
gueuze
though
the
color
and
clarity
of
this
beer
is
stupendous
this
is
definitely
a
hard
lambic
it
does
not
have
much
of
the
soft
acidity
of
some
a
hint
of
cherry
at
the
front
of
this
beer
but
other
than
the
color
one
would
be
hard
pressed
to
identify
this
as
a
fruit
beer
much
less
one
made
with
cherries
citric
acid
seems
to
be
the
most
dominant
acid
flavor
and
i
do
not
detect
much
in
the
way
of
ascetic
acid
as
this
beer
warms
up
the
acidity
becomes
a
bit
softer
more
round
the
malt
seems
to
be
clamoring
for
attention
a
bit
more
this
beer
is
still
bone
dry
but
the
cherry
seems
to
express
itself
a
bit
more
in
a
cherry
fruit
sweetness
sort
of
way
incredibly
shrill
and
sour
in
the
mouth
some
support
from
the
cherry
but
this
is
really
a
one
note
beer
right
now
very
long
but
not
very
complex
i
hope
this
just
needs
time
in
the
cellar
as
its
not
up
to
the
level
of
the
gueuze
from
this
fine
brewery
the
aftertaste
is
quite
bitter
the
hop
again
not
sweet
medium
body
there
seems
to
be
an
infinite
number
of
beers
i
have
yet
to
try
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
im
going
to
miss
this
one
one
of
my
favorite
lambics
a
superb
brew
there
are
few
finer
beverages
that
have
ever
passed
my
lips
oud
beersels
kriek
packaged
in
a
caged
cork
375
ml
bottle
pours
a
brilliant
ruby
red
grapefruit
juicelike
hue
with
a
monstrous
bubbly
pink
colored
head
that
settles
into
almost
nothing
subtle
trails
of
lace
are
left
down
the
flute
glass
the
nose
features
a
musty
extremely
sour
lambic
profile
and
rightfully
so
that
will
almost
make
your
eyes
water
after
a
long
whiff
the
taste
after
one
gets
past
the
tart
sour
acidity
is
quite
nice
notes
of
sour
cherries
an
almost
chewy
graininess
and
hints
of
oak
are
evident
the
finish
is
bone
dry
this
is
a
complex
and
refined
traditional
kriek
to
be
most
certain
the
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
as
it
coats
the
palate
with
a
huge
effervescence
the
acidity
not
to
be
forgotten
cuts
right
through
the
palate
as
well
leaving
its
mark
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
a
gueuze
lambic
veteran
if
you
can
stand
the
sourness
this
is
very
refreshing
almost
like
a
fresh
squeezed
lemonade
highly
suggested
for
fans
of
traditional
lambic
red
color
cloudy

the
nose
at
first
a
superceding
melange
of
cheesy
old
hops
pungent
lactic
notes
and
sweaty
enteric
ammonification
lend
an
impression
of
savory
mild
blue

which
contrasts
and
offsets
the
initial
brightly
tart
fruit
well
sharp
acetic
tartness
a
notch
shy
of

the

at

widens
in
an
agreeably
musty
suggestions
of

a
vague
grainy
wheat
like
presence
surfaces
late
along
with
a
resurgence
of
underripe
fruit
of
a
red
grape
like
nature
only
to
be
superceded
by
an
enveloping
yet
bone
dry
dessicated
hay
impression
very
well
attenuated
superbly
crisp
and
soft
on
the
palate
finishes
expectedly
dry
yet
complex
and
oddly
lingering
with
hints
of
porous
flora
laden
oak
and
sour
sop
a
fabulously
balanced
immensely
quaffable
well
crafted
kriek
it
has
the
depth
of
character
of
a
fine
gueuze
and
although
a
kriek
cherry
wasnt
a
dominant
flavor
component
the
microbial
community
steals
the
show
best
before
march
2022
its
young
and
will
only
continue
to
improve
delicious
after
a
10
minute
reflective
period
that
also
served
as
an
acclimation
session
for
my
palate
i
was
able
to
taste
the
fruit
more
clearly
the
cherries
really
did
take
on
sort
of
a
cranberry
character
ive
never
eaten
a
sour
belgian
cherry
but
i
assume
they
dont
taste
like
bings
or
maraschinos
still
the
tartness
is
more
reminiscent
of
the
native
swamp
berry
of
the
northeastern
us
the
soft
carbonation
is
very
reminiscent
of
any
other
belgian
style
beer
dubbel
or
tripel
especially
and
the
licoricelike
flavor
that
emerged
late
reminded
me
instantly
of
orval
a
bit
of
warmth
resulted
in
very
little
dulling
of
oude
krieks
intensity
i
was
still
shaking
my
head
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
have
stashed
away
a
couple
bottles
of
this
to
see
how
it
tastes
in
a
few
or
twenty
years
drinkability
as
with
all
traditional
lambics
this
is
where
the
ratings
get
interesting
if
you
enjoy
these
styles
the
drinkability
is
topnotch
if
not
trying
one
of
these
is
a
complete
and
utter
shock
to
your
system
luckily
i
love
a
good
lambic
and
this
one
is
damn
good
the
aroma
of
this
authentic
kreik
makes
my
spine
and
teeth
tingle
with
anticipation
or
is
that
just
the
tartness
i
know
im
going
to
experience
great
lambic
aromas
of
horse
blanket
hay
and
other
barnyard
smells
its
deep
pinkmaroon
body
contrasts
the
light
pink
head
this
is
very
dry
acidic
and
tart
a
slight
cherry
flavor
is
somewhat
noticeable
but
for
me
it
was
a
little
hard
to
drink
since
there
was
barely
any
sweetness
to
balance
reminded
me
of
the
cantillon
kreik
i
sampled
at
the
brewery
very
nice
but
im
not
quite
there
yet
with
my
appreciation
for
the
tartness
of
the
authentic
lambics
had
at
the
taste
of
belgium
event
at
celtic
bayou
in
redmond
wa
nice
cherry
aroma
and
taste
backed
up
by
a
surprisingly
strong
sourness
this
is
the
kind
of
lambic
beer
i
like
some
sugary
sweetness
but
this
brew
is
mostly
all
about
the
sour
cherry
flavors
quite
good
ive
had
so
many
sweet
semilambics
lately
ie
lindemanns
that
i
was
quite
relieved
when
i
popped
the
cork
on
this
and
could
smell
the
tartness
of
the
lambic
immediately
its
been
refrigerated
upright
for
some
time
and
carefully
poured
but
the
body
is
still
quite
hazy
i
guess
the
high
level
of
carbonation
pulled
it
up
as
soon
as
the
cork
was
released
the
color
is
a
reddishorangebrown
the
head
is
magnificent
however
with
a
glowing
pink
foam
that
continually
holds
a
densely
creamy
34
head
the
aroma
is
blessedly
sour
it
even
smells
astringent
can
it
be
or
is
that
the
haystraw
suggesting
it
to
me
and
vinous
with
just
a
hint
of
the
fruitiness
below
the
body
is
thin
but
the
extremely
fine
effervescent
carbonation
which
starts
crisp
warms
to
give
it
a
creaminess
that
helps
it
to
appear
fuller
a
mouthpuckering
lactic
sourness
welcomes
you
to
this
exquisite
gem
before
warming
to
reveal
all
of
the
standard
lambic
qualities
woody
with
loads
of
oak
and
and
a
touch
of
pine
horseblanket
barn
sweat
leather
earthy
powdery
soapy
an
amazing
array
of
flavors
its
surprisingly
bonedry
with
the
cherries
lending
only
a
very
minor
thread
to
the
cloth
and
appearing
quite
vinous
even
more
like
grapes
in
the
finish
an
authentic
kriek
lambic
an
astonishingly
complex
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
mulled
over
and
enjoyed
for
a
good
part
of
the
evening
highly
recommended
to
those
who
understand
geuze
and
lambic
along
with
the
beersel
oude
gueuze
this
is
great
for
its
style
in
this
case
a
fruit
cherry
lambic
gets
it
spot
on
stinky
barnyard
nose
which
i
like
earthy
dry
acidic
sour
grassy
refreshing
and
just
the
right
amount
of
cherry
flavour
to
keep
you
interested
and
it
aint
sweet
which
is
good
world
class
krieklambic
a
must
try
notes
some
like
their
fruit
lambics
sweet
this
lambic
is
brewed
with
sugar
but
it
seems
virtually
all
of
the
sugars
were
fermented
out
leaving
it
tart
and
dry
this
is
the
way
i
like
my
lambics

brought
back
a
bottle
from
belgium
pours
a
light
cherry
brown
color
with
good
clarity
white
head
pours
vibrantly
and
leaves
some
lace
the
aroma
has
still
bright
cherry
slight
oxidized
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
faint
lambic
character
light
bodied
well
carbonated
still
vibrant
and
full
of
life
this
is
a
nice
little
treat
the
taste
is
sweet
with
cherry
winegums
the
beer
is
sweet
but
not
sticky
or
syrupy
the
beer
has
a
nonoffensive
taste
which
reminds
more
of
a
soda
the
good
thing
about
the
beer
is
the
lack
of
the
sweetener
taste
bitterness
is
low
and
drinkability
is
high
bellevue
had
a
very
wonderful
light
head
i
dare
say
this
brew
was
perfect
for
the
summer
days
i
consumed
it
on
the
perfect
amount
of
tartness
vs
sweetness
and
this
goes
for
most
fruit
based
lambic
style
beers
as
well
there
was
absolutely
no
aftertaste
or
lingering
on
the
palate
either
if
you
have
this
beverage
available
in
your
area
i
strongly
suggest
you
try
it
i
can
quite
enjoy
a
kriek
but
this
one
is
more
for
drinking
at
parties
than
for
slowly
enjoying
it
at
home
theres
a
lot
worse
kriek
out
there
but
this
still
feels
artificial
and
candylike
okay
but
there
are
better
krieks
out
there
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
thai
restaurant
in
ikebukuro
tokyo
poured
into
a
bellevue
tulip
glass
cherries
is
the
key
word
for
this
strange
carbonated
lambic
brew
the
scent
of
cherries
is
a
bit
overpowering
but
definitely
not
unpleasant
the
head
on
this
brew
was
beautiful
to
look
at
rosy
in
hue
and
leaving
a
thin
delicate
lacing
around
the
glass
bubbling
up
in
the
middle
as
a
good
belgian
beer
should
however
the
carbonation
in
this
was
a
bit
much
for
me
feeling
more
like
cream
soda
than
a
beer
the
flavor
too
while
it
was
definitely
cherry
was
a
bit
too
sour
and
not
really
resembling
a
beer
even
for
a
lambic
overall
this
is
a
tasty
cherry
drink
that
would
go
over
well
with
those
who
dont
like
the
taste
of
standard
brews
however
when
it
comes
to
fruit
beers
and
lambics
i
know
other
brands
i
will
choose
again
over
this
tasty
though
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
i
would
like
it
a
bit
more
sweet
as
a
fruity
beer
but
not
that
bad
after
all
overallan
attractive
beer
which
i
think
has
a
very
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
which
gives
this
beer
high
drinkability
not
a
lot
of
complexity
present
but
definitely
has
some
wild
yeast
funk
an
acceptable
sweetened
kriek
but
its
nothing
special
the
crack
glug
produced
two
big
rocky
fingers
of
cotton
candypink
head
with
good
retention
the
room
filled
with
the
smell
of
sweet
cherries
color
was
a
very
pretty
ruby
red
with
nequality
clarity
leaning
in
the
cherry
smell
was
definitely
of
sweet
cherries
as
opposed
to
sour
ones
which
go
into
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
mouthfeel
was
big
and
full
with
a
dryness
borne
less
of
the
cherries
than
of
the
beers
maturation
in
oak
barrels
along
with
the
wild
yeast
it
was
not
too
sweet
but
it
was
not
as
sour
or
funky
as
many
other
krieks
that
i
have
had
one
reviewer
characterized
it
as
a
chicks
beer

no
acidity
in
the
body
and
very
sweet
this
is
a
nice
representation
but
overall
the
flavor
was
too
simple
there
are
no
strong
characteristics
about
this
cherry
coke
is
cheaper
and
gives
almost
the
same
buzz

moderate
carbonation
and
more

very
refreshing
with

but
not
a

happy
to
find
this
beer
here
and
would
have
it
again
if
nothing
else
is

woody
